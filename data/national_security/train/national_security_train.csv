At a press conference in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , Mr. Trump acknowledged the gap between himself and National Security Adviser John R. Bolton , who said last weekend for the first time the administration had “ no doubt ” that Pyongyang ’ s short-range missile tests in early May violated U.N. Security Council resolutions .
“ My people think it could have been a violation . I view it differently , ” Mr. Trump said . “ I view it as a man . Perhaps he wants to get attention , and perhaps not . Who knows ? It doesn ’ t matter . ”
When a reporter asked whether Mr. Trump was “ bothered at all ” by the small missile tests , the president said , “ No , I ’ m not . I am personally not . ”
Asked whether he has confidence in Mr. Bolton , the president said , “ Yes , I do . ”
North Korea ’ s foreign ministry said Monday that Mr. Bolton is “ inordinately ignorant ” to argue the recent missile tests violated U.N. resolutions , calling the launches on May 4 and May 9 “ normal military exercises . ”

Pyongyang ’ s missile tests were the first since 2017 , after Mr. Trump threatened “ fire and fury ” if Mr. Kim didn ’ t halt his nuclear weapons tests . The threats and crushing economic sanctions brought Mr. Kim to the bargaining table in summer 2018 , although he has yet to agree to give up his weapons programs in return for promised sanctions relief .
Mr. Abe , who shares Mr. Bolton ’ s concerns about the missile launches , differed with the president in what was otherwise a cozy weekend of diplomacy , trade talks and pageantry .
“ North Korea launched a short-range ballistic missile , ” Mr. Abe said . “ This is violating the Security Council resolution . So my reaction is , as I said earlier on , it is of great regret . ”
But he also pointed to Mr. Trump ’ s historic outreach to North Korea as a sea change .
“ He cracked open the shell of distrust , ” Mr. Abe said twice . “ This was a new approach , which I welcome . ”
The prime minister said he and Mr. Trump “ spent a good amount of time in better aligning our policies ” on North Korea .
“ The positions of Japan and the United States in this regard are completely on the same page , ” he said .
Late on Memorial Day , early Tuesday in Japan , the president addressed American sailors aboard the U.S.S . Wasp , an amphibious assault ship . He also visited a Japanese helicopter carrier with Mr. Abe at Yokosuka Naval Base , which the U.S. shares with Japan .
Referring to a mass stabbing incident earlier in the day in Tokyo in which 16 people were injured , Mr. Trump said , “ All Americans stand with the people of Japan and the victims and grieve with their families . ”
North Korea ’ s increasing belligerence since a failed second denuclearization summit with Mr. Trump in Vietnam in late February is raising concern in Congress , including among some Republican lawmakers .
“ I find [ the missile tests ] very disturbing , and certainly wouldn ’ t trust Kim Jong-un , ” Sen. Joni Ernst , Iowa Republican and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said Sunday on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union. ” “ I think we need to keep our eyes on North Korea . I understand the president wants to maintain a relationship with North Korea so that we can work with them . However , those strikes are disturbing . ”
The president said Monday he is in “ no rush ” for a denuclearization deal with Pyongyang , because sanctions are in place and American hostages have been returned by North Korea .
Mr. Trump also said Pyongyang ’ s nuclear weapons tests and missile launches “ seems to have stopped , only time will tell . ”
“ Let ’ s see if something constructive can be done , ” he said . “ If you look back at the last two years , it ’ s been a big difference . No rocket testing , no nuclear testing . I personally think that lots of good things will come with North Korea , I feel that . I may be right , I may be wrong — but I feel that . There ’ s a good respect built , maybe a great respect built between the United States and North Korea . ”
The topic of North Korea was at the forefront during the three-day visit by the president and first lady Melania Trump to Japan to mark the ascension of the new emperor , Naruhito .
The Trumps exchanged gifts with the emperor and Empress Masako on their “ state call , ” the first by any world leader to the new emperor .
Mr. Trump presented the emperor with an American-made 1938 viola in a custom case and a signed photo of American composer Aaron Copland .

Mr. Trump , Mr. Abe and their wives also met with Japanese families of those abducted by North Korea decades ago . Many held photos of their relatives .
It was Mr. Trump ’ s second meeting about the families , and he said the issue is “ very much on my mind. ” Mr. Abe thanked the president for raising the issue with Mr. Kim at his second denuclearization summit in Vietnam , a meeting that ended abruptly without any deal .

Petraeus praised McMaster’s appointment without qualification.

“HR McMaster is a brilliant officer – a battlefield hero and a true soldier-scholar who will serve President Trump and the country exceedingly well,” Petraeus told the Guardian.

McMaster is expected to select his own NSC staffers. But one of McMaster’s friends, Petraeus’ former executive officer Pete Mansoor, said that as a serving military officer, McMaster was not in a position to attach many preconditions to his service.

US President Donald Trump has accused his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron of being ""nasty"" for saying Nato was ""brain dead"".

Mr Trump is in London for a summit marking the Western military alliance's 70th anniversary.

The US president said Nato served a great purpose, and Mr Macron's remarks had been ""very insulting"".

Why is there a row over Nato?

Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - was founded after World War Two to counter the threat of Soviet expansion. The 29 member states pledge to come to the aid of one another should any come under attack.

But speaking last month, Mr Macron complained that Nato members were no longer co-operating on key issues.

He described the alliance as ""brain dead"", stressing what he saw as a waning commitment from its biggest guarantor - the US. He also criticised the US for not consulting Nato before pulling forces out of northern Syria.

The summit, due to get under way later on Tuesday, has already been overshadowed by a bitter row between member states France and Turkey, and a continuing debate over money.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he will oppose Nato's plan for the defence of the Baltic region if it does not back Turkey over its fight against Kurdish groups it considers terrorists.

Why is Turkey an issue?

Mr Erdogan joined the dispute by suggesting that Mr Macron was the one who was ""brain dead"", and accusing him of having ""a sick and shallow understanding"" of terrorism.

Last month, Mr Macron angered Turkey by hosting an official from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), key allies of the US-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria.

Turkey views a section of the group - the YPG - as terrorists.

Mr Macron and Mr Erdogan will come face to face in Downing Street on Tuesday in a four-way meeting also including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

A major problem for Nato

Turkey is posing a major and developing problem for Nato, a problem that if not resolved could test the very boundaries of its membership.

It is effectively holding hostage a response plan for the rapid reinforcement of the Baltic region - which must be approved by all 29 Nato members - until it gets what it wants in its own region.

Turkey wants all other Nato countries to regard Kurdish separatist groups in Turkey as terrorists. This would effectively take Nato into domestic security matters, which most allies see as none of their business.

Add to this Turkey's unilateral actions in Syria; President Erdogan's recent row with Emmanuel Macron over the Kurds; and Turkey's purchase of a sophisticated Russian air defence system - an extraordinary step for a key Nato player - and you are well on the way to a full-blown crisis between Ankara and the alliance.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings on core aspects of his Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces intensifying pressure to produce more indictments or shut down his investigation , according to two U.S. officials .
Specifically , Mueller is close to rendering judgment on two of the most explosive aspects of his inquiry : whether there were clear incidents of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump ’ s 2016 campaign , and whether the president took any actions that constitute obstruction of justice , according to one of the officials , who asked not to be identified speaking about the investigation .
That doesn ’ t necessarily mean Mueller ’ s findings would be made public if he doesn ’ t secure unsealed indictments . The regulations governing Mueller ’ s probe stipulate that he can present his findings only to his boss , who is currently Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein . The regulations give a special counsel ’ s supervisor some discretion in deciding what is relayed to Congress and what is publicly released .
The question of timing is critical . Mueller ’ s work won ’ t be concluded ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections , when Democrats hope to take control of the House and end Trump ’ s one-party hold on Washington .
But this timeline also raises questions about the future of the probe itself . Trump has signaled he may replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the election , a move that could bring in a new boss for Mueller . Rosenstein also might resign or be fired by Trump after the election .
Rosenstein has made it clear that he wants Mueller to wrap up the investigation as expeditiously as possible , another U.S. official said . The officials gave no indications about the details of Mueller ’ s conclusions . Mueller ’ s office declined to comment for this story .
With three weeks to go before the midterm elections , it ’ s unlikely Mueller will take any overt action that could be turned into a campaign issue . Justice Department guidelines say prosecutors should avoid any major steps close to an election that could be seen as influencing the outcome .
Mueller is expected to make known the probe ’ s findings soon after the midterms . ███ ’ s Jodi Schneider reports . Source : ███
That suggests the days and weeks immediately after the Nov. 6 election may be the most pivotal time since Mueller took over the Russia investigation almost a year and a half ago . So far , Mueller has secured more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas .
Read More : Ex-Trump Fixer Cohen Said to Have Lengthy Talks With Mueller
Trump ’ s frustration with the probe , which he routinely derides as a “ witch hunt , ” has been growing , prompting concerns in Congress he may try to shut down or curtail Mueller ’ s work at some point .
There ’ s no indication , though , that Mueller is ready to close up shop , even if he does make some findings , according to former federal prosecutors . Several matters could keep the probe going , such as another significant prosecution or new lines of inquiry . And because Mueller ’ s investigation has been proceeding quietly , out of the public eye , it ’ s possible there have been other major developments behind the scenes .
Mueller only recently submitted written questions to Trump ’ s lawyers regarding potential collusion with Russia , and his team hasn ’ t yet ruled out seeking an interview with the president , according to one of the U.S. officials . If Trump refused an interview request , Mueller could face the complicated question of whether to seek a grand jury subpoena of the president . The Justice Department has a standing policy that a sitting president can ’ t be indicted .
At the same time , Mueller is tying down some loose ends . Four of his 17 prosecutors have left the special counsel ’ s office in recent months . Three are going back to their previous Justice Department jobs , and the fourth has become a research fellow at Columbia Law School .
After several postponements , Mueller ’ s team has agreed to a sentencing date for Michael Flynn , Trump ’ s former national security adviser , who pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements last year . The Dec. 18 date comes more than a year after Mueller secured a cooperation deal with Flynn , suggesting that Mueller ’ s team has all it needs from him .
Trump ’ s former campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , struck his own cooperation agreement with Mueller last month , after being convicted at trial in Virginia on eight counts of bank fraud , filing false tax returns and failure to file a foreign bank account . The plea agreement let him avoid a second trial in Washington . The judge in the Virginia trial , who wasn ’ t part of the plea agreement , has scheduled a sentencing hearing Friday , which could complicate Manafort ’ s cooperation agreement with Mueller .
Mueller ’ s prosecutors also have met with Michael Cohen , Trump ’ s former personal lawyer . Cohen pleaded guilty in New York in August to tax evasion , bank fraud and violations of campaign finance laws . That separate investigation , headed by the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office in Manhattan , is one of several New York probes involving the Trump Organization , and could ultimately prove to be more damaging to the president than Mueller ’ s work .
Former federal prosecutors said in recent interviews that Manafort ’ s plea deal probably advanced Mueller ’ s timeline for determining whether there was collusion .
Manafort could be assisting Mueller ’ s team on questions related to whether the Trump campaign changed the Republican party ’ s stance on Ukraine as part of an understanding with the Russian government , and whether the Russians helped coordinate the release of hacked emails related to Democrat Hillary Clinton with members of Trump ’ s campaign , said another former prosecutor who asked not to be named .
Manafort is also key to understanding a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and a group of Russians who had promised damaging information concerning Clinton , the former official said .
Manafort appears to have good material to offer , said Samuel Buell , a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Duke University School of Law . “ He ’ s not going to get that deal unless he can help Mueller make a case against one or more people , ” Buell said . Cooperators can ’ t expect leniency unless they provide `` substantial assistance in the prosecution of others , '' Buell added , citing sentencing guidelines .
Although the days and weeks after the election might test Mueller in new ways , he has confronted pressure before to shut down .
Trump ’ s lawyers have attempted to publicly pressure Mueller into wrapping up his investigation , setting artificial deadlines since the early days of the probe when they predicted it would wrap by the end of 2017 . In August 2017 , then-White House lawyer Ty Cobb said he would be “ embarrassed ” if the investigation dragged on past Thanksgiving .
Even if Mueller ’ s probe stretched through 2019 , the timeline wouldn ’ t be unprecedented . Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr spent four years investigating President Bill Clinton before releasing his report on the Monica Lewinsky affair , which spun out of a probe into an Arkansas land deal known as Whitewater .
It took almost two years for Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald to indict Scooter Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney ’ s chief of staff , for lying to investigators and obstruction of justice in October 2005 in the investigation into the public outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame .","LISTEN TO ARTICLE 6:37 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

Specifically, Mueller is close to rendering judgment on two of the most explosive aspects of his inquiry: whether there were clear incidents of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, and whether the president took any actions that constitute obstruction of justice, according to one of the officials, who asked not to be identified speaking about the investigation.

That doesn’t necessarily mean Mueller’s findings would be made public if he doesn’t secure unsealed indictments. The regulations governing Mueller’s probe stipulate that he can present his findings only to his boss, who is currently Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The regulations give a special counsel’s supervisor some discretion in deciding what is relayed to Congress and what is publicly released.

The question of timing is critical. Mueller’s work won’t be concluded ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections, when Democrats hope to take control of the House and end Trump’s one-party hold on Washington.

But this timeline also raises questions about the future of the probe itself. Trump has signaled he may replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the election, a move that could bring in a new boss for Mueller. Rosenstein also might resign or be fired by Trump after the election.

Rosenstein has made it clear that he wants Mueller to wrap up the investigation as expeditiously as possible, another U.S. official said. The officials gave no indications about the details of Mueller’s conclusions. Mueller’s office declined to comment for this story.

Pre-Election Lull

With three weeks to go before the midterm elections, it’s unlikely Mueller will take any overt action that could be turned into a campaign issue. Justice Department guidelines say prosecutors should avoid any major steps close to an election that could be seen as influencing the outcome.

That suggests the days and weeks immediately after the Nov. 6 election may be the most pivotal time since Mueller took over the Russia investigation almost a year and a half ago. So far, Mueller has secured more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas.

Trump’s frustration with the probe, which he routinely derides as a “witch hunt,” has been growing, prompting concerns in Congress he may try to shut down or curtail Mueller’s work at some point.

There’s no indication, though, that Mueller is ready to close up shop, even if he does make some findings, according to former federal prosecutors. Several matters could keep the probe going, such as another significant prosecution or new lines of inquiry. And because Mueller’s investigation has been proceeding quietly, out of the public eye, it’s possible there have been other major developments behind the scenes.

Mueller only recently submitted written questions to Trump’s lawyers regarding potential collusion with Russia, and his team hasn’t yet ruled out seeking an interview with the president, according to one of the U.S. officials. If Trump refused an interview request, Mueller could face the complicated question of whether to seek a grand jury subpoena of the president. The Justice Department has a standing policy that a sitting president can’t be indicted.

At the same time, Mueller is tying down some loose ends. Four of his 17 prosecutors have left the special counsel’s office in recent months. Three are going back to their previous Justice Department jobs, and the fourth has become a research fellow at Columbia Law School.

After several postponements, Mueller’s team has agreed to a sentencing date for Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements last year. The Dec. 18 date comes more than a year after Mueller secured a cooperation deal with Flynn, suggesting that Mueller’s team has all it needs from him.

Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, struck his own cooperation agreement with Mueller last month, after being convicted at trial in Virginia on eight counts of bank fraud, filing false tax returns and failure to file a foreign bank account. The plea agreement let him avoid a second trial in Washington. The judge in the Virginia trial, who wasn’t part of the plea agreement, has scheduled a sentencing hearing Friday, which could complicate Manafort’s cooperation agreement with Mueller.

Mueller’s prosecutors also have met with Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer. Cohen pleaded guilty in New York in August to tax evasion, bank fraud and violations of campaign finance laws. That separate investigation, headed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, is one of several New York probes involving the Trump Organization, and could ultimately prove to be more damaging to the president than Mueller’s work.

Manafort’s Plea

Former federal prosecutors said in recent interviews that Manafort’s plea deal probably advanced Mueller’s timeline for determining whether there was collusion.

Manafort could be assisting Mueller’s team on questions related to whether the Trump campaign changed the Republican party’s stance on Ukraine as part of an understanding with the Russian government, and whether the Russians helped coordinate the release of hacked emails related to Democrat Hillary Clinton with members of Trump’s campaign, said another former prosecutor who asked not to be named.

Manafort is also key to understanding a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and a group of Russians who had promised damaging information concerning Clinton, the former official said.

Manafort appears to have good material to offer, said Samuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Duke University School of Law. “He’s not going to get that deal unless he can help Mueller make a case against one or more people,” Buell said. Cooperators can’t expect leniency unless they provide ""substantial assistance in the prosecution of others,"" Buell added, citing sentencing guidelines.

Although the days and weeks after the election might test Mueller in new ways, he has confronted pressure before to shut down.

Done by Thanksgiving

Trump’s lawyers have attempted to publicly pressure Mueller into wrapping up his investigation, setting artificial deadlines since the early days of the probe when they predicted it would wrap by the end of 2017. In August 2017, then-White House lawyer Ty Cobb said he would be “embarrassed”if the investigation dragged on past Thanksgiving.

Even if Mueller’s probe stretched through 2019, the timeline wouldn’t be unprecedented. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr spent four years investigating President Bill Clinton before releasing his report on the Monica Lewinsky affair, which spun out of a probe into an Arkansas land deal known as Whitewater.

The connection is convoluted, dealing with an internal Ukrainian political dispute from more than a decade ago — but it nonetheless says some interesting things about the state of the Russia investigation right now.

Here’s what the indictment says, and why it tells us something important about Mueller’s strategy.

What the indictment literally says

In the early 2010s, van der Zwaan was working in the London office of Skadden Arps, one of the world’s largest and most powerful corporate law firms. His work seemed to focus on the former Soviet Union.

During this same time period, Manafort and Gates were working for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych — a Kremlin-backed leader with dubious democratic credentials.

national_security,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/no-trump-cant-build-a-wall-through-military-eminent-domain/,"OPINION: No, Trump Can’t Use an Emergency Declaration To Build a Wall",2019-01-08,"David French, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","President Donald Trump speaks at the White House in Washington , D.C. , January 2 , 2019 . ( Jim Young/REUTERS )
Let me begin by stating my policy preference up front . I strongly believe that our nation should bolster its border security , including by building a more effective and longer border wall . A better border barrier would represent a far more humane way of deterring desperate individuals and families from making the extraordinarily dangerous trek to the United States , would properly channel asylum seekers to ports of entry , and would ease the need for border detention facilities .
If you believe a nation can and should control who enters its borders , then border barriers are one part of a solution to the problem of illegal entry . But the wall is a symbol now . Democrats will not consent to constructing the founding promise of Trumpism , and Trump ( for now , at least ) won ’ t abandon his signature proposal .
So he ’ s floating the possibility of declaring a state of emergency , using a “ military version ” of eminent domain to seize private land along the border , and building the wall without congressional consent . This would be a serious mistake — a lawless abuse of power that would almost certainly be blocked by the courts ( including by Trump-appointed judges ) . In the remote chance it passed legal review , his declaration would have malignant effects on the American constitutional structure . He would enable future presidents to wield vast powers at a whim , shaking the president loose from his constitutional bonds once and for all .
The legal analysis here is relatively simple . The president does not have the constitutional or statutory authority to unilaterally declare an emergency under these facts , seize private land , and spend money to build a wall . The constitutional question was settled during the Korean War . At the height of the conflict — when the United States was locked in a grueling land conflict with hundreds of thousands of Chinese and North Korean troops — President Truman attempted to “ take possession of and operate most of the nation ’ s steel mills ” to avoid a strike by the United Steelworkers of America .
The necessity of steel to modern military operations is too obvious to require explanation , but the Supreme Court still blocked the president ’ s takeover . Justice Black , writing for the majority , declared that the president ’ s authority to act must derive from an “ act of Congress or from the Constitution itself. ” Since there was no specific enabling statute , Truman attempted to rely on inherent executive powers and his authority as commander-in-chief . The Court rejected his arguments :
The order can not properly be sustained as an exercise of the President ’ s military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces . . . Even though “ theater of war ” be an expanding concept , we can not with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate power as such to take possession of private property in order to keep labor disputes from stopping production . This is a job for the Nation ’ s lawmakers , not for its military authorities . Nor can the seizure order be sustained because of the several constitutional provisions that grant executive power to the President . In the framework of our Constitution , the President ’ s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker . The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad . And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute .
With the president ’ s authority constitutionally constrained in a time of actual war , President Trump won ’ t have greater power when the “ foe ” isn ’ t the Chinese Army but instead a caravan of poor , unarmed Hondurans .
So , if the Constitution doesn ’ t empower Trump to build the wall unilaterally , has an act of Congress granted him the power ? No . Not under any fair reading of the relevant statutes .
It is true that the president has broad authority under the National Emergencies Act to declare various states of emergency . Most Americans don ’ t realize this , but America is awash in a series of declared emergencies . In a December 2017 article for Lawfare , Catherine Padhi explained that we are currently in 28 separate federal states of emergency . Indeed , America has been under some form of “ emergency ” footing for 39 continuous years .
CNN has a comprehensive list of these “ emergencies. ” When you peruse it , you ’ ll see that many of these “ emergencies ” have little relevance to most Americans ’ lives . For example , we ’ re in a state of emergency to “ Block Property of Certain Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Belarus ” and to “ Block Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ” Others are far more consequential , like the September 14 , 2001 , “ Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks . ”
The reason the public largely doesn ’ t track these emergency declarations is that they don ’ t make the president an autocrat . Instead , they unlock powers that are themselves limited by statute . And , in this case , the two relevant statutes for the border wall are simply not broad enough to encompass Trump ’ s dream of “ military ” eminent domain .
The first statute is 10 U.S.C . Section 2808 . Its language is relatively restrictive :
In the event of a declaration of war or the declaration by the President of a national emergency in accordance with the National Emergencies Act ( 50 U.S.C . 1601 et seq . ) that requires use of the armed forces , the Secretary of Defense , without regard to any other provision of law , may undertake military construction projects , and may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects , not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces . Such projects may be undertaken only within the total amount of funds that have been appropriated for military construction , including funds appropriated for family housing , that have not been obligated . [ Emphasis added . ]
Note the key limitations . The president would have to show that the “ emergency ” requires the use of the military — a difficult task in a time of peace when the relevant border is with a national ally . It ’ s a task rendered even more difficult by the fact that border security is a function of the civilian Department of Homeland Security , not the Department of Defense .
Even then , the language indicates the funds can be used only to support the “ use ” of the armed forces . This strongly implies that the funding would be reserved for projects that benefit the military . That conclusion is buttressed by the next section , which relates to a different category of project — those projects that are actually essential to national defense . 33 U.S.C Section 2293 states :
In the event of a declaration of war or a declaration by the President of a national emergency in accordance with the National Emergencies Act [ 50 U.S.C . 1601 et seq . ] that requires or may require use of the Armed Forces , the Secretary , without regard to any other provision of law , may ( 1 ) terminate or defer the construction , operation , maintenance , or repair of any Department of the Army civil works project that he deems not essential to the national defense , and ( 2 ) apply the resources of the Department of the Army ’ s civil works program , including funds , personnel , and equipment , to construct or assist in the construction , operation , maintenance , and repair of authorized civil works , military construction , and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense . [ Emphasis added . ]
Once again , I ’ ve highlighted the relevant provisions . Section 2293 grants the president greater discretion in one clause , then limits that discretion in another . While the emergency only “ may require ” use of the military , the project must be both “ authorized ” and “ essential ” to “ national defense. ” The language plainly contemplates shifting of funds from one or more projects to other projects already authorized .
A new or expanded border barrier has not been authorized by any lawful process .
Moreover , there is no credible showing that expanded border barriers are essential to our national defense . The administration has been trying to emphasize the alleged national-security threat on the southern border , but as it describes the threat of terrorist entry , it ’ s inadvertently highlighting that suspected terrorists make use of other entry points than the southern border — namely , airports . In 2017 , Trump ’ s State Department said that it had “ no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States . ”
In September 2018 , the State Department revised its statement to read : “ At year ’ s end there was no credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico , worked with Mexican drug cartels , or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States . The U.S. southern border remains vulnerable to potential terrorist transit , although terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the United States . ”
We should be vigilant about controlling access to our country . I believe that more border barriers are an important aspect of border security . But words mean things , and the idea that a border wall is so “ essential to the national defense ” that it “ may require the use of the Armed Forces ” to deal with a national emergency is to stretch the plain meaning of the statute past the breaking point .
Critically , we can not forget that in a time of peace , border security is a civilian function , and the penalties for unlawful crossing are matters for civilian law enforcement . Illegal entry is only a misdemeanor under federal law , and there are profound legal limits on the use of the armed forces in a law-enforcement capacity . In the New York Times , Yale professor Bruce Ackerman claims that if members of the military built the wall , they would commit a federal crime .
I don ’ t think Ackerman is right . The statute renders criminal the “ use ” of the armed forces to “ execute the laws. ” The legal liability ( if any ) would likely attach to the commander-in-chief . And it is less likely that the so-called posse comitatus statute would be used to enforce actual criminal liability than it is that the statute would help inform the courts as they interpret the statutory scheme applicable to use of the Armed Forces . In other words , ambiguity on domestic military use in peacetime and in the absence of extraordinary armed confrontations may well be resolved against the president .
Make no mistake : If President Trump attempts to defy the Constitution and federal statutes to use the military to seize land and build a wall without proper congressional appropriation , he ’ ll commit a grave abuse of power . Fortunately , our system of checks and balances will likely intervene to stop his lawless project before it starts , but it is still the president ’ s principle job to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution — not to expand the power of an increasingly imperial presidency . The wall needs to be built through the proper constitutional process or not at all .","President Donald Trump speaks at the White House in Washington, D.C., January 2, 2019. (Jim Young/REUTERS)

His emergency powers aren’t broad enough to bypass Congress.

Let me begin by stating my policy preference up front. I strongly believe that our nation should bolster its border security, including by building a more effective and longer border wall. A better border barrier would represent a far more humane way of deterring desperate individuals and families from making the extraordinarily dangerous trek to the United States, would properly channel asylum seekers to ports of entry, and would ease the need for border detention facilities.

If you believe a nation can and should control who enters its borders, then border barriers are one part of a solution to the problem of illegal entry. But the wall is a symbol now. Democrats will not consent to constructing the founding promise of Trumpism, and Trump (for now, at least) won’t abandon his signature proposal.

So he’s floating the possibility of declaring a state of emergency, using a “military version” of eminent domain to seize private land along the border, and building the wall without congressional consent. This would be a serious mistake — a lawless abuse of power that would almost certainly be blocked by the courts (including by Trump-appointed judges). In the remote chance it passed legal review, his declaration would have malignant effects on the American constitutional structure. He would enable future presidents to wield vast powers at a whim, shaking the president loose from his constitutional bonds once and for all.

The legal analysis here is relatively simple. The president does not have the constitutional or statutory authority to unilaterally declare an emergency under these facts, seize private land, and spend money to build a wall. The constitutional question was settled during the Korean War. At the height of the conflict — when the United States was locked in a grueling land conflict with hundreds of thousands of Chinese and North Korean troops — President Truman attempted to “take possession of and operate most of the nation’s steel mills” to avoid a strike by the United Steelworkers of America.

The necessity of steel to modern military operations is too obvious to require explanation, but the Supreme Court still blocked the president’s takeover. Justice Black, writing for the majority, declared that the president’s authority to act must derive from an “act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.” Since there was no specific enabling statute, Truman attempted to rely on inherent executive powers and his authority as commander-in-chief. The Court rejected his arguments:

The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President’s military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces . . . Even though “theater of war” be an expanding concept, we cannot with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate power as such to take possession of private property in order to keep labor disputes from stopping production. This is a job for the Nation’s lawmakers, not for its military authorities. Nor can the seizure order be sustained because of the several constitutional provisions that grant executive power to the President. In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute.

With the president’s authority constitutionally constrained in a time of actual war, President Trump won’t have greater power when the “foe” isn’t the Chinese Army but instead a caravan of poor, unarmed Hondurans.

national_security,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/5/barack-obamas-team-worked-against-donald-trump/,Team Obama attempted ‘stealth coup’ by undermining Trump,2017-12-05,Rowan Scarborough,"From the moment Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination and then the presidency , national security officials under President Obama have shown themselves to be intense adversaries in public and behind the scenes .
In the latest development , special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s top-gun prosecutor , Andrew Weissmann , praised acting Attorney General Sally Yates , a Trump nemesis , for refusing a White House order to defend the president ’ s travel ban on Muslim-majority countries , according to internal emails .
Mr. Weissmann made it clear whose side he was on .
“ I am so proud , ” Mr. Weissmann wrote to Ms. Yates when he was the head of the Obama Justice Department ’ s criminal fraud division . “ And in awe . Thank you so much . All my deepest respect . ”
The U.S. Supreme Court this week approved Mr. Trump ’ s travel ban of targeted nations in a 7-2 ruling .
Mr. Weissmann , who as a private lawyer donated to Mr. Obama and to New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , another Democrat , now is Mr. Mueller ’ s right-hand man . He oversaw the investigation of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , including a pre-dawn FBI raid on his condo and an in-bed frisking of his wife .
The Weissmann emails and others from Obama political appointees praising Ms. Yates were unearthed in a Freedom of Information Act request by the conservative government watchdog Judicial Watch .
Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates as she became a hero to Mr. Weissmann and other liberals .
The anti-Trump moves by Obama aides began in July 2016 during his campaign for the presidency .
Then-FBI Director James B. Comey began a criminal investigation of the Trump campaign , in whole or part , based on a dossier financed by the Democratic Party with an aim to destroy the Republican candidate . Its salacious and sometimes far-fetched scenarios of Russia-Trump collusion on the Russian hack of Democratic Party computers have not been confirmed publicly .
The top FBI investigator at that time was a “ never Trump ” advocate whom Mr. Mueller removed from his team last summer , The New York Times reported .
John O. Brennan , Mr. Obama ’ s CIA director and former campaign adviser , pushed the investigation during the campaign . He supplied Mr. Comey with the names of Russians with whom Trump associates had made any type of contact . Mr. Brennan testified to Congress that he provided the list of referrals without knowing what was discussed .
James R. Clapper , Mr. Obama ’ s director of national intelligence , has suggested that Mr. Trump is on the way out and calls him unfit for office .
“ I really question his … fitness to be in this office , ” Mr. Clapper told CNN after a fiery Trump speech in August . “ And I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it . Maybe he is looking for a way out . ”
Conservatives suspect all this has happened as Obama administration holdovers and former aides were working to sabotage the Trump administration .
Some news stories attributed to “ former ” government officials — read , Obama — have fallen into the “ fake news ” category . Journalists and Democrats are determined to show that Trump aides and Moscow collaborated .
A major New York Times story on Feb. 14 based in part on “ former American officials ” did much to fuel this narrative .
“ Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump ’ s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election , according to four current and former American officials , ” The Times story read .
Almost the entire story was wrong , according to Mr. Comey ’ s testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence four months later . In other words , there were no such “ repeated contacts ” with Russian intelligence .
Mr. Comey testified that he was so taken aback by the story that he immediately notified senior members of Congress that it was not true .
Another story that seemed to rise up from Obama holdovers was the narrative that Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May because the FBI director had asked for more resources for a Russia-Trump investigation . Several senior Justice Department officials said no such request was made . Mr. Comey has not made that charge .
“ Having experienced a change in administration while at the Pentagon in 2009 , it ’ s not uncommon to see passive-aggressive behavior from a handful of outgoing folks , ” said J.D . Gordon , a former Defense Department spokesman and Trump campaign national security adviser . “ That said , based on the flood of leaks across the government , what we ’ re seeing today more closely resembles a stealth coup . Certainly nothing passive about it . ”
Mr. Brennan has not shied away from depicting Mr. Trump as an awful president or disclosing his own role in driving the FBI to investigate Mr. Trump during the campaign .
“ I wanted to make sure that every information and bit of intelligence that we had was shared with the [ FBI ] so that they could take it , ” Mr. Brennan told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in May . “ It was well beyond my mandate as director of CIA to follow on any of those leads that involved U.S. persons . But I made sure that anything that was involving U.S. persons , including anything involving the individuals involved in the Trump campaign , was shared with the bureau .
“ I was aware of intelligence and information about contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons that raised concerns in my mind about whether or not those individuals were cooperating with the Russians , either in a witting or unwitting fashion , and it served as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion [ or ] cooperation occurred , ” the former CIA chief testified .
During the presidential transition , Rep. Peter T. King , New York Republican , became suspicious of Mr. Brennan ’ s behind-the-scenes maneuvers . He said on ABC News : “ There should be an investigation of what the Russians did but also an investigation of John Brennan and the hit job he seems to be orchestrating against the president-elect . ”
To date , there has been no public confirmation of Trump-Russia election collusion charges .
Any doubts that Mr. Obama ’ s CIA actively opposed Mr. Trump were perhaps dispelled by former acting Director Michael Morell . He endorsed Hillary Clinton in stark language in response to Mr. Trump ’ s comments as a candidate applauding Russian President Vladimir Putin .
“ In the intelligence business , we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation , ” Mr. Morell said .
Indeed , many Republicans expressed dismay at Mr. Trump ’ s praise of Mr. Putin , who has invaded eastern Ukraine , annexed the Crimean Peninsula and viewed NATO as an existential threat as he tries to destabilize Western democracies .
They also cringe at the president ’ s habitual Twitter feeds that often veer from policy and toward personal disputes with people in the media , Hollywood and sports .
Still , the machinations of Mr. Obama ’ s national security team seem to be unprecedented against a candidate , president-elect and president .
The FBI used the discredited dossier at least once to obtain a warrant to bug former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page . Mr . Page said the collusion and bribery charges made by dossier writer Christopher Steele , a former British spy , are fiction . They ruined his investment business , he told the House intelligence committee .
“ After over a year of false rhetoric and propaganda , it ’ s now refreshing that the real truth about what actually happened last year is starting to come to light , ” Mr . Page told The ███ .
Other assaults on Mr. Trump : Mr. Comey elevated the dossier ’ s importance by briefing the president-elect at Trump Tower in New York City . Shortly thereafter , the briefing was leaked to CNN .
Mr. Comey wrote contemporaneous memos about his meetings with Mr. Trump and then leaked them to The New York Times via a middleman .
Then there is “ unmasking , ” the procedure in which senior national security figures may ask the intelligence community to disclose the names of Americans caught up in the eavesdropping of foreign agents .
Obama national security aides requested the unmasking of an undetermined number of Trump associates during the campaign , suggesting to Republicans that they were spying .
Obama people also have floated the talking point that the Trump campaign team violated the 1799 Logan Act by talking policy with Russian Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak during the transition .
When The Washington Post wrote , based on top-secret intercepts , in February that retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had spoken about sanctions against Moscow with Mr. Kislyak , the story brought up the obscure Logan Act as a possible violation .
Rarely if ever enforced , the Logan Act bars private citizens from urging foreign countries to oppose U.S. policies . The Trump transition , however , was not a private group but a government-funded agency .
That transition conversation with Mr. Kislyak proved fatal . Flynn pleaded guilty last week to providing false statements to the FBI when he denied discussing sanctions .
To Republicans , one of the most curious decisions by Mr. Comey was not to seize the Democratic Party computer servers hacked by two Russian cybercells . Instead , in one of the most important criminal investigations ever , Mr. Comey left it up to the private firm CrowdStrike to conduct a cybersecurity investigation and report to the FBI .
CrowdStrike employs former FBI agents and is funded in part by Google , a strong Democratic Party supporter .
If the Obama national security state declared war on Mr. Trump , it seems the FBI waged peace with Mrs. Clinton during the probe into her handling of classified material on her home email server during her tenure as secretary of state .
Mr. Comey , the Senate Judiciary Committee discovered , wrote an exoneration statement months before the investigation was concluded , even before interviewing the Democratic candidate .
CNN reported that Peter Strzok , the anti-Trump counterintelligence agent kicked off the Mueller probe , had a hand in changing the statement to lessen her culpability .
The draft wording was changed from “ grossly negligent ” — which is the legal definition of mishandling classified information — to “ extremely careless , ” the words Mr. Comey uttered at the exoneration press conference .
Mr. Comey downplayed the significance of Mrs. Clinton having her attorneys destroy about 30,000 emails with the app BleachBit . The FBI was able to reconstruct some those deleted emails , which showed they , too , contained classified information .
Mr. Mueller fired Mr. Strzok after the discovery of text messages between him and his lover , Lisa Page , a lawyer and aide to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , The Washington Post reported .
Mr. McCabe has come under criticism from Republicans for his own possible conflict of interest .
During the Clinton email investigation , his wife ran a losing campaign for the Virginia state Senate in 2015 . She took a $ 467,000 donation from the political action committee of Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe , a Clinton family confidant .","From the moment Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination and then the presidency, national security officials under President Obama have shown themselves to be intense adversaries in public and behind the scenes.

The Weissmann emails and others from Obama political appointees praising Ms. Yates were unearthed in a Freedom of Information Act request by the conservative government watchdog Judicial Watch.

Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates as she became a hero to Mr. Weissmann and other liberals.

The anti-Trump moves by Obama aides began in July 2016 during his campaign for the presidency.

Then-FBI Director James B. Comey began a criminal investigation of the Trump campaign, in whole or part, based on a dossier financed by the Democratic Party with an aim to destroy the Republican candidate. Its salacious and sometimes far-fetched scenarios of Russia-Trump collusion on the Russian hack of Democratic Party computers have not been confirmed publicly.

The top FBI investigator at that time was a “never Trump” advocate whom Mr. Mueller removed from his team last summer, The New York Times reported.

John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s CIA director and former campaign adviser, pushed the investigation during the campaign. He supplied Mr. Comey with the names of Russians with whom Trump associates had made any type of contact. Mr. Brennan testified to Congress that he provided the list of referrals without knowing what was discussed.

James R. Clapper, Mr. Obama’s director of national intelligence, has suggested that Mr. Trump is on the way out and calls him unfit for office.

“I really question his … fitness to be in this office,” Mr. Clapper told CNN after a fiery Trump speech in August. “And I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it. Maybe he is looking for a way out.”

Conservatives suspect all this has happened as Obama administration holdovers and former aides were working to sabotage the Trump administration.

‘A stealth coup’

Some news stories attributed to “former” government officials — read, Obama — have fallen into the “fake news” category. Journalists and Democrats are determined to show that Trump aides and Moscow collaborated.

A major New York Times story on Feb. 14 based in part on “former American officials” did much to fuel this narrative.

“Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials,” The Times story read.

Almost the entire story was wrong, according to Mr. Comey’s testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence four months later. In other words, there were no such “repeated contacts” with Russian intelligence.

Mr. Comey testified that he was so taken aback by the story that he immediately notified senior members of Congress that it was not true.

Another story that seemed to rise up from Obama holdovers was the narrative that Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May because the FBI director had asked for more resources for a Russia-Trump investigation. Several senior Justice Department officials said no such request was made. Mr. Comey has not made that charge.

“Having experienced a change in administration while at the Pentagon in 2009, it’s not uncommon to see passive-aggressive behavior from a handful of outgoing folks,” said J.D. Gordon, a former Defense Department spokesman and Trump campaign national security adviser. “That said, based on the flood of leaks across the government, what we’re seeing today more closely resembles a stealth coup. Certainly nothing passive about it.”

Mr. Brennan has not shied away from depicting Mr. Trump as an awful president or disclosing his own role in driving the FBI to investigate Mr. Trump during the campaign.

“I wanted to make sure that every information and bit of intelligence that we had was shared with the [FBI] so that they could take it,” Mr. Brennan told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in May. “It was well beyond my mandate as director of CIA to follow on any of those leads that involved U.S. persons. But I made sure that anything that was involving U.S. persons, including anything involving the individuals involved in the Trump campaign, was shared with the bureau.

“I was aware of intelligence and information about contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons that raised concerns in my mind about whether or not those individuals were cooperating with the Russians, either in a witting or unwitting fashion, and it served as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion [or] cooperation occurred,” the former CIA chief testified.

During the presidential transition, Rep. Peter T. King, New York Republican, became suspicious of Mr. Brennan’s behind-the-scenes maneuvers. He said on ABC News: “There should be an investigation of what the Russians did but also an investigation of John Brennan and the hit job he seems to be orchestrating against the president-elect.”

To date, there has been no public confirmation of Trump-Russia election collusion charges.

Any doubts that Mr. Obama’s CIA actively opposed Mr. Trump were perhaps dispelled by former acting Director Michael Morell. He endorsed Hillary Clinton in stark language in response to Mr. Trump’s comments as a candidate applauding Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation,” Mr. Morell said.

Curious Comey actions

Indeed, many Republicans expressed dismay at Mr. Trump’s praise of Mr. Putin, who has invaded eastern Ukraine, annexed the Crimean Peninsula and viewed NATO as an existential threat as he tries to destabilize Western democracies.

They also cringe at the president’s habitual Twitter feeds that often veer from policy and toward personal disputes with people in the media, Hollywood and sports.

Still, the machinations of Mr. Obama’s national security team seem to be unprecedented against a candidate, president-elect and president.

The FBI used the discredited dossier at least once to obtain a warrant to bug former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page. Mr. Page said the collusion and bribery charges made by dossier writer Christopher Steele, a former British spy, are fiction. They ruined his investment business, he told the House intelligence committee.

“After over a year of false rhetoric and propaganda, it’s now refreshing that the real truth about what actually happened last year is starting to come to light,” Mr. Page told The Washington Times.

Other assaults on Mr. Trump: Mr. Comey elevated the dossier’s importance by briefing the president-elect at Trump Tower in New York City. Shortly thereafter, the briefing was leaked to CNN.

Mr. Comey wrote contemporaneous memos about his meetings with Mr. Trump and then leaked them to The New York Times via a middleman.

Then there is “unmasking,” the procedure in which senior national security figures may ask the intelligence community to disclose the names of Americans caught up in the eavesdropping of foreign agents.

Obama national security aides requested the unmasking of an undetermined number of Trump associates during the campaign, suggesting to Republicans that they were spying.

Obama people also have floated the talking point that the Trump campaign team violated the 1799 Logan Act by talking policy with Russian Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak during the transition.

When The Washington Post wrote, based on top-secret intercepts, in February that retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had spoken about sanctions against Moscow with Mr. Kislyak, the story brought up the obscure Logan Act as a possible violation.

Rarely if ever enforced, the Logan Act bars private citizens from urging foreign countries to oppose U.S. policies. The Trump transition, however, was not a private group but a government-funded agency.

That transition conversation with Mr. Kislyak proved fatal. Flynn pleaded guilty last week to providing false statements to the FBI when he denied discussing sanctions.

To Republicans, one of the most curious decisions by Mr. Comey was not to seize the Democratic Party computer servers hacked by two Russian cybercells. Instead, in one of the most important criminal investigations ever, Mr. Comey left it up to the private firm CrowdStrike to conduct a cybersecurity investigation and report to the FBI.

CrowdStrike employs former FBI agents and is funded in part by Google, a strong Democratic Party supporter.

If the Obama national security state declared war on Mr. Trump, it seems the FBI waged peace with Mrs. Clinton during the probe into her handling of classified material on her home email server during her tenure as secretary of state.

Mr. Comey, the Senate Judiciary Committee discovered, wrote an exoneration statement months before the investigation was concluded, even before interviewing the Democratic candidate.

CNN reported that Peter Strzok, the anti-Trump counterintelligence agent kicked off the Mueller probe, had a hand in changing the statement to lessen her culpability.

The draft wording was changed from “grossly negligent” — which is the legal definition of mishandling classified information — to “extremely careless,” the words Mr. Comey uttered at the exoneration press conference.

Mr. Comey downplayed the significance of Mrs. Clinton having her attorneys destroy about 30,000 emails with the app BleachBit. The FBI was able to reconstruct some those deleted emails, which showed they, too, contained classified information.

Mr. Mueller fired Mr. Strzok after the discovery of text messages between him and his lover, Lisa Page, a lawyer and aide to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, The Washington Post reported.

Mr. McCabe has come under criticism from Republicans for his own possible conflict of interest.

During the Clinton email investigation, his wife ran a losing campaign for the Virginia state Senate in 2015. She took a $467,000 donation from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton family confidant.

He’s paying a steep price for his dishonesty.

In December 2016, Michael Flynn was three weeks from becoming the national-security adviser to the next president of the United States.

This is a pertinent fact in evaluating the conduct underlying his plea deal with Robert Mueller. Flynn admitted to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia and other foreign governments during the transition. He’s paying a steep price for his dishonesty, but from what we know so far, it’s not clear what’s supposed to be the larger scandal.

In these conversations, Flynn didn’t “collude” with the Russians about hacked emails. He informed them of Donald Trump’s posture on a policy question. Flynn went beyond the anodyne foreign contacts typical of a transition. This may be inappropriate, but it isn’t a scandal or — as the more outlandish anti-Trumpists argue — a violation of federal law.

Flynn’s most controversial act came after the Obama administration announced Russia sanctions on December 29. At that point, President Barack Obama had exactly 22 days left in office. This isn’t usually the juncture at which administrations launch new foreign-policy ventures, for the obvious reason that they aren’t going to constitute the government of the United States much longer.

Sands","HANOI , Vietnam — President Trump ’ s high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended abruptly without a deal Thursday , cutting short two days of talks aimed at dismantling Pyongyang ’ s weapons program and leaving the two sides with a murky and uncertain path ahead .
In the stunning outcome in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi , the two sides disagreed over what led to the breakdown and whether and when new talks can be arranged . Mr. Trump said he expected his extraordinary personal diplomacy with Mr. Kim to end the crisis on the divided Korean Peninsula will continue .
To the surprise of supporters and detractors back home , Mr. Trump proved willing to walk away from a diplomatic breakthrough that he clearly craved . He said he ended the private talks two hours early when Mr. Kim insisted that all international economic sanctions be dropped before the North agrees to shutter its nuclear and missile programs .
“ Sometimes you have to walk , ” Mr. Trump explained at a subdued closing news conference . Mr. Trump said he rejected a more modest agreement that was “ ready to be signed , ” and a signing ceremony and celebratory lunch that were on the two leaders ’ schedules were quickly scrubbed .
“ I ’ d much rather do it right than do it fast … , ” Mr. Trump said . “ Basically , they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety , and we couldn ’ t do that . ”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters as he flew to the Philippines from Vietnam on Thursday , “ We were hoping we could take another big swing when the two leaders got together .

“ We made some progress , but we didn ’ t get as far as we would have hoped we would have gotten , ” Mr. Pompeo said .
But in a sign of possible trouble ahead , North Korea ’ s top diplomat held a rare press briefing of his own to challenge Mr. Trump ’ s version of events . He said Mr. Kim had not made the maximalist demands that Mr. Trump described .
Even as the U.S. delegation was jetting home on Air Force One , North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho insisted that Pyongyang had asked only for a partial easing of the sanctions in exchange for shutting down the North ’ s main nuclear complex in Yongbyon . Mr. Ri said the North was also ready to offer in writing a permanent halt of the country ’ s nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and that Washington had wasted an opportunity that “ may not come again . ”
Mr. Pompeo predicted that lower-level diplomacy between the two sides could resume quickly , but Pyongyang challenged even that . North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui told reporters that Mr. Kim was finding it difficult to understand why the U.S. left the talks and that the young North Korean leader “ may have lost his will ” to continue the talks .
Mr. Trump said the end of the talks was amicable . He even offered a sort of defense of Mr. Kim over the death of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier , who succumbed to severe illness shortly after his release from a North Korean prison in June 2017 .
Mr. Trump once cited Warmbier ’ s treatment as a symbol of the human rights failings of the Kim regime , but he said Thursday that the North Korean leader told him he had not been aware of the Ohio college student ’ s case .
Mr. Kim “ tells me that he didn ’ t know about it , and I will take him at his word , ” Mr. Trump said .
Those comments struck a discordant note in the generally positive assessment in Washington of Mr. Trump ’ s handling of the summit .
“ We must remember Otto , and we should never let North Korea off the hook for what they did to him , ” Sen . Rob Portman , Ohio Republican , said in a statement .
But ending the summit without agreement on any of the issues discussed clearly fell short of expectations . Negotiators on both sides had spent months in talks leading up to the summit , trying to pave the way for an agreement that also could have included a declaration to formally end the Korean War or the opening of a U.S. liaison office in Pyongyang .
The stunning result divided analysts who said Mr. Trump had already taken a huge gamble in agreeing to meet with the reclusive North Korean leader and holding a one-on-negotiating session with so many key items still unresolved .
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , a New York Democrat who is usually a fierce critic of the president , said Mr. Trump “ did the right thing by walking away and not cutting a poor deal for the sake of a photo op . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , also said Mr. Trump was right not to take a bad deal , but she argued that Mr. Kim was the “ big winner ” for having secured two personal summits with an American president and easing his country ’ s pariah status without having made any significant concessions .
Some said Mr. Trump may have enhanced his bargaining position by showing the North Koreans and a watching world that he was willing to risk short-term setbacks to achieve his long-term goals . North Korea ’ s hopes for an easing of its economic isolation — and even a possible formal ending to the stalemated Korean War of the 1950s — were dashed with Mr. Trump ’ s decision to walk away .
The summit result was clearly a setback for South Korea , which has pursued its own rapprochement with Pyongyang and hoped a U.S.-North Korean detente would speed along that process . Mr. Trump spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the flight home from Hanoi , the White House said .
Mr. Moon ’ s office said in a statement that it regretted the outcome of the summit but expressed a firm commitment to continue North-South negotiations .
South Korean officials said Mr . Moon encouraged Mr. Trump to continue his efforts for accomplishing the “ historic feat of resolving the world ’ s last remaining Cold War rivalry ” and that the two leaders agreed to meet soon to discuss the nuclear issue , The Associated Press reported .
China , North Korea ’ s longtime key ally , refused to assign blame for the Hanoi summit . Officials said Mr. Trump ’ s diplomatic gambit was a positive step and that the U.S. and North Korea must “ meet each other halfway ” if a deal is to be struck .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters that the Korean Peninsula had experienced a significant “ turnaround ” over the past year , a “ hard-won result ” that is worth cherishing .
After a friendly dinner Wednesday night in Hanoi and talks that Mr. Trump described as “ very good , ” the discussions rapidly fell apart Thursday .
The two leaders canceled a formal working lunch , and the White House soon announced a “ schedule change. ” Word soon came down that the joint signing ceremony with both leaders was canceled .
The second summit between the two men began with smiles and handshakes Wednesday as Mr. Trump sought more clarity from the North Korean leader on the steps he would be willing to take to dismantle his nuclear weapons program . They started that process at a breakthrough summit in Singapore in June .
Mr. Trump was lowering expectations for the second round of talks , cautioning the media that he was in “ no rush ” to get a comprehensive agreement as long as Mr. Kim continued to honor his pledge not to conduct any more missile tests .
Asked whether he was serious about giving up his weapons program , Mr. Kim had said , “ If I was not , I wouldn ’ t be here . ”
Another reporter asked whether he was willing to take concrete steps to denuclearize . Mr. Kim said : “ That ’ s what we are discussing right now . ”

Those comments struck a discordant note in the generally positive assessment in Washington of Mr. Trump’s handling of the summit.

“We must remember Otto, and we should never let North Korea off the hook for what they did to him,” Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio Republican, said in a statement.

But ending the summit without agreement on any of the issues discussed clearly fell short of expectations. Negotiators on both sides had spent months in talks leading up to the summit, trying to pave the way for an agreement that also could have included a declaration to formally end the Korean War or the opening of a U.S. liaison office in Pyongyang.

The stunning result divided analysts who said Mr. Trump had already taken a huge gamble in agreeing to meet with the reclusive North Korean leader and holding a one-on-negotiating session with so many key items still unresolved.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who is usually a fierce critic of the president, said Mr. Trump “did the right thing by walking away and not cutting a poor deal for the sake of a photo op.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, also said Mr. Trump was right not to take a bad deal, but she argued that Mr. Kim was the “big winner” for having secured two personal summits with an American president and easing his country’s pariah status without having made any significant concessions.

Some said Mr. Trump may have enhanced his bargaining position by showing the North Koreans and a watching world that he was willing to risk short-term setbacks to achieve his long-term goals. North Korea’s hopes for an easing of its economic isolation — and even a possible formal ending to the stalemated Korean War of the 1950s — were dashed with Mr. Trump’s decision to walk away.

The summit result was clearly a setback for South Korea, which has pursued its own rapprochement with Pyongyang and hoped a U.S.-North Korean detente would speed along that process. Mr. Trump spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the flight home from Hanoi, the White House said.

Mr. Moon’s office said in a statement that it regretted the outcome of the summit but expressed a firm commitment to continue North-South negotiations.

South Korean officials said Mr. Moon encouraged Mr. Trump to continue his efforts for accomplishing the “historic feat of resolving the world’s last remaining Cold War rivalry” and that the two leaders agreed to meet soon to discuss the nuclear issue, The Associated Press reported.

China, North Korea’s longtime key ally, refused to assign blame for the Hanoi summit. Officials said Mr. Trump’s diplomatic gambit was a positive step and that the U.S. and North Korea must “meet each other halfway” if a deal is to be struck.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters that the Korean Peninsula had experienced a significant “turnaround” over the past year, a “hard-won result” that is worth cherishing.

Smiles and setbacks

After a friendly dinner Wednesday night in Hanoi and talks that Mr. Trump described as “very good,” the discussions rapidly fell apart Thursday.

The two leaders canceled a formal working lunch, and the White House soon announced a “schedule change.” Word soon came down that the joint signing ceremony with both leaders was canceled.

The second summit between the two men began with smiles and handshakes Wednesday as Mr. Trump sought more clarity from the North Korean leader on the steps he would be willing to take to dismantle his nuclear weapons program. They started that process at a breakthrough summit in Singapore in June.

Mr. Trump was lowering expectations for the second round of talks, cautioning the media that he was in “no rush” to get a comprehensive agreement as long as Mr. Kim continued to honor his pledge not to conduct any more missile tests.

Asked whether he was serious about giving up his weapons program, Mr. Kim had said, “If I was not, I wouldn’t be here.”

Another reporter asked whether he was willing to take concrete steps to denuclearize. Mr. Kim said: “That’s what we are discussing right now.”

PARIS -- U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un have quite the interesting relationship.

Trump and Kim are meeting face to face for a second time this week in Hanoi, Vietnam, after holding a June 2018 summit in Singapore. Following their first encounter, Trump told the audience at a rally that he and Kim ""fell in love."" Not long before, the two leaders had publicly threatened each other with nuclear destruction.

In his 2018 New Year's speech, Kim pointed out that the nuclear launch button is ""always on my desk.""

Trump responded via Twitter: ""Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!""

Does anyone really think that the leader of the free world would be meeting with the head of the Hermit Kingdom if North Korea's threats about its nuclear ""button"" weren't credible? That button is arguably the reason that some foreign leaders end up getting regime-changed while others get audiences -- or, in this case, love letter exchanges -- with the U.S. president.

Trump's treatment of Kim stands in stark contrast with his administration's treatment of another world leader it doesn't particularly appreciate: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

If Maduro had nukes, it's unlikely that he'd be subjected to the sort of regime-change attempt that's currently underway in Venezuela. Opposition leader Juan Guaido has declared himself the interim president, without any constitutional authority, and is being recognized by the U.S. as such. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, has openly encouraged regime change with a series of tweets. ""It is time for the Venezuelan military high command to stand alongside its people, not with Maduro's Cuban patrons,"" Bolton wrote on Feb. 12.

With a nuclear arsenal, all Maduro would have to do is tweet about his own button, and suddenly there would be summits, photo ops and whispers about the possibility of a shared Nobel Peace Prize with Trump. Instead, Maduro is fighting for his country's sovereignty (and his own behind) against external actors who have grown tired of waiting for him and his socialist policies to fail on their own merit.

If the difference between America's treatment of nuclear regimes and its treatment of non-nuclear regimes wasn't evident enough, Bolton made it even more clear by referencing a leader who was untouchable for decades -- until he gave up his nuclear program and was subsequently regime-changed.

Last year on CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" Bolton said the administration was ""looking at the Libyan model [of nuclear disarmament] of 2003-2004"" for North Korea. Shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi agreed to the dismantling of his country's nuclear and chemical weapons programs. Gaddafi, who had been in power since 1969, was murdered in 2011 amid a Western-backed coup that has left Libya in chaos ever since.

Eventual regime change is what Kim risks if he gives up his nuclear arsenal. Just ask Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a vocal supporter of Western-backed regime change in Venezuela, who recently tweeted out a photo of a beaten and bloodied Gaddafi shortly before his murder.

Nukes are the only real leverage that some countries have, and the U.S. keeps reinforcing this point. What's troubling is that America's treatment of non-nuclear countries such as Venezuela encourages nuclear proliferation, since nukes provide an insurance policy against foreign meddling.

It's the epitome of hypocrisy for the Trump administration to advocate the denuclearization of any country when members of the administration were reportedly eager to export nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.

According to a congressional report, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and other White House officials promoted a project to build nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia despite the objections of lawyers who warned that the plan could violate laws meant to stop nuclear proliferation.

NOW WATCH: ‘Six Reasons Why the Iran Deal Was Bad for America’",www.nationalreview.com,right,Y5zZvjtTKq8KG363
national_security,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown/trump-heads-to-us-border-with-mexico-to-press-case-for-wall-idUSKCN1P416X,Trump heads to U.S. border with Mexico to press case for wall,2019-01-16,Jeff Mason,"MCALLEN , Texas/WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - Flanked by border agents who are going without paychecks during a government shutdown , U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use emergency powers to bypass Congress to pay for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border .
Trump flew to the Texas border with Mexico to try to bolster his case for the border wall as a partial U.S. government shutdown tied to the issue stretched into its 20th day with no sign of new talks to resolve the impasse .
“ We can declare a national emergency . We shouldn ’ t have to , ” Trump told reporters . “ This is just common sense . ”
Such a step would likely prompt an immediate legal challenge over constitutional powers from congressional Democrats - a challenge Trump said he would win .
The Republican president is adamant that a government funding bill to end the shutdown include $ 5.7 billion for a border barrier - his signature campaign promise . Congressional Democrats oppose that .
The standoff has left a quarter of the federal government closed down and hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay .
A day after he stormed out of a meeting with Democratic leaders , Trump attacked them for refusing his demand , calling them harder to deal with than China , a rival power .
“ I find China , frankly , in many ways to be far more honorable than Crying Chuck and Nancy . I really do , ” Trump said , referring to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer .
The House passed two bills to fund the departments of transportation , housing and agriculture - each drawing a few more Republican votes than a similar effort on Wednesday to reopen the Treasury Department and other agencies .
The White House has said Trump would veto the bills if they made it to his desk .
Trump canceled plans to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , which is scheduled to start on Jan. 22 , signaling he was prepared for the shutdown to drag on .
“ I have never been more depressed about moving forward than right now . I just don ’ t see a pathway forward , ” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham , a Trump ally , who said it was time for Trump to declare a national emergency .
Trump said his lawyers had told him he had the power to invoke national emergency powers to get his wall funded .
“ I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency , ” Trump told reporters at the White House . “ I ’ m not prepared to do that yet , but if I have to , I will . ”
The declaration would circumvent Congress ’ power over the national purse strings . A subsequent court fight could be protracted .
The Washington Post , citing two unnamed sources , reported that the White House was laying the groundwork for declaring an emergency that would let Trump build sections of a wall , possibly using funds from the Army Corps of Engineers .
NBC News , in a similar report , said Trump had been briefed on the plan involving the Army Corps while flying to the border on Thursday . A White House official denied Trump had been briefed on the plan , and the Pentagon declined to comment on the news reports .
President Donald Trump salutes a U.S. Border Patrol helicopter with U.S. Border Patrol agents as it flies over the Rio Grande River during his visit to the U.S. - Mexico border in Mission , Texas , U.S. , January 10 , 2019 . ███/Leah Millis
Senator Joe Manchin , a moderate Democrat who has cultivated good relations with Trump , told reporters a national emergency declaration by Trump would be “ wrong , but I think that ’ s his only way out ” of the impasse .
If Trump were to make such a declaration , Manchin predicted the Senate would immediately pass legislation to fund the federal agencies that have been partially closed .
Pressure on both sides could intensify on Friday when about 800,000 federal employees miss their first paychecks . About half of them are deemed “ essential ” to national security , like prison guards and airport security screeners - and have to continue working . Others are home on furlough .
At the FBI , where most agents continue to work , concerns are building that operational funds the bureau needs to conduct investigations , including sensitive undercover operations , are beginning to dry up , said Tom O ’ Connor , president of the FBI Agents Association .
The shutdown , which began on Dec. 22 , will be the longest in U.S. history if it is still going on by Saturday .
In Texas , Trump focused on stories told by tearful family members of people killed by illegal immigrants , and was shown plastic-wrapped bricks of heroin , bales of marijuana , guns and a bag full of cash seized by border agents .
Trump says undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs are streaming across the border , despite statistics that show illegal immigration there is at a 20-year low and that many drug shipments likely are smuggled through legal ports of entry .
Raul Ortiz , a local border patrol official , told Trump and reporters that 133 people from countries other than Mexico and those in central America - including India , Pakistan , China and Romania - had been apprehended in the stretch of territory around McAllen .

Trump flew to the Texas border with Mexico to try to bolster his case for the border wall as a partial U.S. government shutdown tied to the issue stretched into its 20th day with no sign of new talks to resolve the impasse.

“We can declare a national emergency. We shouldn’t have to,” Trump told reporters. “This is just common sense.”

Such a step would likely prompt an immediate legal challenge over constitutional powers from congressional Democrats - a challenge Trump said he would win.

The Republican president is adamant that a government funding bill to end the shutdown include $5.7 billion for a border barrier - his signature campaign promise. Congressional Democrats oppose that.

The standoff has left a quarter of the federal government closed down and hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay.

A day after he stormed out of a meeting with Democratic leaders, Trump attacked them for refusing his demand, calling them harder to deal with than China, a rival power.

“I find China, frankly, in many ways to be far more honorable than Crying Chuck and Nancy. I really do,” Trump said, referring to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

The House passed two bills to fund the departments of transportation, housing and agriculture - each drawing a few more Republican votes than a similar effort on Wednesday to reopen the Treasury Department and other agencies.

The White House has said Trump would veto the bills if they made it to his desk.

Trump canceled plans to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which is scheduled to start on Jan. 22, signaling he was prepared for the shutdown to drag on.

“I have never been more depressed about moving forward than right now. I just don’t see a pathway forward,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, who said it was time for Trump to declare a national emergency.

‘HIS ONLY WAY OUT’

Trump said his lawyers had told him he had the power to invoke national emergency powers to get his wall funded.

“I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I’m not prepared to do that yet, but if I have to, I will.”

The declaration would circumvent Congress’ power over the national purse strings. A subsequent court fight could be protracted.

The Washington Post, citing two unnamed sources, reported that the White House was laying the groundwork for declaring an emergency that would let Trump build sections of a wall, possibly using funds from the Army Corps of Engineers.

NBC News, in a similar report, said Trump had been briefed on the plan involving the Army Corps while flying to the border on Thursday. A White House official denied Trump had been briefed on the plan, and the Pentagon declined to comment on the news reports.

Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who has cultivated good relations with Trump, told reporters a national emergency declaration by Trump would be “wrong, but I think that’s his only way out” of the impasse.

If Trump were to make such a declaration, Manchin predicted the Senate would immediately pass legislation to fund the federal agencies that have been partially closed.

FRIDAY PAYCHECKS

Pressure on both sides could intensify on Friday when about 800,000 federal employees miss their first paychecks. About half of them are deemed “essential” to national security, like prison guards and airport security screeners - and have to continue working. Others are home on furlough.

At the FBI, where most agents continue to work, concerns are building that operational funds the bureau needs to conduct investigations, including sensitive undercover operations, are beginning to dry up, said Tom O’Connor, president of the FBI Agents Association.

The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, will be the longest in U.S. history if it is still going on by Saturday.

In Texas, Trump focused on stories told by tearful family members of people killed by illegal immigrants, and was shown plastic-wrapped bricks of heroin, bales of marijuana, guns and a bag full of cash seized by border agents.

Trump says undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs are streaming across the border, despite statistics that show illegal immigration there is at a 20-year low and that many drug shipments likely are smuggled through legal ports of entry.

Raul Ortiz, a local border patrol official, told Trump and reporters that 133 people from countries other than Mexico and those in central America - including India, Pakistan, China and Romania - had been apprehended in the stretch of territory around McAllen.

USA TODAY

HANOI – President Donald Trump opened an historic second summit with Kim Jong Un here Wednesday by pledging to push for North Korean denuclearization, even as he faced a political firestorm at home that threatens to eclipse any progress.

""I think it'll be very successful,"" Trump said as he and Kim posed for the cameras, proclaiming that he and his North Korean counterpart have a ""great relationship."" At another photo opportunity, Kim said he is certain of an outcome ""that will be welcomed by all people,"" and ""I will do my best to make that happen.""

But Trump's diplomatic efforts come as his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is expected to allege ""criminal conduct"" by the president in his first public testimony later Wednesday before Congress.

Trump met with Kim for a brief private conversation, followed by a ""social dinner,"" all marking their first face-to-face encounter since the two met in Singapore last summer.

The ceremonial events, splashed across U.S. television screens early Wednesday morning, are expected give way to more substantive talks on the second and final day of the summit Thursday.

Simply put, Trump is trying to get Kim to commit to specific steps to eliminate nuclear weapons programs, while Kim wants Trump to lift economic sanctions that are crippling his impoverished nation.

In urging denuclearization, Trump told Kim that ""some people would like to see it go quicker, but you're satisfied, I'm satisfied."" He also suggested giving up nuclear weapons would draw economic assistance, telling Kim that North Korea has ""unbelievable, unlimited potential,"" and ""I look forward to watching it happen and to helping it to happen.""

Asked about another goal – formally ending the Korean War – Trump told reporters, ""we'll see.""

Meanwhile, Trump and other White House officials, mindful that the visit to Vietnam is competing for public attention among millions of Americans, attacked Cohen in the hours before the Kim meeting.

Trump tweeted that Cohen ""did bad things unrelated to Trump,"" and ""is lying in order to reduce his prison time.""

Some foreign policy analysts said they worry that Trump will be too willing to strike a bad deal with Kim in order to draw attention from his domestic problems, including Cohen's testimony.

""Congress should have postponed Cohen testimony, and Potus should not be tweeting about Cohen from Hanoi,"" tweeted Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Trump appeared annoyed when reporters asked him about Cohen at one of the summit photo opps. The White House later restricted reporter access to the dinner with Trump, Kim, and their aides.

The president did say he plans to hold a news conference after Thursday's meetings with the North Korean leader.

Trump also spent some pre-meeting time launching a Twitter attack on one of his congressional critics, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and claiming he discussed the senator's exaggerations about his war record in a meeting with Vietnam officials.

Tweeting that ""I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal,"" Trump added that ""his war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!""

Trump did not serve in the military during the Vietnam years, claiming college and medical deferments that included bone spurs in his foot.

The tumult back in Washington – lawmakers are also busy with a measure, approved by the Democratic-controlled House, to repeal Trump's border wall emergency – threaten to overshadow the work in Hanoi.

The president's troubles only add to the pressure to deliver results with Kim, who has signaled an interest in stronger relations with the United States but declined to dismantle his nuclear program.

In the days leading up to the summit, Trump appeared to lower expectations, claiming he is ""in no rush"" for denuclearization as long as Pyongyang continues to suspend missile tests.

Hours before the sit-down with the North Korean leader, Trump held largely ceremonial meetings with the leaders of Vietnam, and said their country can be a model for Kim, whom he described as ""my friend.""

""Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize,"" Trump tweeted early in the day.

More than four decades after the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese view the summit as an opportunity to assert themselves on the world diplomatic stage. Heavily promoting the Trump-Kim summit, light poles in Hanoi are festooned with the flags of the U.S., North Korea and Vietnam, mounted on a shield featuring an image of a handshake.

Large posters advertising the summit proclaim Hanoi as ""The City For Peace.""

The demands:Trump-Kim summit: North Korea must do something 'meaningful' to denuclearize before sanctions relief

Trump and Kim met at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel, an Art Nouveau masterpiece that harkens back to French colonial days in Hanoi. Past guests at the hotel have ranged from the comedian Charlie Chaplin to current Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Among the issues on the Trump-Kim agenda:

What exactly is 'denuclearization'

Trump and aides have demanded that North Korea identify and destroy facilities used to make nuclear weapons. Kim, however, believes denuclearization should cover the entire region – including U.S. weapons systems designed to protect ally South Korea.

Economic sanctions standoff

Kim says he will not take major steps toward denuclearization until the United States and other countries lift at least some of the sanctions that have crippled North Korea's economy.

Trump has said sanctions will not be removed until Kim starts to denuclearize, though he has also held out the possibility of other economic assistance.

The economy is one of the reasons the U.S. agreed to meet in Vietnam. It hopes North Korea will follow the model of its communist ally, which developed a quasi-capitalist sector after economic reforms in the 1980s.

North Korea-U.S. relations

While neither leader is expected to open an embassy in the other's country, negotiators are discussing ""liaison offices"" that could be used to improve communications between the two governments.

A formal end to the Korean War

Trump has been open to a treaty to formally end the Korean War, which is technically ongoing even though hostilities were suspended with an armistice in 1953.

Negotiators are working on what aides called a ""peace declaration,"" a non-binding political statement to affirm North and South Korea are no longer at war.

The history:How the North and South negotiated a truce in Korean War

Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea expert with the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said Kim wants to do just enough to satisfy Trump – ""like retiring an exhausted nuclear site he no longer needs"" – while retaining a weapons program he depends on for survival.

""Two steps forward and one step back is still progress for North Korea,"" he said.

Olivia Enos, a policy analyst with the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, said she hopes Trump and his team tread cautiously. Give too much, she said, and the U.S. will lose its leverage and get little in return.

""The president's willingness to compromise threatens to undermine the administration's maximum pressure strategy that brought Kim Jong Un to the negotiating table in the first place,"" she said.

While analysts worried that Trump might give up too much to Kim, Cohen planned to mention the president's Vietnam trip in his testimony.

In a prepared statement first reported late Tuesday by Politico, Cohen cited the deferments Trump received during the Vietnam War.

""'You think I'm stupid, I wasn't going to Vietnam,'"" Cohen quotes Trump as saying.

In his prepared testimony, Cohen adds: ""I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.""

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told cable morning shows that Mr Trump is happy for the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller to be released.

She said the summary of the findings issued by the attorney general amounted to a full vindication of the president.

Mr Mueller's long-awaited report, however, stops short of exonerating Mr Trump of obstruction of justice.

What did the White House say?

White House aides took to the airwaves on Monday to depict the president as the victim of an inquiry that should never have been allowed.

When asked whether Mr Trump would support the release of the full report, Mrs Sanders told NBC News' Today programme: ""He's more than happy for any of this stuff to come out.""

Speaking on CNN later on Monday, Mrs Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" that Democrats and journalists had spent two years portraying the president as an agent of a foreign power.

""That's equivalent to treason,"" said the press secretary. ""That's punishable by death in this country and that is outrageous.""

Mrs Sanders said the ""obscene lie"" was used to try ""to overthrow the president of the United States"".

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Monday called on Democrat Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to step down.

""He ought to resign today,"" she told Fox News. ""He has been on every TV show 50 times a day for practically the last two years promising Americans that the president would be impeached or indicted.""

How did Trump react?

""It was a complete and total exoneration,"" Mr Trump declared on Sunday, even though the report specifically states that he has not been fully exonerated.

""To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this. Before I even got elected it began and it began illegally.""

Is Trump in the clear?

In his four-page summary released on Sunday, Trump-appointed Attorney General William Barr wrote: ""The special counsel did not find that any US person or Trump campaign official conspired or knowingly co-ordinated with Russia.""

But on the issue of whether justice was obstructed, Mr Mueller's report says: ""While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""

Mr Trump still faces about a dozen other investigations.

These include a federal inquiry in New York into possible election law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses, and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee.

Congress is also continuing its own inquiries, mostly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.

What's the political reaction?

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham summed up the conservative response on Monday, telling reporters Mr Trump was stronger today than ever.

""This cloud has been removed,"" he said. ""To those wanting an outcome of removing Trump, you're going to be disappointed.""

Opposition Democrats are demanding full access to Mr Mueller's report.

The Democratic Chair of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, said he would ask Mr Barr to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee ""in the near future"" over ""very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department"".

What are they saying in Russia?

Russia has denied being involved in hacking to influence the 2016 US election result.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocked suggestions there had been collusion, saying: ""I recall the words of the Chinese philosopher who said that it's hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it's not there.

Alexei Pushkov, a member of Russia's upper house, tweeted: ""Democrats, Russophobes and leading media created a virtual conspiracy which existed only in their heads and in headlines, and nowhere else.""

Breaking the law or just venting?

Legally, the House Judiciary Committee will want to get its hands on the full Mueller report. They will want to see why Robert Mueller felt he couldn't exonerate the president on obstruction of justice.

And remember, obstruction of justice is one of the ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" that can lead to impeachment.

There will be an endless back and forth over that. And I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if the subpoenas start to fly.

Committees have the right to call people and papers. They are bound to flex their muscles as much as they can. They want to play this long. They want to damage the president.

To prosecute the president for obstruction of justice there would have needed to be evidence of intent to obstruct. So even though the president fired former FBI chief James Comey and unleashed regular torrents of abuse on Twitter about the investigation, if his only motivation for those acts was to vent his spleen rather than break the law, then he's done nothing wrong legally.

But legislation Trump signed bars companies from investing in the country because of its abysmal record on human rights , an issue the president has given scant attention in talks with Pyongyang .
Heading into his second meeting with the North Korean leader , the president is planning to pitch him on a vision of North Korean modernization , White House officials have said . Trump dangled the prospect of material wealth for Kim ’ s impoverished homeland on Monday , telling reporters , “ I think he ’ ll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy . ”
It ’ s not clear how the president is proposing to help Kim realize his economic goals . A provision Trump signed into law as a part of a 2017 sanctions bill cracking down on Iran , Russia and North Korea could prove a crippling obstacle to any American overture , experts said . The law prohibits imports of anything produced or manufactured by a North Korean citizen — and it would fall on Congress , not the president , to repeal the measure .
“ Because of U.S. law today , the general counsel of any U.S. company is not going to recommend going into North Korea because of human rights abuses , ” said Victor Cha , who served as President George W. Bush ’ s top adviser on North Korea . The Trump administration , he said , “ needs to talk about human rights if they ’ re going to achieve what they want to achieve . ”
That means Trump could ink a nuclear deal with North Korea that lifts some sanctions in exchange for Kim ’ s promise to give up his nation ’ s nuclear weapons , but he would have to rely on Congress to repeal the 2017 law in order for any American company to significantly invest in North Korea . That ’ s unlikely , barring a deal that addresses human rights in a substantive manner .
Since their first meeting Singapore last year , the president has worked to entice Kim to give up his nuclear arsenal by pitching dreams of beachfront condominiums and gold-plated casinos . During their inaugural meeting , Trump played a four-minute video for his counterpart — produced by the CIA and based on a psychological profile of the North Korean leader , according to a source familiar with its production . The video urged Kim to abandon his pursuit of nuclear weapons in order to “ enjoy prosperity like he has never seen . ”
This approach carried with it a sharp turn away from the brutal nature of the North Korean regime — something to which Trump had , in fact , called attention during the first year and a half of his presidency . Among the first lady ’ s guests at the 2018 State of the Union address were the parents of Otto Warmbier , the American student imprisoned by North Korea who was returned in a vegetative state early in the Trump presidency , and North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho . Trump decried the “ depraved character ” of the regime and said “ no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea . ”
There was no rhetoric like that during his discursive 90-minute news conference at the end of his meeting with Kim last June . Pressed on whether , and to what extent , he had challenged Kim on human rights , Trump told reporters , “ It was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization , ” adding : “ They will be doing things . I think he wants to do things . ”
“ After he met with Kim , never talked about it , ” Cha said .
The White House did not respond to a request for comment .
Faced with mounting pressure to incorporate human rights into its North Korea policy , the Trump administration has in recent months provided little information to lawmakers on Capitol Hill , limiting the extent to which it has provided classified briefings on the matter , according to two senior Republican congressional aides . Though lawmakers have pressed administration officials on the issue , “ they did not provide a lot of substance , ” one of the aides said . “ I can ’ t stress the extent to which , in recent months , things have really dried up . ”
Experts insist that economic reform alone is not enough to effect change — it must be interrelated with national security and human rights , as the U.S. managed to do at the height of the Cold War . The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 cracked down on U.S. trade with the Soviet Union and its satellites in response to human rights abuses . The 1975 Helsinki Accords , signed by 35 countries , recognized Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe while extracting a commitment from the Soviet Union to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms .
“ We lose a great opportunity if we don ’ t focus on human rights as part of our arsenal on North Korea , ” said Jay Lefkowitz , who served as special envoy for human rights in North Korea during the George W. Bush administration — a congressionally mandated post for which the Trump administration has yet to nominate anyone . “ The irony is , of all the things he ’ s done in his presidency , the thing that looked the most promising was his North Korea policy during the first 18 months , where he kept both North Korea and China really off balance . And then literally , within the scope of a few hours in Singapore , we took a half dozen giant steps backward . ”
Since the Singapore summit , North Korea has shown few signs of abandoning its nuclear weapons — over the past year , reports have shown , the country has expanded its ballistic missile programs and base of fissile material .
North Korea is likely to use any economic gains to finance its nuclear program , according to Nicholas Eberstadt , a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute . “ The North Korean leadership doesn ’ t see it as an either-or trade , ” Eberstadt said .

But North Korea's record on human rights stands in the way.

President Donald Trump has banked his North Korea policy on selling Kim Jong Un a future of prosperity and riches. But legislation Trump signed bars companies from investing in the country because of its abysmal record on human rights, an issue the president has given scant attention in talks with Pyongyang.

Heading into his second meeting with the North Korean leader, the president is planning to pitch him on a vision of North Korean modernization, White House officials have said. Trump dangled the prospect of material wealth for Kim’s impoverished homeland on Monday, telling reporters, “I think he’ll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy.”

It’s not clear how the president is proposing to help Kim realize his economic goals. A provision Trump signed into law as a part of a 2017 sanctions bill cracking down on Iran, Russia and North Korea could prove a crippling obstacle to any American overture, experts said. The law prohibits imports of anything produced or manufactured by a North Korean citizen — and it would fall on Congress, not the president, to repeal the measure.

“Because of U.S. law today, the general counsel of any U.S. company is not going to recommend going into North Korea because of human rights abuses,” said Victor Cha, who served as President George W. Bush’s top adviser on North Korea. The Trump administration, he said, “needs to talk about human rights if they’re going to achieve what they want to achieve.”

That means Trump could ink a nuclear deal with North Korea that lifts some sanctions in exchange for Kim’s promise to give up his nation’s nuclear weapons, but he would have to rely on Congress to repeal the 2017 law in order for any American company to significantly invest in North Korea. That’s unlikely, barring a deal that addresses human rights in a substantive manner.

Since their first meeting Singapore last year, the president has worked to entice Kim to give up his nuclear arsenal by pitching dreams of beachfront condominiums and gold-plated casinos. During their inaugural meeting, Trump played a four-minute video for his counterpart — produced by the CIA and based on a psychological profile of the North Korean leader, according to a source familiar with its production. The video urged Kim to abandon his pursuit of nuclear weapons in order to “enjoy prosperity like he has never seen.”

This approach carried with it a sharp turn away from the brutal nature of the North Korean regime — something to which Trump had, in fact, called attention during the first year and a half of his presidency. Among the first lady’s guests at the 2018 State of the Union address were the parents of Otto Warmbier, the American student imprisoned by North Korea who was returned in a vegetative state early in the Trump presidency, and North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho. Trump decried the “depraved character” of the regime and said “no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.”

There was no rhetoric like that during his discursive 90-minute news conference at the end of his meeting with Kim last June. Pressed on whether, and to what extent, he had challenged Kim on human rights, Trump told reporters, “It was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization,” adding: “They will be doing things. I think he wants to do things.”

“After he met with Kim, never talked about it,” Cha said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Faced with mounting pressure to incorporate human rights into its North Korea policy, the Trump administration has in recent months provided little information to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, limiting the extent to which it has provided classified briefings on the matter, according to two senior Republican congressional aides. Though lawmakers have pressed administration officials on the issue, “they did not provide a lot of substance,” one of the aides said. “I can’t stress the extent to which, in recent months, things have really dried up.”

Experts insist that economic reform alone is not enough to effect change — it must be interrelated with national security and human rights, as the U.S. managed to do at the height of the Cold War. The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 cracked down on U.S. trade with the Soviet Union and its satellites in response to human rights abuses. The 1975 Helsinki Accords, signed by 35 countries, recognized Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe while extracting a commitment from the Soviet Union to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.

“We lose a great opportunity if we don’t focus on human rights as part of our arsenal on North Korea,” said Jay Lefkowitz, who served as special envoy for human rights in North Korea during the George W. Bush administration — a congressionally mandated post for which the Trump administration has yet to nominate anyone. “The irony is, of all the things he’s done in his presidency, the thing that looked the most promising was his North Korea policy during the first 18 months, where he kept both North Korea and China really off balance. And then literally, within the scope of a few hours in Singapore, we took a half dozen giant steps backward.”

Since the Singapore summit, North Korea has shown few signs of abandoning its nuclear weapons — over the past year, reports have shown, the country has expanded its ballistic missile programs and base of fissile material.

North Korea is likely to use any economic gains to finance its nuclear program, according to Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute. “The North Korean leadership doesn’t see it as an either-or trade,” Eberstadt said.

The only thing Kim might find harder to abandon than his nuclear weapons is his police state.

North Korea “operates an all-encompassing indoctrination machine,” according to a 2014 report commissioned by the U.N. Human Rights Council. The report found that the state uses food as a means to control the population, regularly “disappears” its citizens for perceived disloyalty to the government and runs a vast network of prison and forced labor camps in which torture, rape, and execution are routine.

“ This is really kind of Hollywood-like , what he ’ s trying to do , ” Princeton University political historian Julian Zelizer said .
How Trump thinks he could get the wall by declaring a national emergency
Many presidents have declared national emergencies , including George W. Bush after 9/11 and Barack Obama during the swine flu outbreak in 2009 .
In recent history , they ’ ve done so under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , which lets presidents issue an emergency declaration but under certain constraints — namely , Trump can only use specific powers Congress has already codified by law , and he has to say which powers he ’ s using . The 1976 law was actually passed to rein in presidential power and codify how presidents were going about declaring emergencies , from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Richard Nixon . It offers no definition for what counts as an emergency .
In trying to get wall funding through the National Emergencies Act , the question then becomes which existing laws he can try to use to get the money . That ’ s where he — and the legal scholars trying to figure out what he ’ s talking about — run into trouble : identifying the laws and statutes he could actually use . The Brennan Center for Justice tracks about 130 laws that contain special powers Trump could access .
“ It could be that by putting together a lot of different sources of emergency authority , the president could tap a lot of different funds and at least start , ” Kim Lane Scheppele , a professor at the Center for Human Values at Princeton University , told me .
She pointed to a handful of preexisting laws the president could potentially use .
He could , for example , reallocate military spending on construction projects for the wall . One law allows the defense secretary , after a national emergency declaration , to direct the army ’ s civil works program to construct a structure needed for national defense and use the military budget to do it . Another lets the secretary direct other military services for construction projects . For example , money could come out of the budget for building housing on military bases for service members and into the budget for the wall .
Or Trump could declare a “ state of immigration emergency , ” which unlocks an immigration emergency fund . It ’ s generally supposed to be used to help states feed and house migrants and process their claims , but Scheppele said that it is “ vaguely worded enough to permit an edgy interpretation ” that could get the funds for the wall . The issue there is that the fund only has about $ 20 million at the moment , not enough for Trump ’ s wall .
The White House on Friday identified a couple of specific options for Trump to try to cobble together funds . Ahead of the announcement on Friday , officials said he would redirect about $ 600 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund , an account funded by money seized by the US government ; $ 2.5 billion from the Department of Defense ’ s counter-drug activities ; and $ 3.6 billion from other military construction accounts . Trump won ’ t try to take anything from disaster relief .
Since Trump started talking about declaring an emergency to fund the border wall , there has been some debate about whether he has the legal authority to do so .
Bruce Ackerman , a law professor at Yale University , wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times that Trump can not declare an emergency at the border , arguing that Trump ’ s actions would be illegal , and they would force the armed forces tasked with carrying out his orders to choose between abiding by the commander-in-chief ’ s wishes and committing a federal crime .
“ The president of the United States has a constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , ” Ackerman said in a subsequent phone interview . “ It is unconstitutional for him to take care to violate the laws of the United States . ”
Others have echoed Ackerman ’ s declaration that Trump can ’ t lawfully declare a state of emergency for the wall .
Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) in an appearance on CNN ’ s State of the Union said the idea was a “ nonstarter. ” Fox News judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano said in a Fox Business appearance that the president “ can not spend money unless it ’ s been authorized by Congress . ”
Some have pointed to a Korean War-era court case , Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , in which the Supreme Court ruled that President Harry Truman ’ s attempt to nationalize US steel mills during a strike in the Korean War was unconstitutional . “ If Harry Truman couldn ’ t nationalize the steel industry during wartime , this president doesn ’ t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border , ” Schiff told CNN .
Scheppele , however , expressed skepticism that the case actually applies in what Trump is proposing to do . “ Once you get into the specific area of emergency powers , then the president is acting within a delegated framework , ” she said .
Others say Trump can do it — and it might be harder to stop him than you ’ d think
If Trump does declare a national emergency for the border wall , there will almost certainly be challenges to him in both Congress and the courts . But it ’ s not entirely obvious they will stick . As we saw with Trump ’ s travel ban , he ’ s often willing to do things that go over the legal line , and then leave the courts to figure out where exactly that line lies .
The National Emergencies Act contains a mechanism for Congress to overrule the president by passing a joint resolution out of the House and Senate . With Democrats in control of the House , it would presumably pass there easily , and Ackerman , the Yale professor , says he believes it could pass the Senate too .
“ Mitch McConnell does not have the power to bottle this up , ” he said . “ So that means that there would be a moment of truth for the Republican Party . ”
But due to a 35-year-old court case , Congress might not be able to override the president that easily . In the 1983 case Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha , the Supreme Court decided that a one-house legislative veto violated the Constitution . After that , the National Emergencies Act was amended to require the joint resolution to override the president ’ s declaration — like a typical law , it requires a simple majority in the House and Senate and the president ’ s signature .
Trump would probably not be willing to sign a joint resolution to reject his own emergency declaration , so that means that Congress would need to override him with a two-thirds majority in each chamber .
“ The safeguard you think is there in the National Emergencies Act turns out not to be there , or at least most constitutional scholars who have looked at that question closely think that the Supreme Court would never go for it , especially now that we have a Supreme Court with two new members who are unusually deferential to executive power , ” Scheppele said . “ It could be that actually nobody could tell him no . ”
McConnell , speaking on the Senate floor on Thursday , said he supports the president ’ s emergency declaration . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) at a press conference on Thursday said congressional Democrats would review their options and are “ prepared to respond appropriately ” to Trump ’ s declaration .
A national emergency declaration for the border wall would likely face a challenge in the courts . But it ’ s not clear which parties would have standing to file a lawsuit , and moreover , any decisions would take time .
Being the first mover in declaring the emergency would give Trump a “ tremendous advantage , ” Ackerman said .
“ There are good legal challenges , to be sure , and I think there would be a real fight , ” Goitein , from the Brennan Center , said .
Trump on Friday anticipated the court battle . “ Look , I expect to be sued , ” he said .
Some Republicans previously encouraged Trump to declare the emergency . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) in a tweet earlier in January called on the president to declare an emergency to build the wall . Rep. Mo Brooks ( R-SC ) said in an interview on CNN that Trump had the right to declare an emergency “ because the United States code says so . ”
Mr. President , the Democrats are not working in good faith with you .
Declare emergency , build the wall now . — Lindsey Graham ( @ LindseyGrahamSC ) January 11 , 2019
Beyond the legal questions around what Trump can do and how he can do it , there are some more fundamental issues : The US government was shut down over a campaign trail call that Trump uses to rile up his base , and there ’ s no new emergency at the US-Mexico border .
“ There is no national security crisis , ” Zelizer , from Princeton , said . “ We are not at war , and it ’ s not clear anything is happening at the border . ”
This isn ’ t the first time Trump has invented an immigration crisis when convenient — ahead of the midterms , he started warning about dire threats from a migrant caravan , only to more or less drop the issue once November 6 came and went . Now that Congress won ’ t agree to his border wall , and obviously Mexico isn ’ t paying for it , he ’ s manufacturing panic yet again .
“ There ’ s an emergency whenever it suits his purposes , but that ought not to be the test , ” said Michael Gerhardt , a constitutional scholar at the University of North Carolina ’ s School of Law .
This also puts to the test the Republican Party and its willingness — or , frankly , lack thereof — to stand up to Trump . The GOP spent years complaining about Obama ’ s overreach , so now that Trump is making up an emergency to pay for a border wall Congress does not want , what will they do ?
“ If this were a Democratic president , Republicans would say Obama is going to have to put up or shut up . But because it ’ s Trump , Republicans will argue that we should defer to the president , ” Gerhardt said . “ We have to consider at what point this deferral means the president is usurping legislative authority . ”
Republicans have expressed concern that Trump ’ s emergency declaration now might lead to declarations from future Democratic presidents in the future on issues such as climate change or health care . Pelosi on Thursday made sure to point that out . “ I know the Republicans have some unease about it , no matter what they say , because if the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency , an illusion that he wants to convey , just think of what a president with values can present to the American people , ” she said .
Regardless of the concerns , Trump appears determined to give it a go .
“ It ’ s certainly not a slam-dunk that he can , ” Goitein said , “ but it ’ s not a slam-dunk that he can ’ t , either . ”
After the government shutdown ended , she questioned in a Twitter thread Trump ’ s tactic of threatening to declare an emergency if Congress doesn ’ t give him what he wants . If he ’ s able to wait three weeks , and Congress in that time decides against funding against the wall , “ declaring an emergency to build one anyway is a massive abuse of power and quite likely a violation of the Constitution . ”
By going in this direction , she wrote , “ he makes it about 10 times more likely that lawsuits challenging the declaration will succeed . ”","President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency at the southern border in an attempt to get his border wall built.

The thing is, there is no emergency

Beyond the legal questions around what Trump can do and how he can do it, there are some more fundamental issues: The US government was shut down over a campaign trail call that Trump uses to rile up his base, and there’s no new emergency at the US-Mexico border.

But because it’s Trump, Republicans will argue that we should defer to the president,” Gerhardt said. “We have to consider at what point this deferral means the president is usurping legislative authority.”

Republicans have expressed concern that Trump’s emergency declaration now might lead to declarations from future Democratic presidents in the future on issues such as climate change or health care. Pelosi on Thursday made sure to point that out. “I know the Republicans have some unease about it, no matter what they say, because if the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency, an illusion that he wants to convey, just think of what a president with values can present to the American people,” she said.

Regardless of the concerns, Trump appears determined to give it a go.

“It’s certainly not a slam-dunk that he can,” Goitein said, “but it’s not a slam-dunk that he can’t, either.”

After the government shutdown ended, she questioned in a Twitter thread Trump’s tactic of threatening to declare an emergency if Congress doesn’t give him what he wants. If he’s able to wait three weeks, and Congress in that time decides against funding against the wall, “declaring an emergency to build one anyway is a massive abuse of power and quite likely a violation of the Constitution.”

By going in this direction, she wrote, “he makes it about 10 times more likely that lawsuits challenging the declaration will succeed.”",www.vox.com,left,65WJ7Bkecevzx5MZ

The investigation that led to the arrest of a federal contractor on charges of leaking classified material that was published by The Intercept website apparently was not the stuff of big-budget Hollywood spy films.

The affidavit filed Monday against Reality Leigh Winner, 25, states that federal authorities contacted the FBI on Thursday and said a ""News Outlet"" had reached out two days earlier relating to an upcoming story. The Intercept, which published its story Monday, apparently provided authorities with a copy of a top-secret NSA document discussing details of alleged Russian interference in U.S. elections.

Officials quickly determined the information was classified.

""The U.S. Government Agency examined the document shared by the News Outlet and determined the pages ... appeared to be folded and/or creased, suggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space,"" the affidavit says.

An internal audit determined that six people had accessed and printed the intelligence report, the affidavit says.

""A further audit of the six individuals' desk computers revealed that WINNER had e-mail contact with the News Outlet,"" it says. ""The audit did not reveal that any of the other individuals had e-mail contact with the News Outlet.""

Devin Nunes: No credible evidence of Russia-Trump collusion

No more phone calls, the FBI had a Winner. Unlike Edward Snowden, who fled to Hong Kong and then to Moscow after leaking classified documents, Winner was easy to chase down. FBI Special Agent Justin Garrick, based in Atlanta, spoke to her Saturday in her Augusta, Ga., home.

""During that conversation, WINNER admitted intentionally identifying and printing the classified intelligence reporting at issue despite not having a 'need to know,' and with knowledge that the intelligence reporting was classified,"" the affidavit says.

It adds that Winner, who had ""Top Secret"" clearance while working as a contractor with Pluribus International Corp., admitted taking the classified report from her office space and mailing it to the news outlet, even though she knew the website was not authorized to receive or possess the documents. The complaint claims Winner even acknowledged that she ""knew the contents of the reporting could be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of a foreign nation.""

The Intercept says the NSA document details the Russian ""spear-fishing"" attack targeting local government employees with emails that appeared to be from e-voting vendors but were designed to allow hackers to infect and gain control of computers.

In late October, the hackers sent emails to 122 addresses tied to ""local government organizations,"" the document says, adding that ""officials involved in the management of voter registration systems"" were the likely targets.

""It is unknown whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised all the intended victims, and what potential data could have been accessed by the cyber actor,"" the alleged NSA document says. ""However, based upon subsequent targeting, it was likely that at least one account was compromised.""

The Intercept issued a statement Tuesday saying it obtained the report anonymously and did not know the source until the news broke late Monday.

""It is important to keep in mind that these (charging) documents contain unproven assertions and speculation designed to serve the government’s agenda and as such warrant skepticism,"" the statement said. ""Winner faces allegations that have not been proven. The same is true of the FBI’s claims about how it came to arrest Winner.""

national_security,Fox News (Online),2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-in-flynn-case-to-open-up-case-for-amicus-submissions,"Flynn judge to allow 'amicus' submissions, delaying immediate resolution and drawing planned ethics complaint",,Gregg Re,"D.C. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan issued an order Tuesday indicating he 'll soon accept `` amicus curiae , '' or `` friend of the court '' submissions , in the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn -- drawing immediate scrutiny and a planned ethics complaint against Sullivan , who had previously refused to hear amicus briefs in the case .
Sullivan 's order indicated that an upcoming scheduling order would clarify the parameters of who specifically could submit the amicus briefs , which are submissions by non-parties that claim an interest in the case . Sullivan specifically said he anticipated that `` individuals and organizations '' will file briefs `` for the benefit of the court , '' as he prepares to rule on the government 's motion to dismiss the case .
`` Judge Sullivan , who denied leave to file amicus briefs when he knew third parties would have spoken favorably of Flynn , now solicits briefs critical of Flynn , '' independent journalist Michael Cernovich wrote on Twitter Tuesday evening . `` This is a violation of the judicial oath and applicable ethical rules . We will be filing a complaint against Sullivan . ... [ He ] is acting as a politician , not a judge . ''
Sullivan had previously held in the Flynn case that `` [ o ] ptions exist for a private citizen to express his views about matters of public interest , but the Court 's docket is not an available option . ''
Will Chamberlain , a lawyer and the editor-in-chief of Human Events , noted that case law in the circuit generally prohibits trial court judges from second-guessing the government 's decision not to prosecute a defendant .
Fox News is told that movement on Cernovich 's ethics complaint was underway Tuesday night , and that Cernovich also was considering filing his own amicus brief . ( Cernovich has also sought to intervene in the case of Trump associate Roger Stone to obtain jury questionnaires , after issues of apparent juror bias surfaced -- an ongoing effort supported by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press . )
Flynn 's legal team indicated in a filing Tuesday that a sealed amicus brief has already been submitted by a left-wing group known as the `` Watergate Prosecutors , '' urging Sullivan not to toss out Flynn 's guilty plea despite the Justice Department 's request . That group was featured in an October 2019 Washington Post opinion piece , and listed Jill Wine-Banks -- who previously advanced unsubstantiated collusion theories involving the Trump campaign and Russia -- as one of its members .
Wine-Banks was also explictly named as a member of the group seeking to file an amicus brief in the Flynn case .
`` Mueller can prove conspiracy with Russia beyond any doubt , '' Wine-Banks previously wrote . She also claimed in 2017 that Flynn would receive `` immunity for kidnapping as well as his federal crimes . ''
Late Tuesday , President Trump retweeted a post by the Twitter user Techno_Fog calling Wine-Banks a `` Trump/Russia collusion nutter . '' The post concluded , sarcastically : `` Good job Judge Sullivan ! ''
Wine-Banks did not immediately respond to Fox News ' request for comment .
WASHINGTON POST NEWSROOM DIVIDED OVER WHETHER FLYNN 'S CALLS WERE EVEN NEWSWORTHY -- THEN OP-ED COLUMNIST WENT AHEAD
The Federalist 's Sean Davis responded : `` This is who Emmet G. Sullivan , the judge in Flynn ’ s case , is allowing to hijack a case which both the defense and the government prosecution wish to dismiss because the case was tainted by corruption from the beginning . Pathetic . ''
Davis added that Sullivan was letting `` left-wing lawyers write his final order against Flynn for him . ''
Flynn 's attorney , Sidney Powell , echoed those arguments . `` The proposed amicus brief has no place in this Court , '' Powell wrote . `` No further delay should be tolerated or any further expense caused to him and his defense . ''
In his brief order Tuesday , Sullivan quoted his fellow judge on the D.C. District Court , Amy Berman Jackson , who previously admonished the parties in the Stone case that allowing amicus submissions does not mean that the criminal case will become a `` free for all . ''
Flynn 's case , however , has sometimes seemed like just that . In a fireworks-filled sentencing hearing in December 2018 , for example , Sullivan himself appeared open to the idea that Flynn could be charged with a death penalty-eligible offense .
`` I 'm not hiding my disgust , my disdain for this criminal offense , '' Sullivan said during that hearing . He added that Flynn 's allegedly unregistered work with Turkey `` arguably '' had undermined `` everything this flag over here stands for. ” ( Flynn was never charged with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act , which had gone largely unenforced until recently . )
In a bizarre moment , Sullivan then asked the government 's attorneys whether they had considered charging Flynn with treason . The prosecutors said they had not , and Sullivan later walked back his comments after a brief recess .
Then , last December , Sullivan accused Flynn 's legal team of plagiarism in a filing , saying they had `` lifted verbatim portions from a source without attribution . '' Powell shot back that the claim `` made no sense , '' and that she relied on one of her own cases as well as a brief primarily written by a friend whom she cited .
On the recommendation of U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen , who served as an FBI agent for more than a decade , the Justice Department last Thursday moved to drop its case against Flynn . The stunning development came after internal memos were released raising serious questions about the nature of the investigation that led to Flynn ’ s late 2017 guilty plea of lying to the FBI as his legal fees mounted .
OBAMA KNEW DETAILS OF FLYNN CASE , SHOCKING TOP DOJ OFFICIAL , DOCS SHOW
One of the documents was a top official 's handwritten memo debating whether the FBI 's `` goal '' was `` to get him to lie , so we can prosecute him or get him fired . '' Other materials showed efforts by anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok to pursue Flynn on increasingly flimsy legal grounds .
It would not be unprecedented for the government to successfully move to dismiss a case after securing a conviction . In fact , Sullivan himself tossed the conviction of former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens in 2009 , when it emerged the government had not produced a slew of exculpatory `` Brady '' material .
Powell has raised similar issues in the Flynn case . Fox News has chronicled numerous representations by the lead prosecutor in the Flynn case , Brandon Van Grack , concerning the government 's supposed compliance with `` Brady ' requirements -- representations that now appear to have been inaccurate , as a mountain of striking exculpatory evidence has emerged .
Van Grack withdrew from the case entirely two days after Fox News published the article on his apparent misrepresentations to the court .
Meanwhile , it has emerged that President Obama was aware of the details of Flynn 's intercepted December 2016 phone calls with Russia 's then-Ambassador Sergey Kislyak , surprising then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates in a White House meeting .
Obama 's unexpectedly intimate knowledge of the details of Flynn 's calls , which the FBI acknowledged at the time was not criminal or even improper , raised eyebrows because of his own history with Flynn — and because top FBI officials secretly discussed whether their goal was to `` get [ Flynn ] fired '' when they interviewed him in the White House on January 24 , 2017 , according to newly released documents .
Obama personally had warned the Trump administration against hiring Flynn , and made clear he was `` not a fan , '' according to multiple officials . Obama had fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 ; Obama cited insubordination , while Flynn asserted he was pushed out for his aggressive stance on combating lslamic extremism .
WHO IS JOE PIENTKA , MYSTERY FBI AGENT AT CENTER OF FLYNN AND CARTER PAGE CASES ? ... FBI SCRUBS HIM FROM WEBSITE
On January 5 , 2017 , Yates attended an Oval Office meeting with then-FBI Director James Comey , then-Vice President Joe Biden , then-CIA Director John Brennan and then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , according to the newly declassified documents , including an FD-302 FBI witness report . They were discussing Russian election interference , along with national security adviser Susan Rice and other members of the national security council .
`` It was at this meeting that Obama gave guidance to key officials who would be tasked with protecting his administration ’ s utilization of secretly funded Clinton campaign research , which alleged Trump was involved in a treasonous plot to collude with Russia , from being discovered or stopped by the incoming administration , '' Hemingway wrote .
After the briefing , Obama asked Yates and Comey to `` stay behind , '' and said he had `` learned of the information about Flynn '' and his conversation with Russia 's ambassador about sanctions . Obama `` specified that he did not want any additional information on the matter , but was seeking information on whether the White House should be treating Flynn any differently , given the information . ''
A previous memo from Rice stated that Biden also stayed behind after the main briefing had ended .
At that point , the documents showed , `` Yates had no idea what the president was talking about , but figured it out based on the conversation . Yates recalled Comey mentioning the Logan Act , but ca n't recall if he specified there was an 'investigation . ' Comey did not talk about prosecution in the meeting . ''
The exhibit continued : `` It was not clear to Yates from where the president first received the information . Yates did not recall Comey 's response to the president 's question about how to treat Flynn . She was so surprised by the information she was hearing that she was having a hard time processing it and listening to the conversation at the same time . ''
Yates , who was fired by the Trump administration after taking the extraordinary step of refusing to defend its travel ban executive order in court , later said she was concerned Flynn would be vulnerable to blackmail because of his interactions with Russia .
The Logan Act , an obscure statute , has never been used successfully in a criminal prosecution ; enacted in 1799 in an era before telephones , it was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the United States government abroad . In its motion to dismiss Flynn 's case on Thursday , the DOJ noted that the law was an unserious dead letter .
The Washington Post newsroom also struggled with the relevance of any potential issue with Flynn 's overseas calls , a bombshell transcript uncovered by the Twitter user Techno_Fog revealed this weekend -- before an op-ed columnist went ahead and published the `` red meat . ''
During the interview with FBI agents Strzok and Joe Pientka in the White House , Flynn said `` not really '' when asked if he had sought to convince Kislyak not to escalate a brewing fight with the U.S. over sanctions imposed by the Obama administration , according to a contested FD-302 witness report prepared by the FBI . Flynn also demurred when asked if he had asked Russia to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned Israel ’ s settlements in the West Bank , according to the FBI . The Obama administration abstained in that vote .
At various points , Flynn also suggested to Strzok and Pientka that such conversations might have happened or that he could not recall them if they did , according to the 302 . The 302 indicated that Flynn apparently was aware his communications had been monitored , and at several points he thanked the FBI agents for reminding him of some of his conversations with Russian officials .
Pientka was scrubbed from the FBI website after Fox News asked the bureau about him last December , and Republican lawmakers ( including Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , and GOP Reps. Jim Jordan and Mike Johnson ) are seeking to question him . The FBI told Fox News last year that reporting Pientka 's name was irresponsible and endangered his life for no journalistic purpose ; sources tell Fox News that Pientka still holds a senior post in the bureau 's San Francisco field office .
But , Fox News has previously determined that Pientka was also intimately involved in the probe of former Trump aide Carter Page , which the DOJ has since acknowledged was riddled with fundamental errors and premised on a discredited dossier that the bureau was told could be part of a Russian disinformation campaign .","D.C.

Saunders, Brian Mcnicoll, Aymenn Al-Tamimi, Jared Whitley","The benefits of building a wall on our southern border are so obvious and abundant that , in a sane political environment , there would be no debate about whether it should be done . Indeed , until Donald Trump made “ the wall ” a central component of his presidential platform , proposals for such an obstacle weren ’ t even controversial . As the President and others have pointed out , most Democrats supported the idea and have voted for legislation that included funding for the construction of some sort of physical barrier . Their policy pirouette on this common sense measure has thus led to some truly comical claims .
Most of the arguments against the wall are variations of the perennial claim that Democrats and their “ progressive ” supporters make against any proposal of which they don ’ t approve — it won ’ t work . Just as they claim that the free market somehow doesn ’ t work in health care ( thus the urgent need for a centrally controlled , government-run medical system ) , they insist that a wall on the southern border will produce none of the outcomes promised by Trump . By far the most hilarious contribution to this genre was made by rapper Talib Kweli Greene , who took to Twitter and offered wall supporters the following history lesson :
So , you ’ re unaware of the fact that nazi Germany had a wall called the Berlin Wall that was torn down in 1991 in order to foster humanity and diversity ? Walls didn ’ t work for Nazis so why build them here ? Build bridges not walls Nazi lover .
After excavating himself from the mountain of ridicule beneath which he was inevitably buried pursuant to this exercise in smug ignorance , Greene took down the Tweet . Fortunately , the Western Journal published a screen capture so posterity will not find itself bereft of this valuable source of mirth . But Greene is by no means the only advocate of the Berlin Wall analogy . Last June , the Los Angeles Times published a column by Carolina Miranda titled , “ What the dismantling of the Berlin Wall can teach us as Trump tries to build his wall. ” The obvious answer is “ absolutely nothing , ” yet she conjured a comparison :
This year , Feb. 5 marked the day that the wall had been gone as long as it had been up — 10,316 days … the deconstruction of the Berlin Wall and its attendant Cold War legacies highlights the construction of walls elsewhere — such as the “ big , fat , beautiful wall ” President Trump wants for the US-Mexico border .
Miranda isn ’ t quite illiterate enough to claim the Nazis built the Berlin Wall , but her analogy is just as absurd . That wall was built to keep people trapped in East Germany . It was erected by the leaders of that communist hellhole to halt the flow of its best educated and most productive citizens to the free market economy of democratically governed West Germany . The “ big , fat , beautiful wall ” the President wants to build along the southern border of the United States will be designed to stop uneducated and unskilled immigrants — many of whom are also infected with communicable diseases — from entering our country illegally .
Other dumb analogies compare the border wall to various ancient barriers like Hadrian ’ s Wall . CNN published a particularly moronic piece on this subject . “ The wall was finished in 128 AD , and 10 years later , Hadrian died.… Soon after the Roman ’ s power in the region started to decline , and in 410 AD the Roman rule ended. ” As it happens , Hadrian ’ s Wall was built for military purposes , and served its purpose ( slowing down sporadic incursions by the Picts ) well . Moreover , Roman withdrawal from Britain had nothing to do with the wall or “ declining power in the region. ” They left to fight the Germans who were invading Italy .
A slightly less stupid , but equally ineffective argument to which the anti-wall crowd has inevitably reverted involves the claim that a physical barrier will damage the environment and doom certain flora and fauna to extinction . A gaggle of environmentalist zealots sued the government based on the claim that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act , signed into law in 1996 by Bill Clinton to strengthen the nation ’ s immigration statutes , somehow violates the separation of powers established by the Constitution . If this seems a little thin to you , you are not alone . The Hill notes :
The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal from conservation and animal protection groups challenging the Trump administration ’ s power to bypass state and local environmental laws in building a border wall.… The justices did not provide any explanation for why they refused to hear the appeal .
Presumably , the justices didn ’ t want to dress down the plaintiffs for bugging them with frivolous litigation . But flippancy is a central feature of the anti-wall movement . This is obvious in the treatment the wall has received in the “ news ” media . The Washington Post , for example , ran a piece last January on what the wall would cost if one built it out of dollar bills . Meanwhile , Senate Democrats have made the absurd claim that it will cost $ 70 billion . If Trump ’ s puerile critics were serious people , they would produce a legitimate estimate and compare it to what illegal immigration is costing the taxpayer . Watchdog.org reports :
According to the most recent analysis by the Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) , one illegal immigrant living in America today costs U.S. citizen taxpayers about $ 8,075 . In total , illegal aliens cost American taxpayers $ 116 billion annually .
Predictably , the Democrats and the media dispute this , although they rarely produce credible alternate figures . But for those who prefer a more conservative number , the Heritage Foundation looked at this five years ago and came up with the following estimate :
These households impose a net fiscal burden ( benefits received minus taxes paid ) of around $ 54.5 billion per year . The fiscal cost of unlawful and low-skill immigrants will be increased in the future by government policies that increase the number of low-skill immigrants .
In other words , even using conservative estimates compiled five years ago , the funding Trump is asking for in the current budget is about 10 percent of the annual cost taxpayers incur to provide services to illegal immigrants . One hardly needs to consult a sophisticated financial analyst to see that the return on investment for the wall is huge even if the wall merely stops half of what the Democrats and the media refer to as undocumented citizens from crossing the border . But Schumer , Pelosi , et al . prefer a government “ shut down ” to what is obviously a good deal . If they weren ’ t crooks and demagogues , they would cough up the $ 5.7 billion .
So , Trump ’ s proposed border wall isn ’ t remotely analogous to anything done by the Nazis . And only someone illiterate concerning history would compare it to the Berlin Wall or Hadrian ’ s Wall . Likewise , it is impossible to make a legitimate environmental case against it , and anyone familiar with arithmetic can see that the cost of the wall will be dwarfed by the amount it will save the taxpayers . Nonetheless , these are just a few of the many absurd arguments made by the Democrats and the media against the wall . The true reason for their opposition is obvious , however . They need fraudulent votes from illegals to save their party .","The benefits of building a wall on our southern border are so obvious and abundant that, in a sane political environment, there would be no debate about whether it should be done. Indeed, until Donald Trump made “the wall” a central component of his presidential platform, proposals for such an obstacle weren’t even controversial.

Last June, the Los Angeles Times published a column by Carolina Miranda titled, “What the dismantling of the Berlin Wall can teach us as Trump tries to build his wall.” The obvious answer is “absolutely nothing,” yet she conjured a comparison:

This year, Feb. 5 marked the day that the wall had been gone as long as it had been up — 10,316 days … the deconstruction of the Berlin Wall and its attendant Cold War legacies highlights the construction of walls elsewhere — such as the “big, fat, beautiful wall” President Trump wants for the US-Mexico border.

Miranda isn’t quite illiterate enough to claim the Nazis built the Berlin Wall, but her analogy is just as absurd. That wall was built to keep people trapped in East Germany. It was erected by the leaders of that communist hellhole to halt the flow of its best educated and most productive citizens to the free market economy of democratically governed West Germany. The “big, fat, beautiful wall” the President wants to build along the southern border of the United States will be designed to stop uneducated and unskilled immigrants — many of whom are also infected with communicable diseases — from entering our country illegally.

Other dumb analogies compare the border wall to various ancient barriers like Hadrian’s Wall. CNN published a particularly moronic piece on this subject. “The wall was finished in 128 AD, and 10 years later, Hadrian died.… Soon after the Roman’s power in the region started to decline, and in 410 AD the Roman rule ended.” As it happens, Hadrian’s Wall was built for military purposes, and served its purpose (slowing down sporadic incursions by the Picts) well. Moreover, Roman withdrawal from Britain had nothing to do with the wall or “declining power in the region.” They left to fight the Germans who were invading Italy.

A slightly less stupid, but equally ineffective argument to which the anti-wall crowd has inevitably reverted involves the claim that a physical barrier will damage the environment and doom certain flora and fauna to extinction. A gaggle of environmentalist zealots sued the government based on the claim that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, signed into law in 1996 by Bill Clinton to strengthen the nation’s immigration statutes, somehow violates the separation of powers established by the Constitution. If this seems a little thin to you, you are not alone. The Hill notes:

The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal from conservation and animal protection groups challenging the Trump administration’s power to bypass state and local environmental laws in building a border wall.… The justices did not provide any explanation for why they refused to hear the appeal.

Presumably, the justices didn’t want to dress down the plaintiffs for bugging them with frivolous litigation. But flippancy is a central feature of the anti-wall movement. This is obvious in the treatment the wall has received in the “news” media. The Washington Post, for example, ran a piece last January on what the wall would cost if one built it out of dollar bills. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have made the absurd claim that it will cost $70 billion. If Trump’s puerile critics were serious people, they would produce a legitimate estimate and compare it to what illegal immigration is costing the taxpayer. Watchdog.org reports:

According to the most recent analysis by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), one illegal immigrant living in America today costs U.S. citizen taxpayers about $8,075. In total, illegal aliens cost American taxpayers $116 billion annually.

Predictably, the Democrats and the media dispute this, although they rarely produce credible alternate figures. But for those who prefer a more conservative number, the Heritage Foundation looked at this five years ago and came up with the following estimate:

These households impose a net fiscal burden (benefits received minus taxes paid) of around $54.5 billion per year. The fiscal cost of unlawful and low-skill immigrants will be increased in the future by government policies that increase the number of low-skill immigrants.

In other words, even using conservative estimates compiled five years ago, the funding Trump is asking for in the current budget is about 10 percent of the annual cost taxpayers incur to provide services to illegal immigrants. One hardly needs to consult a sophisticated financial analyst to see that the return on investment for the wall is huge even if the wall merely stops half of what the Democrats and the media refer to as undocumented citizens from crossing the border. But Schumer, Pelosi, et al. prefer a government “shut down” to what is obviously a good deal. If they weren’t crooks and demagogues, they would cough up the $5.7 billion.

So, Trump’s proposed border wall isn’t remotely analogous to anything done by the Nazis. And only someone illiterate concerning history would compare it to the Berlin Wall or Hadrian’s Wall. Likewise, it is impossible to make a legitimate environmental case against it, and anyone familiar with arithmetic can see that the cost of the wall will be dwarfed by the amount it will save the taxpayers. Nonetheless, these are just a few of the many absurd arguments made by the Democrats and the media against the wall. The true reason for their opposition is obvious, however. They need fraudulent votes from illegals to save their party.",www.spectator.org,right,MabUuWt1ZJhHBEbC

national_security,The Atlantic,0,https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/putin-american-democracy/610570/,RIP Democracy,,Franklin Foer,"Jack Cable sat down at the desk in his cramped dorm room to become an adult in the eyes of democracy . The rangy teenager , with neatly manicured brown hair and chunky glasses , had recently arrived at Stanford—his first semester of life away from home—and the 2018 midterm elections were less than two months away . Although he wasn ’ t one for covering his laptop with strident stickers or for taking loud stands , he felt a genuine thrill at the prospect of voting . But before he could cast an absentee ballot , he needed to register with the Board of Elections back home in Chicago . To hear more feature stories , get the Audm iPhone app . When Cable tried to complete the digital forms , an error message stared at him from his browser . Clicking back to his initial entry , he realized that he had accidentally typed an extraneous quotation mark into his home address . The fact that a single keystroke had short-circuited his registration filled Cable with a sense of dread .
Despite his youth , Cable already enjoyed a global reputation as a gifted hacker—or , as he is prone to clarify , an “ ethical hacker. ” As a sophomore in high school , he had started participating in “ bug bounties , ” contests in which companies such as Google and Uber publicly invite attacks on their digital infrastructure so that they can identify and patch vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them . Cable , who is preternaturally persistent , had a knack for finding these soft spots . He collected enough cash prizes from the bug bounties to cover the costs of four years at Stanford . Though it wouldn ’ t have given the average citizen a moment of pause , Cable recognized the error message on the Chicago Board of Elections website as a telltale sign of a gaping hole in its security . It suggested that the site was vulnerable to those with less beneficent intentions than his own , that they could read and perhaps even alter databases listing the names and addresses of voters in the country ’ s third-largest city . Despite his technical savvy , Cable was at a loss for how to alert the authorities . He began sending urgent warnings about the problem to every official email address he could find . Over the course of the next seven months , he tried to reach the city ’ s chief information officer , the Illinois governor ’ s office , and the Department of Homeland Security . As he waited for someone to take notice of his missives , Cable started to wonder whether the rest of America ’ s electoral infrastructure was as weak as Chicago ’ s . He read about how , in 2016 , when he was a junior in high school , Russian military intelligence—known by its initials , GRU—had hacked the Illinois State Board of Elections website , transferring the personal data of tens of thousands of voters to Moscow . The GRU had even tunneled into the computers of a small Florida company that sold software to election officials in eight states .
Out of curiosity , Cable checked to see what his home state had done to protect itself in the years since . Within 15 minutes of poking around the Board of Elections website , he discovered that its old weaknesses had not been fully repaired . These were the most basic lapses in cybersecurity—preventable with code learned in an introductory computer-science class—and they remained even though similar gaps had been identified by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security , not to mention widely reported in the media . The Russians could have strolled through the same door as they had in 2016 . From the January/February 2018 issue cover story : What Putin really wants Between classes , Cable began running tests on the rest of the national electoral infrastructure . He found that some states now had formidable defenses , but many others were like Illinois . If a teenager in a dorm room—even an exceptionally talented one—could find these vulnerabilities , they were not going to be missed by a disciplined unit of hackers that has spent years studying these networks , a unit with the resources of a powerful nation bent on discrediting an American election . # DemocracyRIP was both the hashtag and the plan . The Russians were expecting the election of Hillary Clinton—and preparing to immediately declare it a fraud . The embassy in Washington had attempted to persuade American officials to allow its functionaries to act as observers in polling places . A Twitter campaign alleging voting irregularities was queued . Russian diplomats were ready to publicly denounce the results as illegitimate . Events in 2016 , of course , veered in the other direction . Yet the hashtag is worth pausing over for a moment , because , though it was never put to its intended use , it remains an apt title for a mission that is still unfolding .
Russia ’ s interference in the last presidential election is among the most closely studied phenomena in recent American history , having been examined by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his prosecutors , by investigators working for congressional committees , by teams within Facebook and Twitter , by seemingly every think tank with access to a printing press . It ’ s possible , however , to mistake a plot point—the manipulation of the 2016 election—for the full sweep of the narrative . Events in the United States have unfolded more favorably than any operative in Moscow could have ever dreamed : Not only did Russia ’ s preferred candidate win , but he has spent his first term fulfilling the potential it saw in him , discrediting American institutions , rending the seams of American culture , and isolating a nation that had styled itself as indispensable to the free world . But instead of complacently enjoying its triumph , Russia almost immediately set about replicating it . Boosting the Trump campaign was a tactic ; # DemocracyRIP remains the larger objective . From the April 2020 issue : George Packer on how Trump is winning his war on American institutions In the week that followed Donald Trump ’ s election , Russia used its fake accounts on social media to organize a rally in New York City supporting the president-elect—and another rally in New York decrying him . Hackers continued attempting to break into state voting systems ; trolls continued to launch social-media campaigns intended to spark racial conflict . Through subsidiaries , the Russian government continued to funnel cash to viral-video channels with names like In the Now and ICYMI , which build audiences with ephemera ( “ Man Licks Store Shelves in Online Post ” ) , then hit unsuspecting readers with arguments about Syria and the CIA . This winter , the Russians even secured airtime for their overt propaganda outlet Sputnik on three radio stations in Kansas , bringing the network ’ s drive-time depictions of American hypocrisy to the heartland . Less than six months before Election Day , the government will attempt to identify democracy ’ s most glaring weakness by deploying college kids on their summer break . While the Russians continued their efforts to undermine American democracy , the United States belatedly began to devise a response . Across government—if not at the top of it—there was a panicked sense that American democracy required new layers of defense . Senators drafted legislation with grandiose titles ; bureaucrats unfurled the blueprints for new units and divisions ; law enforcement assigned bodies to dedicated task forces . Yet many of the warnings have gone unheeded , and what fortifications have been built appear inadequate .
Jack Cable is a small emblem of how the U.S. government has struggled to outpace the Russians . After he spent the better part of a semester shouting into the wind , officials in Chicago and in the governor ’ s office finally took notice of his warnings and repaired their websites . Cable may have a further role to play in defending America ’ s election infrastructure . He is part of a team of competitive hackers at Stanford—national champions three years running—that caught the attention of Alex Stamos , a former head of security at Facebook , who now teaches at the university . Earlier this year , Stamos asked the Department of Homeland Security if he could pull together a group of undergraduates , Cable included , to lend Washington a hand in the search for bugs . “ It ’ s talent , but unrefined talent , ” Stamos told me . DHS , which has an acute understanding of the problem at hand but limited resources to solve it , accepted Stamos ’ s offer . Less than six months before Election Day , the government will attempt to identify democracy ’ s most glaring weakness by deploying college kids on their summer break . Despite such well-intentioned efforts , the nation ’ s vulnerabilities have widened , not narrowed , during the past four years . Our politics are even more raw and fractured than in 2016 ; our faith in government—and , perhaps , democracy itself—is further strained . The coronavirus may meaningfully exacerbate these problems ; at a minimum , the pandemic is leeching attention and resources from election defense . The president , meanwhile , has dismissed Russian interference as a hoax and fired or threatened intelligence officials who have contradicted that narrative , all while professing his affinity for the very man who ordered this assault on American democracy . Fiona Hill , the scholar who served as the top Russia expert on Trump ’ s National Security Council , told me , “ The fact that they faced so little consequence for their action gives them little reason to stop . ”
The Russians have learned much about American weaknesses , and how to exploit them . Having probed state voting systems far more extensively than is generally understood by the public , they are now surely more capable of mayhem on Election Day—and possibly without leaving a detectable trace of their handiwork . Having hacked into the inboxes of political operatives in the U.S. and abroad , they ’ ve pioneered new techniques for infiltrating campaigns and disseminating their stolen goods . Even as to disinformation , the best-known and perhaps most overrated of their tactics , they have innovated , finding new ways to manipulate Americans and to poison the nation ’ s politics . Russia ’ s interference in 2016 might be remembered as the experimental prelude that foreshadowed the attack of 2020 .
1 . Hack the Vote When officials arrived at work on the morning of May 22 , 2014 , three days before a presidential election , they discovered that their hard drives were fried . Hours earlier , pro-Kremlin hackers had taken a digital sledgehammer to a vital piece of Ukraine ’ s democratic infrastructure , the network that collects vote tallies from across the nation . After finishing the task , they taunted their victim , posting photos of an election commissioner ’ s renovated bathroom and his wife ’ s passport .
Relying on a backup system , the Ukrainians were able to resuscitate their network . But on election night the attacks persisted . Hackers sent Russian journalists a link to a chart they had implanted on the official website of Ukraine ’ s Central Election Commission . The graphic purported to show that a right-wing nationalist had sprinted to the lead in the presidential race . Although the public couldn ’ t access the chart , Russian state television flashed the forged results on its highly watched newscast . If the attack on Ukraine represented something like all-out digital war , Russia ’ s hacking of the United States ’ electoral system two years later was more like a burglar going house to house jangling doorknobs . The Russians had the capacity to cause far greater damage than they did—at the very least to render Election Day a chaotic mess—but didn ’ t act on it , because they deemed such an operation either unnecessary or not worth the cost . The U.S. intelligence community has admitted that it ’ s not entirely sure why Russia sat on its hands . One theory holds that Barack Obama forced Russian restraint when he pulled Vladimir Putin aside at the end of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou , China , on September 5 , 2016 . With only interpreters present , Obama delivered a carefully worded admonition not to mess with the integrity of the election . By design , he didn ’ t elaborate any specific consequence for ignoring his warning .
From the March 2017 issue : Franklin Foer on how Vladimir Putin became the hero of nationalists everywhere Perhaps the warning was heeded . The GRU kept on probing voting systems through the month of October , however , and there are other , more ominous explanations for Russia ’ s apparent restraint . Michael Daniel , who served as the cybersecurity coordinator on Obama ’ s National Security Council , told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Russians were , in essence , casing the joint . They were gathering intelligence about the digital networks that undergird American elections and putting together a map so that they “ could come back later and actually execute an operation. ” What sort of operation could Russia execute in 2020 ? Unlike Ukraine , the United States doesn ’ t have a central node that , if struck , could disable democracy at its core . Instead , the United States has an array of smaller but still alluring targets : the vendors , niche companies , that sell voting equipment to states and localities ; the employees of those governments , each with passwords that can be stolen ; voting machines that connect to the internet to transmit election results .

Trump ’ s Call for Russian Hacking Makes Even Less Sense After Mueller Matt Masterson is a senior adviser at the Department of Homeland Security ’ s freshly minted Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , a bureau assigned to help states protect elections from outside attack ; it ’ s where Jack Cable will work this summer . I asked Masterson to describe the scenarios that keep him up at night . His greatest fear is that an election official might inadvertently enable a piece of ransomware . These are malicious bits of code that encrypt data and files , essentially placing a lock on a system ; money is then demanded in exchange for the key . In 2017 , Ukraine was targeted again , this time with a similar piece of malware called NotPetya . But instead of extorting Ukraine , Russia sought to cripple it . NotPetya wiped 10 percent of the nation ’ s computers ; it disabled ATMs , telephone networks , and banks . ( The United States is well aware of NotPetya ’ s potency , because it relied on a tool created by—and stolen from—the National Security Agency . ) If the Russians attached such a bug to a voter-registration database , they could render an entire election logistically unfeasible ; tracking who had voted and where they ’ d voted would be impossible .
But Russia need not risk such a devastating attack . It can simply meddle with voter-registration databases , which are filled with vulnerabilities similar to the ones that Cable exposed . Such meddling could stop short of purging voters from the rolls and still cause significant disruptions : Hackers could flip the digits in addresses , so that voters ’ photo IDs no longer match the official records . When people arrived at the polls , they would likely still be able to vote , but might be forced to cast provisional ballots . The confusion and additional paperwork would generate long lines and stoke suspicion about the underlying integrity of the election . Given the fragility of American democracy , even the tiniest interference , or hint of interference , could undermine faith in the tally of the vote . On Election Night , the Russians could place a page on the Wisconsin Elections Commission website that falsely showed Trump with a sizable lead . Government officials would be forced to declare it a hoax . Imagine how Twitter demagogues , the president among them , would exploit the ensuing confusion . Such scenarios ought to have sparked a clamor for systemic reform . But in the past , when the federal government has pointed out these vulnerabilities—and attempted to protect against them—the states have chafed and moaned . In August 2016 , President Obama ’ s homeland-security secretary , Jeh Johnson , held a conference call with state election officials and informed them of the need to safeguard their infrastructure . Instead of accepting his offer of help , they told him , “ This is our responsibility and there should not be a federal takeover of the election system . ”
After the 2016 election , the federal government could have taken a stronger hand with localities . Unprecedented acts of foreign interference presumably would have provided quite a bit of leverage . That did not happen . The president perceives any suggestion of Russian interference as the diminution of his own legitimacy . This has contributed to a conspiracy of silence about the events of 2016 . A year after the election , the Department of Homeland Security told 21 states that Russia had attempted to hack their electoral systems . Two years later , a Senate report publicly disclosed that Russia had , in fact , targeted all 50 states . When then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tried to raise the subject of electoral security with the president , acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney reportedly told her to steer clear of it . According to The New York Times , Mulvaney said it “ wasn ’ t a great subject and should be kept below his level. ” From the April 2019 issue : William J. Burns on how the U.S.-Russian relationship went bad This atmosphere stifled what could have been a genuinely bipartisan accomplishment . The subject of voting divides Republicans and Democrats . Especially since the Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 , the parties have stitched voting into their master narratives . Democrats accuse Republicans of suppressing the vote ; Republicans accuse Democrats of flooding the polls with corpses and other cheating schemes . Despite this rancor , both sides seemed to agree that Russian hacking of voting systems was not a good thing . After the 2016 election , Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar , from Minnesota , partnered with Republican Senator James Lankford , from Oklahoma , on the Secure Elections Act . The bill would have given the states money to replace electronic voting machines with ones that leave a paper trail and would have required states to audit election results to confirm their accuracy . The reforms would also have had the seemingly salutary effect of making it easier for voters to cast ballots .
The Secure Elections Act wouldn ’ t have provided perfect insulation from Russian attacks , but it would have been a meaningful improvement on the status quo , and it briefly looked as if it could pass . Then , on the eve of a session to mark up the legislation—a moment for lawmakers to add their final touches—Senate Republicans suddenly withdrew their support , effectively killing the bill . Afterward , Democrats mocked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as “ Moscow Mitch , ” an appellation that stung enough that the senator ultimately agreed to legislation that supplied the states with hundreds of millions of dollars to buy new voting systems—but without any security demands placed on the states or any meaningful reforms to a broken system . McConnell made it clear that he despised the whole idea of a legislative fix to the electoral-security problem : “ I ’ m not going to let Democrats and their water carriers in the media use Russia ’ s attack on our democracy as a Trojan horse for partisan wish-list items that would not actually make our elections any safer. ” For McConnell , suppressing votes was a higher priority than protecting them from a foreign adversary . 2 . The Big Phish To raise the subject of John Podesta ’ s email in his presence is a callous act . But I wanted his help tabulating a more precise toll of Russian hacking—how it leaves a messy trail of hurt feelings , saps precious mental space , and reshapes the course of a campaign . After repeatedly prodding him for an interview , I finally met with Hillary Clinton ’ s old campaign chief in his Washington office , which stares down onto the steeple of the church Abraham Lincoln attended during the Civil War . Dressed in a plaid shirt , with a ballpoint pen clipped into the pocket , Podesta rocked back and forth in a swivel chair as he allowed me to question him about one of the most wince-inducing moments in recent political history .
Months before WikiLeaks began publishing his emails , Podesta had an inkling that his Gmail account had been compromised . Internal campaign documents had appeared on an obscure website , and he considered the possibility that they had been lifted from his computer . Still , the call from a member of the campaign ’ s communications team on October 7 , 2016 , left him gobsmacked . As he finished a session of debate preparation with Clinton , he learned that Julian Assange intended to unfurl the contents of his inbox over the remaining month of the campaign . It ’ s a familiar if much-ignored maxim in politics that no email should ever contain content one wouldn ’ t want to see on the front page of The New York Times . This was now Podesta ’ s reality . On the 10th floor of the Clinton campaign ’ s headquarters , in Brooklyn , a team of 14 staffers quickly assembled . They covered a glass door in opaque paper to prevent voyeurs from observing their work and began to pore over every word of his 60,000 emails—every forwarded PDF , every gripe from an employee , even the meticulous steps of his risotto recipe . The project would consume the entirety of the month . Every day , Podesta set aside time to meet with emissaries from the 10th floor and review their findings . “ I willed myself not to feel pain , ” he told me .
The material that WikiLeaks eventually posted created some awkward moments . Podesta had received snarky emails from colleagues , and had sent a few himself . To repair relationships , Podesta found himself apologizing to co-workers , friends , former Cabinet secretaries . Even when the contents of the leaked messages seemed innocuous , new annoyances would arise . WikiLeaks hadn ’ t redacted the correspondence to protect privacy , leaving the cellphone numbers of campaign staffers for the world to view . In the middle of meetings , staffers would find their devices vibrating incessantly ; strangers would fill their voicemails with messages like I hope you ’ re raped in prison . Identity thieves quickly circled Podesta , attempting to claim his Social Security benefits and applying for credit cards in his name . Despite a political career that has permitted him to whisper into the ears of presidents , the legendarily frugal Podesta had commuted to New York on Vamoose , a discount bus line . A fraudster exploited the hack to steal the points he had accumulated in the Vamoose rewards program .
As Podesta revisited these painful moments , he claimed that he ’ d stoically persisted in their face : “ I kept going on television . I kept raising money . I kept traveling with Hillary and President Clinton . I kept doing everything that I had been doing. ” But these were the closing weeks of an election that would turn on fewer than 80,000 votes spread across three states . For a campaign that arguably didn ’ t invest its resources properly in the final stretch , the question must be asked : How badly did the Russians throw the campaign off its game ? The least visible damage of the hack might have been the most decisive . In the years since the Podesta hack , Microsoft ’ s Tom Burt has continually battled its perpetrators . As the man charged with safeguarding the security of Windows , Word , and his company ’ s other software , he has developed a feel for the GRU ’ s rhythms and habits . Through Microsoft ’ s work with political parties and campaigns around the world—the company offers them training and sells them security software at a discount—Burt has accumulated lengthy dossiers on past actions . What he ’ s noticed is that attacks tend to begin on the furthest fringes of a campaign . A standard GRU operation starts with think-tank fellows , academics , and political consultants . These people and institutions typically have weak cybersecurity fortifications , the penetration of which serves dual purposes . As the GRU pores through the inboxes of wonks and professors , it gathers useful intelligence about a campaign . But the hacked accounts also provide platforms for a more direct assault . Once inside , the GRU will send messages from the hacked accounts . The emails come from a trusted source , and carry a plausible message . According to Burt , “ It will say something like ‘ Saw this great article on the West Bank that you should review , ’ and it ’ s got a link to a PDF . You click on it , and now your campaign network is infected. ” ( Although Burt won ’ t discuss specific institutions , he wrote a blog post last year describing attacks on the German Marshall Fund and the European offices of the Aspen Institute . )
Podesta fell victim to a generic spear-phishing attack : a spoofed security warning urging him to change his Gmail password . Many of us might like to think we ’ re sophisticated enough to avoid such a trap , but the Russians have grown adept at tailoring bespoke messages that could ensnare even the most vigilant target . Emails arrive from a phony address that looks as if it belongs to a friend or colleague , but has one letter omitted . One investigator told me that he ’ s noticed that Russians use details gleaned from Facebook to script tantalizing messages . If a campaign consultant has told his circle of friends about an upcoming bass-fishing trip , the GRU will package its malware in an email offering discounts on bass-fishing gear . Many of these techniques are borrowed from Russian cybercrime syndicates , which hack their way into banks and traffic in stolen credit cards . Burt has seen these illicit organizations using technologies that he believes will soon be imported to politics . For instance , new synthetic-audio software allows hackers to mimic a voice with convincing verisimilitude . Burt told me , “ In the cybercrime world , you ’ re starting to see audio phishes , where somebody gets a voicemail message from their boss , for example , saying , ‘ Hey , I need you to transfer this money to the following account right away. ’ It sounds just like your boss and so you do it. ” What the Russians can ’ t obtain from afar , they will attempt to pilfer with agents on the ground . The same GRU unit that hacked Podesta has allegedly sent operatives to Rio de Janeiro , Kuala Lumpur , and The Hague to practice what is known as “ close-access hacking. ” Once on the ground , they use off-the-shelf electronic equipment to pry open the Wi-Fi network of whomever they ’ re spying on .
The Russians , in other words , take risks few other nations would dare . They are willing to go to such lengths because they ’ ve reaped such rich rewards from hacking . Of all the Russian tactics deployed in 2016 , the hacking and leaking of documents did the most immediate and palpable damage—distracting attention from the Access Hollywood tape , and fueling theories that the Democratic Party had rigged its process to squash Bernie Sanders ’ s campaign . In 2020 , the damage could be greater still . Podesta told me that when he realized his email had been breached , he feared that the hackers would manufacture embarrassing or even incriminating emails and then publish them alongside the real ones . It ’ s impossible to know their reasoning , but Russian hackers made what would prove to be a clever decision not to alter Podesta ’ s email . Many media outlets accepted whatever emails WikiLeaks published without pausing to verify every detail , and they weren ’ t punished for their haste . The Podesta leaks thus established a precedent , an expectation that hacked material is authentic—perhaps the most authentic version of reality available , an opportunity to see past a campaign ’ s messaging and spin and read its innermost thoughts . In fact , the Russians have no scruples about altering documents . In 2017 , hackers with links to the GRU breached the inboxes of French President Emmanuel Macron ’ s campaign staffers . The contents were rather banal , filled with restaurant reservations and trivial memos . Two days before these were released , other documents surfaced on internet message boards . Unlike the emails , these were pure fabrications , which purported to show that Macron had used a tax haven in the Cayman Islands . The timing of their release , however , gave them credibility . It was natural to assume that they had been harvested from the email hack , too . The Macron leaks suggested a dangerous new technique , a sinister mixing of the hacked and the fabricated intended to exploit the electorate ’ s hunger for raw evidence and faith in purloined documents .
3 . Disinformation 2.0 In the spring of 2015 , trolls in St. Petersburg peered at the feed of a webcam that had been furtively placed in New York City . Sitting in front of a computer screen on the second floor of a squat concrete office building , the trolls waited to see if they could influence the behavior of Americans from the comfort of Russian soil . The men worked for a company bankrolled by Yevgeny Prigozhin , a bald-headed hot-dog vendor turned restaurateur , known to the Russian press as “ Putin ’ s chef. ” In the kleptocratic system that is the Russian economy , men like Prigozhin profit from their connections to Putin and maintain their inner-circle status by performing missions on his behalf . The operation in St. Petersburg was run by the Internet Research Agency , a troll farm serving the interests of the Kremlin . ( Prigozhin has denied any involvement with the IRA . ) The IRA is an heir to a proud Russian tradition . In the Soviet Union ’ s earliest days , the state came to believe that it could tip the world toward revolution through psychological warfare and deception , exploiting the divisions and weaknesses of bourgeois society . When it was assigned this task , the KGB referred to its program by the bureaucratic yet ominous name Active Measures . It pursued this work with artistic verve . It forged letters from the Ku Klux Klan that threatened to murder African athletes at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles . It fomented conspiracies about the CIA—that the agency had orchestrated the spread of the AIDS virus in a laboratory and plotted the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . Some of these KGB schemes were harebrained . But as one defector to the West put it , more Americans believed the Soviet version of JFK ’ s murder than the Warren Report .
The IRA has updated the principles of Active Measures for the digital age . On social media , disinformation can flourish like never before . Whereas the KGB once needed to find journalistic vehicles to plant their stories—usually the small-audience fringes of the radical press—Facebook and Twitter hardly distinguished between mainstream outlets and clickbait upstarts . And many of the new platforms were designed to manipulate users , to keep them engaged for as long as possible . Their algorithms elevated content that fueled panic and anger . With the New York webcam , the IRA was testing a hunch : that , through the miracle of social media , it could now toy with Americans as if they were marionettes . As the political scientist Thomas Rid recounts in his powerful new history , Active Measures , a post on Facebook promised that free hot dogs would be available to anyone who arrived on a specific corner at a prescribed time . Back in St. Petersburg , IRA employees watched as New Yorkers arrived , looked at their phones in frustration , and skulked away . The ruse was innocuous , but it proved a theory that could be put to far more nefarious ends : Social media had made it possible , at shockingly low cost , for Russians to steer the emotions and even movements of Americans . No study has quantified how many votes have been swayed by the 10 million tweets that the IRA has pumped into the digital world ; no metric captures how its posts on Facebook and Instagram altered America ’ s emotional valence as it headed to the polls in 2016 . In the end , the IRA ’ s menagerie of false personas and fusillades of splenetic memes were arguably more effective at garnering sensationalistic headlines than shifting public opinion . For their part , the IRA ’ s minions immodestly credited themselves with having tilted the trajectory of history . The U.S. government obtained an email from an IRA employee describing the scene at the St. Petersburg office on Election Night : “ When around 8 a.m. the most important result of our work arrived , we uncorked a tiny bottle of champagne … took one gulp each and looked into each other ’ s eyes … We uttered almost in unison : ‘ We made America great . ’ ”
Having run a noisy operation in 2016 , the IRA has since learned to modulate itself . Its previous handiwork , much of which was riddled with poor syntax and grammatical errors , hardly required a discerning eye to identify . These days , the IRA takes care to avoid such sloppiness . Now , when they want to , IRA trolls can make themselves inconspicuous . The social-media companies no longer treat Russian trolls like harmless interlopers and have proved capable of aggressive policing . But thwarting the last line of attack is easier than preventing new ones . Relying on this quieter approach , the IRA has carried the theory of its hot-dog experiment into American political life . When white supremacists applied for a permit to hold a march in 2018 to commemorate the first anniversary of their protests in Charlottesville , Virginia , a Facebook group organized a counterprotest in Washington , D.C . The group was called the Resisters . Its administrators , who went by the names Mary and Natasha , recruited a coterie of enthusiastic organizers to promote the rally . When Facebook took down the Resisters ’ page—noting its ties to IRA accounts , and implying that Mary and Natasha were fictitious creations—American leftists were shocked to learn that they had apparently been hatching plans with foreign trolls . According to The New York Times , they were also furious with Facebook : Whether or not the page was a Russian ploy , it had become a venue for real Americans to air their real grievances . In fact , it was hard to pinpoint where the Active Measures ended and the genuine action began—the sort of tradecraft that the KGB would have admired .
Although the IRA might practice stealth when the operation demands , in other circumstances it will deploy raw bluster . Starting in 2017 , it launched a sustained effort to exaggerate the specter of its interference , a tactic that social-media companies call “ perception hacking. ” Its trolls were instructed to post about the Mueller report and fan the flames of public anger over the blatant interference it revealed . On the day of the 2018 midterm elections , a group claiming to be the IRA published a grandiloquent manifesto on its website that declared : “ Soon after November 6 , you will realize that your vote means nothing . We decide who you vote for and what candidates will win or lose . Whether you vote or not , there is no difference as we control the voting and counting systems . Remember , your vote has zero value . We are choosing for you. ” The claim was absurd , but the posturing had a purpose . If enough Americans come to believe that Russia can do whatever it wants to our democratic processes without consequence , that , too , increases cynicism about American democracy , and thereby serves Russian ends . As Laura Rosenberger , a former National Security Council staffer under Obama who runs the Alliance for Securing Democracy , put it , “ They would like us to see a Russian under every bed. ” Judging by this year ’ s presidential-primary campaign , they have been successful in this effort . When the Iowa Democratic Party struggled to implement new technology used to tally results for the state ’ s caucus , television panelists , Twitter pundits , and even a member of Congress speculated about the possibility of hacking , despite a lack of evidence to justify such loose talk . American incompetence had been confused for a plot against America .
4 . An Uncoordinated Response As the outlines of the IRA ’ s efforts began to emerge in the months following the 2016 election , Facebook at first refused to acknowledge the problem . The company ’ s defensiveness called attention to its laissez-faire attitude toward the content that it elevated in people ’ s News Feeds . Facebook found itself flayed by congressional committees , its inner workings exposed by investigative journalists . Ostensibly it had been Alex Stamos ’ s job to prevent the last attack , and now he faced another wave of disinformation , with midterm elections fast approaching . Stamos worried that , in the absence of an orchestrated defense , his company , as well as the nation , would repeat the mistakes of 2016 . In the spring of 2018 , he invited executives from the big tech companies and leaders of intelligence agencies to Facebook ’ s headquarters in Menlo Park , California . As he thought about it , Stamos was surprised that such a summit hadn ’ t been organized sooner . What shocked him more was a realization he had as the meeting convened : Few of these people even knew one another . “ People who ran different agencies working on foreign interference met for the first time at Menlo Park , even though they were 10 Metro stops away in D.C. , ” he told me . “ The normal collaborative process in government didn ’ t exist on this issue. ” Stamos ’ s summit succeeded in spurring cooperation . Prior to the meeting , one tech company would identify and disable Russian accounts but fail to warn its competitors , allowing the same trolls to continue operating with impunity . Over the course of 2018 , the tech industry gradually began acting in concert . The lead investigators on the threat-intelligence teams at 30 companies—including Facebook , Verizon , and Reddit—joined a common channel on Slack , the messaging platform . When one company spies a nascent operation , it can now ring a bell for the others . This winter , Facebook and Twitter jointly shut down dozens of accounts associated with a single residential address in Accra , Ghana , where the Russians had set up a troll factory and hired local 20-somethings to impersonate African Americans and stoke online anger .","

Jack Cable sat down at the desk in his cramped dorm room to become an adult in the eyes of democracy. The rangy teenager, with neatly manicured brown hair and chunky glasses, had recently arrived at Stanford—his first semester of life away from home—and the 2018 midterm elections were less than two months away. Although he wasn’t one for covering his laptop with strident stickers or for taking loud stands, he felt a genuine thrill at the prospect of voting. But before he could cast an absentee ballot, he needed to register with the Board of Elections back home in Chicago. To hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. When Cable tried to complete the digital forms, an error message stared at him from his browser. Clicking back to his initial entry, he realized that he had accidentally typed an extraneous quotation mark into his home address. The fact that a single keystroke had short-circuited his registration filled Cable with a sense of dread.

Despite his youth, Cable already enjoyed a global reputation as a gifted hacker—or, as he is prone to clarify, an “ethical hacker.” As a sophomore in high school, he had started participating in “bug bounties,” contests in which companies such as Google and Uber publicly invite attacks on their digital infrastructure so that they can identify and patch vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Cable, who is preternaturally persistent, had a knack for finding these soft spots. He collected enough cash prizes from the bug bounties to cover the costs of four years at Stanford. Though it wouldn’t have given the average citizen a moment of pause, Cable recognized the error message on the Chicago Board of Elections website as a telltale sign of a gaping hole in its security. It suggested that the site was vulnerable to those with less beneficent intentions than his own, that they could read and perhaps even alter databases listing the names and addresses of voters in the country’s third-largest city. Despite his technical savvy, Cable was at a loss for how to alert the authorities. He began sending urgent warnings about the problem to every official email address he could find. Over the course of the next seven months, he tried to reach the city’s chief information officer, the Illinois governor’s office, and the Department of Homeland Security. As he waited for someone to take notice of his missives, Cable started to wonder whether the rest of America’s electoral infrastructure was as weak as Chicago’s. He read about how, in 2016, when he was a junior in high school, Russian military intelligence—known by its initials, GRU—had hacked the Illinois State Board of Elections website, transferring the personal data of tens of thousands of voters to Moscow. The GRU had even tunneled into the computers of a small Florida company that sold software to election officials in eight states.

Out of curiosity, Cable checked to see what his home state had done to protect itself in the years since. Within 15 minutes of poking around the Board of Elections website, he discovered that its old weaknesses had not been fully repaired. These were the most basic lapses in cybersecurity—preventable with code learned in an introductory computer-science class—and they remained even though similar gaps had been identified by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, not to mention widely reported in the media. The Russians could have strolled through the same door as they had in 2016. From the January/February 2018 issue cover story: What Putin really wants Between classes, Cable began running tests on the rest of the national electoral infrastructure. He found that some states now had formidable defenses, but many others were like Illinois. If a teenager in a dorm room—even an exceptionally talented one—could find these vulnerabilities, they were not going to be missed by a disciplined unit of hackers that has spent years studying these networks, a unit with the resources of a powerful nation bent on discrediting an American election. #DemocracyRIP was both the hashtag and the plan. The Russians were expecting the election of Hillary Clinton—and preparing to immediately declare it a fraud. The embassy in Washington had attempted to persuade American officials to allow its functionaries to act as observers in polling places. A Twitter campaign alleging voting irregularities was queued. Russian diplomats were ready to publicly denounce the results as illegitimate. Events in 2016, of course, veered in the other direction. Yet the hashtag is worth pausing over for a moment, because, though it was never put to its intended use, it remains an apt title for a mission that is still unfolding.

Russia’s interference in the last presidential election is among the most closely studied phenomena in recent American history, having been examined by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his prosecutors, by investigators working for congressional committees, by teams within Facebook and Twitter, by seemingly every think tank with access to a printing press. It’s possible, however, to mistake a plot point—the manipulation of the 2016 election—for the full sweep of the narrative. Events in the United States have unfolded more favorably than any operative in Moscow could have ever dreamed: Not only did Russia’s preferred candidate win, but he has spent his first term fulfilling the potential it saw in him, discrediting American institutions, rending the seams of American culture, and isolating a nation that had styled itself as indispensable to the free world. But instead of complacently enjoying its triumph, Russia almost immediately set about replicating it. Boosting the Trump campaign was a tactic; #DemocracyRIP remains the larger objective. From the April 2020 issue: George Packer on how Trump is winning his war on American institutions In the week that followed Donald Trump’s election, Russia used its fake accounts on social media to organize a rally in New York City supporting the president-elect—and another rally in New York decrying him. Hackers continued attempting to break into state voting systems; trolls continued to launch social-media campaigns intended to spark racial conflict. Through subsidiaries, the Russian government continued to funnel cash to viral-video channels with names like In the Now and ICYMI, which build audiences with ephemera (“Man Licks Store Shelves in Online Post”), then hit unsuspecting readers with arguments about Syria and the CIA. This winter, the Russians even secured airtime for their overt propaganda outlet Sputnik on three radio stations in Kansas, bringing the network’s drive-time depictions of American hypocrisy to the heartland. Less than six months before Election Day, the government will attempt to identify democracy’s most glaring weakness by deploying college kids on their summer break. While the Russians continued their efforts to undermine American democracy, the United States belatedly began to devise a response. Across government—if not at the top of it—there was a panicked sense that American democracy required new layers of defense. Senators drafted legislation with grandiose titles; bureaucrats unfurled the blueprints for new units and divisions; law enforcement assigned bodies to dedicated task forces. Yet many of the warnings have gone unheeded, and what fortifications have been built appear inadequate.

Jack Cable is a small emblem of how the U.S. government has struggled to outpace the Russians. After he spent the better part of a semester shouting into the wind, officials in Chicago and in the governor’s office finally took notice of his warnings and repaired their websites. Cable may have a further role to play in defending America’s election infrastructure. He is part of a team of competitive hackers at Stanford—national champions three years running—that caught the attention of Alex Stamos, a former head of security at Facebook, who now teaches at the university. Earlier this year, Stamos asked the Department of Homeland Security if he could pull together a group of undergraduates, Cable included, to lend Washington a hand in the search for bugs. “It’s talent, but unrefined talent,” Stamos told me. DHS, which has an acute understanding of the problem at hand but limited resources to solve it, accepted Stamos’s offer. Less than six months before Election Day, the government will attempt to identify democracy’s most glaring weakness by deploying college kids on their summer break. Despite such well-intentioned efforts, the nation’s vulnerabilities have widened, not narrowed, during the past four years. Our politics are even more raw and fractured than in 2016; our faith in government—and, perhaps, democracy itself—is further strained. The coronavirus may meaningfully exacerbate these problems; at a minimum, the pandemic is leeching attention and resources from election defense. The president, meanwhile, has dismissed Russian interference as a hoax and fired or threatened intelligence officials who have contradicted that narrative, all while professing his affinity for the very man who ordered this assault on American democracy. Fiona Hill, the scholar who served as the top Russia expert on Trump’s National Security Council, told me, “The fact that they faced so little consequence for their action gives them little reason to stop.”

The Russians have learned much about American weaknesses, and how to exploit them. Having probed state voting systems far more extensively than is generally understood by the public, they are now surely more capable of mayhem on Election Day—and possibly without leaving a detectable trace of their handiwork. Having hacked into the inboxes of political operatives in the U.S. and abroad, they’ve pioneered new techniques for infiltrating campaigns and disseminating their stolen goods. Even as to disinformation, the best-known and perhaps most overrated of their tactics, they have innovated, finding new ways to manipulate Americans and to poison the nation’s politics. Russia’s interference in 2016 might be remembered as the experimental prelude that foreshadowed the attack of 2020.

1. Hack the Vote When officials arrived at work on the morning of May 22, 2014, three days before a presidential election, they discovered that their hard drives were fried. Hours earlier, pro-Kremlin hackers had taken a digital sledgehammer to a vital piece of Ukraine’s democratic infrastructure, the network that collects vote tallies from across the nation. After finishing the task, they taunted their victim, posting photos of an election commissioner’s renovated bathroom and his wife’s passport.

Relying on a backup system, the Ukrainians were able to resuscitate their network. But on election night the attacks persisted. Hackers sent Russian journalists a link to a chart they had implanted on the official website of Ukraine’s Central Election Commission. The graphic purported to show that a right-wing nationalist had sprinted to the lead in the presidential race. Although the public couldn’t access the chart, Russian state television flashed the forged results on its highly watched newscast. If the attack on Ukraine represented something like all-out digital war, Russia’s hacking of the United States’ electoral system two years later was more like a burglar going house to house jangling doorknobs. The Russians had the capacity to cause far greater damage than they did—at the very least to render Election Day a chaotic mess—but didn’t act on it, because they deemed such an operation either unnecessary or not worth the cost. The U.S. intelligence community has admitted that it’s not entirely sure why Russia sat on its hands. One theory holds that Barack Obama forced Russian restraint when he pulled Vladimir Putin aside at the end of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China, on September 5, 2016. With only interpreters present, Obama delivered a carefully worded admonition not to mess with the integrity of the election. By design, he didn’t elaborate any specific consequence for ignoring his warning.

From the March 2017 issue: Franklin Foer on how Vladimir Putin became the hero of nationalists everywhere Perhaps the warning was heeded. The GRU kept on probing voting systems through the month of October, however, and there are other, more ominous explanations for Russia’s apparent restraint. Michael Daniel, who served as the cybersecurity coordinator on Obama’s National Security Council, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Russians were, in essence, casing the joint. They were gathering intelligence about the digital networks that undergird American elections and putting together a map so that they “could come back later and actually execute an operation.” What sort of operation could Russia execute in 2020? Unlike Ukraine, the United States doesn’t have a central node that, if struck, could disable democracy at its core. Instead, the United States has an array of smaller but still alluring targets: the vendors, niche companies, that sell voting equipment to states and localities; the employees of those governments, each with passwords that can be stolen; voting machines that connect to the internet to transmit election results.

The Collusion With Russia Is in Plain Sight

Trump’s Call for Russian Hacking Makes Even Less Sense After Mueller Matt Masterson is a senior adviser at the Department of Homeland Security’s freshly minted Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a bureau assigned to help states protect elections from outside attack; it’s where Jack Cable will work this summer. I asked Masterson to describe the scenarios that keep him up at night. His greatest fear is that an election official might inadvertently enable a piece of ransomware. These are malicious bits of code that encrypt data and files, essentially placing a lock on a system; money is then demanded in exchange for the key. In 2017, Ukraine was targeted again, this time with a similar piece of malware called NotPetya. But instead of extorting Ukraine, Russia sought to cripple it. NotPetya wiped 10 percent of the nation’s computers; it disabled ATMs, telephone networks, and banks. (The United States is well aware of NotPetya’s potency, because it relied on a tool created by—and stolen from—the National Security Agency.) If the Russians attached such a bug to a voter-registration database, they could render an entire election logistically unfeasible; tracking who had voted and where they’d voted would be impossible.

But Russia need not risk such a devastating attack. It can simply meddle with voter-registration databases, which are filled with vulnerabilities similar to the ones that Cable exposed. Such meddling could stop short of purging voters from the rolls and still cause significant disruptions: Hackers could flip the digits in addresses, so that voters’ photo IDs no longer match the official records. When people arrived at the polls, they would likely still be able to vote, but might be forced to cast provisional ballots. The confusion and additional paperwork would generate long lines and stoke suspicion about the underlying integrity of the election. Given the fragility of American democracy, even the tiniest interference, or hint of interference, could undermine faith in the tally of the vote. On Election Night, the Russians could place a page on the Wisconsin Elections Commission website that falsely showed Trump with a sizable lead. Government officials would be forced to declare it a hoax. Imagine how Twitter demagogues, the president among them, would exploit the ensuing confusion. Such scenarios ought to have sparked a clamor for systemic reform. But in the past, when the federal government has pointed out these vulnerabilities—and attempted to protect against them—the states have chafed and moaned. In August 2016, President Obama’s homeland-security secretary, Jeh Johnson, held a conference call with state election officials and informed them of the need to safeguard their infrastructure. Instead of accepting his offer of help, they told him, “This is our responsibility and there should not be a federal takeover of the election system.”

After the 2016 election, the federal government could have taken a stronger hand with localities. Unprecedented acts of foreign interference presumably would have provided quite a bit of leverage. That did not happen. The president perceives any suggestion of Russian interference as the diminution of his own legitimacy. This has contributed to a conspiracy of silence about the events of 2016. A year after the election, the Department of Homeland Security told 21 states that Russia had attempted to hack their electoral systems. Two years later, a Senate report publicly disclosed that Russia had, in fact, targeted all 50 states. When then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tried to raise the subject of electoral security with the president, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney reportedly told her to steer clear of it. According to The New York Times, Mulvaney said it “wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below his level.” From the April 2019 issue: William J. Burns on how the U.S.-Russian relationship went bad This atmosphere stifled what could have been a genuinely bipartisan accomplishment. The subject of voting divides Republicans and Democrats. Especially since the Bush v. Gore decision in 2000, the parties have stitched voting into their master narratives. Democrats accuse Republicans of suppressing the vote; Republicans accuse Democrats of flooding the polls with corpses and other cheating schemes. Despite this rancor, both sides seemed to agree that Russian hacking of voting systems was not a good thing. After the 2016 election, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, from Minnesota, partnered with Republican Senator James Lankford, from Oklahoma, on the Secure Elections Act. The bill would have given the states money to replace electronic voting machines with ones that leave a paper trail and would have required states to audit election results to confirm their accuracy. The reforms would also have had the seemingly salutary effect of making it easier for voters to cast ballots.

The Secure Elections Act wouldn’t have provided perfect insulation from Russian attacks, but it would have been a meaningful improvement on the status quo, and it briefly looked as if it could pass. Then, on the eve of a session to mark up the legislation—a moment for lawmakers to add their final touches—Senate Republicans suddenly withdrew their support, effectively killing the bill. Afterward, Democrats mocked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as “Moscow Mitch,” an appellation that stung enough that the senator ultimately agreed to legislation that supplied the states with hundreds of millions of dollars to buy new voting systems—but without any security demands placed on the states or any meaningful reforms to a broken system. McConnell made it clear that he despised the whole idea of a legislative fix to the electoral-security problem: “I’m not going to let Democrats and their water carriers in the media use Russia’s attack on our democracy as a Trojan horse for partisan wish-list items that would not actually make our elections any safer.” For McConnell, suppressing votes was a higher priority than protecting them from a foreign adversary. 2. The Big Phish To raise the subject of John Podesta’s email in his presence is a callous act. But I wanted his help tabulating a more precise toll of Russian hacking—how it leaves a messy trail of hurt feelings, saps precious mental space, and reshapes the course of a campaign. After repeatedly prodding him for an interview, I finally met with Hillary Clinton’s old campaign chief in his Washington office, which stares down onto the steeple of the church Abraham Lincoln attended during the Civil War. Dressed in a plaid shirt, with a ballpoint pen clipped into the pocket, Podesta rocked back and forth in a swivel chair as he allowed me to question him about one of the most wince-inducing moments in recent political history.

Months before WikiLeaks began publishing his emails, Podesta had an inkling that his Gmail account had been compromised. Internal campaign documents had appeared on an obscure website, and he considered the possibility that they had been lifted from his computer. Still, the call from a member of the campaign’s communications team on October 7, 2016, left him gobsmacked. As he finished a session of debate preparation with Clinton, he learned that Julian Assange intended to unfurl the contents of his inbox over the remaining month of the campaign. It’s a familiar if much-ignored maxim in politics that no email should ever contain content one wouldn’t want to see on the front page of The New York Times. This was now Podesta’s reality. On the 10th floor of the Clinton campaign’s headquarters, in Brooklyn, a team of 14 staffers quickly assembled. They covered a glass door in opaque paper to prevent voyeurs from observing their work and began to pore over every word of his 60,000 emails—every forwarded PDF, every gripe from an employee, even the meticulous steps of his risotto recipe. The project would consume the entirety of the month. Every day, Podesta set aside time to meet with emissaries from the 10th floor and review their findings. “I willed myself not to feel pain,” he told me.

The material that WikiLeaks eventually posted created some awkward moments. Podesta had received snarky emails from colleagues, and had sent a few himself. To repair relationships, Podesta found himself apologizing to co-workers, friends, former Cabinet secretaries. Even when the contents of the leaked messages seemed innocuous, new annoyances would arise. WikiLeaks hadn’t redacted the correspondence to protect privacy, leaving the cellphone numbers of campaign staffers for the world to view. In the middle of meetings, staffers would find their devices vibrating incessantly; strangers would fill their voicemails with messages like I hope you’re raped in prison. Identity thieves quickly circled Podesta, attempting to claim his Social Security benefits and applying for credit cards in his name. Despite a political career that has permitted him to whisper into the ears of presidents, the legendarily frugal Podesta had commuted to New York on Vamoose, a discount bus line. A fraudster exploited the hack to steal the points he had accumulated in the Vamoose rewards program.

As Podesta revisited these painful moments, he claimed that he’d stoically persisted in their face: “I kept going on television. I kept raising money. I kept traveling with Hillary and President Clinton. I kept doing everything that I had been doing.” But these were the closing weeks of an election that would turn on fewer than 80,000 votes spread across three states. For a campaign that arguably didn’t invest its resources properly in the final stretch, the question must be asked: How badly did the Russians throw the campaign off its game? The least visible damage of the hack might have been the most decisive. In the years since the Podesta hack, Microsoft’s Tom Burt has continually battled its perpetrators. As the man charged with safeguarding the security of Windows, Word, and his company’s other software, he has developed a feel for the GRU’s rhythms and habits. Through Microsoft’s work with political parties and campaigns around the world—the company offers them training and sells them security software at a discount—Burt has accumulated lengthy dossiers on past actions. What he’s noticed is that attacks tend to begin on the furthest fringes of a campaign. A standard GRU operation starts with think-tank fellows, academics, and political consultants. These people and institutions typically have weak cybersecurity fortifications, the penetration of which serves dual purposes. As the GRU pores through the inboxes of wonks and professors, it gathers useful intelligence about a campaign. But the hacked accounts also provide platforms for a more direct assault. Once inside, the GRU will send messages from the hacked accounts. The emails come from a trusted source, and carry a plausible message. According to Burt, “It will say something like ‘Saw this great article on the West Bank that you should review,’ and it’s got a link to a PDF. You click on it, and now your campaign network is infected.” (Although Burt won’t discuss specific institutions, he wrote a blog post last year describing attacks on the German Marshall Fund and the European offices of the Aspen Institute.)

Podesta fell victim to a generic spear-phishing attack: a spoofed security warning urging him to change his Gmail password. Many of us might like to think we’re sophisticated enough to avoid such a trap, but the Russians have grown adept at tailoring bespoke messages that could ensnare even the most vigilant target. Emails arrive from a phony address that looks as if it belongs to a friend or colleague, but has one letter omitted. One investigator told me that he’s noticed that Russians use details gleaned from Facebook to script tantalizing messages. If a campaign consultant has told his circle of friends about an upcoming bass-fishing trip, the GRU will package its malware in an email offering discounts on bass-fishing gear. Many of these techniques are borrowed from Russian cybercrime syndicates, which hack their way into banks and traffic in stolen credit cards. Burt has seen these illicit organizations using technologies that he believes will soon be imported to politics. For instance, new synthetic-audio software allows hackers to mimic a voice with convincing verisimilitude. Burt told me, “In the cybercrime world, you’re starting to see audio phishes, where somebody gets a voicemail message from their boss, for example, saying, ‘Hey, I need you to transfer this money to the following account right away.’ It sounds just like your boss and so you do it.” What the Russians can’t obtain from afar, they will attempt to pilfer with agents on the ground. The same GRU unit that hacked Podesta has allegedly sent operatives to Rio de Janeiro, Kuala Lumpur, and The Hague to practice what is known as “close-access hacking.” Once on the ground, they use off-the-shelf electronic equipment to pry open the Wi-Fi network of whomever they’re spying on.

The Russians, in other words, take risks few other nations would dare. They are willing to go to such lengths because they’ve reaped such rich rewards from hacking. Of all the Russian tactics deployed in 2016, the hacking and leaking of documents did the most immediate and palpable damage—distracting attention from the Access Hollywood tape, and fueling theories that the Democratic Party had rigged its process to squash Bernie Sanders’s campaign. In 2020, the damage could be greater still. Podesta told me that when he realized his email had been breached, he feared that the hackers would manufacture embarrassing or even incriminating emails and then publish them alongside the real ones. It’s impossible to know their reasoning, but Russian hackers made what would prove to be a clever decision not to alter Podesta’s email. Many media outlets accepted whatever emails WikiLeaks published without pausing to verify every detail, and they weren’t punished for their haste. The Podesta leaks thus established a precedent, an expectation that hacked material is authentic—perhaps the most authentic version of reality available, an opportunity to see past a campaign’s messaging and spin and read its innermost thoughts. In fact, the Russians have no scruples about altering documents. In 2017, hackers with links to the GRU breached the inboxes of French President Emmanuel Macron’s campaign staffers. The contents were rather banal, filled with restaurant reservations and trivial memos. Two days before these were released, other documents surfaced on internet message boards. Unlike the emails, these were pure fabrications, which purported to show that Macron had used a tax haven in the Cayman Islands. The timing of their release, however, gave them credibility. It was natural to assume that they had been harvested from the email hack, too. The Macron leaks suggested a dangerous new technique, a sinister mixing of the hacked and the fabricated intended to exploit the electorate’s hunger for raw evidence and faith in purloined documents.

3. Disinformation 2.0 In the spring of 2015, trolls in St. Petersburg peered at the feed of a webcam that had been furtively placed in New York City. Sitting in front of a computer screen on the second floor of a squat concrete office building, the trolls waited to see if they could influence the behavior of Americans from the comfort of Russian soil. The men worked for a company bankrolled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a bald-headed hot-dog vendor turned restaurateur, known to the Russian press as “Putin’s chef.” In the kleptocratic system that is the Russian economy, men like Prigozhin profit from their connections to Putin and maintain their inner-circle status by performing missions on his behalf. The operation in St. Petersburg was run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm serving the interests of the Kremlin. (Prigozhin has denied any involvement with the IRA.) The IRA is an heir to a proud Russian tradition. In the Soviet Union’s earliest days, the state came to believe that it could tip the world toward revolution through psychological warfare and deception, exploiting the divisions and weaknesses of bourgeois society. When it was assigned this task, the KGB referred to its program by the bureaucratic yet ominous name Active Measures. It pursued this work with artistic verve. It forged letters from the Ku Klux Klan that threatened to murder African athletes at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. It fomented conspiracies about the CIA—that the agency had orchestrated the spread of the AIDS virus in a laboratory and plotted the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Some of these KGB schemes were harebrained. But as one defector to the West put it, more Americans believed the Soviet version of JFK’s murder than the Warren Report.

The IRA has updated the principles of Active Measures for the digital age. On social media, disinformation can flourish like never before. Whereas the KGB once needed to find journalistic vehicles to plant their stories—usually the small-audience fringes of the radical press—Facebook and Twitter hardly distinguished between mainstream outlets and clickbait upstarts. And many of the new platforms were designed to manipulate users, to keep them engaged for as long as possible. Their algorithms elevated content that fueled panic and anger. With the New York webcam, the IRA was testing a hunch: that, through the miracle of social media, it could now toy with Americans as if they were marionettes. As the political scientist Thomas Rid recounts in his powerful new history, Active Measures, a post on Facebook promised that free hot dogs would be available to anyone who arrived on a specific corner at a prescribed time. Back in St. Petersburg, IRA employees watched as New Yorkers arrived, looked at their phones in frustration, and skulked away. The ruse was innocuous, but it proved a theory that could be put to far more nefarious ends: Social media had made it possible, at shockingly low cost, for Russians to steer the emotions and even movements of Americans. No study has quantified how many votes have been swayed by the 10 million tweets that the IRA has pumped into the digital world; no metric captures how its posts on Facebook and Instagram altered America’s emotional valence as it headed to the polls in 2016. In the end, the IRA’s menagerie of false personas and fusillades of splenetic memes were arguably more effective at garnering sensationalistic headlines than shifting public opinion. For their part, the IRA’s minions immodestly credited themselves with having tilted the trajectory of history. The U.S. government obtained an email from an IRA employee describing the scene at the St. Petersburg office on Election Night: “When around 8 a.m. the most important result of our work arrived, we uncorked a tiny bottle of champagne … took one gulp each and looked into each other’s eyes … We uttered almost in unison: ‘We made America great.’ ”

Having run a noisy operation in 2016, the IRA has since learned to modulate itself. Its previous handiwork, much of which was riddled with poor syntax and grammatical errors, hardly required a discerning eye to identify. These days, the IRA takes care to avoid such sloppiness. Now, when they want to, IRA trolls can make themselves inconspicuous. The social-media companies no longer treat Russian trolls like harmless interlopers and have proved capable of aggressive policing. But thwarting the last line of attack is easier than preventing new ones. Relying on this quieter approach, the IRA has carried the theory of its hot-dog experiment into American political life. When white supremacists applied for a permit to hold a march in 2018 to commemorate the first anniversary of their protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, a Facebook group organized a counterprotest in Washington, D.C. The group was called the Resisters. Its administrators, who went by the names Mary and Natasha, recruited a coterie of enthusiastic organizers to promote the rally. When Facebook took down the Resisters’ page—noting its ties to IRA accounts, and implying that Mary and Natasha were fictitious creations—American leftists were shocked to learn that they had apparently been hatching plans with foreign trolls. According to The New York Times, they were also furious with Facebook: Whether or not the page was a Russian ploy, it had become a venue for real Americans to air their real grievances. In fact, it was hard to pinpoint where the Active Measures ended and the genuine action began—the sort of tradecraft that the KGB would have admired.

Although the IRA might practice stealth when the operation demands, in other circumstances it will deploy raw bluster. Starting in 2017, it launched a sustained effort to exaggerate the specter of its interference, a tactic that social-media companies call “perception hacking.” Its trolls were instructed to post about the Mueller report and fan the flames of public anger over the blatant interference it revealed. On the day of the 2018 midterm elections, a group claiming to be the IRA published a grandiloquent manifesto on its website that declared: “Soon after November 6, you will realize that your vote means nothing. We decide who you vote for and what candidates will win or lose. Whether you vote or not, there is no difference as we control the voting and counting systems. Remember, your vote has zero value. We are choosing for you.” The claim was absurd, but the posturing had a purpose. If enough Americans come to believe that Russia can do whatever it wants to our democratic processes without consequence, that, too, increases cynicism about American democracy, and thereby serves Russian ends. As Laura Rosenberger, a former National Security Council staffer under Obama who runs the Alliance for Securing Democracy, put it, “They would like us to see a Russian under every bed.” Judging by this year’s presidential-primary campaign, they have been successful in this effort. When the Iowa Democratic Party struggled to implement new technology used to tally results for the state’s caucus, television panelists, Twitter pundits, and even a member of Congress speculated about the possibility of hacking, despite a lack of evidence to justify such loose talk. American incompetence had been confused for a plot against America.

4. An Uncoordinated Response As the outlines of the IRA’s efforts began to emerge in the months following the 2016 election, Facebook at first refused to acknowledge the problem. The company’s defensiveness called attention to its laissez-faire attitude toward the content that it elevated in people’s News Feeds. Facebook found itself flayed by congressional committees, its inner workings exposed by investigative journalists. Ostensibly it had been Alex Stamos’s job to prevent the last attack, and now he faced another wave of disinformation, with midterm elections fast approaching. Stamos worried that, in the absence of an orchestrated defense, his company, as well as the nation, would repeat the mistakes of 2016. In the spring of 2018, he invited executives from the big tech companies and leaders of intelligence agencies to Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California. As he thought about it, Stamos was surprised that such a summit hadn’t been organized sooner. What shocked him more was a realization he had as the meeting convened: Few of these people even knew one another. “People who ran different agencies working on foreign interference met for the first time at Menlo Park, even though they were 10 Metro stops away in D.C.,” he told me. “The normal collaborative process in government didn’t exist on this issue.” Stamos’s summit succeeded in spurring cooperation. Prior to the meeting, one tech company would identify and disable Russian accounts but fail to warn its competitors, allowing the same trolls to continue operating with impunity. Over the course of 2018, the tech industry gradually began acting in concert. The lead investigators on the threat-intelligence teams at 30 companies—including Facebook, Verizon, and Reddit—joined a common channel on Slack, the messaging platform. When one company spies a nascent operation, it can now ring a bell for the others. This winter, Facebook and Twitter jointly shut down dozens of accounts associated with a single residential address in Accra, Ghana, where the Russians had set up a troll factory and hired local 20-somethings to impersonate African Americans and stoke online anger.",www.theatlantic.com,left,axueRDNTl24LKKZp

US President Donald Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a US-Mexico border wall without the approval of Congress.

It came after he met senior Democrats, who refused his requests for funding.

The stand-off has seen Mr Trump withhold support for a bill to fully fund the government until he gets money for the border wall.

He said he was prepared for the partial government shutdown - now in its third week - to last years.

Around 800,000 federal workers have been without pay since 22 December.

Trump aides and lawmakers will meet later on Saturday in a fresh bid to resolve the impasse.

What happened in Friday's meeting with Democrats?

The Republican president initially gave a positive account of the 90-minute meeting at the White House, describing it as ""very productive"".

But when asked whether he had considered using emergency presidential powers to bypass congressional approval of funding, Mr Trump said he had.

""I may do it. We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That's another way of doing it.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday's meeting had been ""contentious"", while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""We told the president we needed the government open. He resisted.""

Can Trump declare a national emergency?

Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump says he can declare a ""national emergency"" and build his promised wall along the border without congressional approval. If that's the case, the question becomes why he doesn't go ahead and do that. Why put federal workers through the pain of forgoing pay and hamstring key government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, if he could bypass Democratic objections with the snap of his presidential fingers?

The answer is because the solution isn't that simple. There are provisions of US law that allow the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from Defence Department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes. Such a move may prompt Congress, including Republicans, to push back.

Then there's the inevitable legal challenge from Democrats to such an exercise of presidential authority. Any presidential order to build a wall would be met by an equally imposing wall of court filings blocking its construction.

The president's latest suggestions are best viewed as simply another attempt to gain the upper hand in negotiations with Democrats.

This may not be a threat, more a bluff.

What's the background?

Democrats, who now hold the majority in the House, passed spending bills on Thursday to reopen the government, including $1.3bn (£1bn) of border security funds until 8 February.

But the legislation cannot take effect unless it passes the Republican-controlled Senate, where leader Mitch McConnell said his party would not back any measure without the president's support.

national_security,Guest Writer - Left,0,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-report-public/index.html,OPINION: Why Trump suddenly says public should see Mueller's report,2019-03-21,Analysis Stephen Collinson,"( CNN ) Donald Trump , the President who refused to release his tax returns , just made an unexpected gesture towards transparency , saying he 'd be happy for Americans to see Robert Mueller 's final report .
His comment is probably worth taking with a large pinch of salt . After all , just last week , Trump tweeted `` there should be no Mueller report . ''
The President , with his talent for shifting the terms of a debate , weighed in on the fate of Mueller 's yet-to-be-filed final report before heading to Ohio on Wednesday .
`` I do n't mind . I mean , frankly , I told the House , 'If you want , let them see it , ' '' Trump said when asked whether the American public had the right to see the fruits of the special counsel 's labors .
Trump 's offer was surprising since it appeared to conflict with a long record of attempts to either obstruct or discredit Mueller 's investigation , which he has branded a `` witch hunt '' and something no President should suffer .
Indeed , once he returned from Ohio Wednesday night , Trump tweeted some commentary from Fox News : `` 'The reason we have the Special Counsel investigation is that James Comey ( a dirty cop ) leaked his memos to a friend , who leaked them to the press , on purpose . ' @ KennedyNation Totally illegal ! ''
It is often difficult to know whether Trump is working to a long-term strategic plan , testing out new political ground or just riffing in the moment to get past bad news and onto another subject .
But it 's hard to take his comment seriously , partly because it recalls his frequent statements that he 'd love to sit down in an interview with Mueller , an offer that never appears to have been taken seriously by his lawyers .
Trump provided the special counsel with a set of written answers to questions prepared in coordination with his legal team , but never went head-to-head with prosecutors .
With his comment on Wednesday , the President could have simply been recognizing strong support among Americans for a public accounting of Mueller 's work -- in the belief that he could not shape it without first acknowledging it .
The CNN/SSRS poll released on Wednesday found that 87 % of Americans believe that the Mueller report should be made public . Just 9 % disagree .
The President 's sincerity is also called into question by a tweet last weekend that appeared to signal he was more interested in going through the motions of accountability than adopting it as a practice .
On the recent non-binding vote ( 420-0 ) in Congress about releasing the Mueller Report , I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency . Makes us all look good and does n't matter . Play along with the game ! '' Trump wrote .
Trump 's Democratic foes do n't really think he wants the Mueller report made public .
`` I do n't believe him because he has obstructed every step along the way , '' Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California said on `` Erin Burnett OutFront '' on Wednesday .
Much of the White House 's strategy , once Mueller has filed his final report with Attorney General William Barr , will depend on what it says .
Trump insisted on Wednesday that he did not know what was in the report , and it 's not clear whether he has been briefed by subordinates read in on the investigation , for instance , former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker .
If the report ends up being critical of the President -- after an investigation into alleged cooperation between his campaign team and Russian election meddling and claims he obstructed justice -- Trump will have a strong incentive to suppress it .
A less damaging result would give the White House the chance to turn on a dime after months attacking the special counsel , by using Mueller 's sterling personal reputation to its own benefit .
Assessing the battle to come is also difficult because no one knows what form Mueller 's conclusions will take .
He could elect to provide Barr with a bare-bones explanation of why he chose to pursue some Trump associates , such as former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn , and not others .
Or , given the intense public interest in his investigation , Mueller could deliver a more expansive assessment . It will then be up to the attorney general to decide what Congress , or the public , can see .
There 's another reason why Trump 's backing for a public release of a Mueller report should not be taken at face value .
While suddenly throwing up a trial balloon of cooperation , the White House is girding for a period of political confrontation once the Mueller probe ends .
CNN 's Pamela Brown reported this week that White House lawyers expect to see whatever version of Mueller 's findings Barr decides to send to Congress .
Scrubbing the report for executive privilege claims is well within the purview of the White House counsel 's office -- after all , their charge is to defend the institution of the presidency , not the individual President they serve .
But the chance for the White House to view the report ahead of its release to lawmakers will certainly spark a clash with Democrats who believe Trump 's team will do everything it can to suppress Mueller 's final conclusions .
And sweeping claims of executive privilege could trigger an intricate legal battle that could go all the way up to the Supreme Court , and put off any day of reckoning for Trump in Congress for months , even if the report brings bad news .
Another issue is that as much of Mueller 's investigation represents a counter intelligence probe into election meddling by Russian spy agencies , some findings might need to remain classified .
Democratic committee chairmen are struggling to get the White House to comply with document requests to support their massive investigations into Trump 's campaign , transition , inaugural committee , business and presidency .
`` I want the public to understand us as we paint this picture of what is happening in our country , the stonewalling , the lies , '' House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings told CNN 's Manu Raju on Wednesday .
`` I do not want us to be distracted from the truth , '' he added .
The White House has also missed a deadline to provide documents to the House Judiciary Committee .
Trump 's comment about the release of the Mueller report came as he road tested a counterattack that is building on an escalation of his `` no collusion '' mantra and repeated assaults on the Mueller `` witch hunt . ''
The messaging could carry the President through the critical final stages of the Mueller investigation , and also frame a pillar of his re-election argument as he heads out onto the campaign trail ahead of the 2020 campaign .
The plan is clear : Delegitimize Mueller personally and professionally , paint his findings as a deep state coup that trashes votes of his millions of Trump supporters , and argue that he 's bulletproof since he 's doing such a great job .
`` It 's sort of interesting that a man out of the blue just writes a report . I got 306 electoral votes against 223 . That 's a tremendous victory . I 've got 63 million votes , and now somebody just writes a report . I think it 's ridiculous . '' Trump said Wednesday .
The argument that an investigation into a democratically elected President could amount to a coup in all but name could be a powerful one .
Trump is not the only senior Washington politician who is preparing the political terrain for the eventual filing of the Mueller report .
His line of attack helps explain the strategy adopted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when faced with demands from the Democratic grassroots for the impeachment of the President even before Mueller 's report .
`` He 's just not worth it , '' Pelosi said in a Washington Post interview earlier this month .
The speaker believes the process of impeachment is so damaging to the nation 's political fabric that unless there is some truly grievous offense uncovered by investigations , the proper remedy for a presidency she sees as unethical and disastrous , is at the ballot box .
The CNN poll suggests that Pelosi may have convinced some Democrats .
In December , 80 % of self-identified Democrats said they were in favor of impeachment -- that now stands at 68 % , a 12-point dip .","(CNN) Donald Trump, the President who refused to release his tax returns, just made an unexpected gesture towards transparency, saying he'd be happy for Americans to see Robert Mueller's final report.

With his comment on Wednesday, the President could have simply been recognizing strong support among Americans for a public accounting of Mueller's work -- in the belief that he could not shape it without first acknowledging it.

The CNN/SSRS poll released on Wednesday found that 87% of Americans believe that the Mueller report should be made public. Just 9% disagree.

The President's sincerity is also called into question by a tweet last weekend that appeared to signal he was more interested in going through the motions of accountability than adopting it as a practice.

On the recent non-binding vote (420-0) in Congress about releasing the Mueller Report, I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesn't matter. Play along with the game!"" Trump wrote.

Trump's Democratic foes don't really think he wants the Mueller report made public.

""I don't believe him because he has obstructed every step along the way,"" Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California said on ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Wednesday.

How Mueller's findings will shape White House strategy

Much of the White House's strategy, once Mueller has filed his final report with Attorney General William Barr, will depend on what it says.

Trump insisted on Wednesday that he did not know what was in the report, and it's not clear whether he has been briefed by subordinates read in on the investigation, for instance, former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker.

If the report ends up being critical of the President -- after an investigation into alleged cooperation between his campaign team and Russian election meddling and claims he obstructed justice -- Trump will have a strong incentive to suppress it.

A less damaging result would give the White House the chance to turn on a dime after months attacking the special counsel, by using Mueller's sterling personal reputation to its own benefit.

Assessing the battle to come is also difficult because no one knows what form Mueller's conclusions will take.

He could elect to provide Barr with a bare-bones explanation of why he chose to pursue some Trump associates, such as former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, and not others.

Or, given the intense public interest in his investigation, Mueller could deliver a more expansive assessment. It will then be up to the attorney general to decide what Congress, or the public, can see.

There's another reason why Trump's backing for a public release of a Mueller report should not be taken at face value.

While suddenly throwing up a trial balloon of cooperation, the White House is girding for a period of political confrontation once the Mueller probe ends.

CNN's Pamela Brown reported this week that White House lawyers expect to see whatever version of Mueller's findings Barr decides to send to Congress.

Scrubbing the report for executive privilege claims is well within the purview of the White House counsel's office -- after all, their charge is to defend the institution of the presidency, not the individual President they serve.

But the chance for the White House to view the report ahead of its release to lawmakers will certainly spark a clash with Democrats who believe Trump's team will do everything it can to suppress Mueller's final conclusions.

And sweeping claims of executive privilege could trigger an intricate legal battle that could go all the way up to the Supreme Court, and put off any day of reckoning for Trump in Congress for months, even if the report brings bad news.

Another issue is that as much of Mueller's investigation represents a counter intelligence probe into election meddling by Russian spy agencies, some findings might need to remain classified.

Missed deadlines

The struggle over disclosure is already getting a preview.

Democratic committee chairmen are struggling to get the White House to comply with document requests to support their massive investigations into Trump's campaign, transition, inaugural committee, business and presidency.

""I want the public to understand us as we paint this picture of what is happening in our country, the stonewalling, the lies,"" House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday.

""I do not want us to be distracted from the truth,"" he added.

The White House has also missed a deadline to provide documents to the House Judiciary Committee.

Trump's comment about the release of the Mueller report came as he road tested a counterattack that is building on an escalation of his ""no collusion"" mantra and repeated assaults on the Mueller ""witch hunt.""

The messaging could carry the President through the critical final stages of the Mueller investigation, and also frame a pillar of his re-election argument as he heads out onto the campaign trail ahead of the 2020 campaign.

The plan is clear: Delegitimize Mueller personally and professionally, paint his findings as a deep state coup that trashes votes of his millions of Trump supporters, and argue that he's bulletproof since he's doing such a great job.

""It's sort of interesting that a man out of the blue just writes a report. I got 306 electoral votes against 223. That's a tremendous victory. I've got 63 million votes, and now somebody just writes a report. I think it's ridiculous."" Trump said Wednesday.

The argument that an investigation into a democratically elected President could amount to a coup in all but name could be a powerful one.

Trump is not the only senior Washington politician who is preparing the political terrain for the eventual filing of the Mueller report.

His line of attack helps explain the strategy adopted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when faced with demands from the Democratic grassroots for the impeachment of the President even before Mueller's report.

""He's just not worth it,"" Pelosi said in a Washington Post interview earlier this month.

The speaker believes the process of impeachment is so damaging to the nation's political fabric that unless there is some truly grievous offense uncovered by investigations, the proper remedy for a presidency she sees as unethical and disastrous, is at the ballot box.

The CNN poll suggests that Pelosi may have convinced some Democrats.

In December, 80% of self-identified Democrats said they were in favor of impeachment -- that now stands at 68%, a 12-point dip.",www.cnn.com,left,rxJwmYktfHyH4sYI

President Donald Trump should sit down with special counsel Robert Mueller and answer Mueller’s questions to the best of his ability.

That’s not the advice Trump is getting from all quarters. Some Republicans are saying in public that the president should not cooperate with Mueller’s investigation, and doubtless he has political aides and lawyers speaking similarly.

But nothing Mueller has done has shown him to have an ax to grind against Trump. Exhibit A for those who say he is biased is that he has hired partisan Democrats — as though ambitious Republican lawyers were likely to sign up for a high-profile investigation of a Republican president.

Comey as House Republicans consider holding his successor , Christopher Wray , in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over records related to the Russia probe that secured its first high-profile conviction Friday .
Rep. Devin Nunes , California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said the FBI and Department of Justice have for months “ stonewalled ” requests from his panel for documents pertaining to the salacious Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele .
Mr. Nunes issued an angry demand over the weekend and promised to take action . If the agencies do not meet all the House committee ’ s requests by close of business Monday , he said , he will promptly file a contempt resolution against Mr. Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein .
The disputes came two days after former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia ’ s ambassador to the U.S . In agreeing to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation , the probe of possible Trump campaign involvement with Kremlin meddling in the U.S. presidential election enters the president ’ s inner circle .
But the president had a few choice words for the FBI , saying in a series of tweets Sunday morning that the storied investigative agency ’ s reputation is in shambles and denying any personal jeopardy from Flynn ’ s plea and his cooperation with the Mueller probe .
“ After years of Comey , with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation ( and more ) , running the FBI , its reputation is in Tatters — worst in History ! ” he said in one tweet . “ But fear not , we will bring it back to greatness . ”
The president cited reports that FBI investigator Peter Strzok , who led the agency ’ s email probe that ultimately cleared Hillary Clinton , was removed from Mr. Mueller ’ s Russia investigation for exchanging text messages with Lisa Page , a top FBI lawyer with whom he was having an extramarital affair .
The messages showed a possible bias for Mrs. Clinton and against Mr. Trump .
Mr. Nunes said he knew about Mr. Strzok ’ s demotion three months ago ― but not the reasons for it , which were covered under the subpoena .
“ By hiding from Congress , and from the American people , documented political bias by a key FBI head investigator for both the Russia collusion probe and the Clinton email investigation , the FBI and DOJ engaged in a willful attempt to thwart Congress ‘ constitutional oversight responsibility , ” Mr. Nunes said .
Mr. Nunes said the agencies suddenly became more forthcoming with some information his panel had sought when Mr. Strzok ’ s dismissal was reported over the weekend .
“ The DOJ has now expressed — on a Saturday , just hours after the press reports on Strzok ’ s dismissal appeared — a sudden willingness to comply with some of the committee ’ s long-standing demands , ” Mr. Nunes said . “ This attempted eleventh-hour accommodation is neither credible nor believable , and in fact is yet another example of the DOJ ’ s disingenuousness and obstruction . ”
In another tweet , Mr. Trump denied asking Mr. Comey to halt the investigation into Flynn , who faces up to five years in prison for falsely telling investigators he didn ’ t ask Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to limit Moscow ’ s reaction to U.S. sanctions during the presidential transition .
In his June testimony , Mr. Comey quoted the president as saying , “ I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go . He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . ”
“ I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn , ” Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday morning . “ Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie ! ”
Mr. Trump also said over the weekend that the Flynn guilty plea showed no collusion between his aides and Russia and even took credit for dismissing Flynn in the first place for the same lies to which the former national security adviser pleaded guilty .
“ I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI . He has pled guilty to those lies , ” Mr. Trump wrote Saturday on Twitter . “ It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful . There was nothing to hide ! ”
Mr. Trump previously said Mr. Flynn lost his White House job over misleading Vice President Mike Pence . In the tweet , the president expanded the explanation to cover the lie to the FBI .
Mr. Trump told reporters as he departed the White House on Saturday for New York City that the plea shows “ no collusion [ with Russia ] . There ’ s been absolutely no collusion , so we ’ re very happy . ”
But Mr. Mueller ’ s investigators say Flynn was acting on the direction of at least one other senior Trump transition adviser , believed to be presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , said Mr. Trump should learn his lesson and choose his words carefully during an open investigation .
“ I would just say this to the president , there ’ s an ongoing criminal investigation , Comey may be a part of it , ” Mr. Graham said Sunday on the CBS talk show “ Face the Nation. ” “ You [ are ] tweeting comments regarding ongoing investigations at your own peril . I ’ d be careful if I were you , Mr. President . I ’ d watch this . ”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said the panel is starting to see “ the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice ” against Mr. Trump , coming partly from “ the continual tweets ” from the White House on the FBI , Mr. Comey and Russia-related matters .
Ms. Feinstein said on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press ” that she thinks Mr. Comey ’ s dismissal came “ directly because he did not agree to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation . ”
Sen. Mark R. Warner , Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , flatly said he didn ’ t believe Mr. Trump ’ s denials about trying to influence Mr. Comey .
“ I believe FBI Director Comey , ” he said on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union. ” “ I think he was very credible in his testimony , in his private meetings with us .
“ This president has been obsessed with this investigation , always saying there ’ s nothing there , ” Mr. Warner said . “ But each week another shoe drops where we see more evidence of continuing outreach to Russians and some response by the Trump campaign and Trump individuals . ”
Flynn ’ s guilty plea has further emboldened Capitol Hill Democrats , who say they now have ammunition to press the Republican leaders of congressional probes on Russia to intensify the investigations .
Mr. Warner categorized the Flynn guilty plea as part of “ an alarming pattern ” of White House efforts to interfere with the multiple Russia inquiries .
“ You ’ ve had , clearly , you ’ ve had an attorney general who ’ s had to recuse himself because of untold contacts with the Russians . You had the president of the United States trying to intervene , as has been reported , with other national intelligence leaders , who he appointed , saying , ‘ Can you back off ? ’ ” Mr. Warner said .
The Virginia Democrat pledged his panel would “ continue a thorough , bipartisan probe that follows the facts wherever they may lead . ”
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland , the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , has spent months pressing the panel ’ s Republican chairman — Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina — to subpoena the White House for all documents related to Flynn .
But Mr. Gowdy has rejected requests for such a subpoena , saying that what the Democrats seek could lead to criminal penalties and arguing that “ Congress does not , and can not , prosecute crimes . ”
The House intelligence committee ’ s lead Democrat , Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , warned the White House about interfering in the probes .
“ Congress must make it clear that this would not be acceptable , that we will continue doing a diligent and thoughtful investigation , and do everything in our power to ensure the independence of the Special Counsel , ” he said in statement .
Mr. Schiff joined the Senate Judiciary Committee ’ s top Democrat , Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , in suggesting the possibility that Flynn illegally obstructed U.S. foreign policy during the presidential transition . If so , the retired general might have violated the obscure 1799 Logan Act , which prohibits U.S. citizens from attempting to shape foreign policy .","President Trump is renewing his feud with former FBI Director James B. Comey as House Republicans consider holding his successor, Christopher Wray, in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over records related to the Russia probe that secured its first high-profile conviction Friday.

Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said the FBI and Department of Justice have for months “stonewalled” requests from his panel for documents pertaining to the salacious Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

Mr. Nunes issued an angry demand over the weekend and promised to take action. If the agencies do not meet all the House committee’s requests by close of business Monday, he said, he will promptly file a contempt resolution against Mr. Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

The disputes came two days after former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. In agreeing to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, the probe of possible Trump campaign involvement with Kremlin meddling in the U.S. presidential election enters the president’s inner circle.

The White House said Trump would meet Kim at Hanoi ’ s French-colonial-era Metropole Hotel at 6:30 p.m. ( 1130 GMT ) and have a 20-minute one-on-one conversation before a dinner scheduled to last just over an hour and a half .
Trump flew into Hanoi on Air Force One late on Tuesday .
“ Just arrived in Vietnam , ” he wrote in a Twitter post . “ Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi . Tremendous crowds , and so much love ! ”
Kim arrived by train early in the day after a three-day , 3,000-km ( 1,850-mile ) trip from his capital , Pyongyang , through China . He completed the last stretch from a border station to Hanoi by car .
The two leaders , who seemed to strike up a surprisingly warm relationship at their first summit in Singapore last June , will be accompanied at dinner by two aides and interpreters , the White House said , before they meet again on Thursday .
Their talks come eight months after the historic summit in Singapore , the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader .
While much of that first meeting was about breaking the ice after decades of bitter animosity between their two countries , this time there will be pressure to move beyond a vaguely worded commitment by Kim to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula .
Trump ’ s critics at home have warned him against cutting a deal that would do little to curb North Korea ’ s nuclear ambitions , urging specific , verifiable North Korean action to abandon the nuclear weapons that threaten the United States .
In return , Kim would expect significant U.S. concessions such as relief from punishing sanctions and a declaration that the 1950-53 Korean War is at last formally over .
Trump , landing in darkness , waved as he disembarked Air Force One and was met by senior Vietnamese and U.S. officials . His motorcade passed crowds waving the flags of Vietnam , the United States and North Korea on its way to the JW Marriott Hotel , his accommodation for the two-day summit .
Earlier , Vietnamese officials greeted Kim at the station in Dong Dang town after he crossed the border from China by train . He got a red-carpet welcome with honor guard , military band and fluttering North Korean and Vietnamese flags .
Kim was accompanied by his sister , Kim Yo Jong , an important aide .
About a dozen bodyguards briefly ran alongside his limousine as he began the two-hour journey to Hanoi . Roads were closed with security forces in armored personnel carriers guarding the route to the Melia hotel , where Kim is staying .
North Korean officials engaged in working-level talks for the summit briefed Kim after he arrived , the North ’ s state news agency , KCNA , said on Wednesday .
At the Melia hotel , Kim “ heard concrete details on the pattern of engagement between working-level delegations , ” KCNA said , referring to the North by its official name , the Democratic People ’ s Republic of Korea .
Visiting the North Korean embassy in Vietnam , Kim urged staff there to strengthen two-way ties in line with the needs of the times , KCNA added .
Kim “ will reunite with U.S. President Donald J. Trump from February 27 to 28 and conduct the historic second DPRK-U.S. summit , ” before embarking on a goodwill visit to Vietnam on March 1 and 2 , the agency said .
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also arrived on Tuesday and met Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh for talks .
U.S. President Donald Trump arrives at Noi Bai Airport for the US-DPRK summit in Hanoi , Vietnam February 26 , 2019 . ███/Kham/Pool
Trump said before leaving Washington it would be “ a very tremendous summit ” and stressed the benefits to North Korea if it gave up its nuclear weapons .
“ With complete denuclearization , North Korea will rapidly become an economic powerhouse , ” he said . “ Without it , just more of the same . Chairman Kim will make a wise decision ! ”
In a speech on Sunday , however , Trump appeared to play down the possibility of a major breakthrough , saying he would be happy as long as North Korea maintained its pause on weapons testing .
“ I ’ m not in a rush , ” he said . “ I just don ’ t want testing . As long as there ’ s no testing , we ’ re happy . ”
North Korea has not held a nuclear or missile test since 2017 , but analysts say the two leaders have to move beyond summit symbolism .
“ The most basic , yet urgent , task is to come to a shared understanding of what denuclearization would entail , ” said Gi-Wook Shin , director of Stanford ’ s Asia-Pacific Research Center .
“ The ambiguity and obscurity of the term ‘ denuclearization ’ only exacerbates the skepticism about both the U.S. and North Korean commitments to denuclearization . ”
While the United States is demanding North Korea give up all of its nuclear and missile programs , the North wants to see the removal of a U.S. nuclear umbrella for South Korea .
Trump ’ s departure from Washington comes at a time of increased pressure at home , and he is keen to show progress on a foreign policy issue that has confounded multiple predecessors .
Some analysts fear that may lead him to pull his punches .
“ The main concern is whether the president , besieged by domestic distractions , will give away too much , and take a bad deal that leaves the United States less secure , ” said Victor Cha , a former White House official who took part in North Korea talks under previous Republican administrations .

The White House said Trump would meet Kim at Hanoi’s French-colonial-era Metropole Hotel at 6:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) and have a 20-minute one-on-one conversation before a dinner scheduled to last just over an hour and a half.

Trump flew into Hanoi on Air Force One late on Tuesday.

“Just arrived in Vietnam,” he wrote in a Twitter post. “Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi. Tremendous crowds, and so much love!”

Kim arrived by train early in the day after a three-day, 3,000-km (1,850-mile) trip from his capital, Pyongyang, through China. He completed the last stretch from a border station to Hanoi by car.

The two leaders, who seemed to strike up a surprisingly warm relationship at their first summit in Singapore last June, will be accompanied at dinner by two aides and interpreters, the White House said, before they meet again on Thursday.

Their talks come eight months after the historic summit in Singapore, the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.

While much of that first meeting was about breaking the ice after decades of bitter animosity between their two countries, this time there will be pressure to move beyond a vaguely worded commitment by Kim to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Trump’s critics at home have warned him against cutting a deal that would do little to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, urging specific, verifiable North Korean action to abandon the nuclear weapons that threaten the United States.

In return, Kim would expect significant U.S. concessions such as relief from punishing sanctions and a declaration that the 1950-53 Korean War is at last formally over.

Trump, landing in darkness, waved as he disembarked Air Force One and was met by senior Vietnamese and U.S. officials. His motorcade passed crowds waving the flags of Vietnam, the United States and North Korea on its way to the JW Marriott Hotel, his accommodation for the two-day summit.

Earlier, Vietnamese officials greeted Kim at the station in Dong Dang town after he crossed the border from China by train. He got a red-carpet welcome with honor guard, military band and fluttering North Korean and Vietnamese flags.

Kim was accompanied by his sister, Kim Yo Jong, an important aide.

About a dozen bodyguards briefly ran alongside his limousine as he began the two-hour journey to Hanoi. Roads were closed with security forces in armored personnel carriers guarding the route to the Melia hotel, where Kim is staying.

North Korean officials engaged in working-level talks for the summit briefed Kim after he arrived, the North’s state news agency, KCNA, said on Wednesday.

At the Melia hotel, Kim “heard concrete details on the pattern of engagement between working-level delegations,” KCNA said, referring to the North by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Visiting the North Korean embassy in Vietnam, Kim urged staff there to strengthen two-way ties in line with the needs of the times, KCNA added.

Kim “will reunite with U.S. President Donald J. Trump from February 27 to 28 and conduct the historic second DPRK-U.S. summit,” before embarking on a goodwill visit to Vietnam on March 1 and 2, the agency said.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also arrived on Tuesday and met Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh for talks.

‘TREMENDOUS’

Trump said before leaving Washington it would be “a very tremendous summit” and stressed the benefits to North Korea if it gave up its nuclear weapons.

“With complete denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an economic powerhouse,” he said. “Without it, just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision!”

In a speech on Sunday, however, Trump appeared to play down the possibility of a major breakthrough, saying he would be happy as long as North Korea maintained its pause on weapons testing.

“I’m not in a rush,” he said. “I just don’t want testing. As long as there’s no testing, we’re happy.”

North Korea has not held a nuclear or missile test since 2017, but analysts say the two leaders have to move beyond summit symbolism.

“The most basic, yet urgent, task is to come to a shared understanding of what denuclearization would entail,” said Gi-Wook Shin, director of Stanford’s Asia-Pacific Research Center.

“The ambiguity and obscurity of the term ‘denuclearization’ only exacerbates the skepticism about both the U.S. and North Korean commitments to denuclearization.”

While the United States is demanding North Korea give up all of its nuclear and missile programs, the North wants to see the removal of a U.S. nuclear umbrella for South Korea.

Trump’s departure from Washington comes at a time of increased pressure at home, and he is keen to show progress on a foreign policy issue that has confounded multiple predecessors.

Some analysts fear that may lead him to pull his punches.

“The main concern is whether the president, besieged by domestic distractions, will give away too much, and take a bad deal that leaves the United States less secure,” said Victor Cha, a former White House official who took part in North Korea talks under previous Republican administrations.

The Justice Department added another piece to the puzzle of its Russia investigation on Friday with charges against GOP political consultant Roger Stone — but the full picture still is n't complete .
Stone was arrested in Florida following an indictment by a grand jury working with the office of special counsel Robert Mueller .
Stone denied breaking the law and said he 'll plead not guilty when he 's arraigned later in Washington , D.C .
Prosecutors say Stone and at least two of his associates served as intermediaries between Donald Trump 's 2016 presidential campaign and `` Organization 1 '' — as WikiLeaks is referred to in the court document — which fenced material stolen by the Russian government as part of the Kremlin 's scheme to wreak havoc in the 2016 White House race .
After WikiLeaks released emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 , `` a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone '' to ask what else WikiLeaks had planned .
Stone then pinged `` Person 1 '' — conservative commentator Jerome Corsi — and instructed him to `` get the pending ... emails '' from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .
That was the start of what appeared to be weeks of indirect communication between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks through Stone and his associates , according to the indictment — and , via WikiLeaks , with Russia 's military intelligence agency , the GRU .
The charges Stone is facing are about the accounts he gave to Congress about these events . Stone vowed Friday that he 'll fight the charges and said he expects to be `` vindicated '' in court .
A Trump lawyer highlighted on Friday that the charges in the Stone indictment , however , are n't about collusion — they 're about the statements Stone made to Congress and others .
`` The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else , '' said Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow . `` Rather , the indictment focuses on alleged false statements Mr. Stone made to Congress . ''
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders attempted to distance the president from the indictment and arrest .
`` The president did nothing wrong , '' Sanders said in a Friday morning cable TV interview . `` There was no collusion . ''
And the president himself has frequently asserted via Twitter in the past two years that there was `` NO COLLUSION ! '' between his 2016 campaign and any Russian election interference effort and called suggestions to the otherwise a `` hoax . '' Trump has also frequently referred to the Mueller investigation as a `` witch hunt . ''
The Stone indictment raises as many questions as it answers . Although the account it gives clarifies a few key points about the events of 2016 , there are also important things that it does n't say .
Did any of the Americans know they were ultimately dealing with Russia ?
In the summer of 2016 , the fact of Russia 's `` active measures '' was the subject of speculation , anonymous quotes and supposition — but was not officially confirmed in public .
Since then , Mueller 's office has detailed some of Russia 's practices : the use of social media agitation to deepen divisions among Americans and the cyberattacks against political and other targets in search of embarrassing dirt to release .
The question now is what Stone , Trump 's then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort , Trump 's family or Trump himself knew about what was taking place behind the scenes .
Trump has gone back and forth both then and now about what he accepts about the Russian election interference in 2016 . But at the time , he was consistent about how much he loved WikiLeaks and urged voters to focus on what it was revealing about the Democrats , no matter where the material was coming from .
The events of July 2016 followed many contacts by Russians or their agents with people in the Trump campaign — including a meeting the previous month hosted by Donald Trump Jr. , following an offer of help for the campaign , again via intermediaries , from the Russian government .
Manafort also met at least once with a business associate who has been linked to the GRU and , according to court documents , allegedly discussed polling data from the campaign , although the details about that meeting are n't clear .
And even as Trump 's political fortunes improved throughout 2016 , he and his deputies were negotiating with powerful Russians behind the scenes over a potential Trump Tower project in Moscow .
But prosecutors have n't established whether any contacts included information about Russia 's broader program of interference or specifically whether anyone in Trump 's camp knew that Russia was apparently behind the WikiLeaks releases .
Did Trump 's campaign know what the Russians were doing ? Or did it embrace the support it was getting without being aware of its ultimate benefactor ?
WikiLeaks has denied it received the stolen material from a Russian source . And it said on Friday of the Stone indictment that there was `` new evidence of no 'back channel ' with '' it . But , according to Mueller 's earlier indictment of 12 GRU officers , the Russian spies used the fake persona they created , `` Guccifer 2.0 , '' to give stolen material to WikiLeaks .
Prosecutors have n't made clear whether they believe Assange knew for certain that he was actually dealing with the Russian government , although Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , when he was director of the CIA , declared unequivocally that WikiLeaks is a `` hostile intelligence service . ''
In addition to the clandestine contacts , some actions took place in the open . Trump , for example , made a leitmotif of the emails that Hillary Clinton deleted from the private server she used while she was secretary of state .
On July 27 , 2016 , Trump said : `` Russia , if you 're listening , I hope you 're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing ... I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press . ''
There are suggestions that Russia was listening : According to Mueller 's indictment of 12 GRU officers , the Russian spy agency ramped up its cyberattacks against Clinton and her presidential campaign that same day .
Was Trump being facetious because he considered all the discussion about Russian election interference to be a joke ? Or did he have reason to expect that someone in Russia might be paying attention when he spoke ?
What communications did WikiLeaks potentially have with others in Stone 's circle ?
Much of the contact that prosecutors contend took place between Americans and WikiLeaks allegedly was actually via two Stone associates : conservative commentator Jerome Corsi and radio host Randy Credico , who has denied being a link between WikiLeaks and Stone .
A statement issued by Corsi 's lawyers on Friday says the Stone indictment vindicates Corsi — in Corsi 's view . Although Corsi contends that he testified truthfully before the grand jury and during his interviews with prosecutors , he may yet face charges of his own from the special counsel , as he has said he has already walked away from a plea agreement about alleged lying about his actions .
A passage in the indictment unsealed on Friday suggested that someone was telling Corsi not only about WikiLeaks ' intentions , but also about messaging for use against Clinton . Specifically , Corsi began to recommend to Stone that Clinton needed to be portrayed as unhealthy .

The Justice Department added another piece to the puzzle of its Russia investigation on Friday with charges against GOP political consultant Roger Stone — but the full picture still isn't complete.

Stone was arrested in Florida following an indictment by a grand jury working with the office of special counsel Robert Mueller.

Stone denied breaking the law and said he'll plead not guilty when he's arraigned later in Washington, D.C.

Prosecutors say Stone and at least two of his associates served as intermediaries between Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and ""Organization 1"" — as WikiLeaks is referred to in the court document — which fenced material stolen by the Russian government as part of the Kremlin's scheme to wreak havoc in the 2016 White House race.

After WikiLeaks released emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee in July 2016, ""a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone"" to ask what else WikiLeaks had planned.

Stone then pinged ""Person 1"" — conservative commentator Jerome Corsi — and instructed him to ""get the pending ... emails"" from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

That was the start of what appeared to be weeks of indirect communication between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks through Stone and his associates, according to the indictment — and, via WikiLeaks, with Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU.

The charges Stone is facing are about the accounts he gave to Congress about these events. Stone vowed Friday that he'll fight the charges and said he expects to be ""vindicated"" in court.

A Trump lawyer highlighted on Friday that the charges in the Stone indictment, however, aren't about collusion — they're about the statements Stone made to Congress and others.

""The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else,"" said Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow. ""Rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements Mr. Stone made to Congress.""

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders attempted to distance the president from the indictment and arrest.

""The president did nothing wrong,"" Sanders said in a Friday morning cable TV interview. ""There was no collusion.""

And the president himself has frequently asserted via Twitter in the past two years that there was ""NO COLLUSION!"" between his 2016 campaign and any Russian election interference effort and called suggestions to the otherwise a ""hoax."" Trump has also frequently referred to the Mueller investigation as a ""witch hunt.""

The Stone indictment raises as many questions as it answers. Although the account it gives clarifies a few key points about the events of 2016, there are also important things that it doesn't say.

Did any of the Americans know they were ultimately dealing with Russia?

In the summer of 2016, the fact of Russia's ""active measures"" was the subject of speculation, anonymous quotes and supposition — but was not officially confirmed in public.

Since then, Mueller's office has detailed some of Russia's practices: the use of social media agitation to deepen divisions among Americans and the cyberattacks against political and other targets in search of embarrassing dirt to release.

The question now is what Stone, Trump's then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump's family or Trump himself knew about what was taking place behind the scenes.

Trump has gone back and forth both then and now about what he accepts about the Russian election interference in 2016. But at the time, he was consistent about how much he loved WikiLeaks and urged voters to focus on what it was revealing about the Democrats, no matter where the material was coming from.

The inside game

The events of July 2016 followed many contacts by Russians or their agents with people in the Trump campaign — including a meeting the previous month hosted by Donald Trump Jr., following an offer of help for the campaign, again via intermediaries, from the Russian government.

Manafort also met at least once with a business associate who has been linked to the GRU and, according to court documents, allegedly discussed polling data from the campaign, although the details about that meeting aren't clear.

And even as Trump's political fortunes improved throughout 2016, he and his deputies were negotiating with powerful Russians behind the scenes over a potential Trump Tower project in Moscow.

But prosecutors haven't established whether any contacts included information about Russia's broader program of interference or specifically whether anyone in Trump's camp knew that Russia was apparently behind the WikiLeaks releases.

Did Trump's campaign know what the Russians were doing? Or did it embrace the support it was getting without being aware of its ultimate benefactor?

WikiLeaks has denied it received the stolen material from a Russian source. And it said on Friday of the Stone indictment that there was ""new evidence of no 'back channel' with"" it. But, according to Mueller's earlier indictment of 12 GRU officers, the Russian spies used the fake persona they created, ""Guccifer 2.0,"" to give stolen material to WikiLeaks.

Prosecutors haven't made clear whether they believe Assange knew for certain that he was actually dealing with the Russian government, although Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, when he was director of the CIA, declared unequivocally that WikiLeaks is a ""hostile intelligence service.""

The outside game

In addition to the clandestine contacts, some actions took place in the open. Trump, for example, made a leitmotif of the emails that Hillary Clinton deleted from the private server she used while she was secretary of state.

On July 27, 2016, Trump said: ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing ... I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.""

There are suggestions that Russia was listening: According to Mueller's indictment of 12 GRU officers, the Russian spy agency ramped up its cyberattacks against Clinton and her presidential campaign that same day.

Was Trump being facetious because he considered all the discussion about Russian election interference to be a joke? Or did he have reason to expect that someone in Russia might be paying attention when he spoke?

What communications did WikiLeaks potentially have with others in Stone's circle?

Much of the contact that prosecutors contend took place between Americans and WikiLeaks allegedly was actually via two Stone associates: conservative commentator Jerome Corsi and radio host Randy Credico, who has denied being a link between WikiLeaks and Stone.

A statement issued by Corsi's lawyers on Friday says the Stone indictment vindicates Corsi — in Corsi's view. Although Corsi contends that he testified truthfully before the grand jury and during his interviews with prosecutors, he may yet face charges of his own from the special counsel, as he has said he has already walked away from a plea agreement about alleged lying about his actions.

A passage in the indictment unsealed on Friday suggested that someone was telling Corsi not only about WikiLeaks' intentions, but also about messaging for use against Clinton. Specifically, Corsi began to recommend to Stone that Clinton needed to be portrayed as unhealthy.

""Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke — neither he nor she well,"" he wrote on Aug. 2, according to the indictment. ""I expect that much of next dump focus, setting stage for Foundation debacle.""

In fact, neither Clinton's health nor the Clinton Foundation were the focus of the next WikiLeaks release, but a messaging campaign based on Clinton's supposed ill health took off in August 2016.

Russia's state-controlled RT news site mentioned Clinton's ""bad health,"" the National Enquirer published a piece about it, Fox News host Sean Hannity discussed it on TV, and then Trump himself was warning about Clinton's fitness by Aug. 18.

Was Assange the conduit for this messaging strategy?

What action did the Trump campaign take based on its alleged communications with WikiLeaks?

Stone took credit, according to the indictment unsealed Friday, for telling the Trump campaign beforehand about the Oct. 7, 2016, release by WikiLeaks of emails stolen from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.

He has said since that he didn't have any inside information and he was just puffing up his own importance — taking things Assange was saying publicly and making it appear to Trump's campaign that Stone had learned them through some kind of inside line.

Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in December that Stone hadn't given the campaign a heads-up but that even if he had — as prosecutors now allege — that isn't a crime. Giuliani compared it to getting a tip that a newspaper is about to run a story before it appears.

And Stone, as he and others observed on Friday, isn't facing criminal charges related to the actions he took in 2016, but rather the accounts he has given about them afterward to Congress and other related activity.

If that suggests prosecutors don't consider Stone's underlying conduct itself to be illegal, it also raises questions about what he or Trump campaign leaders expected out of the warning about the Oct. 7 disclosure.

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Capitol Hill , June 13 , 2017 . ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )
We now have a redacted version of the deputy attorney general ’ s guidance to the special counsel .
Eight months ago , in August 2017 , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein secretly gave Special Counsel Robert Mueller specific guidance as to the crimes Mueller is authorized to investigate . The guidance came about ten weeks after Mueller ’ s May 17 appointment . This guidance purports to describe the grounds for criminal investigations , marking the limits of the special counsel ’ s jurisdiction .
As readers may recall , these columns have been critical of the deputy attorney general for failing to provide such guidance . Instead , I ’ ve contended , Rosenstein assigned Mueller to conduct a counterintelligence investigation , which is not a sound basis for appointing a special counsel ; the regulations require grounds for a criminal investigation .
So . . . was I wrong ? No , I was right .
We learned Tuesday morning , based on a Monday-night court filing by Mueller , that Rosenstein ’ s amplification of Mueller ’ s jurisdiction was set forth in a classified memorandum dated August 2 , 2017 . That memo was filed just one week after a July 26 column in which I comprehensively laid out the deficiencies in Rosenstein ’ s appointment order and suggested that he could cure the problem by “ specify [ ing ] exactly what potential crimes the special counsel is authorized to investigate. ” To be clear , I do not claim to be the only commentator who has criticized the deficiencies of Rosenstein ’ s appointment order , though I doubt others have done so as consistently and pointedly , including with proposals for bringing it into compliance . ( See , e.g. , “ Mend , Don ’ t End , Mueller ’ s Investigation . ” )
To recap , Rosenstein appointed Mueller on May 17 , 2017 , days after President Trump ’ s botched firing of FBI director James Comey — a debacle in which the administration ’ s conflicting explanations for the director ’ s removal , coupled with the president ’ s reprehensible comments about Comey for the consumption of Russian diplomats he hosted at the White House , intensified Democratic calls for a special counsel .
From the outset , I protested that Rosenstein ’ s order appointing Mueller violated governing special-counsel regulations . They make the trigger for such an appointment the existence of a “ criminal investigation of a person or matter , ” which some conflict of interest prevents the Justice Department from conducting in the normal course — requiring that an attorney from outside the U.S. government be assigned to conduct the criminal investigation ( see 28 CFR Sections 600.1 and 600.3 ) . To the contrary , Rosenstein ’ s order disclosed no basis for a criminal investigation and indicated no crimes that had allegedly been committed .
Instead , the deputy attorney general assigned Mueller to conduct a counterintelligence investigation . To wit , Rosenstein defined the probe as “ the investigation confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on March 20 , 2017. ” In that testimony , Comey had quite explicitly confirmed a counterintelligence probe : “ I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI , as part of our counterintelligence mission , is investigating the Russian government ’ s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election ” ( emphasis added ) .
Significantly , there is a natural symmetry between the grounds for appointing a special counsel and those for requiring the recusal of top Justice Department officials . It is the latter that gives rise to the former . I had thus argued that Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’ s recusal from the Russia investigation was premature and too sweeping . As the attorney general acknowledged , the recusal matter was controlled by 28 CFR Section 45.2 . But that regulation similarly states that disqualification is necessary only if there is a criminal investigation or prosecution as to which a prosecutor has a conflict of interest .
Since the Russia investigation was a counterintelligence investigation , I contended that Sessions could have declined to recuse . There was a caveat : In the event the Russia counterintelligence probe turned up evidence of crimes that would warrant criminal investigations , Sessions — because of his prominent role in the Trump campaign — would likely have to recuse himself from those investigations , on a case-by-case basis ( e.g. , if criminal charges were brought against Michael Flynn , as ultimately happened ) .
Sessions ’ s recusal in early March 2017 has been , ever since , the subject of heated overreaction by President Trump . While the president has a point because the recusal was too broad , he acts as if there were no basis for it at all . In point of fact , if the counterintelligence investigation were to yield grounds for criminal investigations that arose out of the campaign , including any implicating Trump himself , Sessions would have been bound by ethics rules to disqualify himself from those matters .
Trump ’ s apparent belief that the attorney general is there to shield the president from investigation is dangerously wrong .
The question , of course , is whether such grounds exist . Trump ’ s irritation that Sessions ’ s recusal could be taken as an implicit concession that there are such grounds is understandable . But Trump ’ s apparent belief that the attorney general is there to shield the president from investigation is dangerously wrong ; and the presidential wrath that bursts from this belief is , to put it mildly , unbecoming — the president ’ s disturbing penchant to act like a guilty man even if he is probably not one .
The tension between the president and the attorney general bubbled over ( as it occasionally has over the past year ) on July 19 , 2017 . That is when the New York Times published its interview with Trump , in which he said that he would not have appointed Sessions as AG had he known that Sessions would have recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation . There followed days of commentary over this eruption — including my own contribution , a column arguing that Trump had himself , not Sessions , to blame for the existence of a no-boundaries special counsel investigation .
The Times ’ interview of Trump and its aftermath brought renewed ( and , to my mind , welcome ) attention to Rosenstein ’ s failure to specify grounds for a criminal investigation that would justify the special-counsel appointment . In my aforementioned July 26 column , after ( yet again ) rehearsing why Rosenstein ’ s appointment order failed to comply with governing regulations , I closed with some observations and suggestions :
Not only is Mueller invited to conduct a fishing expedition , with no specified crimes limiting his investigative jurisdiction , but counterintelligence probes are classified . Consequently , Mueller ’ s investigation proceeds in total secrecy : no boundaries on what may be examined , and no disclosures about what the special counsel is examining and why . Instead of badgering his attorney general on Twitter , perhaps the president could , you know , act like a president and instruct his Justice Department to comply with federal regulations . Sessions could be directed to consider whether his recusal complies with the regulation that limits disqualification to criminal investigations as to which there is a conflict . To the extent it does not , he should amend the recusal to conform to the regulation . Rosenstein could be directed to consider whether his appointment of a special counsel complies with the regulations that limit such appointments to criminal investigations or prosecutions as to which the Justice Department is conflicted . He could further be directed to specify exactly what potential crimes the special counsel is authorized to investigate . [ Emphasis added . ] Finally , after Rosenstein specifies the crimes , Mueller could be invited to seek an expansion of his jurisdiction if he can demonstrate that he has legitimately found evidence of other crimes . If this were done , if the regulations were followed , all of us , including the president , would know what crimes the president is suspected of committing . . . if there are any .
We now know that on August 2 , Rosenstein issued a classified memorandum , undertaking to correct the appointment ’ s order ’ s deficiencies by describing various grounds for a criminal investigation .
It is worth considering how we have come to know about the memo .
About three weeks ago , Paul Manafort filed a motion to dismiss the money-laundering indictment Mueller filed against him in the District of Columbia ( and he has since filed a motion to dismiss the bank- and tax-fraud indictment Mueller filed against him in the Eastern District of Virginia ) . The motion to dismiss , which was foreshadowed by a civil lawsuit Manafort filed in January , claims that the special counsel ’ s charges against him , based on Manafort ’ s dealings with a Kremlin-backed Ukrainian political party , exceed the jurisdiction outlined in Rosenstein ’ s appointment order , which focuses on Russia ’ s interference in the 2016 election .
It is worth considering how we have come to know about the memo .
As I argued at the time , Manafort ’ s claim is a serious one ( although his tactic of raising it in a separate civil action , rather than in a motion to dismiss before the judge presiding over the criminal case , was improper ) . Nevertheless , I observed that Rosenstein could easily cure the deficiency of his appointment order by granting Mueller additional jurisdiction to investigate any crimes arising out of Manafort ’ s involvement with Ukraine .
It turns out that this is exactly what Rosenstein did ( among other things ) in his August 2 memo .
In the memo , the deputy attorney general claims that his original order appointing Mueller did not mention the criminal investigations Mueller was authorized to conduct because Rosenstein wanted to make the public aware that Mueller was being appointed “ without confirming specific investigations involving specific individuals . ”
Count me a skeptic . If that is what Rosenstein intended , he could have issued the classified memorandum defining Mueller ’ s jurisdiction at the same time he issued the appointment order — i.e. , on May 17 . After all , the special counsel ’ s jurisdiction to conduct criminal investigations is supposed to be established at the time of the special counsel ’ s appointment , not ten weeks later .
I believe Rosenstein amplified Mueller ’ s jurisdiction because he wisely concluded that the objections to his previous failure to do so had merit . Moreover , by August 2017 , Rosenstein had to have been anticipating Mueller ’ s indictment of Manafort ( along with Richard Gates ) , which occurred less than three months later . It would have been clear to Rosenstein and Mueller that they could face headwinds in the Manafort prosecution unless Rosenstein articulated a clearer jurisdictional basis for it .
The fact that Rosenstein ’ s August 2 memo is classified underscores the fact that the Russia probe is essentially a counterintelligence investigation . Such investigations are classified . In criminal investigations , sensitive information is tightly held , but it is almost never classified .
For now , there are several notable things about Rosenstein ’ s memo amplifying Mueller ’ s jurisdiction .
First , most of it is redacted . The memo is a little over two pages long . After some opening background , Rosenstein instructs Mueller , “ The following allegations were within the scope of the Investigation at the time of your appointment and are within the scope of the [ May 17 appointment ] Order. ” But after that , everything is blacked out except for two “ allegations ” regarding Paul Manafort . The redacted portion is four times bigger than the unredacted Manafort portion , so Rosenstein has obviously authorized Mueller to investigate several “ allegations ” about which we are still in the dark .
Do these include “ allegations ” that expressly name President Trump ? We do not know .
Second , I quote the memo ’ s use of allegation advisedly . The special-counsel regulations are not satisfied by mere allegations ; they require that there be factual grounds warranting a “ criminal investigation of a person or matter. ” Now , the regulation governing a special counsel ’ s jurisdiction ( Section 600.4 ) is unclear on how much must be said about the grounds for the investigation — the acting attorney general must give the special counsel “ a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated. ” I believe the term “ specific factual statement ” implies that more than a mere , conclusory allegation is required ; but others will counter the regulation is satisfied by what Rosenstein has provided : general outlines of potential crimes , in the form of allegations . The latter view , if correct , means the public is apt to be in the dark about why there is a special counsel .
Do these include ‘ allegations ’ that expressly name President Trump ? We do not know .
Third , the two unredacted allegations against Manafort bear examination . One is easy enough to grasp : the “ allegation ” that Manafort “ committed a crime or crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Victor Yanukovich. ” This is reflected by the two indictments Mueller has filed against Manafort ( and Gates , who has since entered a guilty plea to lesser charges and is reportedly cooperating ) .
It is the other allegation ( which is the first one that Rosenstein lists against Manafort ) that is intriguing : The “ allegation ” that Manafort
committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government ’ s efforts to interfere with the 2016 election for President of the United States , in violation of United States law .
As we ’ ve frequently observed , collusion is not a crime in and of itself — even “ colluding with Russian government officials. ” Concerted activity must rise to the level of conspiracy to commit a violation of federal criminal law ( or some similar form of joint criminal activity , such as aiding and abetting another person ’ s or entity ’ s commission of a federal crime ) . Rosenstein may invoke the words “ crime or crimes ” and the phrase “ in violation of United States law , ” but there is no factual statement describing actions that amount to concrete crimes .
In this sense , the August 2 memo ’ s amplification of Mueller ’ s jurisdiction is no more edifying than the May 17 appointment order ’ s original grant of jurisdiction , which authorized Mueller to investigate “ any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of Donald Trump. ” It is not a crime to have “ links ” to , or to “ coordinate ” with , Russia . To be sure , it would be a crime to , say , coordinate with Russia in the hacking of email accounts . But Rosenstein does not allege anything like that . So even with the amplification , we still do not know what crimes Rosenstein suspects , such that “ collusion ” should have prompted the appointment of a special counsel .
Finally , what is the source of an allegation that Manafort colluded with Russian officials “ with respect to the Russian government ’ s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election ” ?
Here , we must humbly concede , as these columns have many times , that we do not know everything the FBI knows . The government is conducting an investigation , and we are informed only about what officials choose to reveal . We know the government has been investigating Manafort for a long time , and we can safely assume that the FBI has been digging deeply into his Russian ties for any connections to the 2016 election . Withal , we can confidently say two things : ( 1 ) Despite facing many counts of serious criminal misconduct , Manafort has never been charged with any crime connected to Russia ’ s meddling in the 2016 election , and ( 2 ) the most notorious information to allege explicitly that Manafort conspired in Russia ’ s election meddling is the Steele dossier — the unverified reports compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele , whose political opposition research project was sponsored by the Hillary Clinton campaign .
Of course , we know about the government ’ s use of the Steele dossier in connection with the investigation of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page . It appears that uncorroborated and highly suspect dossier allegations were used to apply for a FISA warrant against Page because the government would have lacked probable cause without them . The FISA court was not informed that Clinton campaign was behind the dossier .
By contrast , we do not know to what extent , if any , the dossier was exploited in the investigation of Manafort . CNN has reported that Manafort was also the target of surveillance warrants , but I do not believe that reporting has been confirmed by the Justice Department , any congressional committee , or any other government source . Assuming that Manafort was surveilled , we might also have assumed that his years of shady activities with Kremlin-backed Ukrainians would have given the government the probable-cause needed to justify any FISA warrants — i.e. , it would have been unnecessary for the government to resort to Steele ’ s suspect claims , as it did with Page . Based on anonymous sources , CNN ’ s report suggests that Manafort was surveilled around the same time that Page was ( late 2016 into 2017 ) , but that this monitoring was prompted by “ communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives , and among the Russians themselves . ”
Does the Steele dossier form any part of the government ’ s basis for Rosenstein ’ s allegation that Manafort was complicit in Russia ’ s interference in the election ?
If not , what is the factual basis of that allegation , which to date has resulted in no formal charges against Manafort ?
Do the extensive redacted portions of Rosenstein ’ s memo contain allegations that other named Trump campaign officials were complicit in Russia ’ s interference in the 2016 election ?
Are those allegations , if any , based in any way on the Steele dossier ?
If not , what is the factual basis for alleging that the named Trump campaign officials were complicit in Russia ’ s interference in the 2016 election ?
Is President Trump among the individuals named in Rosenstein ’ s allegations ?
Suffice it to say , we remain uninformed regarding the government ’ s basis for alleging that ‘ collusion ’ with Russia resulted in potential crimes warranting investigation .
Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein is to be commended for attempting to rectify the deficiencies in his original special-counsel appointment order by issuing a memo that amplifies Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s jurisdiction to conduct criminal investigations . Rosenstein ’ s explanation for the timing of the memo ( ten weeks after the appointment order ) is not very convincing , and the extensively redacted form in which it has been released means the memo raises more questions than it answers . Suffice it to say , we remain uninformed regarding the government ’ s basis for alleging that “ collusion ” with Russia resulted in potential crimes warranting investigation ; and we still do not know if the Justice Department alleges that President Trump is a criminal suspect — and , if so , in what crime .","Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Capitol Hill, June 13, 2017.

That memo was filed just one week after a July 26 column in which I comprehensively laid out the deficiencies in Rosenstein’s appointment order and suggested that he could cure the problem by “specify[ing] exactly what potential crimes the special counsel is authorized to investigate.” To be clear, I do not claim to be the only commentator who has criticized the deficiencies of Rosenstein’s appointment order, though I doubt others have done so as consistently and pointedly, including with proposals for bringing it into compliance. (See, e.g., “Mend, Don’t End, Mueller’s Investigation.”)

The Deficiencies of Rosenstein’s Order Appointing Mueller

To recap, Rosenstein appointed Mueller on May 17, 2017, days after President Trump’s botched firing of FBI director James Comey — a debacle in which the administration’s conflicting explanations for the director’s removal, coupled with the president’s reprehensible comments about Comey for the consumption of Russian diplomats he hosted at the White House, intensified Democratic calls for a special counsel.

From the outset, I protested that Rosenstein’s order appointing Mueller violated governing special-counsel regulations. They make the trigger for such an appointment the existence of a “criminal investigation of a person or matter,” which some conflict of interest prevents the Justice Department from conducting in the normal course — requiring that an attorney from outside the U.S. government be assigned to conduct the criminal investigation (see 28 CFR Sections 600.1 and 600.3). To the contrary, Rosenstein’s order disclosed no basis for a criminal investigation and indicated no crimes that had allegedly been committed.

Instead, the deputy attorney general assigned Mueller to conduct a counterintelligence investigation. To wit, Rosenstein defined the probe as “the investigation confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017.” In that testimony, Comey had quite explicitly confirmed a counterintelligence probe: “I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election” (emphasis added).

Significantly, there is a natural symmetry between the grounds for appointing a special counsel and those for requiring the recusal of top Justice Department officials. It is the latter that gives rise to the former. I had thus argued that Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation was premature and too sweeping. As the attorney general acknowledged, the recusal matter was controlled by 28 CFR Section 45.2. But that regulation similarly states that disqualification is necessary only if there is a criminal investigation or prosecution as to which a prosecutor has a conflict of interest.

Since the Russia investigation was a counterintelligence investigation, I contended that Sessions could have declined to recuse. There was a caveat: In the event the Russia counterintelligence probe turned up evidence of crimes that would warrant criminal investigations, Sessions — because of his prominent role in the Trump campaign — would likely have to recuse himself from those investigations, on a case-by-case basis (e.g., if criminal charges were brought against Michael Flynn, as ultimately happened).

Sessions’s recusal in early March 2017 has been, ever since, the subject of heated overreaction by President Trump. While the president has a point because the recusal was too broad, he acts as if there were no basis for it at all. In point of fact, if the counterintelligence investigation were to yield grounds for criminal investigations that arose out of the campaign, including any implicating Trump himself, Sessions would have been bound by ethics rules to disqualify himself from those matters.

Trump’s apparent belief that the attorney general is there to shield the president from investigation is dangerously wrong.

The question, of course, is whether such grounds exist. Trump’s irritation that Sessions’s recusal could be taken as an implicit concession that there are such grounds is understandable. But Trump’s apparent belief that the attorney general is there to shield the president from investigation is dangerously wrong; and the presidential wrath that bursts from this belief is, to put it mildly, unbecoming — the president’s disturbing penchant to act like a guilty man even if he is probably not one.

The tension between the president and the attorney general bubbled over (as it occasionally has over the past year) on July 19, 2017. That is when the New York Times published its interview with Trump, in which he said that he would not have appointed Sessions as AG had he known that Sessions would have recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. There followed days of commentary over this eruption — including my own contribution, a column arguing that Trump had himself, not Sessions, to blame for the existence of a no-boundaries special counsel investigation.

Proposing That Rosenstein Specify Mueller’s Jurisdiction

The Times’ interview of Trump and its aftermath brought renewed (and, to my mind, welcome) attention to Rosenstein’s failure to specify grounds for a criminal investigation that would justify the special-counsel appointment. In my aforementioned July 26 column, after (yet again) rehearsing why Rosenstein’s appointment order failed to comply with governing regulations, I closed with some observations and suggestions:

Not only is Mueller invited to conduct a fishing expedition, with no specified crimes limiting his investigative jurisdiction, but counterintelligence probes are classified. Consequently, Mueller’s investigation proceeds in total secrecy: no boundaries on what may be examined, and no disclosures about what the special counsel is examining and why. Instead of badgering his attorney general on Twitter, perhaps the president could, you know, act like a president and instruct his Justice Department to comply with federal regulations. Sessions could be directed to consider whether his recusal complies with the regulation that limits disqualification to criminal investigations as to which there is a conflict. To the extent it does not, he should amend the recusal to conform to the regulation. Rosenstein could be directed to consider whether his appointment of a special counsel complies with the regulations that limit such appointments to criminal investigations or prosecutions as to which the Justice Department is conflicted. He could further be directed to specify exactly what potential crimes the special counsel is authorized to investigate. [Emphasis added.] Finally, after Rosenstein specifies the crimes, Mueller could be invited to seek an expansion of his jurisdiction if he can demonstrate that he has legitimately found evidence of other crimes. If this were done, if the regulations were followed, all of us, including the president, would know what crimes the president is suspected of committing . . . if there are any.

We now know that on August 2, Rosenstein issued a classified memorandum, undertaking to correct the appointment’s order’s deficiencies by describing various grounds for a criminal investigation.

Manafort’s Motion to Dismiss Mueller’s Charges

It is worth considering how we have come to know about the memo.

About three weeks ago, Paul Manafort filed a motion to dismiss the money-laundering indictment Mueller filed against him in the District of Columbia (and he has since filed a motion to dismiss the bank- and tax-fraud indictment Mueller filed against him in the Eastern District of Virginia). The motion to dismiss, which was foreshadowed by a civil lawsuit Manafort filed in January, claims that the special counsel’s charges against him, based on Manafort’s dealings with a Kremlin-backed Ukrainian political party, exceed the jurisdiction outlined in Rosenstein’s appointment order, which focuses on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

It is worth considering how we have come to know about the memo.

As I argued at the time, Manafort’s claim is a serious one (although his tactic of raising it in a separate civil action, rather than in a motion to dismiss before the judge presiding over the criminal case, was improper). Nevertheless, I observed that Rosenstein could easily cure the deficiency of his appointment order by granting Mueller additional jurisdiction to investigate any crimes arising out of Manafort’s involvement with Ukraine.

It turns out that this is exactly what Rosenstein did (among other things) in his August 2 memo.

Why Did Rosenstein Write the August 2 Memo?

In the memo, the deputy attorney general claims that his original order appointing Mueller did not mention the criminal investigations Mueller was authorized to conduct because Rosenstein wanted to make the public aware that Mueller was being appointed “without confirming specific investigations involving specific individuals.”

Count me a skeptic. If that is what Rosenstein intended, he could have issued the classified memorandum defining Mueller’s jurisdiction at the same time he issued the appointment order — i.e., on May 17. After all, the special counsel’s jurisdiction to conduct criminal investigations is supposed to be established at the time of the special counsel’s appointment, not ten weeks later.

I believe Rosenstein amplified Mueller’s jurisdiction because he wisely concluded that the objections to his previous failure to do so had merit. Moreover, by August 2017, Rosenstein had to have been anticipating Mueller’s indictment of Manafort (along with Richard Gates), which occurred less than three months later. It would have been clear to Rosenstein and Mueller that they could face headwinds in the Manafort prosecution unless Rosenstein articulated a clearer jurisdictional basis for it.

The fact that Rosenstein’s August 2 memo is classified underscores the fact that the Russia probe is essentially a counterintelligence investigation. Such investigations are classified. In criminal investigations, sensitive information is tightly held, but it is almost never classified.

Heavily Redacted ‘Allegations’ of ‘Collusion’

For now, there are several notable things about Rosenstein’s memo amplifying Mueller’s jurisdiction.

First, most of it is redacted. The memo is a little over two pages long. After some opening background, Rosenstein instructs Mueller, “The following allegations were within the scope of the Investigation at the time of your appointment and are within the scope of the [May 17 appointment] Order.” But after that, everything is blacked out except for two “allegations” regarding Paul Manafort. The redacted portion is four times bigger than the unredacted Manafort portion, so Rosenstein has obviously authorized Mueller to investigate several “allegations” about which we are still in the dark.

Do these include “allegations” that expressly name President Trump? We do not know.

Second, I quote the memo’s use of allegation advisedly. The special-counsel regulations are not satisfied by mere allegations; they require that there be factual grounds warranting a “criminal investigation of a person or matter.” Now, the regulation governing a special counsel’s jurisdiction (Section 600.4) is unclear on how much must be said about the grounds for the investigation — the acting attorney general must give the special counsel “a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated.” I believe the term “specific factual statement” implies that more than a mere, conclusory allegation is required; but others will counter the regulation is satisfied by what Rosenstein has provided: general outlines of potential crimes, in the form of allegations. The latter view, if correct, means the public is apt to be in the dark about why there is a special counsel.

Do these include ‘allegations’ that expressly name President Trump? We do not know.

Third, the two unredacted allegations against Manafort bear examination. One is easy enough to grasp: the “allegation” that Manafort “committed a crime or crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Victor Yanukovich.” This is reflected by the two indictments Mueller has filed against Manafort (and Gates, who has since entered a guilty plea to lesser charges and is reportedly cooperating).

It is the other allegation (which is the first one that Rosenstein lists against Manafort) that is intriguing: The “allegation” that Manafort

committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 election for President of the United States, in violation of United States law.

As we’ve frequently observed, collusion is not a crime in and of itself — even “colluding with Russian government officials.” Concerted activity must rise to the level of conspiracy to commit a violation of federal criminal law (or some similar form of joint criminal activity, such as aiding and abetting another person’s or entity’s commission of a federal crime). Rosenstein may invoke the words “crime or crimes” and the phrase “in violation of United States law,” but there is no factual statement describing actions that amount to concrete crimes.

In this sense, the August 2 memo’s amplification of Mueller’s jurisdiction is no more edifying than the May 17 appointment order’s original grant of jurisdiction, which authorized Mueller to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of Donald Trump.” It is not a crime to have “links” to, or to “coordinate” with, Russia. To be sure, it would be a crime to, say, coordinate with Russia in the hacking of email accounts. But Rosenstein does not allege anything like that. So even with the amplification, we still do not know what crimes Rosenstein suspects, such that “collusion” should have prompted the appointment of a special counsel.

Is the Steele Dossier Involved?

Advertisement

Finally, what is the source of an allegation that Manafort colluded with Russian officials “with respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election”?

Here, we must humbly concede, as these columns have many times, that we do not know everything the FBI knows. The government is conducting an investigation, and we are informed only about what officials choose to reveal. We know the government has been investigating Manafort for a long time, and we can safely assume that the FBI has been digging deeply into his Russian ties for any connections to the 2016 election. Withal, we can confidently say two things: (1) Despite facing many counts of serious criminal misconduct, Manafort has never been charged with any crime connected to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, and (2) the most notorious information to allege explicitly that Manafort conspired in Russia’s election meddling is the Steele dossier — the unverified reports compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, whose political opposition research project was sponsored by the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Of course, we know about the government’s use of the Steele dossier in connection with the investigation of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It appears that uncorroborated and highly suspect dossier allegations were used to apply for a FISA warrant against Page because the government would have lacked probable cause without them. The FISA court was not informed that Clinton campaign was behind the dossier.

By contrast, we do not know to what extent, if any, the dossier was exploited in the investigation of Manafort. CNN has reported that Manafort was also the target of surveillance warrants, but I do not believe that reporting has been confirmed by the Justice Department, any congressional committee, or any other government source. Assuming that Manafort was surveilled, we might also have assumed that his years of shady activities with Kremlin-backed Ukrainians would have given the government the probable-cause needed to justify any FISA warrants — i.e., it would have been unnecessary for the government to resort to Steele’s suspect claims, as it did with Page. Based on anonymous sources, CNN’s report suggests that Manafort was surveilled around the same time that Page was (late 2016 into 2017), but that this monitoring was prompted by “communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives, and among the Russians themselves.”

Thus, the questions arise:

Does the Steele dossier form any part of the government’s basis for Rosenstein’s allegation that Manafort was complicit in Russia’s interference in the election?

If not, what is the factual basis of that allegation, which to date has resulted in no formal charges against Manafort?

Do the extensive redacted portions of Rosenstein’s memo contain allegations that other named Trump campaign officials were complicit in Russia’s interference in the 2016 election?

Are those allegations, if any, based in any way on the Steele dossier?

If not, what is the factual basis for alleging that the named Trump campaign officials were complicit in Russia’s interference in the 2016 election?

Is President Trump among the individuals named in Rosenstein’s allegations?

Suffice it to say, we remain uninformed regarding the government’s basis for alleging that ‘collusion’ with Russia resulted in potential crimes warranting investigation.

Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein is to be commended for attempting to rectify the deficiencies in his original special-counsel appointment order by issuing a memo that amplifies Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s jurisdiction to conduct criminal investigations. Rosenstein’s explanation for the timing of the memo (ten weeks after the appointment order) is not very convincing, and the extensively redacted form in which it has been released means the memo raises more questions than it answers. Suffice it to say, we remain uninformed regarding the government’s basis for alleging that “collusion” with Russia resulted in potential crimes warranting investigation; and we still do not know if the Justice Department alleges that President Trump is a criminal suspect — and, if so, in what crime.",www.nationalreview.com,right,Wocy06geDCxZGhYt

Moreover , Bolton also corroborates the testimony of Gordon Sondland , the former U.S. ambassador to the European Union who testified that “ everyone was in the loop. ” Indeed they were , including the secretary of State , the Defense secretary and Attorney General William Barr .

According to Bolton , Trump also undermined the values of our country by telling Xi that not only was it appropriate for the Chinese leader to imprison millions of Uighurs in detention camps , but also that it was the right thing to do .

Last week, we witnessed the reemergence of John Bolton, the president’s former national security adviser, and the release of his book. In it, Bolton describes his personal experiences with Donald Trump and his great alarm at Trump’s incompetence, his dangerous subordination of our national security to his own personal interests, and his fundamental indecency.

In short, Bolton is telling Americans what we already know. That the president is exactly what he appears to be: petty, self-serving, ignorant and utterly supplicant to autocrats in China, Turkey, North Korea and Russia.

We proved during the impeachment trial that Trump withheld hundreds of millions in military aid to Ukraine to coerce that country into announcing a sham investigation of his political rival. Bolton confirms our case and provides additional evidence of that flagrant abuse of power by providing a firsthand account of how Trump confirmed this illicit quid pro quo during a conversation they had. Moreover, Bolton also corroborates the testimony of Gordon Sondland, the former U.S. ambassador to the European Union who testified that “everyone was in the loop.” Indeed they were, including the secretary of State, the Defense secretary and Attorney General William Barr.

Betrayal of American values

But Bolton does more than just confirm the impeachment charges. During the trial, I raised a hypothetical question about China intervening in our election and whether Trump would resist such interference — or offer China a better trade deal, instead. As it turns out, this was no hypothetical. Bolton details how Trump sought reelection help from China, at one point begging Chinese President Xi Jinping for assistance and apparently offering trade concessions to get it.

According to Bolton, Trump also undermined the values of our country by telling Xi that not only was it appropriate for the Chinese leader to imprison millions of Uighurs in detention camps, but also that it was the right thing to do. This is a stunning betrayal of everything America stands for and can only be understood in the context of Trump’s desperation to secure China’s help for his reelection.

No wonder, too, that while a new virus was threatening the health of our citizens, President Trump continued singing China’s praises while knowing that China was concealing important information about the virus’ spread.

Most damning, though, is Bolton’s confirmation of our central charge during Trump’s impeachment — that the country could not trust Donald Trump to do what’s right for the United States but only what was right for Donald Trump. As Bolton wrote: “I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn't driven by reelection calculations.”

Given his damning portrait of a dangerously out-of-control U.S. president, and the astonishing degree to which Bolton possessed evidence directly relevant to our impeachment investigation, what are we to make of Bolton’s decision to withhold this information until he could profit from it? Only this, that John Bolton is no patriot. To the same extent and in the same degree in which he condemns Trump, Bolton indicts himself for putting profit above patriotism.

Our view:Bolton's book shocks but doesn't surprise

Thankfully, there were true patriots on Bolton’s staff and elsewhere in the government that told Congress what they knew when asked by the House to testify about Trump’s corrupt scheme. They did the right thing, sometimes at significant personal and professional cost. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman has faced a retaliatory firing from the National Security Council and now could be denied a promotion because he told the truth. Because in his indelible words, “This is America. ... And here, right matters.”

Cowardice instead of courage

Bolton had his opportunity to join Vindman, Fiona Hill, Tim Morrison, Marie Yovanovitch, Bill Taylor and many others who displayed great courage in testifying. But he refused. Repeatedly.

And though it feels like a lifetime ago, it has hardly been five months thatI asked the Senate this rhetorical question about Trump — “How much damage can he do between now and the next election? A lot. A lot of damage.”

None of the above:Bolton has a habit of toppling leaders but having no replacement in mind

Over 125,000 Americans are now dead from COVID-19. Tens of millions are unemployed. During a time of national reckoning over systemic racism, Trump does nothing but sow division and use the levers of his power to attack his enemies. And it’s only June.

When our history is written, Donald Trump will be judged harshly, as will those Republican members of the Senate who refused to stand up to him in the face of such graphic evidence of wrongdoing and unfitness for office. But neither will it be kind to John Bolton, who had a chance to make a difference and chose to make a profit instead.

It’s not all about Russia.

The House Intelligence Committee has reportedly issued seven subpoenas in connection with its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and of the Obama administration’s potentially illegal use of the government’s foreign-intelligence-collection power for the purpose of monitoring Americans — in particular, Americans connected to the Trump campaign and transition.

The most intriguing detail of the subpoenas is the demand for any information related to requests for unmasking by Samantha Power, President Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations.

“Unmasking” is the revealing in intelligence reports of the identities of Americans whose communications (or information about whom) have been “incidentally” intercepted during foreign-intelligence-collection operations.

Of course, the fact that a subpoena demanding information is issued does not necessarily mean the information exists. Nevertheless, the issuance of a subpoena implies that the issuer has a good-faith basis to believe it does. On that score, it has previously been reported that the committee’s chairman, Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), has reviewed intelligence reporting and detected instances of unmasking.

Were there to be information indicating that Ms. Power was involved in unmasking American identities in intelligence reports, significant questions would be raised. As ambassador to the U.N., Power, a long-time Obama adviser, held a diplomatic position. She was not an intelligence analyst.

WASHINGTON — A series of explosive memos prepared by former FBI director James Comey about his troubling encounters with President Trump were released Thursday and closely tracked Comey's description of them in congressional testimony and in a new book Comey has authored.

The memos, provided to Congress late Thursday, also had previously been provided to Justice special counsel Robert Mueller to assist his investigation into Trump's possible attempts to obstruct the probe of Russia's interference in the 2016 elections.

European and Middle Eastern agencies that have information-sharing relationships with the U.S. , already wary of the Trump team ’ s perceived closeness to Russian officials , are now watching with increased trepidation as a vicious fight boils over in Washington over intelligence leaks surrounding the Flynn case , current and former officials told The ███ on Wednesday .
“ Our foreign partners are deeply alarmed and unsettled by what they ’ re seeing in Washington , ” said one senior Republican national security source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
The source , who meets regularly with senior foreign intelligence and security officials from several nations , spoke just hours after President Trump escalated the battle Wednesday by doubling down on his accusation — on Twitter and at a White House press conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , that the nation ’ s intelligence agencies were behind the classified leaks to certain news organizations out of retaliation against him for defeating Hillary Clinton in the November election .
“ From intelligence , papers are being leaked , things are being leaked , it ’ s criminal action , a criminal act , ” Mr. Trump said , with Mr. Netanyahu standing nearby . “ It ’ s been going on for a long time , before me , but now it ’ s really going on . People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton . ”
Mr. Trump and his supporters have repeatedly argued that it ’ s the illegal leaks — not the content showing Mr. Flynn ’ s contacts with Russia ’ s ambassador to Washington — that is the real scandal , in some cases explicitly comparing the leaks to abuse of private information under FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover . Critics says the president and his team are simply trying to deflect attention from the scandal engulfing the administration .
“ I think the leaks are an important issue , but [ focusing on them ] is like shooting the messenger , ” Sen. Angus King , a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats , told CNN on Wednesday .
“ I think it ’ s very , very unfair what ’ s happened to Gen. Flynn , the way he was treated , and documents and papers that were illegally , I stress that , illegally leaked , ” Mr. Trump told reporters .
He dispatched a flurry of furious messages on Twitter , asserting that The Washington Post and The New York Times , specifically , are being misled by intelligence community leaks , and outright denying that any improper or illegal communications have ever occurred between Russian officials and Mr. Flynn , or anyone else on the Trump team .
“ This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton ’ s losing campaign , ” the president tweeted early Wednesday morning , adding the following , confusingly worded addition moments later : “ Information is being illegally given to the failing @ nytimes & @ washingtonpost by the intelligence community ( NSA and FBI ? ) .Just like Russia . ”
But the president has stopped short of naming individuals who he believes are behind leaks relating the conversations between Mr. Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak . A range of current and former officials are believed to have — or have had — access to such information , including FBI Director James B. Comey , former acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates , former Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and former CIA Director John O. Brennan , among others .
Mr. Brennan , who retired as CIA director when Mr. Trump took office , was particularly scathing over what he said was the president ’ s unfair attacks on the work of the country ’ s spies .
“ I think Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia of various actions it has taken in the past number of years is a road that he needs to be very , very careful about moving down , ” Mr. Brennan lectured then-President-elect Trump on Fox News Sunday last month . “ If he doesn ’ t have confidence in the intelligence community , what signal does that send to our partners and allies as well as our adversaries ? ”
When Mr. Trump made a visit to CIA headquarters on his first full day as president , Mr. Brennan denounced his remarks , which mixed tributes to the professionalism of the nation ’ s intelligence agents with political remarks , attacks on the media and a review of the debate over the size of his Inauguration Day crowd .
Through a spokesman , Mr. Brennan called the speech a “ despicable display of self-aggrandizement ” and that Mr. Trump “ should be ashamed of himself . ”
The fight may now be shifting to Capitol Hill , where debate is raging over how to handle a probe into the White House ’ s Russian ties , charges of Russian meddling in the presidential election and the role that intelligence agency leaks played in the controversies .
Key Republicans , including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , have said the events leading up to Mr. Flynn ’ s dismissal should be added to the focus on any such probe . But some Republicans have pushed back , suggesting the true focus of any congressional investigation should center on the issue of classified information leaks .
“ The leak of highly classified information by a number of individuals inside our intelligence community is the illegal act that I think we need to review , ” said Rep. Mike Johnson , Louisiana Republican and a member of the House Judiciary Committee .
“ We ’ ve got to find out if we have a problem internally . That could be a serious threat to the country going forward . And these are very serious implications , ” he told NPR .
Mr. Johnson added that “ it ’ s illegal for the CIA , for example , to spy , even incidentally , on Americans unless strict parameters are met . And it just simply doesn ’ t appear that that happened in this case . ”
His comments targeted a deeper fear of an open break between the commander in chief and the foreign and domestic intelligence agencies charged with providing him the unbiased best information on which to make decisions of war and peace .
Even some key Democrats have acknowledged the damage that current and former American spies can do to undermine a president they do not feel supports them .
“ They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you , ” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , warned during an early-January interview on MSNBC .
One former senior official with close ties the highest echelons of the intelligence community said Mr. Trump “ has been hugely foolish ” by “ systematically , consciously and intentionally insulting everyone who can or should hold him accountable : his party , more broadly the Congress ; reporters and more broadly the [ press ] ; the director of the FBI ; judges , and more broadly the courts ; the CIA , and more broadly the intelligence community . ”
“ I wouldn ’ t for a second propose they ’ re now out to get him , but there will be less and less benefit of the doubt given as time passes , ” the former official said . “ And time is passing extraordinarily fast for him and his actions . His flawed judgment and his character flaws are collapsing in on him . ”
The senior Republican national security source who spoke with The Times said tensions are running high on Capitol Hill over the Flynn affair .
“ We feel like this could be just the tip of the iceberg , and that ’ s what ’ s making Republicans nervous behind closed doors , ” the source said . “ In the past 24 hours , I ’ ve heard so many Republican operatives saying privately that , if this thing got to the level of high crimes and misdemeanor , there wouldn ’ t be a lot of love lost if Trump had to go and be replaced by [ Vice President Mike ] Pence . ”
Paul Pillar , a former CIA official who teaches at Georgetown University , said Wednesday that “ we have probably the worst relationship between U.S. intelligence agencies and the White House during the first month of an administration that we ’ ve seen in recent memory . ”
The situation harks of the acrimony that swept Washington in 1969 , when President Nixon arrived with an outspoken grudge against the CIA , dating back , historians say , to Nixon ’ s anger that the agency failed to debunk Sen.

Mr . Pillar said the current circumstances make it “ much more difficult for the intelligence community to perform its functional mission of informing the president on U.S. foreign policy . ”

Our intelligence partners will be reassured when the administration conveys a clear-eyed , objective and historically grounded assessment about Russia ’ s malign intent toward the U.S. and its allies . ”","The Trump White House and the U.S. intelligence community moved closer to open warfare in the wake of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s spectacular downfall — and the fallout is unnerving key American intelligence partners around the world, according to several high-level national security sources.

European and Middle Eastern agencies that have information-sharing relationships with the U.S., already wary of the Trump team’s perceived closeness to Russian officials, are now watching with increased trepidation as a vicious fight boils over in Washington over intelligence leaks surrounding the Flynn case, current and former officials told The Washington Times on Wednesday.

“Our foreign partners are deeply alarmed and unsettled by what they’re seeing in Washington,” said one senior Republican national security source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The source, who meets regularly with senior foreign intelligence and security officials from several nations, spoke just hours after President Trump escalated the battle Wednesday by doubling down on his accusation — on Twitter and at a White House press conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that the nation’s intelligence agencies were behind the classified leaks to certain news organizations out of retaliation against him for defeating Hillary Clinton in the November election.

“From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked, it’s criminal action, a criminal act,” Mr. Trump said, with Mr. Netanyahu standing nearby. “It’s been going on for a long time, before me, but now it’s really going on. People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.”

Mr. Trump and his supporters have repeatedly argued that it’s the illegal leaks — not the content showing Mr. Flynn’s contacts with Russia’s ambassador to Washington — that is the real scandal, in some cases explicitly comparing the leaks to abuse of private information under FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Critics says the president and his team are simply trying to deflect attention from the scandal engulfing the administration.

“I think the leaks are an important issue, but [focusing on them] is like shooting the messenger,” Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN on Wednesday.

But Mr. Trump was not mollified.

“I think it’s very, very unfair what’s happened to Gen. Flynn, the way he was treated, and documents and papers that were illegally, I stress that, illegally leaked,” Mr. Trump told reporters.

He dispatched a flurry of furious messages on Twitter, asserting that The Washington Post and The New York Times, specifically, are being misled by intelligence community leaks, and outright denying that any improper or illegal communications have ever occurred between Russian officials and Mr. Flynn, or anyone else on the Trump team.

“This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign,” the president tweeted early Wednesday morning, adding the following, confusingly worded addition moments later: “Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia.”

But the president has stopped short of naming individuals who he believes are behind leaks relating the conversations between Mr. Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. A range of current and former officials are believed to have — or have had — access to such information, including FBI Director James B. Comey, former acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates, former Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and former CIA Director John O. Brennan, among others.

Mr. Brennan, who retired as CIA director when Mr. Trump took office, was particularly scathing over what he said was the president’s unfair attacks on the work of the country’s spies.

“I think Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia of various actions it has taken in the past number of years is a road that he needs to be very, very careful about moving down ,” Mr. Brennan lectured then-President-elect Trump on Fox News Sunday last month. “If he doesn’t have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies as well as our adversaries?”

When Mr. Trump made a visit to CIA headquarters on his first full day as president, Mr. Brennan denounced his remarks, which mixed tributes to the professionalism of the nation’s intelligence agents with political remarks, attacks on the media and a review of the debate over the size of his Inauguration Day crowd.

Through a spokesman, Mr. Brennan called the speech a “despicable display of self-aggrandizement” and that Mr. Trump “should be ashamed of himself.”

Focusing on the leaks

The fight may now be shifting to Capitol Hill, where debate is raging over how to handle a probe into the White House’s Russian ties, charges of Russian meddling in the presidential election and the role that intelligence agency leaks played in the controversies.

Key Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have said the events leading up to Mr. Flynn’s dismissal should be added to the focus on any such probe. But some Republicans have pushed back, suggesting the true focus of any congressional investigation should center on the issue of classified information leaks.

“The leak of highly classified information by a number of individuals inside our intelligence community is the illegal act that I think we need to review,” said Rep. Mike Johnson, Louisiana Republican and a member of the House Judiciary Committee.

“We’ve got to find out if we have a problem internally. That could be a serious threat to the country going forward. And these are very serious implications,” he told NPR.

Mr. Johnson added that “it’s illegal for the CIA, for example, to spy, even incidentally, on Americans unless strict parameters are met. And it just simply doesn’t appear that that happened in this case.”

His comments targeted a deeper fear of an open break between the commander in chief and the foreign and domestic intelligence agencies charged with providing him the unbiased best information on which to make decisions of war and peace.

Even some key Democrats have acknowledged the damage that current and former American spies can do to undermine a president they do not feel supports them.

“They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, warned during an early-January interview on MSNBC.

One former senior official with close ties the highest echelons of the intelligence community said Mr. Trump “has been hugely foolish” by “systematically, consciously and intentionally insulting everyone who can or should hold him accountable: his party, more broadly the Congress; reporters and more broadly the [press]; the director of the FBI; judges, and more broadly the courts; the CIA, and more broadly the intelligence community.”

“I wouldn’t for a second propose they’re now out to get him, but there will be less and less benefit of the doubt given as time passes,” the former official said. “And time is passing extraordinarily fast for him and his actions. His flawed judgment and his character flaws are collapsing in on him.”

The senior Republican national security source who spoke with The Times said tensions are running high on Capitol Hill over the Flynn affair.

“We feel like this could be just the tip of the iceberg, and that’s what’s making Republicans nervous behind closed doors,” the source said. “In the past 24 hours, I’ve heard so many Republican operatives saying privately that, if this thing got to the level of high crimes and misdemeanor, there wouldn’t be a lot of love lost if Trump had to go and be replaced by [Vice President Mike] Pence.”

Nixon parallels

Paul Pillar, a former CIA official who teaches at Georgetown University, said Wednesday that “we have probably the worst relationship between U.S. intelligence agencies and the White House during the first month of an administration that we’ve seen in recent memory.”

The situation harks of the acrimony that swept Washington in 1969, when President Nixon arrived with an outspoken grudge against the CIA, dating back, historians say, to Nixon’s anger that the agency failed to debunk Sen. John F. Kennedy’s claims of a “missile gap” with the Soviet Union in the 1960 presidential election.

Mr. Pillar said the current circumstances make it “much more difficult for the intelligence community to perform its functional mission of informing the president on U.S. foreign policy.”

While Mr. Trump may have real distrust of the intelligence community, there are also worries and distrust among intelligence officials over the relationships that Russian officials appear to have with high levels of the administration, Mr. Pillar said.

“To the extent that people are concerned about what information might be compromised to the Russians, that just adds to the problem of the sort of free communications between intelligence officers and senior administration officials,” he said. “Friends and allies with whom for many years we’ve had good relationships are also worried about that.

“It is definitely impacting information-sharing with our partners,” added the senior Republican national security source. “Our interlocutors are more nervous to convey their perspective and much more cautious about being candid. They’ve seized up.”

Stephen Slick, who spent 28 years in the CIA’s clandestine service and now heads the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin, added that “few outsiders understand the range and significance of relationships U.S. intelligence maintains with foreign counterparts.”

“These relationships are long-standing and highly resilient, but foreign security partners will be watching closely to learn how sensitive information they may share is being used and protected, and also to confirm that their non-public contributions are appreciated by the chief executive,” said Mr. Slick.

“The American public and our foreign security partners need to learn the facts regarding leaked claims that Russian intelligence maintained contacts with the president’s campaign staff,” he said. “Most U.S. security partners harbor a deep and well-founded distrust of the Russian government and its security services. Our intelligence partners will be reassured when the administration conveys a clear-eyed, objective and historically grounded assessment about Russia’s malign intent toward the U.S. and its allies.”

President Donald Trump is replacing US National Security Adviser HR McMaster with Bush-era defence hawk and former United Nations ambassador John Bolton.

Mr Trump tweeted to thank Gen McMaster, saying he had done an ""outstanding job & will always remain my friend"".

Mr Bolton, who has backed attacking North Korea and Iran, told Fox News his job would be to ensure the president has ""the full range of options"".

He becomes Mr Trump's third national security chief in 14 months.

Gen McMaster is the latest high-profile departure from the White House.

Last week, Mr Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by a tweet, replacing him with former CIA Director Mike Pompeo.

Mr Bolton's appointment does not require US Senate confirmation. He will take the job on 9 April.

The National Security Adviser is the key counsellor to the president on national security and foreign policy issues, and acts as a conduit for policy proposals coming from various government departments, including defence and state.

Responding to the move, Mr Bolton said he was looking forward to working with President Trump and his team ""to make our country safer at home and stronger abroad"".

Who is John Bolton?

Mr Bolton, 69, has been a foreign policy hawk in Republican circles for decades, having served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and George W Bush.

The second Bush appointed him as US envoy to the UN, during which time diplomats privately criticised Mr Bolton's style as abrasive.

A strident neo-conservative, Mr Bolton helped build the case that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be wrong.

Known for his walrus moustache, Mr Bolton does not appear to have greatly moderated his views since his last spell in government.

He stands by the invasion of Iraq and has advocated in newspaper op-eds using military force against North Korea and Iran.

A hawk's hawk

Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher

Earlier this month, Donald Trump tweeted: ""I still have some people that I want to change"". He wasn't kidding.

Since then chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, personal lawyer John Dowd and now National Security Adviser HR McMaster have headed to (or been shown) the exits.

One explanation is that the president feels more comfortable in his job - and more willing to challenge the advice given him by his closest aides.

He has chafed at the perception that he is being ""handled"" by those around him, and is installing men who agree to action, instead of preaching caution.

When it comes to Iran, Mr Bolton and the president are on the same page. Coupled with Mr Tillerson's exit, the US is heading toward a much more confrontational relationship with the Islamic Republic.

In other ways, however, the former UN ambassador is an unusual choice.

Mr Trump frequently has called the Iraq war a colossal mistake - the same war that Mr Bolton enthusiastically promoted during his time in the George W Bush administration.

Candidate Trump regularly espoused non-interventionism. Mr Bolton is a hawk's hawk.

Now that hawk has a perch in the Oval Office.

Why is Trump replacing McMaster?

In a brief statement on Thursday, Gen McMaster thanked President Trump for appointing him and said he was applying to retire from the US Army later this year.

The 55-year-old three-star general is leaving after just over a year as national security adviser. The president had reportedly found Gen McMaster's briefings to be grating. He was also described as aggressive and prone to lecture.

The White House said Mr Trump and Gen McMaster had ""mutually agreed"" that he would leave. He had been rumoured for weeks to be on his way out.

“ Experts have said that Iran is no closer to denuclearization than it was two years ago . Just two days ago , Iran announced that it would speed up its already restarted uranium enrichment . And far from being restrained , Iran has seized tankers , shot down a drone , and continued its support for militias across the Middle East . Bolton ’ s policy record is equally unimpressive on Venezuela , where the Trump administration seeks the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro ’ s regime and has thrown its support behind self-declared ‘ interim president ’ Juan Guaido . Bolton said the U.S. military needed to be ‘ ready to go ’ in Venezuela . But since a planned May 1 uprising dubbed ‘ Operation Freedom ’ by Guaido fizzled into a series of street protests , Maduro ’ s position appears as strong as ever . ”
“ Some have openly worried about what Bolton ’ s departure could mean for U.S. national security . Senator Mitt Romney lamented the loss of Bolton ’ s ‘ contrarian ’ voice . At a time when the administration has been censoring contrarian views—including factual ones—telling the president what he needs to hear , and not just what he wants to hear , is an asset…
“ But painting Bolton as a heroic truth teller is missing the point . Bolton was a hugely ineffective national security adviser . He didn ’ t occupy the role in any substantive way and failed to carry out the basic tasks that NSAs are expected to do—including holding regular national security policy meetings and getting through to the president . While he was ignoring his job , he instead focused on building up his own ego , publicly airing his disagreements with the president and pursuing his own policy convictions… Let ’ s hope that the next national security adviser does a lot better than Bolton . ”
“ Mr . Bolton ’ s singular achievement was to dismantle a foreign-policymaking structure that had until then kept the president from running foreign policy by the seat of his pants . Mr. Bolton persuaded Mr. Trump he didn ’ t need the National Security Council to make decisions ; it is no surprise that the president eventually felt confident deciding he did not need a national security adviser , either . Whether Mr. Trump names a replacement for Mr. Bolton does not matter : No one is going to convince the president he needs a system now , let alone the one that existed for 70 years . ”
Some argue that “ As wrong as Bolton has been on many matters — his fingerprints could be seen on plans threatening American military intervention in Iran and Venezuela — his presence at least provided a healthy corrective to a president naively disposed to aligning with the some of the world ’ s worst authoritarian regimes , provided they butter him up . With no illusions , Bolton saw Vladimir Putin , Kim Jong Un and their ilk for who they were — as tyrants and enemies of American values . That an impulsive president has now dispensed with him in order , apparently , to be more comfortably surrounded by sycophants means America ’ s role in the world will be that much more at the mercy of the whims and ego of a mercurial president . Hold on . ”
“ Trump ’ s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it ’ s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there ’ s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But… ‘ even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. ’ … ‍ “ In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid , the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation . There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter . ”","From the Left

Bolton said the U.S. military needed to be ‘ready to go’ in Venezuela. But since a planned May 1 uprising dubbed ‘Operation Freedom’ by Guaido fizzled into a series of street protests, Maduro’s position appears as strong as ever.”

Alex Emmons, The Intercept

“Some have openly worried about what Bolton’s departure could mean for U.S. national security. Senator Mitt Romney lamented the loss of Bolton’s ‘contrarian’ voice. At a time when the administration has been censoring contrarian views—including factual ones—telling the president what he needs to hear, and not just what he wants to hear, is an asset…



“But painting Bolton as a heroic truth teller is missing the point. Bolton was a hugely ineffective national security adviser. He didn’t occupy the role in any substantive way and failed to carry out the basic tasks that NSAs are expected to do—including holding regular national security policy meetings and getting through to the president. While he was ignoring his job, he instead focused on building up his own ego, publicly airing his disagreements with the president and pursuing his own policy convictions… Let’s hope that the next national security adviser does a lot better than Bolton.”

Samantha Vinograd, Politico

“Mr. Bolton’s singular achievement was to dismantle a foreign-policymaking structure that had until then kept the president from running foreign policy by the seat of his pants. Mr. Bolton persuaded Mr. Trump he didn’t need the National Security Council to make decisions; it is no surprise that the president eventually felt confident deciding he did not need a national security adviser, either. Whether Mr. Trump names a replacement for Mr. Bolton does not matter: No one is going to convince the president he needs a system now, let alone the one that existed for 70 years.”

John Gans, New York Times

Some argue that “As wrong as Bolton has been on many matters — his fingerprints could be seen on plans threatening American military intervention in Iran and Venezuela — his presence at least provided a healthy corrective to a president naively disposed to aligning with the some of the world’s worst authoritarian regimes, provided they butter him up. With no illusions, Bolton saw Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un and their ilk for who they were — as tyrants and enemies of American values. That an impulsive president has now dispensed with him in order, apparently, to be more comfortably surrounded by sycophants means America’s role in the world will be that much more at the mercy of the whims and ego of a mercurial president. Hold on.”

Editorial Board, New York Daily News

“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… ‍ “In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”

You’ve got to read, if you haven’t yet, the piece by Adam Kredo in the Washington Free Beacon about the circumstances surrounding the resignation of Michael Flynn on Monday.

Kredo weaves together the statements of several confidential sources to create an alarming tapestry that views not unlike the classic 1980s sci-fi film referenced above — it seems reasonably clear that leftovers from the Obama administration are actively sabotaging the new president.

A quick excerpt or two…

The effort, said to include former Obama administration adviser Ben Rhodes—the architect of a separate White House effort to create what he described as a pro-Iran echo chamber—included a small task force of Obama loyalists who deluged media outlets with stories aimed at eroding Flynn’s credibility, multiple sources revealed. The operation primarily focused on discrediting Flynn, an opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, in order to handicap the Trump administration’s efforts to disclose secret details of the nuclear deal with Iran that had been long hidden by the Obama administration.

Kredo’s piece isn’t the only one pointing to Iran as the real enemy of interest here rather than Russia. It’s worth watching Obama’s fundraising for his presidential library and other “philanthropic” activities with interest in the identities of his benefactors.

And there’s more…

“It’s actually Ben Rhodes, NIAC, and the Iranian mullahs who are celebrating today,” said one veteran foreign policy insider who is close to Flynn and the White House. “They know that the number one target is Iran… [and] they all knew their little sacred agreement with Iran was going to go off the books. So they got rid of Flynn before any of the [secret] agreements even surfaced.” Flynn had been preparing to publicize many of the details about the nuclear deal that had been intentionally hidden by the Obama administration as part of its effort to garner support for the deal, these sources said. Flynn is now “gone before anybody can see what happened” with these secret agreements, said the second insider close to Flynn and the White House. Sources in and out of the White House are concerned that the campaign against Flynn will be extended to other prominent figures in the Trump administration.

Read the whole thing. It’s well worth your time.

But let’s understand what actually happened here. Yes, Mike Flynn had a conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on Dec. 29 regarding American policy toward that country. Yes, there is an ancient and little-known piece of legislation, the Logan Act, which makes it illegal for private citizens to conduct foreign policy, and yes, that law was put forth to justify accusations Flynn had committed a crime in his conversation with Kislyak.

But as a national security advisor designate it’s hardly realistic to have considered Flynn a private citizen, and he wasn’t going to be charged with anything for that conversation. Which gives rise to the mistake which ultimately cost him his job — pressed about the conversation, Flynn told Vice President Mike Pence that he and Kislyak did not discuss the lifting of Obama administration sanctions against Russia, which was apparently true. What Flynn had discussed, per an interview he did with the Daily Caller before he was forced out, was the status of the 35 Russian diplomats Obama had expelled from the country. He contends Kislyak raised the issue and was told it would be reviewed after the inauguration — but he made no promises to the Russian.

The expulsions were considered part of the sanctions, and therefore Flynn’s representation to Pence would go down as inaccurate — and the resulting media scandal following Pence’s reliance on Flynn’s statements to pass the adviser’s contention on in a TV interview ultimately made Flynn too hot to handle.

But this goes far beyond the Beltway scandal machine which is now running at top gear after largely idling for the past eight years spitting out its first Trump administration victim. What blew Flynn out of the water were leaks from the intelligence community — his conversation with Kislyak was recorded by the FBI, pursuant to a FISA warrant which had to come from the highest levels, possibly high enough to have reached Obama himself, and then a transcript was provided to the media in order to refute Flynn’s contention he hadn’t discussed the sanctions.

Mike Walsh called this troubling pattern a “rolling coup attempt, organized by elements of the intelligence community, particularly CIA and NSA, abetted by Obama-era holdovers in the understaffed Justice Department (Sally Yates, take a bow) and the lickspittles of the leftist media, all of whom have signed on with the ‘Resistance’ in order to overturn the results of the November election.”

He’s not wrong. He goes further and is also not wrong…

Welcome to the Deep State, the democracy-sapping embeds at the heart of our democracy who have not taken the expulsion of the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party lightly. They realize that the Trump administration poses a mortal threat to their hegemony, and so have enlisted an army of Democrats, some Republicans, the “neverTrumpumpkin” conservative die-hards, leftist thugs, Black Lives Matter and anybody else they can blackmail, browbeat or enlist. They mean business.

What to do if you’re Trump? Fight.

It’s not enough to send Sean Spicer out to complain about the leaks, or to back his press conference statements up with early-morning tweets.

He must fight.

Trump clearly has not taken the sound advice of any executive engaged in a hostile takeover of a large organization — which is to fire everyone. There should be no holdovers from the Obama administration left in the federal government beyond what the law forces on the president.

Which includes the CIA, NSA, and other agencies clearly infested with Harkonnens seeking to impose the same fate on Trump and his administration which befell Duke Leto Atreides.

Trump went to Langley and spoke about inaugural crowds, and received warm applause from some of the same people concocting schemes to destroy his presidency. That was a mistake, and it must be recognized as such. Trump is late in drumming Obama’s people out of the government, and those people are now a cancer on his administration. He must clean out the intelligence community and the rest of the deep state, and he must drain the swamp in Washington. And he’s in a race against time in doing so.

All new administrations, particularly those taking over from predecessors in the opposite party, will struggle to find loyal servants within the bowels of the federal government. But no administration has politicized the bureaucracy and the intelligence community the way Obama did, and the government has never been so corrupted as it is now. The political assassination of Mike Flynn proves that, and Flynn will certainly not be the last. This administration is in a death struggle with the deep state, and only one will survive.",www.spectator.org,right,Ji0AFuEGu3RtM5OW

On Monday , the Mueller team claimed that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort violated his plea deal by lying to the FBI and Mueller ’ s office on a “ variety of subject matters , ” amid reports the cooperation agreement was not panning out how prosecutors had hoped . Conservative author Jerome Corsi also plans to reject a potential deal with Mueller involving a perjury plea . Meanwhile , former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos reported to prison to begin a 14-day sentence -- but has been extremely critical of the probe on Twitter and is likely to be a thorn in the side of investigators for months to come .
The complications only served to stoke President Trump ’ s persistent allegations that the investigation is being unfairly run . The president tweeted early Tuesday that the special counsel ’ s office is treating people “ viciously ” and “ ruining lives for them refusing to lie , ” an apparent reference to Corsi 's reported claims about why he wo n't strike a deal .
“ Wait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people , ruining lives for them refusing to lie . Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue , ” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning . “ The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint , when in actuality he is the exact opposite . He is doing TREMENDOUS damage to our Criminal Justice System , where he is only looking at one side and not the other . ”
Trump added : “ Heroes will come of this , and it won ’ t be Mueller and his terrible Gang of Angry Democrats . ”
The president , who has repeatedly referred to the probe as a “ Witch Hunt ” and blasted the team of investigators as “ Angry Dems ” based on their political affiliation and past donation history to largely Democratic candidates and causes , submitted his written answers to Mueller ’ s questions in the probe last week , marking a major milestone in the investigation . His attorneys said that despite their serious issues with the probe , the president has provided “ unprecedented cooperation . ”
Mueller is widely expected to be nearing the final stages of the investigation in the wake of the November midterms .
But in a late twist , a court filing Monday night said Manafort , who was convicted on multiple counts of financial fraud over the summer in connection with work he completed in Ukraine as a political consultant , breached the plea deal agreed upon earlier this year .
“ After signing the plea agreement , Manafort committed federal crimes by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel ’ s Office on a variety of subject matters , which constitute breaches of the agreement , ” Mueller ’ s office said .
One source told ABC News on Monday that special counsel prosecutors were “ not getting what they want ” from Manafort .
In a joint-status report , Manafort contested the special counsel ’ s claims , noting that he met with the government “ on numerous occasions and answered the government ’ s questions . ”
“ Manafort has provided information to the government in an effort to live up to his cooperation obligations , ” his lawyers wrote . “ He believes he has provided truthful information and does not agree with the government ’ s characterization or that he has breached the agreement . ”
Manafort ’ s sentencing in the Eastern District of Virginia is , at this point , slated for early February .
Also Monday night , Corsi , who revealed earlier this month that he had received a subpoena in the investigation , told The Associated Press that he plans to reject any deal offered to him to plead guilty to perjury .
He claimed to reporters they wanted him to admit to something he did n't do , and effectively lie in doing so .
Corsi is closely connected with GOP political operative Roger Stone , who also expects to be a target in Mueller ’ s probe . Stone has said he believes Mueller is investigating whether he had advanced knowledge of WikiLeaks releasing hacked emails of Democrats during the campaign .
In a statement to Fox News on Monday , Stone denied advance knowledge of email hacking .
“ I continue to see that my friend Dr. Jerry Corsi is being harassed by the Special Counsel , not for lying , but for refusing to lie , ” Stone said . “ It is inconceivable that in America someone would be prosecuted for refusing to swear to a false narrative pushed on him by the Mueller investigators . ”
Stone added : “ If Jerry ever deduced that Mr. Podesta ’ s emails had been purloined and would be published by WikiLeaks , he did not share that conclusion with me . ”
Corsi said earlier this month his ongoing negotiations with the special counsel have “ just blown up , ” even though he said he “ did everything ” he could to cooperate and thought he was “ doing a pretty good job of it . ”
“ This has been one of the most frightening experiences of my life , ” Corsi said .
Meanwhile , Papadopoulos , who pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI last year , was sentenced to 14 days in prison , where he reported Monday . Papadopoulos has been outspoken on Twitter and in media interviews regarding the nature of the investigation and his experience with the special counsel ’ s office .
“ The truth will all be out . Not even a prison sentence can stop that momentum , ” Papadopoulos tweeted Sunday . “ Looking forward to testifying publicly shortly after . The wool isn ’ t going to be pulled over America ’ s eyes forever . Much love . ”
One of the first high-profile targets , though , has yet to be sentenced . Next month , after a year of delays , the special counsel has scheduled a sentencing date for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn , who also pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI with regard to conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition as part of a plea deal
Mueller ’ s team has repeatedly delayed Flynn ’ s sentencing , raising questions and fueling GOP concerns over the status of the investigation , but the retired three-star Army general is expected to finally be sentenced on Dec. 18 .
In addition to problems with the Trump campaign-connected targets , Mueller ’ s team has faced challenges pursuing the case against a slew of Russian companies and citizens . In February , a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly acting as a troll farm interfering in the 2016 presidential election and waging “ information warfare ” against the U.S .

Mueller’s team has repeatedly delayed Flynn’s sentencing, raising questions and fueling GOP concerns over the status of the investigation, but the retired three-star Army general is expected to finally be sentenced on Dec. 18.

In addition to problems with the Trump campaign-connected targets, Mueller’s team has faced challenges pursuing the case against a slew of Russian companies and citizens. In February, a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly acting as a troll farm interfering in the 2016 presidential election and waging “information warfare” against the U.S.

But Washington attorneys then surfaced to fight back on the Russians' behalf, even seeking sensitive evidence from Mueller's team.

Questions about WikiLeaks ’ publication of thousands of hacked emails , which it allegedly obtained following a plot by Russian military intelligence to steal the emails from Hillary Clinton ’ s presidential campaign and the Democratic party , are at the heart of Robert Mueller ’ s criminal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin .
The campaign also said in a legal filing that any alleged agreement between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to publish the emails could not have been a “ conspiracy ” because WikiLeaks ’ decision to release the stolen emails was not an illegal act . The court filing was written in response to a civil lawsuit brought against the Trump campaign by two of Hillary Clinton ’ s donors and a former employee of the Democratic party .
The Trump campaign ’ s surprising defence of WikiLeaks marks a stark departure from official US policy , which has condemned the website for frequently targeting the US government and for publishing thousands of classified documents about covert policies .

Questions about WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of hacked emails, which it allegedly obtained following a plot by Russian military intelligence to steal the emails from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic party, are at the heart of Robert Mueller’s criminal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

The campaign also said in a legal filing that any alleged agreement between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to publish the emails could not have been a “conspiracy” because WikiLeaks’ decision to release the stolen emails was not an illegal act. The court filing was written in response to a civil lawsuit brought against the Trump campaign by two of Hillary Clinton’s donors and a former employee of the Democratic party.

The Trump campaign’s surprising defence of WikiLeaks marks a stark departure from official US policy, which has condemned the website for frequently targeting the US government and for publishing thousands of classified documents about covert policies.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Declaring that the world is entering a ""new era of competition,"" President Trump outlined a national security strategy Monday that puts U.S. economic issues — trade, energy independence and even tax reform — to the center of U.S. foreign policy.

""We know that American success is not a foregone conclusion. It must be earned, and it must be won,"" Trump said in a speech outlining the new strategy. ""We are declaring that America is in the game, and America is going to win.""

In the first comprehensive update of U.S. foreign policy since 2015, Trump defined his national security strategy as resting on four pillars: Protecting the American people at home, promoting economic prosperity, preserving peace through a strong military and advancing American interests abroad.

The result is a doctrine that attempts to balance competing objectives: Emphasizing political and economic competition with countries like Russia and China while also enlisting their help with security challenges like North Korea's nuclear program.

""While we seek such opportunities of cooperation, we will stand up for ourselves, and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before,"" Trump said.

Every president since Ronald Reagan has used a national security report to Congress to give a high-level overview of their foreign policy priorities, but Trump took the unusual step of also delivering them in a speech Monday to 600 people, including uniformed service members and other national security officials .

Reading from a teleprompter and speaking in a soft, dispassionate voice, Trump's remarks served as much a a first-year report card as a forward-looking security vision, boasting low unemployment numbers and a soaring stock market.

Trump defined his foreign policy in stark contrast to his predecessors, and — while he didn't mention him by name — was clearly singling out President Barack Obama for criticism.

Leaders in Washington, he said, have ""negotiated disastrous trade deals,"" short-changed the military, neglected the North Korea crisis, made a bad nuclear deal with Iran and allowed the Islamic State to gain a foothold in Iraq and Syria.

But in a speech brimming with economic nationalism, he also took aim at his predecessors on trade, borders and immigration.

""A nation without borders is not a nation,"" he said. ""A nation that does not protect prosperity at home cannot protect its interests abroad. A nation that is not prepared to win a war is a nation not capable of preventing a war. A nation that is not proud of its history cannot be confident in its future. And a nation that is not certain of its values cannot summon the will to defend them.""

He even argued that his domestic agenda — including tax cuts and deregulation — would make the United States a stronger force in the world.

It's a strategy that puts more emphasis on the business climate than on climate change, a key focus of Obama's last national security strategy document. In fact, Trump's strategy says the United States will counter ""an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests.""

The strategy places an emphasis on cyber-security even as it reduces intelligence that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to just a couple lines: ""Through modernized forms of subversive tactics, Russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries around the world,"" the written report said.

But Trump omitted even that vague reference from his speech, saying only that the U.S. must ""address new forms of conflict such as economic and political aggression.""

Trump described Russia and China as ""revisionist powers"" intent on changing the global status quo by illegitimately seizing territory — Russia through its occupation of Crimea and China through its island-building in the South China Sea. China's unique economic and military clout makes it what the report called a ""strategic competitor,"" aides said.

But that doesn't mean that the United States shouldn't cooperate with them when their interests align, Trump argues. Just Sunday, Trump received the personal thanks of Russian President Vladimir Putin after the CIA gave the Russian security service information about a planned terrorist attack in St. Petersburg.

In other areas, Trump attempts to expand the concept of national security as encompassing fair trade, tax reform and deregulation.

Questions about Iran's calculations

There were subsequent reports that he complained that his aides were trying to goad him into a war with Iran that could contradict his campaign vow to avoid new Middle East entanglement.

If Iran or an Iranian proxy does turn out to be behind an attack that sent global oil prices soaring, there will be questions about the Islamic Republic's motivation and how it is calculating its response to Trump's policies.

The developments could suggest Iran has no intention of responding to any US overtures, following Trump's decision to pull out of the nuclear deal forged by his predecessor Barack Obama and the adoption of a ""maximum pressure"" sanctions campaign.

Iranian politics are notoriously difficult to judge from the outside. But the crisis could also indicate that factions in the Islamic Republic are seeking to squelch any political maneuvering room for any leaders who are open to talking to the US.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – As President Donald Trump prepares to attend his second United Nations meeting this week, world leaders are bracing for another round of confrontation with the U.S. over Iran, global trade and Trump's ""America first"" view of foreign policy.

A year after he shocked his counterparts by threatening to ""totally destroy"" North Korea in his inaugural U.N. address, Trump is expected to use a series of speeches to push a hard line against Iran. Part of his mission will be to persuade skeptical allies to back his decision four months ago to yank the U.S. out of a controversial deal to limit Iran's nuclear program.

Senior aides say the president will also reaffirm the idea of sovereignty as a guiding principle of U.S. foreign policy – a message sure to play better with voters in battleground states ahead of the November midterm elections than with the diplomatic corps gathered in New York for the annual session.

“Sovereignty is a priority,” Nikki Haley, Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said as she previewed the president’s message. “It’s going to be the will of the American people, not the will of the international community.”

Trump will use other venues to push foreign leaders to take a stronger stance against the global drug trade and will implore the world to focus on the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons, the White House said. He will meet with South Korea President Moon Jae-in, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the leaders of Egypt, France, Japan and the United Kingdom.

After last year's meeting led to an insult-trading tiff with North Korea's Kim Jong Un that elevated tensions, the bombast subsided and the two leaders met in Singapore in June. Many in Trump's administration acknowledge Kim is still developing nuclear weapons, but Trump notes that the rhetoric has cooled.

Kim is not expected to attend this week's UN meetings.

Whether Trump will be able to make progress on other U.S. priorities this year is an open question. Some White House aides backed down from a plan to make Iran the centerpiece of a Security Council meeting Trump will chair Wednesday, instead broadening that conversation to deal with weapons of mass destruction.

But Trump indicated in a tweet on Friday that Iran will be the focus of the meeting, noting he would chair a meeting “on Iran” this week.

Richard Gowan, a senior fellow at the United Nations University think tank, said other world leaders have “a pretty dim view of Trump,” but they also don’t want to risk a public blow up with the United States.

Those same leaders witnessed the spat over trade between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau following the G-7 meeting in June as well as the friction that played out when Trump met with allies at the NATO summit in Brussels a month later.

“I don’t think anyone has really high expectations,” Gowan said. “They’re basically hoping to limit the drama.”

Haley defended the administration's approach.

""I don’t expect all countries to love how we are but that’s because we’re taking our country back — and the message of our country back — and we’re not apologizing for it,"" she said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday night.

That dynamic may be particularly pronounced on Iran, where Trump will seek to convince allies that there is no way to salvage the 2015 deal without U.S. involvement. The White House has vowed to ramp up theeconomic pressure on countries and companies doing business with Tehran. Haley and other administration officials want the Security Council to punish Iran for alleged violations of international nuclear nonproliferation resolutions.

“The message is going to be ‘Our strategy is serious and we’re committed to it,’” said the American Foreign Policy Council's Ilan Berman. “This meeting is a very important opportunity for this administration to signal that the worst pain is yet to come.”

Trump made withdrawing from the Iran agreement a key element of his campaign, and this week’s meeting will represent the first United Nations session since he made good on that pledge. Leaders of the five other nations — China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and Germany — that signed onto the deal are working to save it without U.S. involvement.

Also hanging over the gathering is whether Trump will meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Trump has indicated he's open to a meeting but aides say the president is not actively seeking one.

Trump will address the session on Tuesday and will chair the Security Council discussion on non-proliferation on Wednesday.

Ned Price, who served as a top National Security Council adviser to President Barack Obama, predicted there will be a set of parallel talks, outside the formal sessions, aimed at softening or blocking the Trump administration’s foreign policy agenda, from its funding cuts to the U.N.'s Palestinian refugee aid program to its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

The Trump presidency is often a kind of political “Rashomon,” with partisans on either side looking at the same facts and coming to wildly different conclusions.

So it’s all the more remarkable that the central controversy of our time isn’t a fight over one story with different interpretations of shared facts, but a fight over two different stories altogether.

The two narratives are like a binary star system, each body circling the other, throwing off so much blinding light and heat that it becomes difficult to distinguish them. Their combined gravitational pull bends everything in their direction.

The problem is that both stories might be true. The cartoon versions offered by the usual suspects on the left and the right are surely shot through with hyperbole. But both stories have some truth to them.

Other than Trump’s public pleading with Russia to find Clinton’s missing emails, which he says was a joke, and his open praise of Russia front group WikiLeaks, there’s little evidence that he had a more sinister alliance with Putin.

However, it does seem clear that the Trump campaign was eager to collude with Russia. The infamous meeting at Trump Tower between a Russian emissary and the campaign’s key leadership — Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort — was convened for that very reason.

US officials are investigating a secret Facebook group where border patrol members allegedly posted racist and sexist jokes about migrants and others.

The private group had about 9,500 members, including former and current border patrol agents, ProPublica reported.

Some posts mocked migrant deaths, while others targeted Latino members of Congress, ProPublica said.

The Border Patrol chief has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"".

""Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable,"" Carla Provost said.

The group was called ""I'm 10-15"", ProPublica said - 10-15 being Border Patrol code for ""aliens in custody"".

'Throw burritos at them'

According to ProPublica, members of the group mocked Latino members of Congress who visited migrant detention centres in Texas on Monday.

Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Veronica Escobar were among those said to have been called ""hoes"" and ""scum buckets"" in the private postings.

In one post, a member reportedly suggested throwing burritos at them, while another shared a doctored image depicting Ms Ocasio-Cortez performing a sex act on President Donald Trump.

The BBC was not able to independently verify the existence of the private group, which is not publicly accessible on Facebook.

Matthew Klein, an assistant commissioner at the CBP, said the Department of Homeland Security had launched a code-of-conduct investigation into the group.

He said a number of CBP agents may be members of the group.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez said the posts did not surprise her, and that they were ""indicative"" of what she had seen while visiting the migrant detention centre on Monday.

""I see why CBP officers were being so physically and sexually threatening towards me,"" she tweeted after the trip.

'Forced to drink from toilets'

On Twitter, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said that border patrol officers had told women in cells to ""drink out of the toilets"".

She added that during the visit, she ""forced"" herself into a cramped cell where the women inside ""described their treatment at the hands of officers as 'psychological warfare'"".

After critics shared a photo of similar toilets in another such facility - with a sink attachment on top labelled ""potable water"" - Ms Ocasio-Cortez said the one she saw was ""not functioning"" at the time.

""So the women were told they could drink out of the bowl,"" she tweeted.

A Trump administration official, who did not wish to be named, told CBS News that ""the toilets are connected to the sinks and the sinks dispense safe drinking water.

""The sink on top of the toilets broke. But as soon as the sinks broke, border patrol put out jugs of water for migrants to drink right when that happened. The jugs were right there for everyone to drink.""

Ms Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers toured detention centres days after a harrowing picture of a drowned man and his daughter on the US-Mexico border brought the migration crisis into sharp focus.

Last month, the New York congresswoman stoked controversy after comparing migrant detention centres to ""concentration camps"".

What's the reaction?

Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Joaquin Castro condemned the secret Facebook page as ""vulgar, disgusting and vile"".

""That shows, unfortunately, that there are many within CBP who've become desensitised to the point of being dangerous to the migrants in their care.""

Senator Cory Booker, a Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he was introducing a plan to ""virtually eliminate migrant detention"".

He called the facilities ""for-profit prison that should not exist"", and said that as president, he would improve the facilities and close any that do not meet his standard.

Earlier this month, Mexico reached a deal with the Trump administration to try to stem the flow of undocumented migrants travelling to the US.

Last month a US Justice Department lawyer disputed in court whether detained migrant children are entitled to toothbrushes and soap.

In February, Mr Trump declared an emergency on the country's southern border, saying it was necessary to tackle what he said was a crisis there.

A copy of the report , obtained by The ███ , outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction , all while misleading lawmakers about the activities .
The document , compiled by the Senate ’ s Republican-led chief investigative subcommittee , began circulating Tuesday , just as the Trump administration issued its harshest warnings to date to foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business with Iran or find themselves in the crosshairs of Washington ’ s reimposition of sanctions as part of Mr. Trump ’ s withdrawal from the nuclear deal .
“ Companies doing business in Iran face substantial risks , and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear-related sanctions , ” said Sigal Mandelker , Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence .
She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “ deceptive ” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists .
The Iranian government “ uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks ” as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran ’ s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization , Ms. Mandelker said .
She issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities — the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump ’ s pullout from the nuclear accord .
Iranian officials said the increase , while provocative , does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord .
The president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions , which the U.S. , Europe , China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran ’ s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections .
While Iran told the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on Tuesday that it plans only to increase enrichment within limits set by 2015 deal , the announcement came with threats from a top Iranian official that the activities could be quickly expanded . The warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump ’ s withdrawal .
The head of Iran ’ s nuclear agency , Ali Akbar Salehi , said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges . He made the comment a day after Iran ’ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord .
The Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama ’ s team was willing to go to ensure the deal ’ s success as it was still being negotiated .
The Senate Homeland Security Committee ’ s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks , facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars .
“ Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal , ” according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times . “ Despite these claims , the U.S. Department of the Treasury , at the direction of the U.S. State Department , granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system .
“ Even after the specific license was issued , U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system , ” the report said .
Sen . Rob Portman , the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee , is set to outline his panel ’ s findings Wednesday .
Under terms of the nuclear deal , Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions , but it remained “ illegal for U.S. persons , entities , and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran . ”
The ban included any “ intermediary ” transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran — a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system .
On the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015 , Tehran had some $ 5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat , Oman , according to Senate investigators , who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar .
On Tehran ’ s request , Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department ’ s office of foreign assets control .
According to the Senate report : “ Muscat sought to convert $ 5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros . [ But ] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar , the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars . ”
Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would “ continue to be denied access to the [ U.S. ] financial and commercial market ” under the proposed accord , but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran .
“ On February 24 , 2016 , OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $ 5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system , ” according to the Senate report , which claims the move was made “ even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it . ”
Even as office of foreign assets control officials directly “ encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds , ” the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction , said the report , which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , and Sen. Mark Kirk , Illinois Republican , that contended the Obama “ administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system . ”
The catch , according to Senate investigators , was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange — in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic .
Despite the Obama administration ’ s efforts , Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system , the Senate investigators said .
Mr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that “ the Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran . ”
“ Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits , the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system , ” Mr. Portman said . “ The only reason this transaction wasn ’ t executed was because two U.S. banks refused , even though the administration asked them to help convert the money . ”
Such sanctions , he added , “ are a vital foreign policy tool , and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness . ”","The Obama administration — despite repeatedly assuring Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system — secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks to convert the windfall of cash it received from sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal into dollars, an investigative report by the Senate has revealed.

Congress out of the loop

In a court filing Monday , prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller wrote that Manafort and one of his associates `` repeatedly '' contacted two witnesses in an effort to influence their testimony . The contacts occurred earlier this year , shortly after a grand jury returned a new indictment against Manafort and while he was confined to his home .
The filing marks the second time that Mueller 's team has accused Manafort of violating a judge 's order in the case . Late last year , federal agents discovered that Manafort was attempting to ghostwrite an opinion piece in Ukraine even though he was under a gag order in the case .
The allegations of attempted witness tampering relate to Manafort 's criminal case in Washington where he faces charges of money-laundering conspiracy , false statements and acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests . He also faces bank fraud and tax evasion charges in Virginia .
The charges - they involve tens of millions of dollars routed through offshore accounts - do not relate to his work on the Trump campaign or involve allegations of Russian election interference .
In the latest court documents , prosecutors say that while he was under house arrest , Manafort and his associate attempted to get two witnesses to lie about the nature of lobbying and public relations work they carried out at Manafort 's direction on behalf of Ukraine .
The court documents do not name Manafort 's associate , but they refer to him as `` Person A '' and note the pseudonym is consistent with previous filings in the case . In earlier filings , Person A has referred to Konstantin Kilimnik , a longtime Manafort associate who prosecutors have said has ties to Russian intelligence .
Kilimnik , who has denied having connections to Russian intelligence agencies , was also involved in the ghostwritten op-ed matter , which prosecutors also connect to Person A in the latest filing .
Reached Monday evening , Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said his client and his attorneys were reviewing the filing .
The two witnesses were also not named in court filings . But prosecutors say they were principals in a public relations firm that worked with Manafort in organizing a group of former European officials , known as the Hapsburg group , who promoted Ukrainian interests in Europe as well as the U.S .
The group 's work factors into an indictment against Manafort that accuses him of acting as an unregistered foreign agent by lobbying in the U.S. on behalf of Ukrainian interests . Prosecutors say Manafort directed the group 's work and secretly funneled more than $ 2 million to it to take positions favorable to Ukraine including by lobbying in the U.S. without disclosing that they were being paid to favorably represent the country .
Manafort has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty . Several members of the Hapsburg group have previously denied the allegations .
According to the court filing , Manafort began messaging and calling one of the witnesses in February shortly the unsealing of the indictment that included the allegations of unregistered lobbying related to the Hapsburg group . Around that same time , Manafort 's co-defendant and longtime business associate , Rick Gates , pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors .
The day after Gates ' plea , Manafort messaged and called one of the witnesses and continued reaching out over the next several days , according to a sworn affidavit filed by an FBI agent in the case .
In one call , the agent wrote , Manafort said he wanted to give the witness a `` heads-up about Hapsburg . '' The individual immediately ended the call `` because he was concerned about the outreach , '' according to the affidavit .
On Feb. 26 , Manafort sent the person a series of messages through an encrypted application , including a link to a Business Insider story with the headline : `` Former European leaders struggle to explain themselves after Mueller claims Paul Manafort paid them to lobby for Ukraine . '' Another message said , `` We should talk . I have made clear that they worked in Europe . ''
The witness told investigators that he interpreted Manafort 's efforts to reach him as a way to influence his potential statements . The person believed from his experience that the Hapsburg group lobbied in the United States and knew that Manafort knew that as well , the agent wrote .
Court papers also accuse Person A of making several attempts to influence the witnesses ' testimony in February and later in April . That month , Person A wrote to one of the witnesses , `` My friend P is looking for ways to connect to you to pass you several messages . '' He then asked if that could be arranged .

And Mr. Trump ’ s always-present national security adviser , H.R . McMaster , is an active-duty Army lieutenant general steeped in battlefield history and doctrine .
All four have fought on the ground in Iraq against radical Islam . They bring to Mr. Trump a deep collective knowledge of that country ’ s tribes and politicians who will lead a post-Islamic State Iraq . Unlike Mr. Trump , these scholar warriors are also voracious readers . Gen. McMaster , for example , wrote a book on how Lyndon B. Johnson bamboozled the Joint Chiefs during the Vietnam War .
But they share the body clock of a president who sleeps only several hours a day as well as a disdain for political correctness .
A retired military officer who knows the generals told The ███ that the president has grown particularly close to Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly . Lean and rugged , both rose in the Marine Corps on parallel career paths culminating in leading combatant commands — for Mr. Mattis , U.S. Central Command ( Middle East ) ; for Mr. Kelly , U.S. Southern Command ( southern border ) .
“ No . 1 , they get along very well , ” said the former officer . “ I call it street sense . They know how to talk the line , and Trump does too . Trump is like talking to a concrete worker . These two generals have got a man who listens and does not pretend like Obama and others to know everything . When the president is out of his lane and needs advice , these guys are right in there . ”
Said Dakota Wood , a retired Marine officer and Heritage Foundation analyst who worked on the transition : “ The president seems to like very successful sports figures . It could be that he is attracted to the legendary reputation that accompanies the Marine Corps and through that lens the accomplishments of four-star Marine generals , amplified by their typical plain-spoken , reality-based style of addressing issues . ”
Another retired military officer and transition member said that part of the allure of Mattis-Kelly-Dunford-McMaster is that they have never been part of the Washington “ swamp ” that Mr. Trump has vowed to drain .
“ He ’ s much more comfortable around military people , ” said this source . “ You could tell that at the Army-Navy game when he went to both sides . The generals are not politicians . They ’ re not part of the Washington swamp . They ’ re all successful in their career , and they are not part of the Washing swamp of bureaucracy bull . ”
In contrast , Mr. Obama had a famously cool relationship with his generals , as told by his former defense secretaries .
His first defense secretary , Robert M. Gates , wrote in his memoir , “ Duty , ” that Mr. Obama felt compelled in one meeting to command , “ That ’ s an order . ”
“ That order was unnecessary and insulting , proof positive of the depth of the Obama White House distrust of the nation ’ s military leadership , ” a “ shocked ” Mr. Gates wrote .
“ The controlling nature of the Obama White House and the staff took micromanagement and operational meddling to a new level , ” he said . “ I think Obama considered time spent with generals and admirals an obligation . ”
Retired Air Force Gen. Philip M. Breedlove , while NATO supreme allied commander , encountered so much troubling communication with the White House that he asked former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell for help .
“ I may be wrong but I do not see this WH really ‘ engaged ’ by working with Europe/NATO , ” Gen. Breedlove wrote . “ Frankly I think we are a ‘ worry ’ ie a threat to get the nation drug into a conflict vice an ‘ opportunity ’ represented by some pretty stalwart allies . ”
Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly retired in the Obama years . Congressional aides said the White House pushed out Mr. Mattis as Central Command chief because of his tough Iran stance . Mr. Kelly delivered hawkish Senate testimony on border security that the administration did not approve .
Mr. Trump signaled during the election campaign that he would bond with the top brass when he accused Mr. Obama of turning his generals into “ rubble . ”
Mr. Trump has stacked the West Wing with campaign confidants : campaign manager Kellyanne Conway , his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner , former Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon .
All have something in common : They have no experience navigating the federal government ’ s byzantine and sometimes treacherous bureaucracy .
“ Mattis and Kelly understand that the president and the people around him really know nothing about government and how it works , ” the former officer told The Times . “ Instead of being critical , they just understand that . They ’ ve been very helpful to Bannon and the other people around them . ”
Gen. McMaster , the Army soldier among the Marines , also listens to them .
“ Remember , he ’ s a three-star . Not a four-star . I can tell you he relies on both Mattis and Kelly a lot , ” the ex-officer said . “ They just operated for a lot of years at the World Series level in this government . And they know how government works . ”
Even before the Syria strike , which shifted Mr. Trump from Russian President Vladimir Putin admirer to adversary , the president was moving in the direction of the generals in his administration .
He narrowed his broad criticism of NATO allies to just one issue — paying their fair share — while adopting Mr. Mattis ‘ view that the alliance is the world ’ s indispensable partnership .
The four generals whose careers focused so much on the Middle East are pushing for building a new Arab alliance to check Iran and fight the Islamic State .
This is why , in quick succession , the White House played host to a parade of pivotal leaders : Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi , Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi , Jordan ’ s King Abdullah II and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .
Mr. Trump also granted wide authority to Gen. McMaster to mold the National Security Council and staff in his image .
Within weeks , the general remade membership of the NSC decision-making principals committee — the one that weighed options to respond to Syria ’ s sarin nerve gas attack on civilians . Gen. McMaster eased out Mr. Bannon as a permanent member . He brought on Gen. Dunford and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats as standing members instead of invitees .
“ So the president was immediately notified upon news of the chemical attack , and he was very interested in understanding better the circumstances of the attack and who was responsible , ” is how Gen. McMaster described the beginning of war cabinet discussions .
Of the NSC shake-up , White House press secretary Sean Spicer said , “ We had talked about the fact that he would have full authority to oversee the National Security Council in terms of personnel and structure , and he has . ”
Mr. Kelly was viewed as “ taking the hit ” for the White House ’ s missteps on the president ’ s first executive order travel ban , which was blocked by federal judges . The former Marine general appeared before the press and Congress to discourage talk that he was out of the loop and at odds with the White House .
When Democrats demanded a briefing on the Homeland Security Department ’ s hunt for criminal illegal aliens , Mr. Kelly picked himself to enter the firing line . He survived several heated exchanges .
He refers to the president as “ boss ” yet wishes the president would not make so many references to building a wall along the southwestern border , a project still in search of long-range funding .
The president summoned Mr. Kelly to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach , Florida , one weekend to brainstorm the writing of a second executive order on travel from predominately Muslim countries . This one removed Iraq from the ban , a concession insiders attribute to Mr. Kelly and his knowledge of the vetting capability in Baghdad .
The knowledgeable former military officer told The Times that he believes Mr. Kelly , Mr. Mattis and Gen. McMaster have had an influence in getting Mr. Trump to tamp down his steady stream of volatile tweets that take the White House off message .
Retired Air Force Gen. Thomas McInerney , a veteran of Pentagon bureaucracy wars , said he believes Mr. Trump learned to love the military as a cadet at the New York Military Academy .
“ Certainly Gen. Kelly and Gen. Mattis interviewed well because both are extremely talented leaders as well as former combatant commanders and know their areas of responsibility very well , ” Mr. McInerney said . “ In Gen. Kelly ’ s case , he was South Command commander where our greatest challenges of illegal immigrants as well as illegal drug importation are coming from , so his learning curve was zero . He could write a book on homeland security , which is why the president hired him so quickly . ”
While Mr. Trump has bonded with his three Marines and a soldier , the group has sharp critics .
Conservatives say Mr. Mattis is politically tone-deaf on appointees and wanted to put Trump critics , moderates or even Democrats in prestigious Pentagon jobs that should go to the ideologically right .
Gen. McMaster is criticized for his insistence that the violent Islamic State terrorist group has nothing to do with Islam the religion . His position is rebutted by conservative scholars , who say clerics , mosques and Muslim teachings all combine to support radical Islam .
Mr. Trump generally adheres to this view and has continued to refer to terrorists as Islamic extremists .","The same President Trump who can be gruff and erratic in public tweets is a commander in chief who is deferential and attentive when he talks to a star-studded cast of his closest military advisers.

People familiar with the budding relationships portray Mr. Trump as often in listening mode among his generals and as accessible as the next phone call. They contrast the billionaire real estate developer’s affinity for the top brass with former President Barack Obama’s documented standoffishness.

The Tomahawk strike on Syria on Friday underscores that Washington’s warrior class is again in charge of presenting military options to the White House instead of the other way around.

With three Marines and a soldier always nearby, perhaps no president in recent memory has surrounded himself on a daily basis with so many senior generals and their strategic brainpower.

A retired Marine general, James Mattis runs the Defense Department. His and Mr. Trump’s top military adviser is Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Another retired Marine four-star general, John F. Kelly is responsible for protecting 325 million U.S. residents as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

And Mr. Trump’s always-present national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, is an active-duty Army lieutenant general steeped in battlefield history and doctrine.

All four have fought on the ground in Iraq against radical Islam. They bring to Mr. Trump a deep collective knowledge of that country’s tribes and politicians who will lead a post-Islamic State Iraq. Unlike Mr. Trump, these scholar warriors are also voracious readers. Gen. McMaster, for example, wrote a book on how Lyndon B. Johnson bamboozled the Joint Chiefs during the Vietnam War.

But they share the body clock of a president who sleeps only several hours a day as well as a disdain for political correctness.

A retired military officer who knows the generals told The Washington Times that the president has grown particularly close to Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly. Lean and rugged, both rose in the Marine Corps on parallel career paths culminating in leading combatant commands — for Mr. Mattis, U.S. Central Command (Middle East); for Mr. Kelly, U.S. Southern Command (southern border).

“No. 1, they get along very well,” said the former officer. “I call it street sense. They know how to talk the line, and Trump does too. Trump is like talking to a concrete worker. These two generals have got a man who listens and does not pretend like Obama and others to know everything. When the president is out of his lane and needs advice, these guys are right in there.”

Said Dakota Wood, a retired Marine officer and Heritage Foundation analyst who worked on the transition: “The president seems to like very successful sports figures. It could be that he is attracted to the legendary reputation that accompanies the Marine Corps and through that lens the accomplishments of four-star Marine generals, amplified by their typical plain-spoken, reality-based style of addressing issues.”

Another retired military officer and transition member said that part of the allure of Mattis-Kelly-Dunford-McMaster is that they have never been part of the Washington “swamp” that Mr. Trump has vowed to drain.

“He’s much more comfortable around military people,” said this source. “You could tell that at the Army-Navy game when he went to both sides. The generals are not politicians. They’re not part of the Washington swamp. They’re all successful in their career, and they are not part of the Washing swamp of bureaucracy bull.”

Bonding with top brass

In contrast, Mr. Obama had a famously cool relationship with his generals, as told by his former defense secretaries.

His first defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, wrote in his memoir, “Duty,” that Mr. Obama felt compelled in one meeting to command, “That’s an order.”

“That order was unnecessary and insulting, proof positive of the depth of the Obama White House distrust of the nation’s military leadership,” a “shocked” Mr. Gates wrote.

“The controlling nature of the Obama White House and the staff took micromanagement and operational meddling to a new level,” he said. “I think Obama considered time spent with generals and admirals an obligation.”

Retired Air Force Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, while NATO supreme allied commander, encountered so much troubling communication with the White House that he asked former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell for help.

“I may be wrong but I do not see this WH really ‘engaged’ by working with Europe/NATO,” Gen. Breedlove wrote. “Frankly I think we are a ‘worry’ ie a threat to get the nation drug into a conflict vice an ‘opportunity’ represented by some pretty stalwart allies.”

Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly retired in the Obama years. Congressional aides said the White House pushed out Mr. Mattis as Central Command chief because of his tough Iran stance. Mr. Kelly delivered hawkish Senate testimony on border security that the administration did not approve.

Mr. Trump signaled during the election campaign that he would bond with the top brass when he accused Mr. Obama of turning his generals into “rubble.”

Mr. Trump has stacked the West Wing with campaign confidants: campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, former Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon.

Gen. McMaster, the Army soldier among the Marines, also listens to them.

“Remember, he’s a three-star. Not a four-star. I can tell you he relies on both Mattis and Kelly a lot,” the ex-officer said. “They just operated for a lot of years at the World Series level in this government. And they know how government works.”

Even before the Syria strike, which shifted Mr. Trump from Russian President Vladimir Putin admirer to adversary, the president was moving in the direction of the generals in his administration.

He narrowed his broad criticism of NATO allies to just one issue — paying their fair share — while adopting Mr. Mattis‘ view that the alliance is the world’s indispensable partnership.

The four generals whose careers focused so much on the Middle East are pushing for building a new Arab alliance to check Iran and fight the Islamic State.

This is why, in quick succession, the White House played host to a parade of pivotal leaders: Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

‘Extremely talented leaders’

Mr. Trump also granted wide authority to Gen. McMaster to mold the National Security Council and staff in his image.

Within weeks, the general remade membership of the NSC decision-making principals committee — the one that weighed options to respond to Syria’s sarin nerve gas attack on civilians. Gen. McMaster eased out Mr. Bannon as a permanent member. He brought on Gen. Dunford and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats as standing members instead of invitees.

“So the president was immediately notified upon news of the chemical attack, and he was very interested in understanding better the circumstances of the attack and who was responsible,” is how Gen. McMaster described the beginning of war cabinet discussions.

Of the NSC shake-up, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, “We had talked about the fact that he would have full authority to oversee the National Security Council in terms of personnel and structure, and he has.”

Mr. Kelly was viewed as “taking the hit” for the White House’s missteps on the president’s first executive order travel ban, which was blocked by federal judges. The former Marine general appeared before the press and Congress to discourage talk that he was out of the loop and at odds with the White House.

When Democrats demanded a briefing on the Homeland Security Department’s hunt for criminal illegal aliens, Mr. Kelly picked himself to enter the firing line. He survived several heated exchanges.

While Mr. Trump has bonded with his three Marines and a soldier, the group has sharp critics.

Conservatives say Mr. Mattis is politically tone-deaf on appointees and wanted to put Trump critics, moderates or even Democrats in prestigious Pentagon jobs that should go to the ideologically right.

Gen. McMaster is criticized for his insistence that the violent Islamic State terrorist group has nothing to do with Islam the religion. His position is rebutted by conservative scholars, who say clerics, mosques and Muslim teachings all combine to support radical Islam.

Mr. Trump generally adheres to this view and has continued to refer to terrorists as Islamic extremists.

His funeral this week has drawn hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of mourners across the country .
Referring to the deployment of U.S. forces in Iraq , Zarif said the reaction to Soleimani 's death would `` make it almost impossible for the U.S. to continue to stay in this region . ''

Regarding the deal between Iran and six other nations , including the U.S. , to limit its nuclear program , Zarif said `` all limits '' on centrifuges used to enrich uranium `` are now suspended , '' insisting that Tehran was still complying with other aspects of the agreement , known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , or JCPOA .

Let's take the next few minutes to fact-check President Trump's claims about how much the U.S. and other member countries are contributing to NATO defense spending. Here's NPR national security correspondent David Welna.

DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Trump has said it before about NATO's European allies, and he said it again this morning in Brussels at breakfast.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money from many years back where they're delinquent, as far as I'm concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them. So if you go back 10 or 20 years, you just add it all up. It's massive amounts of money that's owed.

WELNA: In fact, the U.S. has not been stiffed for unpaid bills by NATO allies. Former Obama administration National Security Council official Aaron O'Connell says NATO is not like a club with annual membership fees.

AARON O'CONNELL: There is no ledger that maintains accounts of what countries pay and owe. There are no dues to NATO. It's not set up that way.

WELNA: NATO members did make a commitment four years ago to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense by 2024. Just nine of the military alliance's 29 members are expected to reach that mark this year. Trump this morning singled out Germany, the biggest economic power in NATO after the U.S.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Germany is just paying a little bit over 1 percent, whereas the United States in actual numbers is paying 4.2 percent.

WELNA: Germany indeed devotes only about 1-and-a-quarter percent of its GDP to defense. While it has boosted defense spending the past two years, Germany, like about half the other NATO members, does not plan to reach 2 percent by 2024. Trump today told NATO member states they should be spending 4 percent of their GDP. But his own claim that the U.S. is spending 4.2 percent of GDP is at odds with the Pentagon, which puts it at 3.3 percent. American University NATO scholar Garret Martin says in any case, U.S. defense needs vastly surpass those of its European allies.

GARRET MARTIN: We're not comparing apples to apples. The United States is a global military power with global military commitments. NATO and the transatlantic geographical area is only a part of what the United States military does. That's not necessarily true for most of the European members of the alliance.

WELNA: Last week at a rally in Montana, Trump made another claim about NATO funding.

WELNA: Close - NATO reported yesterday that spending by European members has increased by $35 billion. American University's Martin says the higher spending continues a trend that predates Trump.

MARTIN: I think once the trend started changing in 2014, that created momentum even before he became president. Now, maybe there's a bit more urgency now because he's blunter than his predecessors in criticizing his European partners.

WELNA: And as NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg pointed out today, despite Trump's complaints about the U.S. spending too much, it's actually spending more than before.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JENS STOLTENBERG: Actions speak louder than words because since Trump became president, U.S. funding for military presence in Europe, the European Deterrence Initiative, has been increased by 40 percent.

WELNA: That spending was approved by Congress, where the Senate last night and the House today overwhelmingly approved resolutions backing NATO. David Welna, NPR News, Washington.

Trump Jr. accepted the meeting after an acquaintance offered to provide him with dirt on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . A Russian government attorney at the behest of Russia ’ s prosecutor general would provide the information , according to the acquaintance .
The offer matches up loosely with some of the allegations in the dossier , including that the Kremlin provided dirt on Trump ’ s political opponents .
Trump Jr. and others in the meeting say that it went nowhere and no meaningful information was exchanged . They also say that there was no follow up to the meeting , which lasted around 20 minutes .

The origin story of the 35-page document was pretty simple at the outset. Fusion GPS, which was investigating then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, hired former British spy Christopher Steele to write the dossier.

But as more details about the dossier trickle out into the public forum, connections have surfaced that raise questions about how information made its way into the salacious document.

Here are the four most significant “coincidences.”

Trump Tower

The first coincidence to emerge from the dossier involved the June 9, 2016, meeting held at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and a group of Russians.

Two of the Russians in the meeting — Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin — happened to be working at the time of that meeting with Glenn Simpson, the founder of the opposition research firm that commissioned the dossier.

“I mean, thank God I didn’t know anything about the Trump Tower meeting, or I would really have some explaining to do,” he told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during a closed-door interview in November.

The Ohrs

Before and after the election, Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr was in contact with Steele, a former MI6 agent. And weeks after Trump’s win, Ohr met with Simpson to discuss his work on Trump.

That revelation, which was publicized in December, is strange enough. But Ohr had another connection to the dossier project. His wife, a Russia expert named Nellie, worked as a researcher for Fusion GPS on its Trump investigation. (RELATED: Fusion GPS Could Have Been Buying Access To DOJ)

‘Vicious Sid,’ ‘Mr. Fixer’ and the Department of State

The newest coincidence to emerge out of the dossier quagmire centers around Sidney Blumenthal and Cody Shearer, two quintessential Clinton insiders.

Known as “Vicious Sid” and “Mr. Fixer,” respectively, the two friends passed salacious allegations about Trump to a State Department official named Jonathan Winer.

Winer, who is friends with Blumenthal, in turn, gave the information to Steele.

Steele provided the information to the FBI in October 2016, according to a recent report by The Guardian.

The Papadopoulos Connection

The young Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians also has a possible link to the dossier.

national_security,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/22/trump-mueller-report-survive-226101,Can Trump Survive Mueller?,2019-03-22,"Michael Kruse, Alexandra Glorioso","“ Well , ” the newswoman said to Donald Trump , “ you ’ re under a tremendous amount of pressure lately . ”
It was April 6 , 1990 , and Paula Zahn on CBS actually had plenty of reasons to think Trump might be feeling anxious . It hadn ’ t been two months since the hyper-public , tabloid-tawdry revelation that his philandering had shattered his marriage to the mother of his first three children . He and his executives were grappling with the flawed , frantic opening of the newest , gaudiest , most expensive and most debt-bloated of his three casinos in Atlantic City . And reporters who covered money instead of celebrity had started to suss out the unsteadiness of Trump ’ s overall financial state .
“ Both in your professional life and your personal life , ” Zahn offered .
Nearly three decades have passed . Even in Trump ’ s perma-perilous presidency , this is a juncture that pulses with risk . Newly empowered Democrats in Congress are ramping up multiple investigations , and talk of impeachment is impossible to avoid . Looming largest over this tumultuous battlefield , though , is the report special counsel Robert Mueller appears poised to submit to Attorney General William Barr—the culmination of nearly two years of labor and the subject of immeasurable speculation . While Trump often awards himself and his administration “ A-plus ” grades , many others question whether he will be able to sustain his rosy self-assessment once the details of Mueller ’ s findings become public .
Every flurry of tweets from the president—and last weekend ’ s two-day grievance bender against late-night comedy and cable news shows was a particularly strong example—begets new pronouncements that Trump is coming unglued from the strain . George Conway , husband of close Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway , hauled out the clinical definition of narcissistic personality disorder to make the case that Trump is not only unfit for office but becoming catastrophically worse . And psychiatrists are speaking with dire predictions about the potential for a deranged person with extraordinary powers to create global mayhem and destruction .
“ He has very poor coping mechanisms when he is criticized or when he feels humiliated , ” Bandy Lee , a forensic psychiatrist from Yale and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump , the second edition of which is out this month , told me , “ and at these points he generally goes into attack mode and he threatens others or tries to get revenge . The Mueller report is of a scale that is probably unlike what we have seen him undergo before . ”
Worst-case scenario ? “ Obliterate observing eyes of his humiliation , ” Lee said . Meaning ? “ Destroying the world . That , very quickly , becomes an avenue , a perceived solution … for individuals with his personality structure . ”
Make what you will of such medical predictions , but the historical record tells a different story . The back-and-forth with Zahn is an instructive ( and comforting ? ) reminder about overstating Trump ’ s fragility . The Trump campaign in 2015 and ’ 16 careened from kill shot to kill shot , of course , and just kept going , right to the White House—and that was not the first time he flashed his ability to mitigate calamity and deftly skirt what might have seemed like an inevitable comeuppance . Whether or not Trump could remain not only financially solvent but reputationally intact was an open question for the entirety of the first half of the 1990s . So many times , he could have been snuffed , stopped , rendered a relative footnote , his place in the history of this country limited to status as a gauche totem of a regrettable epoch of greed . That , needless to say , is not how the tale played out . Trump is many things . A developer . A promoter . A master media manipulator . A grown-old rich kid . The president of the United States . Above all else , though , he is a survivor .
“ The ultimate survivor , ” former Trump casino executive Jack O ’ Donnell told me recently .
Trump ’ s Trophies : Trump had a tendency to spend on things he couldn ’ t afford—like his Manhattan Plaza Hotel , left , a luxury yacht , top right , and his 1989 airline Trump Shuttle , bottom left—mostly with borrowed money . | AP Images , AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler , JetPix/Wikimedia Commons
But it ’ s not just that Trump has survived that ’ s important to consider at this moment—it ’ s how he has done it . Armed with extraordinary audacity , constitutional sangfroid , a stomach for tumult , an acumen for recasting obvious losses into strange sorts of wins , and the prodigious safety net bequeathed by his wealthy , wily father , he has plowed past myriad hazards . And he did it by tying himself tightly to his bankers and lenders in New York and to gaming industry regulators in New Jersey—who let him live large until they couldn ’ t let him die without fatally wounding themselves . He effectively inhabited hosts , using them to get bigger and bigger in the ’ 80s until he was practically perversely invincible by the ’ 90s—not only “ too big to fail , ” as the late Wayne Barrett once told Susan Glasser and me , but “ too big to jail . ”
Perhaps his past escapes are the reason he appears oddly calm as most of the country leans forward , awaiting word of bombshells from Mueller . Over the weekend , when outsiders perceived mounting anxiety in Trump ’ s Twitter barrage , people who spoke to Trump by phone told reporters that “ he seemed to be in good spirits. ” The volume of tweets , they surmised , was just a product of too much time on his hands in the White House .
His bravado and bluster can ’ t mask , his critics say , the true jeopardy he faces . The stakes now are too high , the arena too large , the political currents too strong , for Trump to expect the same results . But if he does fail , pinned to account by the weight of evidence uncovered by Mueller , one thing is certain : It will be the first time .
Those who believe in the power of Trump ’ s survival skills to protect him from even this unprecedented threat draw an analogy between the Republican Party—its members of Congress and especially the Senate—and the institutions that have enabled him in the past .
“ The banks were heavily invested in Trump , and they couldn ’ t have him go down , ” former Trump campaign staffer Sam Nunberg told me , “ and the Republican Party can ’ t have him go down . ”
“ I think he believes that the presidency is too big to fail , too powerful to be taken down , ” O ’ Donnell added . “ And I think that this is kind of something that he learned in the ‘ 90s , where the banks basically said to him , ‘ You ’ re too big to fail , we have to back you. ’ And they did it , time and time again , in Atlantic City . ”
To be determined in the coming weeks and months : how well those lessons will hold up .
“ This is a man who has lived dangerously for decades by flirting with the boundaries of propriety , legality and civility , ” Trump biographer Tim O ’ Brien told me . “ And he is now faced , after years and years of getting away with it , with consequences that are far beyond anything he ’ s encountered before . … The things that I think have allowed him to survive in the past will be of practical , personal use here in terms of him maintaining a stiff upper lip , if he ’ s able to. ” But the more material applicability of the Machiavellian takeaways from his ‘ 90s scrapes ? “ I think they ’ re going to be absolutely of no use if the legal consequences are realized at their full magnitude . ”
“ No matter what they do , he survives . No matter what they try , he survives , ” longtime New York Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf told me . “ Can Trump survive this ? He absolutely can . ”
In the middle of 1990 , after all , he was more than $ 3 billion in the red . He had for years spent too much to buy too much , all with mostly borrowed money . The yacht , the airline , Manhattan ’ s Plaza Hotel . “ Trophies , ” he called them . And his casinos , first two , now three with the lurching launch of the Trump Taj Mahal , cannibalized each other . Even record rakes of cash weren ’ t enough to simply service all of Trump ’ s debt . On the horizon was the first of his six corporate bankruptcies .
“ Trump is on his way down—and probably out , ” business journalist Allan Sloan wrote that June in Newsday .
People didn ’ t stop at mere predictions . They also poked fun .
“ I envision Donald Trump a year from now doing the ads for stomach-flatteners or ginsu knives on late-night TV . Or as a Worldwide Wrestling Federation commentator , ” Gail Collins , then a columnist for the New York Daily News , told David Von Drehle , then a reporter for the Miami Herald .
Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown likened Trump to late-in-life Elvis . “ He probably will wind up in that sort of Graceland , you know , wearing a diaper , ” she told Steve Kroft of CBS News .
Spy , the puckish satirical magazine and inveterate needler of Trump , in its August 1990 issue took a tongue-in-cheek look at what they foresaw as a sad , middling future for a balding , paunchy Trump . Their crystal ball , though , was not all wrong . They anticipated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing , and a rough version of reality television , too—and a public offering that would permit Trump to use money from shareholders to make money of his own ( “ Now YOU can own a piece of the Trump ! ” ) .
But beyond the smart set ’ s schadenfreude were Trump ’ s real-life results .
After weeks of negotiations , the cluster of 70-some-odd banks that had loaned him billions of dollars gave him an additional $ 65 million loan . It was the first in a yearslong sequence of bailouts and extensions and breathing-room reprieves . They had loaned him so much money , it was no longer only his problem—it was theirs . He all but dared them to take him down . “ He has a good bit of leverage over the institutions , ” a Harvard Business School finance professor told the Boston Globe at the time . “ His adjusted net worth is minus several hundred million dollars , by my estimate , and he is alive only because his bankers are too red-faced to pull the plug on his life-support system , ” the chairman of a money management firm wrote in the New York Post . “ The most important thing , ” an official in the office of one of his lenders said in The American Banker , “ is to make Trump survive . ”
The banks over time clawed back a passel of Trump ’ s possessions ( the yacht , the planes , the Plaza ) , but they didn ’ t take his casinos—because they didn ’ t want them . “ The last thing they want to do is manage casinos , ” an analyst from Moody ’ s Investors explained to the Associated Press . And the last thing the gaming officials and city leaders in New Jersey wanted was to have them close . The relationship was the same as with the banks back in New York . Desperate to prop up the flagging gaming industry , looking continually to the casinos to inject into the struggling seaside town at least the appearance of vitality and prosperity , they needed Trump as much as Trump needed them . A prerequisite to owning a casino in Atlantic City , understandably , was financial stability , and regulators could have stripped Trump of his—repeatedly—but of course didn ’ t . Trump ’ s casinos amounted to roughly a third of the market . “ The whole economic development of the town , ” said O ’ Donnell , “ it was dependent on this . And so they just—they caved . ”
Trump had managed to turn an apparent weakness into a significant advantage . The banks put him on an allowance … of $ 450,000 a month . The Trump Tower triplex was safe .
“ The man is a Sherman tank in a Brioni suit , ” New York Post gossip columnist and Trump pal Cindy Adams told USA Today .
“ Hey , look , I had a cold spell from 1990 to ’ 91 , ” he said in 1994 in New York . “ I was beat up in business and in my personal life . … But you learn that you ’ re either the toughest , meanest piece of shit in the world , or you just crawl into a corner , put your finger in your mouth , and say , ‘ I want to go home. ’ ” And Trump didn ’ t want to go home .
He wasn ’ t entirely in the clear , though , until 1995 and ’ 96 , when his need for money finally superseded his desire for absolute control and he took his casinos public . He sat in his office and looked at O ’ Brien , then a reporter for the Wall Street Journal . He was “ back , ” he said . People bought stock in Trump and lost money in droves . Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts proved to be a good investment for just one person—Trump . “ It was to get other people to get him out of that debt , ” a former member of the Trump Organization told me . In addition to his selling of his stake in his foundation-laying Grand Hyatt and tens of millions of dollars of wrangled , well-timed loans from family trusts , it ’ s what saved Trump—along with a partnership with Hong Kong investors that turned his long-held plot of land on the Upper West Side that always cost him money into one that began to actually make him money . Construction on what would have been Trump City and now would be called Trump Place ( and then wouldn ’ t ) started in 1997 . And two years later , in front of some of the buildings , Trump let the magician David Blaine get “ buried alive ” for a week in a plexiglass coffin . It was , said Blaine , a stunt famed illusionist Harry Houdini always wanted to do . For Trump , the publicity ploy made for an apt ode to the art of escape .
Trumpologists and culture critics frequently cite showman P.T . Barnum as Trump ’ s preeminent antecedent , but another , less noted inspiration was Houdini , the author of a forthcoming Houdini biography told me . “ He always found—especially when it just seemed like it was over for him—he found some new chapter , and some new way to sort of get his success going again , ” Joe Posnanski said . “ He created this handcuff act , and the handcuff act becomes huge , and then that sort of runs its course .

It was April 6, 1990, and Paula Zahn on CBS actually had plenty of reasons to think Trump might be feeling anxious. It hadn’t been two months since the hyper-public, tabloid-tawdry revelation that his philandering had shattered his marriage to the mother of his first three children. He and his executives were grappling with the flawed, frantic opening of the newest, gaudiest, most expensive and most debt-bloated of his three casinos in Atlantic City. And reporters who covered money instead of celebrity had started to suss out the unsteadiness of Trump’s overall financial state.

“Both in your professional life and your personal life,” Zahn offered.

She asked how he was doing.

“I feel great,” Trump replied. “I’m doing well.”

Nearly three decades have passed. Even in Trump’s perma-perilous presidency, this is a juncture that pulses with risk. Newly empowered Democrats in Congress are ramping up multiple investigations, and talk of impeachment is impossible to avoid. Looming largest over this tumultuous battlefield, though, is the report special counsel Robert Mueller appears poised to submit to Attorney General William Barr—the culmination of nearly two years of labor and the subject of immeasurable speculation. While Trump often awards himself and his administration “A-plus” grades, many others question whether he will be able to sustain his rosy self-assessment once the details of Mueller’s findings become public.

Every flurry of tweets from the president—and last weekend’s two-day grievance bender against late-night comedy and cable news shows was a particularly strong example—begets new pronouncements that Trump is coming unglued from the strain. George Conway, husband of close Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, hauled out the clinical definition of narcissistic personality disorder to make the case that Trump is not only unfit for office but becoming catastrophically worse. And psychiatrists are speaking with dire predictions about the potential for a deranged person with extraordinary powers to create global mayhem and destruction.

“He has very poor coping mechanisms when he is criticized or when he feels humiliated,” Bandy Lee, a forensic psychiatrist from Yale and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, the second edition of which is out this month, told me, “and at these points he generally goes into attack mode and he threatens others or tries to get revenge. The Mueller report is of a scale that is probably unlike what we have seen him undergo before.”

Worst-case scenario? “Obliterate observing eyes of his humiliation,” Lee said. Meaning? “Destroying the world. That, very quickly, becomes an avenue, a perceived solution … for individuals with his personality structure.”

Make what you will of such medical predictions, but the historical record tells a different story. The back-and-forth with Zahn is an instructive (and comforting?) reminder about overstating Trump’s fragility. The Trump campaign in 2015 and ’16 careened from kill shot to kill shot, of course, and just kept going, right to the White House—and that was not the first time he flashed his ability to mitigate calamity and deftly skirt what might have seemed like an inevitable comeuppance. Whether or not Trump could remain not only financially solvent but reputationally intact was an open question for the entirety of the first half of the 1990s. So many times, he could have been snuffed, stopped, rendered a relative footnote, his place in the history of this country limited to status as a gauche totem of a regrettable epoch of greed. That, needless to say, is not how the tale played out. Trump is many things. A developer. A promoter. A master media manipulator. A grown-old rich kid. The president of the United States. Above all else, though, he is a survivor.

“The ultimate survivor,” former Trump casino executive Jack O’Donnell told me recently.

But it’s not just that Trump has survived that’s important to consider at this moment—it’s how he has done it. Armed with extraordinary audacity, constitutional sangfroid, a stomach for tumult, an acumen for recasting obvious losses into strange sorts of wins, and the prodigious safety net bequeathed by his wealthy, wily father, he has plowed past myriad hazards. And he did it by tying himself tightly to his bankers and lenders in New York and to gaming industry regulators in New Jersey—who let him live large until they couldn’t let him die without fatally wounding themselves. He effectively inhabited hosts, using them to get bigger and bigger in the ’80s until he was practically perversely invincible by the ’90s—not only “too big to fail,” as the late Wayne Barrett once told Susan Glasser and me, but “too big to jail.”

Perhaps his past escapes are the reason he appears oddly calm as most of the country leans forward, awaiting word of bombshells from Mueller. Over the weekend, when outsiders perceived mounting anxiety in Trump’s Twitter barrage, people who spoke to Trump by phone told reporters that “he seemed to be in good spirits.” The volume of tweets, they surmised, was just a product of too much time on his hands in the White House.

His bravado and bluster can’t mask, his critics say, the true jeopardy he faces. The stakes now are too high, the arena too large, the political currents too strong, for Trump to expect the same results. But if he does fail, pinned to account by the weight of evidence uncovered by Mueller, one thing is certain: It will be the first time.



***

Those who believe in the power of Trump’s survival skills to protect him from even this unprecedented threat draw an analogy between the Republican Party—its members of Congress and especially the Senate—and the institutions that have enabled him in the past.

“The banks were heavily invested in Trump, and they couldn’t have him go down,” former Trump campaign staffer Sam Nunberg told me, “and the Republican Party can’t have him go down.”

“I think he believes that the presidency is too big to fail, too powerful to be taken down,” O’Donnell added. “And I think that this is kind of something that he learned in the ‘90s, where the banks basically said to him, ‘You’re too big to fail, we have to back you.’ And they did it, time and time again, in Atlantic City.”

To be determined in the coming weeks and months: how well those lessons will hold up.

“This is a man who has lived dangerously for decades by flirting with the boundaries of propriety, legality and civility,” Trump biographer Tim O’Brien told me. “And he is now faced, after years and years of getting away with it, with consequences that are far beyond anything he’s encountered before. … The things that I think have allowed him to survive in the past will be of practical, personal use here in terms of him maintaining a stiff upper lip, if he’s able to.” But the more material applicability of the Machiavellian takeaways from his ‘90s scrapes? “I think they’re going to be absolutely of no use if the legal consequences are realized at their full magnitude.”

Others who know Trump well aren’t so sure.

“No matter what they do, he survives. No matter what they try, he survives,” longtime New York Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf told me. “Can Trump survive this? He absolutely can.”

In the middle of 1990, after all, he was more than $3 billion in the red. He had for years spent too much to buy too much, all with mostly borrowed money. The yacht, the airline, Manhattan’s Plaza Hotel. “Trophies,” he called them. And his casinos, first two, now three with the lurching launch of the Trump Taj Mahal, cannibalized each other. Even record rakes of cash weren’t enough to simply service all of Trump’s debt. On the horizon was the first of his six corporate bankruptcies.

“Trump is on his way down—and probably out,” business journalist Allan Sloan wrote that June in Newsday.

People didn’t stop at mere predictions. They also poked fun.

“I envision Donald Trump a year from now doing the ads for stomach-flatteners or ginsu knives on late-night TV. Or as a Worldwide Wrestling Federation commentator,” Gail Collins, then a columnist for the New York Daily News, told David Von Drehle, then a reporter for the Miami Herald.

Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown likened Trump to late-in-life Elvis. “He probably will wind up in that sort of Graceland, you know, wearing a diaper,” she told Steve Kroft of CBS News.

Spy, the puckish satirical magazine and inveterate needler of Trump, in its August 1990 issue took a tongue-in-cheek look at what they foresaw as a sad, middling future for a balding, paunchy Trump. Their crystal ball, though, was not all wrong. They anticipated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, and a rough version of reality television, too—and a public offering that would permit Trump to use money from shareholders to make money of his own (“Now YOU can own a piece of the Trump!”).

But beyond the smart set’s schadenfreude were Trump’s real-life results.

After weeks of negotiations, the cluster of 70-some-odd banks that had loaned him billions of dollars gave him an additional $65 million loan. It was the first in a yearslong sequence of bailouts and extensions and breathing-room reprieves. They had loaned him so much money, it was no longer only his problem—it was theirs. He all but dared them to take him down. “He has a good bit of leverage over the institutions,” a Harvard Business School finance professor told the Boston Globe at the time. “His adjusted net worth is minus several hundred million dollars, by my estimate, and he is alive only because his bankers are too red-faced to pull the plug on his life-support system,” the chairman of a money management firm wrote in the New York Post. “The most important thing,” an official in the office of one of his lenders said in The American Banker, “is to make Trump survive.”

Trump the Candidate: Despite a number of incidents that might have taken any other candidate down—including the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, pictured above, in which he swaggered about sexual assault—Trump was elected president on Nov. 8, 2016 and delivered his acceptance speech, pictured below, in the early hours of the following morning. | YouTube, Spencer Platt/Getty Images

The banks over time clawed back a passel of Trump’s possessions (the yacht, the planes, the Plaza), but they didn’t take his casinos—because they didn’t want them. “The last thing they want to do is manage casinos,” an analyst from Moody’s Investors explained to the Associated Press. And the last thing the gaming officials and city leaders in New Jersey wanted was to have them close. The relationship was the same as with the banks back in New York. Desperate to prop up the flagging gaming industry, looking continually to the casinos to inject into the struggling seaside town at least the appearance of vitality and prosperity, they needed Trump as much as Trump needed them. A prerequisite to owning a casino in Atlantic City, understandably, was financial stability, and regulators could have stripped Trump of his—repeatedly—but of course didn’t. Trump’s casinos amounted to roughly a third of the market. “The whole economic development of the town,” said O’Donnell, “it was dependent on this. And so they just—they caved.”

Trump had managed to turn an apparent weakness into a significant advantage. The banks put him on an allowance … of $450,000 a month. The Trump Tower triplex was safe.

“The man is a Sherman tank in a Brioni suit,” New York Post gossip columnist and Trump pal Cindy Adams told USA Today.

“Hey, look, I had a cold spell from 1990 to ’91,” he said in 1994 in New York. “I was beat up in business and in my personal life. … But you learn that you’re either the toughest, meanest piece of shit in the world, or you just crawl into a corner, put your finger in your mouth, and say, ‘I want to go home.’” And Trump didn’t want to go home.

He wasn’t entirely in the clear, though, until 1995 and ’96, when his need for money finally superseded his desire for absolute control and he took his casinos public. He sat in his office and looked at O’Brien, then a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. He was “back,” he said. People bought stock in Trump and lost money in droves. Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts proved to be a good investment for just one person—Trump. “It was to get other people to get him out of that debt,” a former member of the Trump Organization told me. In addition to his selling of his stake in his foundation-laying Grand Hyatt and tens of millions of dollars of wrangled, well-timed loans from family trusts, it’s what saved Trump—along with a partnership with Hong Kong investors that turned his long-held plot of land on the Upper West Side that always cost him money into one that began to actually make him money. Construction on what would have been Trump City and now would be called Trump Place (and then wouldn’t) started in 1997. And two years later, in front of some of the buildings, Trump let the magician David Blaine get “buried alive” for a week in a plexiglass coffin. It was, said Blaine, a stunt famed illusionist Harry Houdini always wanted to do. For Trump, the publicity ploy made for an apt ode to the art of escape.

Trumpologists and culture critics frequently cite showman P.T. Barnum as Trump’s preeminent antecedent, but another, less noted inspiration was Houdini, the author of a forthcoming Houdini biography told me. “He always found—especially when it just seemed like it was over for him—he found some new chapter, and some new way to sort of get his success going again,” Joe Posnanski said. “He created this handcuff act, and the handcuff act becomes huge, and then that sort of runs its course. And then he comes up with the milk can, and the milk can sort of runs its course. And he comes up with the Chinese water torture cell, and that runs his course. And he starts hanging upside down and escaping from straitjackets.”

It makes Posnanski think of Trump.

“With Trump, you just think, ‘OK, this is it. This is totally it, you know?’” he said. “He’s bankrupt, people are laughing at him, he’s this, he’s that—but it’s never over for him.”

“Trump,” said Sheinkopf, the Democratic strategist, “is incessantly pulling Houdini acts.”

Recall all the “gaffes” that were to have torpedoed his indelicate, unorthodox 2016 presidential bid—peaking, of course, with the “Access Hollywood” tape revealed in early October in which he swaggered about sexual assault.

National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster was added to the administration's growing list of former White House officials Thursday when President Trump announced he was replacing McMaster with former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.

Bolton is a hawk's hawk who has repeatedly said he believes the United States has the right to take the first shot to handle potential threats.

Several commentators have expressed concern that Bolton's bellicose approach will only encourage Trump's more aggressive foreign policy instincts and could help lead the United States into what might be otherwise avoidable military conflicts.

Here are some facts from Bolton's past that help show why his appointment has made some people nervous.

He thinks pre-emptive war with Iran and North Korea is the right call

In a February op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Bolton made the ""legal case for striking North Korea first"" to stop what he deems an ""imminent threat"" from the nation's nuclear program.

Bolton is strongly opposed to the Iran nuclear deal and said on Fox News that the United States ""has no other option"" than to bomb the country. According to The American Conservative, ""he has been obsessed for many years with going to war against the Islamic Republic.""

He still thinks invading Iraq was the right call

In the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Bolton joined other administration officials in expressing confidence that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that Iraqis would welcome the U.S. overthrow of the regime.

Both those predictions turned out to be incorrect, but unlike his new boss, Bolton still believes the invasion was the right decision.

""I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,"" Bolton told the Washington Examiner in 2015. ""I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces.""

He resisted efforts to investigate the Iran-Contra scandal

Bolton was working as an assistant attorney general in the Reagan administration during the Iran-Contra affair. During that investigation, Bolton argued that the Ethics in Government Act establishing an independent counsel was unconstitutional because the authority to direct, supervise and fire any federal prosecutor should remain with ""the president or his delegate.""

According to The Nation, Bolton also ""tried to torpedo"" then-senator John Kerry's investigation into alleged drug smuggling and gun running by Reagan-backed contra rebels in the civil war against Nicaragua's Sandinista government.

He is not a big U.N. fan

When former president George W. Bush appointed Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations it was pointed out that his nominee was not a fan of the organization.

In particular, critics pointed to his February 1994 statement at the “Global Structures Convocation” that, ""The Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories. If it lost ten stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference. The United Nations is one of the most inefficient inter-governmental organizations going.""

Bolton also said, ""The United States makes the UN work when it wants it to work, and that is exactly the way it should be, because the only question, the only question for the United States is what is in our national interest. And if you don’t like that, I’m sorry, but that is the fact.""

He once joked that Obama is a Muslim

During his 2016 keynote address to the American Freedom Alliance, Bolton managed to imply former president Barack Obama was both a Muslim and a monarch.

Bolton spoke of King Abdullah of Jordan, who he joked ""is not simply a Muslim king of a Muslim country, unlike our president.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified the American Freedom Alliance as an anti-Muslim hate group, but the AFA has strongly rejected the designation.

AFA President Karen Siegemund called the hate group label ""absurd"" and the AFA had considered suing the SPLC.

""Speaking the truth got us on the hate list,"" Siegemund said at an AFA conference in November. ""We got on the hate list for speaking out against hate.""

Drones have become an increasingly popular tool for industry and government .
Electric utilities use them to inspect transmission lines . Oil companies fly them over pipelines . The Interior Department even deployed them to track lava flows at Hawaii 's Kilauea volcano .
But the Department of Homeland Security is warning that drones manufactured by Chinese companies could pose security risks , including that the data they gather could be stolen .
The department sent out an alert on the subject on May 20 , and a video on its website notes that drones in general pose multiple threats , including `` their potential use for terrorism , mass casualty incidents , interference with air traffic , as well as corporate espionage and invasions of privacy . ''
We could pull information down and upload information on a flying drone . You could also hijack the drone . ''
Most drones bought in the U.S. are manufactured in China , with most of those drones made by one company , DJI Technology . Lanier Watkins , a cyber-research scientist at Johns Hopkins University 's Information Security Institute , said his team discovered vulnerabilities in DJI 's drones .
`` We could pull information down and upload information on a flying drone , '' Watkins said . `` You could also hijack the drone . ''
The vulnerabilities meant that `` someone who was interested in , you know , where a certain pipeline network was or maybe the vulnerabilities in a power utilities ' wiring might be able to access that information , '' he noted .
DJI offered a bounty for researchers to uncover bugs in its drones , although Walker said Johns Hopkins did n't accept any money .

Politics DHS Warnings About Chinese Technology Add To Concerns With Ongoing Trade Tensions DHS Warnings About Chinese Technology Add To Concerns With Ongoing Trade Tensions Listen · 3:42 3:42

Drones have become an increasingly popular tool for industry and government.

Electric utilities use them to inspect transmission lines. Oil companies fly them over pipelines. The Interior Department even deployed them to track lava flows at Hawaii's Kilauea volcano.

But the Department of Homeland Security is warning that drones manufactured by Chinese companies could pose security risks, including that the data they gather could be stolen.

The department sent out an alert on the subject on May 20, and a video on its website notes that drones in general pose multiple threats, including ""their potential use for terrorism, mass casualty incidents, interference with air traffic, as well as corporate espionage and invasions of privacy.""

We could pull information down and upload information on a flying drone. You could also hijack the drone.""

""We're not being paranoid,"" the video's narrator adds.

Most drones bought in the U.S. are manufactured in China, with most of those drones made by one company, DJI Technology. Lanier Watkins, a cyber-research scientist at Johns Hopkins University's Information Security Institute, said his team discovered vulnerabilities in DJI's drones.

""We could pull information down and upload information on a flying drone,"" Watkins said. ""You could also hijack the drone.""

The vulnerabilities meant that ""someone who was interested in, you know, where a certain pipeline network was or maybe the vulnerabilities in a power utilities' wiring might be able to access that information,"" he noted.

DJI offered a bounty for researchers to uncover bugs in its drones, although Walker said Johns Hopkins didn't accept any money.

In a statement, DJI said:

""At DJI, safety is at the core of everything we do, and the security of our technology has been independently verified by the U.S. government and leading U.S. businesses. DJI is leading the industry on this topic and our technology platform has enabled businesses and government agencies to establish best practices for managing their drone data. We give all customers full and complete control over how their data is collected, stored, and transmitted. ""For government and critical infrastructure customers that require additional assurances, we provide drones that do not transfer data to DJI or via the Internet, and our customers can enable all the precautions DHS recommends. Every day, American businesses, first responders, and U.S. government agencies trust DJI drones to help save lives, promote worker safety, and support vital operations, and we take that responsibility very seriously. We are committed to continuously working with our customers and industry and government stakeholders to ensure our technology adheres to all of their requirements.""

There are other, more covert, ways that foreign governments could obtain the type of information gathered by drones, said John Villasenor, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who teaches at UCLA.

""[If] you fly a drone above a pipeline, there's a pretty good chance someone is gonna see it up there,"" he said, but ""a spy satellite just takes a picture from 120 miles up or whatever. Then, of course, no one's going to know what happened.""

This is not the first time the U.S. government has expressed concern over the use of Chinese-made drones. In 2017, the U.S. Army barred use of DJI's drones.

Villasenor said the government's concern over Chinese drones ""is not new, although the fact that it has surfaced now may or may not be tied to these broader trade tensions which have flared up in recent months.""

The Department of Homeland Security's warning about Chinese drones coincides with the Trump administration's campaign against tech manufacturer Huawei, which also coincides with the ongoing trade war between the two countries.

It also comes as officials are warning transit agencies in New York and Washington, D.C., against buying new subway cars made by a Chinese manufacturer.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., along with the region's other Democratic senators, has introduced legislation prohibiting the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority from buying the Chinese-made cars because of security concerns.

""A rail car might have a whole host of sensors [and] communication tools, and when that equipment is manufactured in China,"" Warner said, ""and when that equipment sometimes can be upgraded on a remote basis in terms of a software upgrade, there are national security implications.""

Underlying the tech concerns is the Chinese government's control over all Chinese companies.

""The Communist Party of China now has in their law the ability to interfere and take information from virtually every Chinese company,"" Warner warned. ""And as long as that exists, that provides a whole set of vulnerabilities I think American business has to consider on a going-forward basis.""

Some note that “ confusion persists about Mueller 's labored explanation for why he felt constrained to say — flat out — whether Trump committed obstruction .

The ICE briefer never made it in the room , an administration official said .
If he had been allowed to speak , he would have told them that the limits they ’ re pondering to immigrant detention , proposed by Democrats , would lead to 30,000 people being released back onto the streets , including thousands of migrants with criminal records .
Even Senate Republicans ‘ ante would mean cuts to ICE ’ s ability to hold all the illegal immigrants the agency says need to be detained if the government is going to begin to make a dent in the illegal immigration problem .
While most of the public focus in the negotiations has been on President Trump ’ s call for a border wall , the number of detention beds available to hold illegal immigrants is just as big of a sticking point — and perhaps even more critical to achieving Mr. Trump ’ s stated goal of cutting illegal immigration .
“ ICE was disappointed not to be able to address the conference committee directly , ” the administration source told The ███ .
Left outside the room , ICE has instead produced a briefing document for the negotiators . The document defends the president ’ s call for 52,000 detention beds and says both Democrats ’ plan — cutting ICE to about 35,520 beds — and even Senate Republicans ‘ proposal of about 40,520 beds would mean dangerous migrants would have to be set free .
“ Up to 30,000 releases of criminals , illegal aliens with criminal charges and recent border crossers ” would not be held , ICE said . In some cases ICE would even be forced to break the law to release migrants deemed subject to “ mandatory detention ” by Congress , the briefing says .
Not only would that cut down on deterrence of illegal immigration , but it would mean fewer criminals would be ousted from American communities , ICE argued .
Both Democrats and Republicans negotiating the spending bill acknowledged beds are a major sticking point , along with the wall .
“ It ’ s one of the things that are being negotiated , ” said Sen. Jon Tester , Montana Democrat .
He disputed ICE ’ s claim that 30,000 migrants , including thousands of criminals , would be released under the Democratic plan .

Democrats ’ plan also calls for millions of dollars in additional funding to improve conditions at detention facilities .","A briefer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stood outside the closed-door meeting Wednesday while negotiators working on a homeland security spending deal heard from border experts, who made their pitch for a border wall.

The ICE briefer never made it in the room, an administration official said.

If he had been allowed to speak, he would have told them that the limits they’re pondering to immigrant detention, proposed by Democrats, would lead to 30,000 people being released back onto the streets, including thousands of migrants with criminal records.

Even Senate Republicans‘ ante would mean cuts to ICE’s ability to hold all the illegal immigrants the agency says need to be detained if the government is going to begin to make a dent in the illegal immigration problem.

While most of the public focus in the negotiations has been on President Trump’s call for a border wall, the number of detention beds available to hold illegal immigrants is just as big of a sticking point — and perhaps even more critical to achieving Mr. Trump’s stated goal of cutting illegal immigration.

“ICE was disappointed not to be able to address the conference committee directly,” the administration source told The Washington Times.

Left outside the room, ICE has instead produced a briefing document for the negotiators. The document defends the president’s call for 52,000 detention beds and says both Democrats’ plan — cutting ICE to about 35,520 beds — and even Senate Republicans‘ proposal of about 40,520 beds would mean dangerous migrants would have to be set free.

“Up to 30,000 releases of criminals, illegal aliens with criminal charges and recent border crossers” would not be held, ICE said. In some cases ICE would even be forced to break the law to release migrants deemed subject to “mandatory detention” by Congress, the briefing says.

Not only would that cut down on deterrence of illegal immigration, but it would mean fewer criminals would be ousted from American communities, ICE argued.

Both Democrats and Republicans negotiating the spending bill acknowledged beds are a major sticking point, along with the wall.

“It’s one of the things that are being negotiated,” said Sen. Jon Tester, Montana Democrat.

He disputed ICE’s claim that 30,000 migrants, including thousands of criminals, would be released under the Democratic plan.

“I really doubt that would be the case, but we’ll see,” he said.

Lawmakers also said they were happy to hear from Border Patrol officials Wednesday, who provided a secret briefing about what they need in terms of border wall.

“That was really the focus of the meeting, rather than ICE’s role. We’ll have funding in the package for ICE. The pushback that we’ve been getting is on the border barrier funding,” said Sen. John Hoeven, North Dakota Republican.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, Alabama Republican, said they heard from the people they thought they needed — and that was the Border Patrol.

“I guess you look back in retrospect, say we could have brought so and so in. I thought the meeting yesterday was overall very good — told us some things that we needed from the experts — not something we politically thought of,” he said.

Immigration experts, though, said detention beds are a critical component if Congress’s goal is to reduce illegal immigration.

“The border wall’s not unimportant, but we’re going to get more bang for the buck for detention than for extra fencing,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration controls.

“I’m not against extra fencing, I’m for it, but we put inordinate emphasis on it, when in fact holding people in detention to make sure they show up [for deportation] is going to be a more effective deterrent to future people,” he said.

“It is unacceptable that to date, the Trump administration appears to be ignoring a matter of great importance to Gold Star Family members whose loved ones were killed while serving in Afghanistan: were any U.S. troop casualties in Afghanistan connected with the alleged GRU bounty payments to Taliban-linked militants?""

( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )
Trump ’ s opponents at home and abroad would love to see him get the U.S. into a messy intervention right before the election .
Donald Trump inherited a superficially stable world from Barack Obama that , in fact , was quite volatile . There had been no tense standoffs with North Korea , but also apparent intercontinental ballistic missiles with possible nuclear warheads now pointed at the United States . Obama more or less punted on North Korea , by declaring it a problem — and hoping that Pyongyang ’ s missile and nuclear testing did not get too out of hand before 2017 .
Then there was the “ Iran deal. ” It was an appeasing agreement that almost surely guaranteed that Iran would soon have nuclear weapons , along with a revived economy liberated from sanctions and empowered with American cash . Iran ’ s terrorist surrogates were the greatest beneficiaries of U.S. naïveté . At best , Obama assumed that when Iran went nuclear , it would be on someone else ’ s presidential watch and therefore not his fault . At worst , Obama , in delusional fashion , believed that empowering Iran would balance Sunni states and bring justice to historically oppressed Shiite and Persian minorities who would take their rightful place in the Islamic world .
Everyone knew that China violated almost every aspect of world commerce . Everyone knew that China would never allow the U.S. to trade with China the same way that Beijing traded with America . Everyone knew that 1.3-billion-person China was a neo-imperialist Communist dictatorship that was headed on an announced trajectory of world hegemony . Obama in particular thought that stopping China ’ s agenda would be medicine that was more painful than the disease .
Like the proverbial medieval mice who voted to warn of a marauding carnivorous house cat by putting a bell around his neck , the prognosis of Chinese mercantilism and aggression — and the need to confront Beijing — was right-on . But no one wished to do the messy , dangerous work of belling the Chinese cat .
The Obama administration ’ s Russian “ reset ” was an ungodly disaster . Vladimir Putin absorbed Eastern Ukraine and Crimea . He interfered freely but often clumsily in U.S. elections — well prior to 2016 . John Kerry invited the Russians to reenter the Middle East on the lunatic idea of a Russian promise to address Syrian WMD . Putin violated prior agreements on the deployment of short-range missiles . The more Obama appeased Putin — dismantled missile defense in Eastern Europe , blamed the Bush administration for the tensions that were to be relieved by the reset , and in a hot-mic exchange offered to become more malleable with Putin if Putin would behave while Obama was up for reelection — the more Putin detested Obama .
Everyone knew that tired pretenses had nothing to do with the realities on the ground in the Middle East . The U.S. embassy belonged in Jerusalem . The Palestinians of today were no more “ refugees ” than were the Volga Germans . The strategic Golan Heights were never going to return to the Assad terrorist state . The U.S. had no business funneling financial assistance through the U.N. to Palestinians who either were engaged in terrorism or approved of it . Trump pulled back the curtain and showed all the little devilish men with gears and levers projecting a fake image of norms and protocols on the Middle East projection screen .
Again , these existential crises — Iran , North Korea , China , Russia , the Middle East — all preceded Trump . But they also all tested the Trump doctrine of restoring deterrence without engaging in costly optional wars in which in tactical victories can not translate into definable strategic success or clear U.S. advantage in a cost-benefit analysis .
Trump ’ s enemies hope ( translated into politicalese ) that his ambitious foreign policy does not follow the success of Trump ’ s dynamic economy . At home , Trump caused a stir by all at once opening up more federal leasing for energy exploration , green-lighting pipelines , massively deregulating , cutting taxes , jawboning outsourcers and off-shorers , confronting asymmetrical trade partners , pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and the Paris climate accord , and recalibrating NAFTA . That huge risk of maximum changes everywhere and swarming the opposition all at once achieved a force-multiplying effect on the economy that soon boomed .
Trump probably believes that if he goes full-bore abroad , true to form , a domino effect will follow , given that the U.S. gains more sway each time it faces down a miscreant . The stakes are certainly high . A big China trade deal , an agreement to denuclearize North Korea and Iran , flipping Putin to become a neutral rather than an adversary , or a Middle East halfway accord could change global realities and empower the U.S. And so the gambler Trump wagers that he can do overseas what he did at home and pull off land-breaking agreements — all at once .
Note that Trump shattered the blue wall in part because of his sober Jacksonianism : restoring U.S. tough deterrence without inserting a large military presence in any of the hellholes that U.S. troops have been deployed to in the past 50 years , much less falling into a conventional war that America could win , but only at considerable cost . Bombing the “ sh * t ” out of ISIS was a successful example of a non non-intervention . Early on , the canny Trump , alone of his Republican rivals , fathomed that voters neither wanted any more Obama apologetics nor would put up with another Afghanistan , Libya , or Iraq .
Squaring that circle of toughness without risking a major war is now Trump ’ s political challenge , given that the shelf life of rhetorical deterrence is brief .
The United States can not abide renegade lunatic regimes with nuclear missiles aimed at its heartland , or aggressive nuclearized regimes with which the U.S. had either already fought a major war or narrowly avoided one . China ’ s destruction of global trading norms only whets China ’ s appetite to translate its huge profits into military power and neocolonial adventurism , on the theory that countries that have appeased its mercantilism will probably do the same in matters of its aggressive foreign and military policy .
The Palestinians felt that during the Obama years they were insidiously persuading the United States to ostracize the moderate Arab regimes , embrace an Iranian foil , and decouple from Israel .
Putin asserted that his weak Russia was a match for a strong U.S. because he assumed that he was strong and Obama weak — and therefore his own godhead could do what his country otherwise could not .
Yet Trump all at once is attempting to straighten out all the foolishness of the last decade with China , Iran , North Korea , Russia , and the Middle East , and , again , he is doing so simultaneously , not sequentially . He might remember that China is the chief threat , and it has some leverage with both Iran and North Korea . In other words , it would certainly be in China ’ s interest to see the U.S. in a mess with its surrogates in Tehran and Pyongyang while America seeks to face down Chinese mercantilism — with the Middle East descending into another hot war .
So , Trump could achieve either high-profile success — or became mired in endless engagements and a pre-election , public-relations disaster .
Halving the Chinese trade deficit and forcing it to follow global rules would be an astounding achievement . So would denuclearizing North Korea and preventing Iran from getting the bomb . As would finally telling the Palestinians to give up terrorism and get on with building a state , or corralling Putin so that he abandons dreams of a new Soviet Empire and accepts that Eastern Europe , the Baltic States , and the breakaway republicans are never going to be Russian again . Prodding a change in government in Venezuela would create momentum elsewhere in authoritarian Latin America . Again , to do all that at once , rather than in sequence , would be singular achievements — and yet likely improbable .
George W. Bush tried to address just three existential challenges all at once following 9/11 , and it all but destroyed his presidency . Bush not only fashioned a successful multifaceted anti-terrorism strategy that foiled subsequent attempts to repeat the World Trade Center and Pentagon bombings , but he took the war to the enemy . Yet soon the U.S. was fighting wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan , while trying to stop North Korea ’ s sudden emergence as a nuclear power , and while battling Iranian terrorists inside Iraq and Tehran ’ s own nuclear agenda — as China stepped up its global profile and began translating its enormous profits into a growing military , and as OPEC and Middle East suppliers helped drive up the cost of oil .
What was problematic about Bush ’ s “ Axis of Evil ” of Iraq , Iran , and North Korea was not that the term was necessarily inaccurate about the threats all three posed , or the need to address all of them eventually . The rub was that a country with a sizable force fighting in Afghanistan might abruptly find itself fighting three new dirty conflicts all at once .
In short , Trump might learn from the past and avoid what his opponents hope for — a series of conflicts dovetailing with the 2020 election , as the financial and psychological strain tax the electorate , as they did from 2006 to 2008 .
Note in this regard how deeply Trump ’ s opposition is invested in seeing him fail or , specifically , how private citizen John Kerry , last spring and summer , and , most recently , Senator Dianne Feinstein have met with the oleaginous Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif , ostensibly as “ adults in the room ” who agree on waiting Trump out — which in fact was the explicit advice recently given to the Chinese by former State Department official Susan Thornton .
Trump ’ s “ principled realism , ” “ Jacksonianism , ” or “ the Trump doctrine ” ostensibly is tit-for-tat deterrence , not nation-building or optional interventions .

The speech , which Mr. Trump read from a teleprompter , was also long on contradictions and short on proposals for solving the threats he denounced .
Making headlines was Mr. Trump ’ s most explicit warning to date to North Korea about its continuing efforts to develop nuclear weapons that could reach the U.S . The president warned that America would “ totally destroy ” North Korea if forced to “ defend itself or its allies. ” Though that declaration elicited gasps from the diplomats and criticism from the media , it was a more explicit version of his earlier threat that Pyongyang would be met with “ fire and fury ” if it continued threatening America and its allies with its nuclear and missile tests . In vintage Trumpian form , he mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “ rocket man ” on a “ suicide mission. ” Demanding the “ denuclearization ” of the peninsula , Mr. Trump did not call for a resumption of negotiations to achieve that goal .
He also took aim at the “ rogue ” states and movements that threaten American security and world peace -- “ radical Islamic terrorism , ” a term he has only intermittently deployed . And he criticized what he called the “ rogue regimes ” of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , and Cuba , calling upon his “ fellow leaders to join the United States in the fight to defeat ” their threats to peace .
Singling out Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by name , he accused Venezuela ’ s leader of starving his own people and transforming his once oil-rich country into a land of desperation and corruption . He said he was prepared to take “ further action ” against the regime , but offered no hint of what that might include .
Mr. Trump bashed Iran and the nuclear deal as “ one of the worst and most one-sided ” transactions the nation has ever entered into -- an “ embarrassment. ” While he stopped short of rejecting the agreement , he clearly hinted that the U.S. might walk away from it , setting the stage for an eventual rejection in October .
In each of these cases , however , Mr. Trump offered no specific proposals for countering the threat he claims they pose . And several diplomats noted the inherent contradiction in Mr. Trump ’ s attack on North Korea for failing to negotiate an end to its nuclear program and his near abandonment of Iran ’ s agreement suspending its nuclear efforts , a deal monitored and endorsed by the UN . While calling for world help in isolating North Korea -- and praising Russia and China for cutting off some fuel to Pyongyang -- he seemed prepared to go it alone to counter Iran ’ s alleged nuclear ambitions .
The president ’ s speech elicited some applause from the assembled diplomats , but mostly uncomfortable silence . His shrill tone and bombast was reminiscent of his campaign rallies . But his base undoubtedly welcomed his assertion that the rogue states menacing America ’ s and world stability were “ going to hell , ” and that America was being “ taken advantage of ” in paying 22 percent of the UN ’ s expenses . He highlighted the hypocrisy of the appointment of some of the world ’ s worst human rights abusers to the UN ’ s human rights council . While praising Jordan , Turkey , and Lebanon for caring for “ horribly treated ” Syrian refugees , he suggested that America would take few more of them . For the cost of settling one refugee in the U.S. , he said , ten refugees could be resettled closer to home .

( Mike Theiler/Reuters )
Our long national hysteria may not be over , but at least it should — by rights — be diminished .
Robert Mueller delivered his long-awaited report on Friday , and Attorney General William Barr just released his summary of the findings . They completely vindicate President Trump regarding the allegation that his campaign colluded with the Russians during the 2016 election , and also conclude that he didn ’ t commit the crime of obstruction of justice .
The Russia finding couldn ’ t be starker . In his letter Barr quotes directly from the report : “ [ T ] he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. ” This , according to Barr , after more than 2,800 subpoenas , 500 search warrants , 230 orders for communication records , 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers , and interviews with roughly 500 witnesses . If there were any evidence of collusion , Mueller would have found it .
It always seemed unlikely , if not outright preposterous , that the Russians would have entrusted a sensitive intelligence operation to the most shambolic general-election campaign in modern memory . There was no reason to collude with the Trump campaign , in any case — the Russians obviously hacked Democrats ’ emails , on their own , and then released them via their WikiLeaks cutout , on their own . Nonetheless , even as Mueller indictments and plea deals piled up , with no suggestion of collusion in sight , Trump critics could never give up on the idea .
The media was obsessed , and always implied there was some devastating revelation just over the horizon . MSNBC and CNN took every minor scooplet from outlets such as the Washington Post and the Daily Beast and blew them up into major stories . The press , in its zeal to believe the worst , sometimes published too-good-to-check erroneous reports . Otherwise serious opinion writers accused Trump of being a traitor or perhaps a Russian asset since 1987 . John Brennan assured everyone that there was no doubt that there was collusion . Democrats such as Adam Schiff said the same .
It ’ d be a nice contribution to the public discourse if any of these people admitted they were wrong , but instead they will all move on , looking for the next blockbuster to destroy Trump looming somewhere over the next hill .
As for obstruction , that ’ s come a cropper , too , although the Barr letter is careful to note that Mueller doesn ’ t exonerate Trump on this score . Clearly , Trump hated the probe and , if he ’ d had his own way , would have ended it . He never did , though . Since Trump wasn ’ t guilty of collusion , it ’ s hard to see what his corrupt motive would have been justifying an obstruction charge — indeed , the chief cause of his rage seems to have been that he was indeed , as he insisted all along , innocent of collusion , yet subjected to years-long investigation . Also , it ’ s dubious that a president can obstruct justice while exercising his lawful powers . So Mueller left the legal question to Barr , who concluded there wasn ’ t evidence of a crime .
Democrats are now clamoring for the full Mueller report , hoping it reveals something more damaging than what is alluded to in the Barr letter .

(Mike Theiler/Reuters)

Our long national hysteria may not be over, but at least it should — by rights — be diminished.

Robert Mueller delivered his long-awaited report on Friday, and Attorney General William Barr just released his summary of the findings. They completely vindicate President Trump regarding the allegation that his campaign colluded with the Russians during the 2016 election, and also conclude that he didn’t commit the crime of obstruction of justice.

The Russia finding couldn’t be starker. In his letter Barr quotes directly from the report: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” This, according to Barr, after more than 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 230 orders for communication records, 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, and interviews with roughly 500 witnesses. If there were any evidence of collusion, Mueller would have found it.

It always seemed unlikely, if not outright preposterous, that the Russians would have entrusted a sensitive intelligence operation to the most shambolic general-election campaign in modern memory. There was no reason to collude with the Trump campaign, in any case — the Russians obviously hacked Democrats’ emails, on their own, and then released them via their WikiLeaks cutout, on their own. Nonetheless, even as Mueller indictments and plea deals piled up, with no suggestion of collusion in sight, Trump critics could never give up on the idea.

The media was obsessed, and always implied there was some devastating revelation just over the horizon. MSNBC and CNN took every minor scooplet from outlets such as the Washington Post and the Daily Beast and blew them up into major stories. The press, in its zeal to believe the worst, sometimes published too-good-to-check erroneous reports. Otherwise serious opinion writers accused Trump of being a traitor or perhaps a Russian asset since 1987. John Brennan assured everyone that there was no doubt that there was collusion. Democrats such as Adam Schiff said the same.

It’d be a nice contribution to the public discourse if any of these people admitted they were wrong, but instead they will all move on, looking for the next blockbuster to destroy Trump looming somewhere over the next hill.

As for obstruction, that’s come a cropper, too, although the Barr letter is careful to note that Mueller doesn’t exonerate Trump on this score. Clearly, Trump hated the probe and, if he’d had his own way, would have ended it. He never did, though. Since Trump wasn’t guilty of collusion, it’s hard to see what his corrupt motive would have been justifying an obstruction charge — indeed, the chief cause of his rage seems to have been that he was indeed, as he insisted all along, innocent of collusion, yet subjected to years-long investigation. Also, it’s dubious that a president can obstruct justice while exercising his lawful powers. So Mueller left the legal question to Barr, who concluded there wasn’t evidence of a crime.

Democrats are now clamoring for the full Mueller report, hoping it reveals something more damaging than what is alluded to in the Barr letter. Although we are sure there are embarrassing details, Barr notes that most of the episodes related to obstruction are already known. Still, we favor maximum disclosure, mindful of the restrictions on disclosing grand-jury material — as well as disclosure of as many materials as possible related to how this investigative train got running in the first place.

We said at the outset of the Mueller probe that we preferred an independent commission as the more appropriate venue for a public airing of the facts around Russian interference. Mueller ended up proceeding in the same rut as most special-counsel probes, prosecuting a lot of process crimes and a few more-serious offenses not directly related to the matter at hand. There was plenty to work with here, since Trump’s associates, from Paul Manafort to Roger Stone, were such a motley, sleazy crew. They are marks against his judgment; that never made Trump a traitor.

For the same reasons , it is necessary to conclude that Mueller ’ s investigation has to be brought to an end . The Mueller investigation has gone on so long and is absorbing so much of the president ’ s time and attention that it is creating a deleterious effect on national security .
One-time Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort has been indicted in two different federal courts on separate charges .

Manafort ’ s lawyers have insisted that the charges against him in one case — bank fraud and such — should be dropped because they are outside the authority granted Mueller by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein when he appointed Mueller special counsel to investigate the supposed collusion between candidate Donald Trump and the Russian government .
In a Friday hearing in a federal court in Alexandria , Virginia , in which Manafort ’ s lawyers were seeking dismissal of the charges against their client in that court , U.S. District Court Judge T.S .

Judge Ellis said that the Justice Department lawyers ’ earlier characterization of the case was false and amounted to , “ We said what this investigation was about but we are not bound by it and we were lying. ” Ellis added , “ You don ’ t really care about Mr. Manafort . You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment , or whatever . ”
On Saturday , another U.S. district court judge , Dabney Friedrich of the D.C. district court , refused Mueller ’ s motion to delay the arraignment hearing on Concord Management and Consulting , one of the three firms — and a bunch of Russian citizens — Mueller indicted in February .

We shouldn ’ t read too much into either judge ’ s action . Judge Ellis , as I can vouch for from personal experience , loves to bully lawyers . His comments Thursday may have been no more than that . Judge Friedrich may be losing patience with Mueller ’ s team , but that will have little bearing on the disposition of the cases against the Russians indicted by Mueller in February .
Neither of the judges is at all likely to rein in the Mueller investigation , far less bring it to an end . Nor is it more likely that Deputy AG Rosenstein or AG Jeff Sessions will call a halt to Mueller ’ s work . The president won ’ t fire Mueller , for to do so would be political suicide .
Mueller ’ s investigation will be a year old on May 17 .

In Mueller ’ s time , he has managed to indict and convict former national security adviser Gen. Mike Flynn of lying to federal agents despite the fact that , as the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence revealed a few days ago , former FBI director James Comey testified to the HPSCI that the FBI agents who interrogated Flynn saw no evidence that Flynn was lying .

Donald Trump will use his first address to the UN general assembly on Tuesday to call for international action to confront North Korea and Iran , which he will portray as twin threats to global security , the White House said .
The US president will warn member states that they risk being “ bystanders in history ” if they do not mobilise to confront such threats , according to a senior White House official .

The official also said Trump would use his address to sketch out his vision of how nation states could cooperate in the face of such challenges without compromising their sovereignty . In that way , the official argued , asking for other nations to take part in collective action was consistent with Trump ’ s “ America First ” approach .

Donald Trump will use his first address to the UN general assembly on Tuesday to call for international action to confront North Korea and Iran, which he will portray as twin threats to global security, the White House said.



The US president will warn member states that they risk being “bystanders in history” if they do not mobilise to confront such threats, according to a senior White House official.

The official also said Trump would use his address to sketch out his vision of how nation states could cooperate in the face of such challenges without compromising their sovereignty. In that way, the official argued, asking for other nations to take part in collective action was consistent with Trump’s “America First” approach.

The president’s speech will focus on “world regimes that threaten security”, the official said.

""Disagreements between our countries were discussed at length,"" Pence told employees at the Commerce Department on Monday, ""but what the world saw, what the American people saw, is that President Donald Trump will always put the prosperity and security of America first.""

Trump has meetings at the White House on Tuesday, but so far is not scheduled to speak publicly.

There is no White House news briefing scheduled.

One of Trump's meetings is with a group of congressional lawmakers, though the subject is tax cuts rather than Russia.

Still, several Republicans invited to the White House meeting had, only hours earlier, rebuked Trump over his appearance with Putin.

Rep. Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican who represents the western suburbs of Chicago, said Russian interference in 2016 was “undeniable” and that the president had a “responsibility” to confront Putin.

The “press conference,” Roskam said in a statement Monday, “was an affront to American democracy and the Intelligence Community and a victory for Russian propaganda.”

Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Mich., another White House invitee, said he stood by the assessment of congressional intelligence committees demonstrating Russia’s effort to undermine the election.

""Open diplomatic communication between nuclear superpowers is essential, but lest anyone think otherwise, Vladimir Putin’s Russia is not a friend to the United States,"" Bishop said in a statement. ""We must hold Russia accountable.”

Others were more cautious in their reaction. Republican Rep. Jim Renacci, who represents a central Ohio district, posted on Twitter that “it appears Russia was involved either directly or indirectly” in the election but that he didn’t “believe their involvement affected the outcome.""

Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, continued to condemn Trump over his relationship with Putin.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Trump ""engaged in a dangerous, disgraceful and damaging show of his Blame America First policy."" She called on congressional Republicans to step up efforts to block Russian interference in 2018 congressional races and Trump's likely re-election bid in 2020.

Some Democrats said Trump's comments amount to an impeachable offense, or even treason. John Brennan, the CIA director under President Barack Obama, called Trump's performance ""nothing short of treasonous,"" and said that ""he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.""

Responding in an interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Trump described Brennan as ""a very bad person.""",www.usatoday.com,center,27EzLaC3R3Ruil7C

Democrats accuse Trump of misusing taxpayer dollars destined for a vulnerable U.S. ally for personal political gain. The security aid was approved by Congress to help Ukraine curb Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

If the House votes to approve articles of impeachment - formal charges - the Republican-controlled Senate would then hold a trial on whether to remove the president from office.

Senate Republicans have so far shown little appetite for removing the president.

“If it were today, I don’t think there’s any question it would not lead to a removal,” Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday, adding that the duration of any trial would depend on how long senators want to take.

Congressional Democrats also released testimony from Kurt Volker, Trump’s former special representative for Ukraine negotiations. Volker detailed what he described as the role of Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as a conduit between Washington and Kiev.

Volker and Sondland, with Trump’s secretary of energy, Rick Perry, were known as the “three amigos,” responsible for Trump’s unofficial channel to Ukrainian government officials, witnesses testified.

Volker said his decision to resign on Sept. 27 was because of the impeachment inquiry.

“I didn’t think I would be able to go to Ukraine or meet with Russians and be able to carry out those duties in that way anymore,” he said. He also said he wanted to provide testimony “with as much candor and integrity as I possibly could.”
