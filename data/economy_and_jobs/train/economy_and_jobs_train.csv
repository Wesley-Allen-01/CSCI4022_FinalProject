The media won’t report it, but this is a economic Armageddon. The middle class is being destroyed. I call it “The Obama Great Depression.”

In a nutshell, this is what explains the popularity of Donald Trump. Republicans and Democrats live in different worlds. Some might say we live on different planets.

I live in the real world. I am a private sector businessman. I have “boots on the ground.” I understand that President Obama has wrecked the U.S. economy. It’s bad and it’s getting much worse. If Hillary or Bernie, or some other clueless liberal who wants to “protect and expand Obama’s legacy” is elected, America’s economy will smash to the ground like Humpty Dumpty- into a million pieces that we can never put back together again.

It’s all going bad under Barack Obama. Today’s GDP report validates everything I’ve been saying and predicting for years. The chickens are coming home to roost.

Then I saw the exit polls on Fox News on Tuesday night after five overwhelming, massive, YUUUUGE Republican primary landslides for Donald Trump. What was the number one issue for a large majority of Republican voters? The economy and jobs.

There was no close second. Even Trump’s signature issue of immigration was at the bottom of their list. The voters are scared to death about this economy, jobs and the future of middle class America.

But not Democrat voters. It’s just Republican voters that are scared about this horrible economy.

Why? I finally figured out the disconnect.

Because like me, most Republican voters are in the private sector. We own our own small businesses. Or we work for private sector businesses. Or we’re independent contractors- real estate brokers, stockbrokers, car salesman, boat salesmen, insurance brokers, mortgage brokers, etc. In other words, we are “boots on the ground.” We are the first to know something is wrong with the economy. We are the ones who know when the politicians and media are lying through their teeth.

We know Obama, Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media are lying about “economic recovery.” There is no recovery. There never was one. We have been living in an 8-year-long Obama Great Depression. Yes, those living in New York (Wall Street), San Francisco (Silicon Valley) and Washington D.C. (government jobs and contracts) are fat and happy. But everywhere else in-between, the people are in severe trouble. We are scared. We are hurting. We know this is getting worse. We know where this could end- with a complete economic collapse and the end of America and capitalism.

Republican voters support for Donald Trump because:

They don’t trust any politician to save us, or to change the situation. That includes even a pure conservative politician like Ted Cruz. Conservative, or not, Cruz has spent his entire life as a lawyer and government employee. For all intents and purposes, Ted Cruz- like 99 percent of politicians- might as well be Obama. They understand only a capitalist billionaire businessman can possibly turn this nightmare around. They know Trump has failed at a few businesses- and they don’t care. At least he failed with his own money, not the taxpayers! What a refreshing change. And interestingly, maybe those failures make Trump the perfect guy to turnaround the U.S. economy. Sure Trump has failed- but he came back bigger and better than ever, each and every time. Failure doesn’t matter in business, it’s the art of the comeback that matters! Maybe, just maybe, Trump can show America and the U.S. economy and the middle class how to recover, just like he did after almost losing it all.

Republican voters get all this. But Democrat voters haven‘t a freaking clue there’s a problem. Have you noticed?

Every Democrat I speak to swears the economy is fine. You know why there is such a disconnect? Because Democrats almost never work in the private sector. They sign the back of paychecks, not the front. Huge difference.

Republicans and Democrats live in different worlds.

Republicans work for a living, sell for a living, own for a living. We do it all with our own money, talent and wits. I’ve never taken a government check in my life.

But the vast majority of Obama, Hillary and Bernie supporters belong to one of four categories:

#1) They work for someone else. They collect a safe weekly paycheck, without ever having to worry where the money comes from.

#2) They work for government, or collect a pension from government for NOT working.

#3) They collect welfare, food stamps and free Obamacare from government.

#4) They are in school, or college, or broke and jobless living in mommy and daddy’s basement. They’ve never earned a serious check in the real world, let alone signed the front of the check. They understand nothing about money or the economy.

So yes, Republicans and Democrats do live in different worlds. That accounts for most Republicans supporting Donald Trump with fervor and passion and enthusiasm. Meanwhile virtually all Democrats despise him and are repulsed by him. They can’t understand why anyone would like Trump.

What it comes down to is…we are indeed living in two different Americas. We are actually living on two different planets. It’s clear to me:

Republicans are from Mars…and Democrats are from Ur-Anus.

USA Today

For most people, a salaried job paying $25,000 a year is far from exceptional. It corresponds to an hourly wage of roughly $14, which isn’t enough to live on in many pricey metro areas.

But, according to existing federal labor rules, a $25,000 job can be classified as managerial or given another designation that exempts it from overtime pay. That's why the Obama administration moved this week to change those rules. As of Dec. 1, the minimum annual salary that can be excluded from overtime will be raised from $23,660 to $47,476, unless opponents manage to block the change in Congress or the courts.

The move is long overdue. The percentage of people eligible for overtime has been in a free fall since its high in 1975. Then, 62% of salaried workers were paid overtime for work over 40 hours. Today the number is 7%. And it was even lower before 2004, when the Bush administration made some needed changes.

Setting a new minimum salary is, to be sure, an inexact science. An annual salary of $23,660 might once have been called middle income, even managerial. Today, that does not pass the laugh test as a threshold for a management or professional job.

The new level of $47,476 is slightly less than it would have been had it been adjusted for inflation each year since 1975. It would increase the percentage of workers who qualify for overtime to 35%. That seems like a reasonable place to start.

A harsh blow to small businesses: Opposing view

It also seems reasonable that the new level should be indexed for inflation as well. But this and future administrations need to recognize that any action can produce unintended consequences, and should be willing to adjust the number if circumstances warrant.

These new rules are the latest effort by the Obama administration to push up worker pay in the face of a decidedly hostile Congress. With Republicans refusing to budge on the federal minimum wage, Obama settled on overtime rules in part because he could alter them without legislation.

In truth, the overtime rules are probably a better way to assist workers than by tweaking the minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour. The minimum wage affects a small segment of the working population (about 1.5 million people, compared with 4.2 million people who'd qualify for overtime under the new rules). And if the minimum is raised too far too fast, employers could respond by eliminating jobs.

The response to changing overtime rules is likely to be less severe. If employers don’t want to pay overtime, they are more likely to cut people back to 40 hours a week, or to bump their salaries up to the new annual minimum of $47,476, than they are to eliminate jobs.

Critics of the new rules argue that they will turn millions of professionals into clock-punchers while adding rigidity to what have been flexible and collegial work environments. There might be some truth to this. But clearly the current system has not served the interest of workers well.

Most people in the lower- to middle-income brackets would rather have fair pay for their long hours than a fancier job title.

America 's unemployment rate sank to 7.4 percent in July , a drop of two-tenths of a percent , the Bureau of Labor Statistics says in its monthly summary of the U.S. economic situation . But employers added 162,000 jobs last month , coming in below economists ' expectations .
`` Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 162,000 in July , with gains in retail trade , food services and drinking places , financial activities , and wholesale trade , '' the report states . `` Over the prior 12 months , nonfarm employment growth averaged 189,000 per month . ''
Barclays Capital economist Peter Newland called it `` a clearly weaker-than-expected report , '' The Associated Press reports .

America's unemployment rate sank to 7.4 percent in July, a drop of two-tenths of a percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says in its monthly summary of the U.S. economic situation. But employers added 162,000 jobs last month, coming in below economists' expectations.

""Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 162,000 in July, with gains in retail trade, food services and drinking places, financial activities, and wholesale trade,"" the report states. ""Over the prior 12 months, nonfarm employment growth averaged 189,000 per month.""

Barclays Capital economist Peter Newland called it ""a clearly weaker-than-expected report,"" The Associated Press reports.

The Republicans just got a big gift from the Congressional Budget Office: It’s going to be a lot easier for them to call Obamacare a “job killer.”

That’s because the budget office’s new economic report, released Tuesday, says the health care law will cause Americans to work fewer hours — enough to be the equivalent of 2 million fewer jobs in 2017.

Story Continued Below

The latest number is nearly three times as high as the budget office’s previous prediction, and it’s supposed to rise in later years to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs in 2024.

There’s a lot more fine print about what those numbers really mean, and whether the jobs were “lost.” In fact, CBO said it’s in large part about the number of hours people choose to work, not actual job losses.

But what matters politically is how the numbers look in attack ads. And in this election year, “2 million lost jobs” is a Republican ad-maker’s dream.

The projection will put the White House, and especially red-state Democrats, in an even more awkward position heading into November. Until now, they’ve mostly had to worry about stories of canceled health plans and, of course, the botched website rollout. Now they’ll need to figure out how to counter, or at least explain, the new CBO job figures.

The White House is already taking a crack at it. The report doesn’t actually say businesses will be forced to reduce employment, said the administration, which noted that the report also states there is “no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased” because of the Affordable Care Act.

Instead, the administration said Tuesday, the health care law will allow people to choose to work less because they’ll be able to get health insurance.

Under Obamacare, “individuals will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods, like retiring on time rather than working into their elderly years or choosing to spend more time with their families,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement.

Still, Republicans wasted no time blasting out multiple emails and statements about job loss, “pink slips” and the new CBO estimates. House Speaker John Boehner’s office gave reporters a quick heads-up, and other Republicans piled on fast.

“For years, Republicans have said that the president’s health care law creates uncertainty for small businesses, hurts take-home pay, and makes it harder to invest in new workers,” Boehner, of Ohio, said in a statement. “The middle class is getting squeezed in this economy, and this CBO report confirms that Obamacare is making it worse.”

All this year, the unemployment rate had been vacillating in a narrow range between 8.3 percent and 8.1 percent, where it stood in August. But the rate fell to 7.8 percent in September, after a household survey showed more people say they are working.

The Labor Department also revised some summer data.

Last month, employers added 114,000 jobs, almost exactly what economists had predicted.

A Negative Take On The Jobs Data

The pace of improvement is far too slow to absorb the backlog of people seeking work. About 100,000 new jobs are needed each month simply to keep pace with population growth.

The jobless rate would be much higher today — more like the 11 percent Romney notes — if labor force participation were as high as when Obama took office. Many people have dropped out of the workplace, either to take early retirement, go back to school or to stay home, because they don't see much hope of finding a good job.

Alternatively, A Positive Take

In January 2009, when Obama took the oath of office, the U.S. economy lost more than 800,000 jobs.

By spurring Congress to immediately pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the president turned around that employment plunge and ""kept our economy from swerving over the cliff,"" according to Rebecca Thiess, a policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the stimulus created up to 3.3 million full-time jobs and helped stabilize the labor market in the 2009-2011 period. Since the recovery kicked in, the private sector has added jobs for 31 straight months, bringing the total to 5.2 million new jobs.

So What's The Outlook?

The past three-and-a-half years could be considered a split decision, with good points and bad. But what lies ahead?

Romney says his economic policies would create about 12 million jobs over the next four years. But many independent economists say that's the same number of jobs that would be created under current policies.

Joseph Davis, chief economist for the mutual fund giant Vanguard, said he doesn't see the unemployment rate improving significantly until Congress takes definitive action to reduce the deficit and the debt. Having lawmakers constantly put off major decisions about taxes and spending is creating tremendous uncertainties for employers who feel they can't make hiring plans until they know what their taxes will be and whether government spending — on infrastructure, defense contracts and more — will continue.

""If we don't see a meaningful change in terms of clearing up policy uncertainty, then it's very difficult to see the economic trajectory change,"" Davis said. ""If we could adopt a credible and binding plan to reduce the deficit, that would go a long way in reducing uncertainty"" and opening the door to new employees, he added.

What Are People Saying Today?

Friday's big move in the jobless rate did not go unnoticed by Romney supporters, many of whom suggested the Labor Department manipulated the data. For example, Jack Welch, the retired CEO of General Electric, tweeted that the drop in the jobless rate was ""unbelievable,"" and added this reference to Obama: ""can't debate, so change numbers.""

WASHINGTON — President Obama's call to raise the federal minimum wage could help lift 900,000 workers out of poverty, but at a cost of as many as 500,000 jobs, according to an analysis released today by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.

The White House and congressional Democrats--who are seeking to make a federal minimum wage hike a top issue in the 2014 elections--took issue with the politically sensitive report and said CBO's findings are inconsistent with the prevailing view among economists that raising the minimum wage does not impact employment.

""Zero is a perfectly reasonable estimate of the impact of the minimum wage on employment ,"" countered Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman in a conference call with reporters in response to the CBO report.

Obama initially called on Congress to raise the $7.25 hourly minimum wage to $9, but he has since rallied with leading Senate Democrats who are pushing for a $10.10 increase. The Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to vote on a wage increase in March, but it is unlikely to get a vote in the GOP-controlled House.

Raising the minimum wage gets broad public support in polls, but it faces near unanimous opposition from congressional Republicans. Democrats are expected to use the issue on the campaign trail in the midterm elections.

A Gallup poll released Monday showed that nearly one in four Americans say that jobs and unemployment are their top concern, underscoring Democrats' sensitivity to the CBO's conclusion that a wage increase could result in job losses.

CBO examined the budget impacts of raising the minimum wage to $9 and $10.10. The report concluded that a $9 increase would lift 300,000 workers above the poverty line, but cost 100,000 new jobs as employers are expected to reduce workforces to make up for higher wages. A $10.10 increase would lift 900,000 workers above the poverty line, but cost 500,000 jobs.

""I think that that understanding has moved employment effects to zero,"" she said, ""I think CBO didn't fully appreciate that in their review.""

Republicans were quick to highlight the report's warning of job losses.

""This report confirms what we've long known: while helping some, mandating higher wages has real costs, including fewer people working. With unemployment Americans' top concern, our focus should be creating — not destroying — jobs for those who need them most,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., joined the White House in questioning the veracity of the CBO report, citing competing economic consensus that a wage increase would be an economic stimulus and boost jobs. ""What's more, in past years, the CBO itself has acknowledged the uncertainty of its own predictions and ignored new perspectives in the wide array of analysis on the minimum wage,"" she said.

The CBO report acknowledges that long-term conclusions on the effect of the minimum wage are difficult to predict. In 2007 – the last time Congress voted to raise the federal minimum wage to the current $7.25 rate – CBO reported that ""the potential employment and unemployment impacts of raising the federal minimum wage rate to $7.25 per hour are difficult to predict, but are likely to be small.""

""More than 600 economists, including seven Nobel Prize laureates, recently affirmed the growing consensus that low-wage workers benefit from modest increases in the minimum wage without negative consequences for the low-wage job market,"" Harkin said, adding that his legislation would increase wages for 28 million workers, and create 85,000 new jobs.

USA TODAY

Hiring rebounded strongly in March as employers added 196,000 jobs, easing fears that payroll growth is slowing sharply amid a cooling economy.

The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.8%, the Labor Department said Friday.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated 175,000 jobs were added last month.

Job gains for January and February were revised up by a modest 14,000.

After severe, weather-related swings in employment early this year, economists largely anticipated a return to normalcy in March. If anything, Goldman Sachs reckoned below-average snowfall would bolster job gains by about 20,000.

Payroll growth was feeble in February, with just 33,000 additions, but that was largely blamed on weather as construction and leisure and hospitality had especially poor performances. Unusually mild temperatures pulled forward hiring to January, inflating that month’s employment gains. An offsetting drop the following month was compounded by snowstorms.

Yet, the February showing was so paltry it raised concerns that hiring was tapering off more than anticipated as the benefits of federal tax cuts and spending increases fade and the low unemployment rate makes it harder for employers to find workers. The global economy, particularly Europe and China, also has been sputtering, hurting manufacturers.

Economists eagerly awaited the March jobs report to help determine whether the February totals reflected a blip or the start of a steeper downshift in hiring and the economy.

Employers added a robust average of 223,000 jobs a month in 2018, but analysts expect employment growth to throttle back this year amid the slowing economy and worker shortages. Many predict average monthly gains of about 165,000. In the first quarter, the average was 180,000.

""The gradual slowdown in trend employment growth is another sign that the economy is weakening,"" economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.

Wage growth edges back

Average hourly earnings rose 4 cents to $27.70, lowering the annual gain from a 10-year high of 3.4% to 3.2%.

Wage growth has picked up as employers compete for a dwindling supply of available workers. The faster pay increases haven’t yet prompted most companies to pass their rising labor costs onto consumers through higher prices, keeping inflation subdued.

But further earnings gains eventually could lead to stronger inflation, posing a dilemma for a Federal Reserve that has vowed to remain patient and forecast no interest rate hikes this year. March’s annual pullback helps keep the Fed in its market friendly wait-and-see mode.

Industries that are hiring

Health care and social assistance led the job gains with 61,000. Professional and business services added 37,000; leisure and hospitality, 33,000; and construction, 16,000.

Manufacturing cut 6,000 jobs, a second straight anemic showing after strong gains last year, indicating the struggling global economy and U.S. trade fight with China are taking a bigger toll.

Retail, which is shrinking as shoppers shift their purchases online, cut 12,000 jobs after shedding 20,000 in February.

Labor force participation dips

The share of American adults working or looking for jobs fell to 63% from 63.2%. From September to February, the figure had climbed fairly steadily from 62.7% as a healthy labor market offering more jobs and higher wages attracted discouraged workers, seniors, disabled people and others on the sidelines.

March’s drop could indicate that labor force participation is resuming its longer-term decline as baby boomers retire. A lower participation rate means a smaller labor supply for employers that could push up wages and inflation further, possibly prompting the Fed to eventually raise rates. But the number for a single month could just be a one-off.

What it means

This was about as ideal a jobs report as markets could expect. Job growth bounced back forcefully from its poor February performance, alleviating worries of an imminent downturn in the economy.

Yet yearly wage growth, while still healthy, retreated some from the 10-year high reached two months ago. That should keep the Fed on hold for now. The Dow Jones industrial average was up about 20 points, or less than 0.1%, in mid-day trading.

At the same time, the report offers no reason for the Fed to consider cutting rates, as President Trump has urged.

The basic question at issue , economically , is whether the challenge of long-term unemployment is still big enough to warrant “ emergency ” response . That raises the question : Just how many would-be workers are unemployed for lengthy periods these days ?
The answer is a lot , even using the Labor Department ’ s official tally of the unemployed . And the number goes higher , because not all the long-term jobless are included in that mainstream count .
Some 1.3 million Americans who have been out of work at least 26 weeks saw emergency benefits run dry on Dec. 28 , when year-end budget talks left the program an unresolved issue and it expired . By some estimates , another 3.6 million people are likely to enter the ranks of the long-term unemployed ( and to be eligible for the benefits if they reappear ) at some point during 2014 .
The total number of long-term unemployed goes beyond those eligible under an emergency benefits program , economists say . Consider that the program 's 1.3 million beneficiaries , late in 2013 , were just a fraction of the 4.1 million people whom the Labor Department counted as unemployed for more than 26 weeks . That larger group includes people who have already exhausted the extended benefits . Beyond the official long-term unemployed , more than 760,000 others are counted by the Labor Department as `` discouraged , '' meaning they have stopped looking for work .
That ’ s the backdrop for the current situation , in which many labor-market experts on both the left and right are supporting the restoration of emergency benefits .
“ Simply put ... it ’ s much harder for the long-term unemployed to find a job right now than it has been in the past when emergency federal benefits were allowed to expire , ” writes Michael Strain of the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
The rationale behind unemployment insurance ( UI ) is to cushion workers and their families during the time it takes them to find a new job . In the current climate , another rationale for extending benefits is simply as an incentive for the jobless to not give up hope .
“ It keeps them in the labor force looking for work , ” says Chad Stone , chief economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington . People must keep up the job search to collect the support payments .
By contrast , dropping out of the job market tends to damage people ’ s earning prospects when they eventually try to jump back in , economists say . When that happens to a lot of Americans at once , it means lower productive potential for the whole economy .

The Emergency Unemployment Compensation , or EUC , program , which was launched in 2008 , makes jobless benefits run as long as 73 weeks per person in states with very high unemployment rates .
Some good news : America ’ s unemployment rate is now down to 7 percent of the workforce , as of November , well below its 10 percent recession-era peak .
But the progress still leaves long-term unemployment much higher than usual .
The long-term unemployed alone account for 2.6 percent of the US labor force . That ’ s down from a post-recession peak above 4 percent , but it ’ s still far higher than the number usually is even in the depths of a recession .
The benefits typically pay an amount equal to about half a worker ’ s prior salary .
Progress in the overall job market , meanwhile , can mean the emergency benefits for individual workers shrink . That ’ s because the law works on a formula where the duration of benefits hinges on a state ’ s unemployment rate .
In most states , unemployment has fallen enough that , if the emergency benefit is renewed , it will mean individuals have aid for 40 to 63 weeks , not the 73-week maximum .
Even before the EUC program expired in December , only 41 percent of unemployed workers were eligible for and receiving either state or federal jobless aid , down from 65 percent 2010 , according to the National Employment Law Project , which is pushing for Congress to extend the benefits .

The revival of middle-class jobs has been one of Obama 's mantras since he took office in 2009 fighting the worst economic crisis in generations . It was a major theme of his last State of the Union address and is expected to feature in the one scheduled for Tuesday .
Obama 's administration can take credit for stabilizing the U.S. economy , which is growing again and last year added jobs at the fastest clip since 1999 .
But for the middle class the scars of the recession still run deep . Federal Reserve survey data show families in the middle fifth of the income scale now earn less and their net worth is lower than when Obama took office .
In the six years through 2013 , over the recession and recovery that have spanned Obama 's tenure , jobs have been added at the top and bottom of the wage scale , a Reuters analysis of labor statistics shows . In the middle , the economy has shed positions - whether in traditional trades like machining or electrical work , white-collar jobs in human resources , or technical ones like computer operators .
The trend is in plain sight in Dalton , Georgia , a manufacturing hub 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) north of Atlanta .

''","Barack Obama enters the final two years of his presidency with a blemish on his legacy that looks impossible to erase: the decline of the middle class he has promised to rescue.

The revival of middle-class jobs has been one of Obama's mantras since he took office in 2009 fighting the worst economic crisis in generations. It was a major theme of his last State of the Union address and is expected to feature in the one scheduled for Tuesday.

Obama's administration can take credit for stabilizing the U.S. economy, which is growing again and last year added jobs at the fastest clip since 1999.

But for the middle class the scars of the recession still run deep. Federal Reserve survey data show families in the middle fifth of the income scale now earn less and their net worth is lower than when Obama took office.

In the six years through 2013, over the recession and recovery that have spanned Obama's tenure, jobs have been added at the top and bottom of the wage scale, a Reuters analysis of labor statistics shows. In the middle, the economy has shed positions - whether in traditional trades like machining or electrical work, white-collar jobs in human resources, or technical ones like computer operators.

The trend is in plain sight in Dalton, Georgia, a manufacturing hub 90 miles (145 kilometers)north of Atlanta. Massive factories that made it ""the carpet capital of the world,"" were slammed by the collapse of the housing bubble. During the recession, with machines idle, they began investing heavily in new technology and are now laying plans to restore some lost jobs.

But the new positions are more skewed to the high and low end, and there will be fewer of them per dollar of output than before the recession, said Brian Anderson, president of the Greater Dalton Chamber of Commerce.

""We can produce a whole lot of new carpet with not a lot more people,"" Anderson said. Companies have spent between $1.5 and $2 billion on retooling and innovation, reducing demand for labor, while higher than average regional unemployment continued to hold down wages, he said.

MORE INVESTMENT, FEWER JOBS

Firms like flooring giant Shaw Industries pared jobs - dropping 5,000 from a pre-recession labor force of 28,000 - but with new technology have rebuilt revenue to near previous levels. The company is boosting wages for master mechanics to around $30 an hour, but feels no pressure to increase wages for the unskilled positions it retains.

The heavy investment in robotics and mechanization has raised expectations, said Paul Richard, Shaw's vice president of human resources. ""It has put more emphasis on associates that can bring technical skills.""

Obama has proposed expanded access to community college education and improved family leave policies, while some of his allies have called for an outright wealth transfer from the top to the middle.

For Obama's legacy none of that may matter.

The forces at work in the American economy appear so entrenched that Obama may be remembered as the president who pulled the nation from its worst downturn since the Great Depression, but failed to arrest deepening economic inequality.

The Federal Reserve, under Obama appointee Janet Yellen, has put money in almost all Americans' pockets with near zero interest rates that have held down mortgage payments, allowed companies to reinvest, and boosted job creation.

WASHINGTON — Americans overwhelmingly disagree with President Trump on just about everything from his military threats to North Korea to his combative stance toward NFL players who won't stand for the National Anthem.

But a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll also finds an unusual disconnect: Americans are increasingly optimistic about the nation's economy.

""He's just really intent on keeping the nation divided,"" says William Reed, 52, of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton last year and was among those polled. ""No empathy; no compassion; just all about him and tweeting.""

For the first time during Trump's presidency, a majority of Americans, 53%, say in the USA TODAY poll that the economy is in a recovery. That typically would lift views that the nation is headed in the right direction. But this time, nearly two-thirds, or 64%, also say the country is on the wrong track, up 21 percentage points since the beginning of the year and the highest of his tenure.

As Trump approaches the one-year anniversary of his election next month, his underwater approval ratings and the public's anxiety hold perils for his presidency. They embolden his critics and make it harder for him to push legislative proposals such as a tax bill through Congress.

Diplomacy or military action?

When it comes to North Korea, Americans are more likely to agree with the embattled secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, than with his boss.

By 3-1, 61%-20%, Americans say the United States should pursue diplomacy to try to curtail North Korea's nuclear program, not undertake military action. By an even wider margin, 69%-15%, they say the U.S. should launch military strikes only in response to a North Korea attack, not as a pre-emptive step.

""There's a place for military, absolutely, but when dealing with nuclear weapons, you have to try diplomacy first,"" says Annie Davis, 41, of Greenville, S.C., the manager of a veterinary clinic who was among those polled. ""There are civilians on both sides.""

Those surveyed disapprove of the president's handling of North Korea by 56%-34%.

That said, both Trump supporters and critics agree that the president inherited a complicated and dangerous standoff with Pyongyang, with no easy path ahead. ""This guy, Kim, is a very unstable man and has no respect for the nuclear issue, which goes all the way back to when Bill Clinton was in office,"" says Doug Johnson, 54, of Hannibal, Mo.

Obamacare redux

Americans hold just about everybody in politics in low esteem, not to mention the news media.

Congress gets a whopping unfavorable rating of 64%-17%. The Democratic Party is viewed unfavorably by double digits, 48%-37%. The GOP fares worse, 62%-23%. Vice President Pence's unfavorable rating is better than Trump's (57%-34%), but it's still in negative territory, at 44%-36%.

The news media is viewed unfavorably by 54%-31%, worse than the already dismal 50%-37% unfavorable rating in the first poll of the year.

What's getting more popular? The Affordable Care Act.

Six in 10 Americans, 59%, now say Congress should either leave Obamacare alone, or fix the problems with the program but leave its framework intact. That's up 6 points since June, and in the wake of the failure last month of Senate Republicans to win approval of alternative programs — this after seven years of campaign promises to ""repeal and replace"" it.

Now 11% say Congress should repeal the Affordable Care Act even if a replacement isn't ready; another 26% say a repeal should be passed but only when a replacement is ready to go.

Trust in Trump to protect the interests of Americans and their families on health care has fallen, to 15%. Only 10% say they trust congressional Republicans most; 43% trust congressional Democrats.

Those surveyed express dismay and bewilderment that legislators haven't been able to work together.

""If they don't fix it,"" says Willie Woods, 55, the owner of a trucking firm in Houston. ""then we'll be in the same boat this year and the next year.""

Good feeling gone

Gone is the good feeling after the president's address to a joint session of Congress early in the year. Just after that, by 46%-43%, Americans were inclined to believe things were headed in the right direction. Now, by a yawning 40 percentage points, 64%-24%, they say things are on the wrong track.

That include a third of Republicans.

""He's not doing his job the way he's supposed to do,"" worries Robert Pounds, 58, of Aiken, S.C., who voted for Trump last year. ""I'd like to see him get health care figured out. I'd like him to stand up and get more jobs in America, like he said he would. I know he's a rich fellow, but he needs to start helping America.""

By 57%-33%, those surveyed say Trump mostly hasn't delivered on his campaign promises. By 47%-26%, they say he has done a worse job as president than they expected.

Trump gets low marks even for his Twitter-fueled blasts at NFL players who have been dropping to one knee during the National Anthem before games. Two-thirds of those surveyed say the president's call for NFL owners to fire the protesting players and for fans to boycott their games is inappropriate.

The president's approval rating is 38%, the lowest of the year in the USA TODAY poll. His disapproval rating is 56%, the highest of the year. By 35%-13%, those who ""strongly disapprove"" of him outnumber those who ""strongly approve.""

That means for nearly half of the country, feelings are inflamed for or against the president.

The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range between 1.75 percent and 2 percent after its July reduction was its first in a decade. The central bank cited weakening exports and low inflation as reasons for the cut.

""Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,"" the central bank's monetary policy committee said in a statement. ""Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports have weakened. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.""

Wednesday's decision came a day after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York took the unusual step of injecting $53 billion into markets to quell a spike in interest rates.

The burst of hiring lowered the unemployment rate to 5.8 percent from 5.9 percent. It's the lowest rate since July 2008.

Along with the job gains, economic growth has accelerated this year. Yet despite the improvement, voters identified economic anxiety as their top concern in Tuesday's elections. That suggests the improvement hasn't yet been felt by many Americans.

( Full 2014 election results)

Nearly 60 percent of voters said they thought the economy was stagnating or worsening. Only one-third saw it as improving.

The picture has still improved enough that the Federal Reserve announced last month that it was ending its bond purchase program, which had been intended to lower interest rates and stimulate economic growth.

At the same time, better hiring and growth have barely boosted paychecks for the vast majority of earners. Adjusted for inflation, average hourly pay rose just 0.3 percent over the 12 months that ended in September, according to government data.

Analysts say the economic expansion remains strong enough to support the current pace of hiring. Over the past six months, the economy has grown at a 4.1 percent annual rate.

U.S. manufacturers are expanding at the fastest pace in three years, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group. A measure of new orders showed that factory output will likely continue to grow in coming months. A separate survey by the ISM found that retailers, restaurants and other service companies grew at a healthy pace last month.

Home sales rose in September at their fastest rate this year, a sign that housing could pick up after a sluggish performance for most of this year.

Still, faltering global growth could create trouble for the U.S. economy in the months ahead. Exports fell in September, the government said this week, widening the trade deficit. That led many economists to shave their predictions of economic growth in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of 3 percent or less, down from the government's initial estimate of 3.5 percent.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders offered a rare correction and apology after providing false information during a press briefing Tuesday about how many jobs Barack Obama created for blacks during his presidency.

Sanders incorrectly told reporters President Donald Trump had created three times as many jobs for African-Americans as former President Barack Obama had during his entire eight years in the White House.

""Correction from today’s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn’t,"" Sanders posted on Twitter. ""I’m sorry for the mistake, but no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African Americans created under President Trump.""

Media outlets were quick to fact-check with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. When Obama was president, he created nearly 3 million jobs for blacks, about 15 times what Sanders claimed.

Sanders had been attempting to show Trump's record with the African-American population was not only great, but even better than Obama's, explaining Trump tripled Obama's job creation record for the black community.

""This President since he took office, in the year and a half that he's been here, has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans,"" Sanders said Tuesday.

She continued: ""That's 700,000 African-Americans that are working now that weren't working when this President took place. When President Obama left, after eight years in office, he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans.""

Six years ago, homebuilders and Realtors were facing brutal business conditions: millions of Americans were losing their jobs and homes.

As 2015 begins, hiring is strong and economic indicators are pointing up. Could this be the year when the housing market finally breaks out of its tepid recovery and takes off?

Economists see several reasons why 2015 might be a banner year for homebuying — and not just in San Francisco and Miami.

They also see One Big Factor that potentially could block a buying binge.

Before considering that possible downer, let's first look at the upside:

Employers are hiring again.

When companies are hiring, would-be homebuyers feel more confident about taking on mortgage debt.

During the recession, companies kept slashing positions, sending the unemployment rate soaring to 10 percent and frightening potential homebuyers. But job growth has been strong lately, with employers adding 321,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate has tumbled to 5.8 percent.

As that good news sinks in, optimism is rising. The Conference Board's latest Consumer Confidence Index shows confidence is running 19.5 percent higher than a year ago.

Home prices just took a breather, which helps.

From January to October, home prices rose 4.5 percent nationally, according to the latest S&P/Case Shiller Home Price Index. That gain was subdued compared with October 2013, when home prices jumped 11 percent higher than the previous year.

But slower price appreciation in 2014 may have set the stage for a buying surge in 2015. That's because buyers need the right combination of steady income, decent savings, low interest rates and reasonable home prices to jump into the market.

The Labor Department's latest jobs report showed an uptick in wages, and the surging stock market has been boosting savings. Mortgages have been holding below 4 percent for 30-year fixed rates.

And now the decelerating growth in home prices may be creating an affordability opportunity that will attract buyers in early 2015.

Rents are high.

When millions of Americans were losing their homes in the recession, many started moving into apartments. That shift caused rents to soar.

""With rents now rising at a seven-year high, historically low [interest] rates and moderating [home] price growth are likely to entice more buyers to enter the market in upcoming months,"" Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, said in a release.

Millennials are sick of Mom's basement.

The Census Bureau says just 36 percent of Americans under age 35 own a home. In 2007, that figure was 42 percent.

Some young people enjoy renting, but a recent survey by Fannie Mae showed 9 in 10 would prefer to own. They have been held back by tight lending standards that have made it tough to get around their heavy student debts and light savings.

But in December, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced programs that would allow first-time buyers to get homes with down payments of just 3 percent, instead of 5 percent.

That lower amount would allow creditworthy but cash-strapped young buyers to qualify for mortgages. ""If access to credit improves, we could see substantially larger numbers of young buyers in the market,"" Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com, said in his 2015 outlook.

But there's one reason for pessimism.

For years, many economists have been saying mortgage interest rates would rise. In 2015, they finally may be right.

That's because the Federal Reserve, which has held down both short- and long-term interest rates since 2008, has been signaling a coming change. The Fed is expected to allow rates to drift up, probably starting this summer.

Strong economies and tight labor markets put strains on fast-food companies. How can they remain profitable when wages are rising? The social media frenzy over the new chicken sandwich at Popeyes shows the success of one classic play: introduce an iconic new menu item, and charge more for it.

At $3.99, the item is asking a bit more from customers than Chick-fil-A’s competing sandwich does – but apparently it’s not asking too much. It has been so popular that restaurants are selling out of food. The New Yorker magazine declared on Tuesday: “The Popeyes Chicken Sandwich Is Here to Save America.” If there's a new chicken sandwich king, we can thank the strong consumer economy.

The fast-food industry is very responsive to consumer tastes and budgets because it's so huge and price-competitive. When times are bad, fast-food companies don't have to worry about rising food or labor costs, but at the same time their customers are on a tighter budget, so value menus and promotions might be the order of the day. But when times are good it's a different matter.

Consumers are still choosing fast food because they're looking for a deal, but as companies struggle with rising food and labor costs, their margins are getting squeezed. Raising prices on existing menu items can help maintain profit margins, but go too far and consumers might revolt. A different kind of ""inflation"" is introducing new product offerings (at higher prices) to woo existing or new customers.

Perhaps it's no surprise that the two iconic burgers in the fast-food industry -- Burger King's Whopper and the McDonald's Big Mac -- were both introduced during times of low unemployment like we have today. The Whopper came first in 1957, in a year when the unemployment rate dropped as low as 3.7%. Burger King's co-founder noticed that a rival establishment was selling well with a bigger burger, and he sought out to imitate it.

The Big Mac owes its success to a particularly entrepreneurial McDonald's franchisee in Pittsburgh. Jim Delligatti came up with the idea in his Pittsburgh restaurant as a way of increasing sales.

No . 1 is Manhattan . The second is a rural Native American reservation in North Dakota .
The two illustrate how widely inequality is spread around the country , and how the issue presents itself in different ways . The far-reaching problem was a driving force behind a raft of proposals in the states this year , as lawmakers looked to address persistent wealth gaps exacerbated by the Great Recession and the subsequent years of halting economic growth .
Polls show inequality to be a growing public concern . A Pew Research Center survey this year found 65 % of all Americans believed inequality was growing , and Gallup found similar results . Partisan differences abound : 90 % of Democrats in the Pew poll thought there was `` a lot '' or `` some '' actions government could take about inequality .

The two U.S. counties with the worst income inequality couldn't be more different. No. 1 is Manhattan. The second is a rural Native American reservation in North Dakota.

The two illustrate how widely inequality is spread around the country, and how the issue presents itself in different ways. The far-reaching problem was a driving force behind a raft of proposals in the states this year, as lawmakers looked to address persistent wealth gaps exacerbated by the Great Recession and the subsequent years of halting economic growth.

Polls show inequality to be a growing public concern. A Pew Research Center survey this year found 65% of all Americans believed inequality was growing, and Gallup found similar results. Partisan differences abound: 90% of Democrats in the Pew poll thought there was ""a lot"" or ""some"" actions government could take about inequality. Half of Republicans said there was ""not much"" or ""nothing"" government could do.

Those differences carried over to the states, where responses in blue versus red states seemed at times as vast as research has shown the wealth gap itself to be. This year, lawmakers sought to do something about inequality, from giving tax breaks to individuals and businesses to bolstering safety net programs and clamping down on corporate pay.

""Our economic divide has become so stark, inequality is so off the historical wall, it's almost forced itself on the country's attention,"" said Sam Pizzigati of the Institute for Policy Studies, a Washington-based progressive think tank. ""It's become so stark that it can't be ignored anymore.""

Others worry the focus on inequality can lead to proposals – targeting executive pay, for example – that won't directly help those who have less.

""Inequality has distracted attention from the bottom, where it needs to be,"" said Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who has questioned some of the research showing an increasing wealth gap. ""Dealing with poverty is much harder.""

Inequality cuts across state lines and pervades every corner of the U.S. It also dovetails with a decline in economic mobility: A Pew Charitable Trusts report last year found 43% of Americans raised in the bottom of the income scale remain there as adults. Almost three in four never reach the middle. (Pew funds Stateline.)

The areas with the worst inequality show how the problem presents different challenges in different places.

New York County, which comprises Manhattan, for example, had the worst income inequality of all U.S. counties, according to U.S. Census Bureau data showing the average inequality from 2008-2012.

The second most unequal was Sioux County, North Dakota, within the Standing Rock Indian Reservation which straddles the Dakotas. President Obama will visit the area on Friday.

Some patterns emerge from the inequality data:

Among the top 10 most unequal counties, six are in the South, including two in Georgia;

Eighteen of the most unequal 25 counties are in the South;

Three are in the area around New York City, while the city itself has the most billionaires in the world.

Corporate Policy

This year Democrats in two coastal states floated a pair of novel proposals that sought to tie state power of the purse to inequality. Experts and the bill authors said it was the first time such measures had been introduced to address inequality.

In California, two Senate Democrats proposed tying the state's corporate income tax to CEO-worker pay equity, setting up a sliding scale whereby a company's tax bill would decrease if the gap between executive and worker pay was smaller.

The bill would have reduced the corporate tax rate for any company where the CEO makes less than 100 times the earnings of the median worker at the company (with bigger discounts for greater parity). Last year, a Bloomberg survey found the average CEO compensation to be more than 200 times that of rank-and-file workers, an increase of 20% since 2009.

The bill eventually failed its first floor vote, but its authors, Democratic Sens. Mark DeSaulnier and Loni Hancock, have moved it keep it alive.

""My belief is the public is behind it, and will become more behind it,"" DeSaulnier said this week. He said he plans to lobby his colleagues to back the bill, but that ""it can be intimidating taking on multi-billionaires. We've got a lot of plutocrats in this country now.""

Opposition has been fierce: a handful of Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the bill, and the business community has come out in force to label it a ""job killer."" Opponents range from the Chamber of Commerce to the state's retailers and restaurants associations. The Tax Foundation, which advocates for ""fairer, flatter"" taxes, has been skeptical as well.

A bill in Rhode Island was more successful. The bill would give companies a preference in state procurement if they don't pay their executives 32 times or more than the lowest-paid worker in the company.

Democratic Sen. Catherine Cool Rumsey said the focus on inequality led to her think about different ways to address the issue, and she decided to use state contracts as a tool.

""We can, as legislators, as keepers of the purse, help drive those incentives,"" she said. ""You don't want to be anti-business but at the same token we have to change the conversation to the impact as a taxpayer.""

The bill was approved in the Senate last week and sent to the House, where no companion legislation has yet been introduced.

Minimum Wage

""More and more, people see these in tandem,"" said Ellen Bravo, executive director of Family Values @ Work, which advocates for family-friendly work policies, ""This is exactly what the economy needs: People need to keep their jobs and keep their income.""

Yet those efforts haven't paid off in the same way. Attempts to start paid family leave programs state by state have hit a wall recently. Cities such as the District of Columbia, New York City and Portland, Oregon, have created or expanded paid sick leave requirements, but opposition from businesses and some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle has halted efforts elsewhere.

Safety Net Cuts

Much of the debate this year on inequality has taken place in the context of an economy ever-so-slowly recovering from the Great Recession. Lawmakers in some states have trimmed the safety net in response, saying if government assistance is too generous, workers will have less incentive to re-enter the workforce. Creating good jobs, they say, is the best way to address inequality.

The dynamic played out most prominently with regard to unemployment insurance, both at the state and federal level. Lawmakers considered changes to reduce the number of weeks available and trim benefits, with an eye toward boosting workforce participation.

In Congress, lawmakers allowed federal jobless benefits, which were expanded during the recession, to expire at the end of 2013. Efforts to revive the program this year have failed.

Likewise, some states have cut back their own regular unemployment programs, reducing the number of weeks available to levels not seen in decades. At least eight states have reduced the number of weeks available below the usual 26 weeks, often on a sliding scale that reduced availability as the jobless rate declines. The Missouri legislature approved a similar bill, but Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon hasn't acted on it yet.

The familiar argument about not letting the safety net become a hammock, as articulated by Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, also spawned cuts to other parts of the safety net this year.

""Rather than focusing on inequality, it's how do we actually help the poor and help individuals in need?"" said Rachel Sheffield of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""If we look at our policies from our welfare system they don't promote that, they don't promote work and self-sufficiency. Our welfare system has failed to do that.""

In a subtle but significant change, many states opted recently not to continue waivers from the federal government that let their residents collect food stamps without meeting certain work requirements. The moves were cast as welfare reform, to push people back into the workforce.

Tax Policy

Pro-growth, business-friendly tax proposals have carried over into the fiscal realm in states this year as well. At the same time, other states wielded the tax code to boost workers' income.

Efforts to boost business through taxes took the form of cuts to personal and corporate tax rates. Lawmakers in Missouri overrode a gubernatorial veto of a cut in income taxes for top earners. Indiana also cut the state's corporate income tax rate.

Advocates for the working poor turned to the tax code to boost the earned income tax credit (EITC), a benefit that offsets payroll and income taxes for low-income workers, mostly parents. Obama's proposal to expand the federal credit hasn't gained traction in Congress.

The credit is unique in that it generally enjoys support from Republicans and Democrats. The federal credit directs billions in benefits to taxpayers across the country, and 25 states plus D.C. have their own versions.

2014 was a year of expansion, in part thanks to recovered state budgets. Minnesota, Maryland, District of Columbia and Republican-controlled Ohio all approved expansions of their EITCs.

""That's a really great policy, along with the minimum wage, for making sure that state economies are recovering and that working families get to recover too,"" said Erica Williams of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

If you think only farmers care about the farm bill currently being considered by Congress, you're very, very mistaken.

The measure will not only set policy and spending for the nation's farms for years to come, but it will also affect dozens of other seemingly unrelated programs — all at a cost of nearly $1 trillion over the next decade. Following are a few questions and answers about the massive legislation:

Why is it called the farm bill, and where did it come from?

First, the term ""farm bill"" is a bit misleading. It's simply shorthand for legislation that invariably gets saddled with a different name. In 2002, it was the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act, and in 2008, it was known as the Food, Conservation and Energy Act. The latest bill is the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2012.

Second, perhaps 80 percent of the bill has nothing to do with farms or farming. But more on that later.

Modern farm bills date to the Great Depression and the New Deal. By the 1930s, U.S. farmers were victims of their own success. Mechanization and stepped-up production during World War I, as America fed a war-weary Europe, eventually led to huge surpluses and falling prices for basic crops. The Agricultural Adjustment Act sought to do something that to this day remains controversial: pay farmers not to grow crops in an effort to boost prices.

But the Supreme Court didn't like a tax provision in the 1933 law and struck down the entire act. By 1938, Congress passed a new Agricultural Adjustment Act, sans the offending tax. Farm bills have been passed about every five years ever since.

""I would say the New Deal is the great-great-grandfather of all the farm bills as we currently know them,"" says Dale Moore, director for public policy at the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Why should you care?

It's not just about farmers. The farm bill is an all-encompassing piece of legislation comprising everything from farm subsidies and crop insurance — which have an indirect impact on food prices — to energy, forestry, food stamps and school lunches.

""It covers what is, in a lot of ways, the rural economy in this country,"" Moore says.

Why is it controversial?

In an age of rising deficits, the bill has come in for a lot of scrutiny.

Chris Edwards, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, calls the farm bill ""a bipartisan pork barrel spending spree.""

""Farm subsidies redistribute wealth from taxpayers to often well-off farm businesses and landowners,"" he says. ""In 2010, the average income of farm households was 25 percent above the average of all U.S. households.""

But the largest chunk of the farm bill in dollar terms is directed to the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as the food stamp program.

Edwards says the growth in the program in recent years has been remarkable, ""not just because of the recession but because of the increase in eligibility during the Bush administration.""

However, Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, thinks much of the criticism of food stamps has been over the top.

""In my view, one of the biggest myths is the claim that some people make that SNAP is growing out of control and is contributing in a substantive way to the deficit,"" she says. ""To the extent it is growing, it's for reasons that we very much understand — it's about addressing the needs of people in a bad economy.""

How much does it cost?

The details of this year's bill are still being hammered out, but the Congressional Budget Office says the cost over 10 years will be about $969 billion. The vast majority — $768.2 billion, according to the CBO — will go to food stamps.

Since the farm bill represents anticipated spending over 10 years, it's difficult to assign it an exact percentage of an evolving federal budget. But it's typically more than education and less than defense spending or Social Security.

What's in the farm bill?

The short answer is: a lot. Here's a partial list:

price supports and/or crop insurance for commodity crops

conservation programs that affect land, water and soil use

agricultural exports and food aid, including humanitarian assistance to other nations

food assistance programs for poor Americans

direct and guaranteed loans to farmers and ranchers

forestry programs managed by the U.S. Forest Service

programs promoting renewable fuels such as ethanol

crop insurance and disaster assistance





How is the latest legislation different than past bills?

Sponsors of the 2012 farm bill claim it will save taxpayers $23.6 billion over 10 years. But that figure represents less than 2.5 percent of the total cost of the bill, according to the CBO.

The biggest change, supporters of the bill say, will involve a planned transition away from the direct payments to farmers that were instituted in the 1990s. Those payments were meant to streamline the process, but were granted to farmers regardless of what kind of year they had.

""If they had a very difficult year, they got the very same payment as if they had a bumper crop with fabulous prices,"" says Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union.

With the improvements, the balance of the equation for farmers shifts away from price supports and toward risk management. It's designed to protect against things like floods and droughts in a way that minimizes the need for Congress ""to do ad hoc disaster legislation"" for farmers each time there's a catastrophic event, Johnson says.

And our economy too will emerge from the current situation. How much time will it take? In the worst case scenario I think about two years. And let me repeat once again, (BACK TO PUTIN) after this the growth is unavoidable, also because the economic situation will also be changing.

No to bridges to nowhere , yes to nuclear , a faster Internet , and R & D
One of Donald Trump ’ s signature policy proposals has been a massive infrastructure investment plan . This puts conservatives in a bind . After all , didn ’ t we denounce the Obama administration ’ s stimulus plan as a massive boondoggle that didn ’ t do anything to boost the economy but wasted resources ?
At the same time , we should recognize that there is ample conservative warrant for believing that the government should ensure that the United States has the world ’ s best infrastructure . Most free-market economists agree that infrastructure is one of the few worthwhile jobs that government can do . What ’ s more , as entrepreneur and Manhattan Institute fellow Jim Manzi pointed out in “ The New American System , ” in the Spring 2014 issue of National Affairs , government concern for infrastructure was actually a major booster of American prosperity in the 19th century , usually thought of as the halcyon days of small government . Such luminaries as Alexander Hamilton famously favored government public works , as did ( less famously ) Abraham Lincoln , who expanded Henry Clay ’ s agenda of investment in telegraphs and railroads . This communication and transportation network provided the backbone for America ’ s stunning late-19th-century growth , which made it the world ’ s richest nation well before it became a global power after World War I .
There is a good case that now is also a good time to spend on infrastructure . It ’ s not only that the economy could use the stimulus , which would probably be real if almost certainly lower than breathless Keynesian types would assume , or that interest rates on American debt are at all-time-lows , although those are factors . It ’ s that American infrastructure in key areas — such as transportation , the Internet , and energy — is subpar , and that quality infrastructure is a key asset in economic competition in a globalized economy .
But the question remains : What , exactly , does the Trump administration intend to do , and what might come out of Congress , where Democrats and big government are already salivating at the prospect of larding up a bridge-to-nowhere pretend-infrastructure bill ? This is an area where conservatives can play a key role , constructively engaging with an administration that holds both great potential and significant risks for conservative-minded policies . Conservatives can and indeed should support a major infrastructure initiative — so long as it is done right .
Here are some key points on what that might look like .
1 . First come the least sexy but most valuable parts : upgrading existing infrastructure .

A strike by 40,000 Verizon workers impacted the numbers , the labor department said , and without the strike the number of jobs added would have been 72,000 , which is still less than half the expected job growth .
The unemployment rate is now the lowest it has been since November 2007 , and job gains in 2016 have slowed sharply from the 240,000 average of the last two years . On Friday , the Department of Labor also cut its assessment of the number of jobs added in March and April by 59,000 .

May ’ s report is the last before the Fed ’ s next meeting on 14-15 June , when the US central bank may raise interest rates again .

Verizon strike ends as tentative deal promises 'big gains ' for workers Read more
The last time Verizon workers went on strike , for two weeks in August 2011 , the department of labor reported that the economy added no jobs that month . The following month , however , it reported a growth of 103,000 jobs and noted that the spike partially “ reflected the return to payrolls of about 45,000 ” striking workers .
The recent strike ended last week after the labor department helped Verizon and the union representing the striking workers reach a tentative deal .
As job growth slows , Barack Obama has moved to defend his economic legacy . Earlier this week , while speaking in Elkhart , Indiana , he described the US economy as the “ strongest , most durable economy in the world ” and pointed out that over the past six years , US businesses have created more than 14m new jobs .
“ Despite the drop in unemployment , wages are still growing too slowly , and that makes it harder to pay for college or save for retirement , ” said Obama , before pointing out that so far this year , wages have grown at a rate of about 3 % . Until recently , his administration had described wages as the unfinished business of this recovery .

economy_and_jobs,Brookings Institution,1,http://www.brookings.edu/research/topics/jobs,Job Creation,2012-04-03,Robert C. Pozen,"President Obama is about to sign into law the JOBS Act-short for “ Jumpstart Our Business Startups. ” This Act won bipartisan support because it reduces the regulatory burdens on capital raising by small businesses . However , many of the Act ’ s provisions leave investors too vulnerable to significant risks that they do not understand .
The JOBS Act addresses three distinctly different types of companies : true startups , “ small ” companies going public and private companies of all sizes . For true startups , the JOBS Act offers the prospect of “ crowdfunding ” -the solicitation of relatively small amounts of capital from a large number of contributors , usually via the Internet .
Crowdfunding could open up a host of exciting new possibilities for small businesses . For instance , a mom-and-pop restaurant could use crowdfunding to finance the opening of a second location . Or an online retailer could solicit contributions to help purchase new servers to accommodate increasing web traffic .
Although the House bill broadly exempted crowdfunding from the securities laws , a bipartisan amendment in the Senate provided some regulatory protections to investors . The amendment mandated that companies disclose basic financial information before seeking crowdfunding , and required third-party intermediaries ( i.e. , websites selling crowdfunding shares ) to register with the SEC . The amendment also reduced the amount of money that an individual could invest in a crowdfunded venture-preventing investors from assuming too much risk .
With this increased oversight , crowdfunding could fill a useful niche to help certain small businesses raise capital . Nonetheless , crowdfunding is very much an experiment ; it might spawn a new generation of Internet fraudsters . Therefore , Congress should hold hearings every year or so to examine how the market has responded to the new Act .
For “ small ” companies , the Act decreases the regulatory burdens associated with going public . In the registration statement for the IPO , certain companies will only need two years of audited financial statements ( instead of three ) . Furthermore , once these companies complete their IPO , they ’ d be exempt from various requirements of public companies for up to five years-such as mandatory “ say-on-pay ” advisory votes and auditor attestation of internal controls .
While these regulatory exemptions may have an adverse effect on the corporate governance of small companies , I don ’ t believe that these reforms will greatly increase the risk of serious fraud or deception . Even with the regulatory exemptions in the JOBS Act , investors will receive better disclosures than they would have received if the company had stayed private .
However , the exemptions in the JOBS Act apply to many companies that should not be considered “ small ” -including many companies earning nearly $ 1 billion in annual revenue . In effect , the JOBS Act ’ s definition of a “ small ” company covers the vast majority of U.S. companies that go public .
In my view , a company with $ 800 or $ 900 million of annual revenues should not be considered “ small. ” A more appropriate metric would be annual revenues of $ 250- $ 350 million . That is the definition of a small company developed by the SEC ’ s special task force on the subject .

Under current rules , fraudsters avoid using the Internet or other media to solicit investors for private offerings , since such widespread offerings would immediately attract the attention of the SEC ’ s enforcement division .

Currently , to be “ accredited ” , an investor must earn $ 200,000 annually ( $ 300,000 for married couples ) or have a net worth of at least $ 1 million ( excluding their primary residence ) . Back in 1982 , when this threshold was established , only 1.6 % of American households qualified . Today , more than four times as many households meet this standard . The SEC should update the definition of “ accredited ” -say , to an income of $ 600,000 or a net worth of $ 3,000,000 ( again excluding their primary residence ) -to make sure that all investors in private offerings are financially savvy enough to understand what they ’ re buying and sufficiently wealthy to bear the substantial risk .
In short , the JOBS Act may help certain small businesses raise capital with fewer regulatory restrictions . But if these regulatory exemptions are exploited by the Bernie Madoffs of the world , investors may become more fearful of buying shares in any small business-making it harder for legitimate small businesses to raise capital . Therefore , over the next several years , the SEC should carefully monitor the actual effects of the Act – both positive and negative .","President Obama is about to sign into law the JOBS Act-short for “Jumpstart Our Business Startups.” This Act won bipartisan support because it reduces the regulatory burdens on capital raising by small businesses. However, many of the Act’s provisions leave investors too vulnerable to significant risks that they do not understand.

The JOBS Act addresses three distinctly different types of companies: true startups, “small” companies going public and private companies of all sizes. For true startups, the JOBS Act offers the prospect of “crowdfunding”-the solicitation of relatively small amounts of capital from a large number of contributors, usually via the Internet.

Crowdfunding could open up a host of exciting new possibilities for small businesses. For instance, a mom-and-pop restaurant could use crowdfunding to finance the opening of a second location. Or an online retailer could solicit contributions to help purchase new servers to accommodate increasing web traffic.

Although the House bill broadly exempted crowdfunding from the securities laws, a bipartisan amendment in the Senate provided some regulatory protections to investors. The amendment mandated that companies disclose basic financial information before seeking crowdfunding, and required third-party intermediaries (i.e., websites selling crowdfunding shares) to register with the SEC. The amendment also reduced the amount of money that an individual could invest in a crowdfunded venture-preventing investors from assuming too much risk.

With this increased oversight, crowdfunding could fill a useful niche to help certain small businesses raise capital. Nonetheless, crowdfunding is very much an experiment; it might spawn a new generation of Internet fraudsters. Therefore, Congress should hold hearings every year or so to examine how the market has responded to the new Act.

For “small” companies, the Act decreases the regulatory burdens associated with going public. In the registration statement for the IPO, certain companies will only need two years of audited financial statements (instead of three). Furthermore, once these companies complete their IPO, they’d be exempt from various requirements of public companies for up to five years-such as mandatory “say-on-pay” advisory votes and auditor attestation of internal controls.

While these regulatory exemptions may have an adverse effect on the corporate governance of small companies, I don’t believe that these reforms will greatly increase the risk of serious fraud or deception. Even with the regulatory exemptions in the JOBS Act, investors will receive better disclosures than they would have received if the company had stayed private.

However, the exemptions in the JOBS Act apply to many companies that should not be considered “small”-including many companies earning nearly $1 billion in annual revenue. In effect, the JOBS Act’s definition of a “small” company covers the vast majority of U.S. companies that go public.

In my view, a company with $800 or $900 million of annual revenues should not be considered “small.” A more appropriate metric would be annual revenues of $250-$350 million. That is the definition of a small company developed by the SEC’s special task force on the subject.

As executive director of BANANAS , an Oakland-based nonprofit that connects families with childcare providers , he has seen how Oakland ’ s minimum wage hike has impacted workers who benefit from a higher wage , while creating new challenges for families facing more expensive or reduced access to child care .
“ Everybody believes that it ’ s a good thing , that we do need to improve wages , because childcare providers are woefully underpaid , ” he said . “ But the implications can be complicated . ”
In March , the minimum wage in Oakland jumped to $ 12.25 from $ 9 an hour . “ The increase in the minimum wage is absolutely having a dramatic impact on the childcare field , ” Winefield said .
The wage hike is restricting access to child care for lower-income families , he said .
“ In some instances , childcare providers have hired assistants to work with them , with the children , ” Winefield said . “ But because of the increase to the minimum wage , they have not been able to hold on to those folks . They just simply can ’ t afford to keep those assistants .
“ Their profit margins are so thin to begin with , so they have to lay off those providers . So those are working people who are out of jobs .

Williamson, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Carrie Severino, John Fund, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, Bill Corsair","Our primitive belief : When the chieftain pleases the gods , we get bountiful harvests .
There was a scrap of good economic news this week : The GDP-growth figure for the last quarter has been revised upward to an annualized rate of 3.3 percent . That is the most robust GDP growth we ’ ve had since the third quarter of 2014 .
There was other good news : Corporate earnings were up 5.4 percent year-over-year , and while consumer spending slowed down substantially , investment in business equipment rose considerably , to an annualized rate of 10.4 percent .
You ’ ll notice the word “ annualized ” in there more than once . That ’ s because we are looking at the data from only one quarter , i.e. , from a three-month period . That ’ s a pretty narrow view : No one remembers 2014 as a smashingly successful year for the U.S. economy , but it featured two quarters of growth far stronger than the one currently being touted by the Trump administration : 4.6 percent in the second quarter and 5.2 percent in the third quarter . Unfortunately , growth was negative 0.9 percent in the first quarter and 2 percent in the fourth quarter . This quarter giveth , and the next quarter taketh away . Or maybe it doesn ’ t .
But this isn ’ t about data . It ’ s about bug-eyed , bone-in-the-nose , bark-at-the-moon primitivism .
We like to think that we have left behind such ancient notions as divinely sanctioned kingship and rule by chieftains who propitiate the gods and therefore make the fields fertile and the livestock fecund — or else displease the gods and bring upon us drought and plague . But we haven ’ t .
One of the great enduring stupidities of the American presidential cult is the belief , rooted in invincible ignorance , that the state of the U.S. economy at any given moment is a reflection of the intelligence and wisdom of the chief executive of the federal government and a result of the excellence or insufficiency of his administration . “ Sure , Bill Clinton may have been an intern-diddling hillbilly and maybe even a violent rapist , but , man , my IRA kicked ass in the 1990s ! ”
There ’ s an upscale version of this stupidity , one you will hear repeated ad nauseam on outlets like MSNBC and in the virtual pages of Forbes , which really ought to know better . Here ’ s Jere Glover praising candidate Donald Trump for asserting
the same thing I ’ ve been compiling cold , hard government data on since 1980 : By crucial metrics like GDP , job creation , business investment and avoiding recessions , the economy does a lot better with Democrats in the White House than with Republicans . Just one eye-opening example : Nine of the last 10 recessions have been under Republicans .
If you have a little basic mathematical literacy , you ’ ll see some problems . A little political literacy will lead to your detecting several more . But let ’ s consider it .
Ten recessions back gets us to 1953 . Since then , we have had 30 years of Democratic presidents and 35 years of Republican presidents ; if recessions were randomly distributed , we ’ d still expect to see more of them coinciding with Republican presidencies simply because there have been more of them . In fact , most presidencies have coincided with one or more recessions .
On the specifics , the argument is weak . But how much should we make of that coincidence in general ? Democrats plead on behalf of Barack Obama that he came into office during a terrible economic crisis , and that he and his policies should not be blamed for the weak growth and disappointing labor-market performance that marked his time in office . That ’ s not unfair . But the same could be said of , e.g. , Gerald Ford , who had to deal with an OPEC-inflicted quadrupling of oil prices in 1973 . Does anybody think Gerald Ford ’ s policies caused that ? John Kennedy came into office at the tail end of a recession , which officially ended in February of his first year in office . Does any serious person believe that in the course of less than a month President Kennedy implemented policies that ended the recession ? That would be a deeply silly contention . Even more juvenile is assuming that business cycles are inextricably linked to election cycles — without offering a lick of evidence or even a plausible mechanism for that being the case .
Recession-counting also ignores the fact that some recessions are the result of excellent public policy . The Reagan administration came into office with the country suffering from a serious inflation problem , and the tight monetary policy that the administration undertook to rein in that inflation produced a recession , as it was expected to . The recession was the price we paid for getting inflation under control . Inflation rose again toward the end of the Reagan-era boom , and once again , monetary tightening was used to control inflation at the cost of inflicting the mild recession that Bill Clinton rode to power . Oddly , Jere Glover ignores inflation . I wonder why .
People talk about ‘ Reagan deficits ’ and the ‘ Clinton surplus , ’ but it would be much more sensible to talk about the Tip O ’ Neill deficits and the Gingrich surplus .
Besides the most obvious economic stupidity , there is some pretty deep political stupidity at work here , too . For one thing , presidents have to deal with Congress , which actually does things like set tax rates and appropriate money . People talk about “ Reagan deficits ” and the “ Clinton surplus , ” but it would be much more sensible to talk about the Tip O ’ Neill deficits and the Gingrich surplus : Reagan wanted substantial spending cuts that were never implemented , and Clinton resisted even modest fiscal reform until he couldn ’ t . These things get a little more complicated than the R-vs.-D , black-hats/white-hats mode of analysis would suggest .
And , of course , there ’ s the hard-to-quantify fact that Dwight Eisenhower , Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan , George W. Bush , and Donald J. Trump ( “ One of these things is not like the others / one of these things does not belong ! ” ) pursued radically different economic policies . As , indeed , did Democratic presidents : There ’ s a great deal of daylight between Jack Kennedy ’ s economic thinking and Barack Obama ’ s . On the GOP side , Ike was a Republican throwback who pursued a policy agenda that he himself described as “ progressive ” while keeping an eye on the nickels and dimes , and he presided over a federal government that , in 1957 , saw slightly lower taxes than we have today , three times the military spending , and a modest budget surplus . ( Modern conservatives could live with a progressive like that , I think . ) Nixon was a Wilsonian statist who imposed price controls on the economy .

The Winners in the Modern Economy Won ’ t Be Protection Seekers","(Reuters photo: Jason Reed)

Our primitive belief: When the chieftain pleases the gods, we get bountiful harvests.

There was a scrap of good economic news this week: The GDP-growth figure for the last quarter has been revised upward to an annualized rate of 3.3 percent. That is the most robust GDP growth we’ve had since the third quarter of 2014.

Hurrah.

There was other good news: Corporate earnings were up 5.4 percent year-over-year, and while consumer spending slowed down substantially, investment in business equipment rose considerably, to an annualized rate of 10.4 percent.

You’ll notice the word “annualized” in there more than once. That’s because we are looking at the data from only one quarter, i.e., from a three-month period. That’s a pretty narrow view: No one remembers 2014 as a smashingly successful year for the U.S. economy, but it featured two quarters of growth far stronger than the one currently being touted by the Trump administration: 4.6 percent in the second quarter and 5.2 percent in the third quarter. Unfortunately, growth was negative 0.9 percent in the first quarter and 2 percent in the fourth quarter. This quarter giveth, and the next quarter taketh away. Or maybe it doesn’t.

But this isn’t about data. It’s about bug-eyed, bone-in-the-nose, bark-at-the-moon primitivism.

We like to think that we have left behind such ancient notions as divinely sanctioned kingship and rule by chieftains who propitiate the gods and therefore make the fields fertile and the livestock fecund — or else displease the gods and bring upon us drought and plague. But we haven’t.

One of the great enduring stupidities of the American presidential cult is the belief, rooted in invincible ignorance, that the state of the U.S. economy at any given moment is a reflection of the intelligence and wisdom of the chief executive of the federal government and a result of the excellence or insufficiency of his administration. “Sure, Bill Clinton may have been an intern-diddling hillbilly and maybe even a violent rapist, but, man, my IRA kicked ass in the 1990s!”

It’s dumb, but it rules politics.

There’s an upscale version of this stupidity, one you will hear repeated ad nauseam on outlets like MSNBC and in the virtual pages of Forbes, which really ought to know better. Here’s Jere Glover praising candidate Donald Trump for asserting

the same thing I’ve been compiling cold, hard government data on since 1980: By crucial metrics like GDP, job creation, business investment and avoiding recessions, the economy does a lot better with Democrats in the White House than with Republicans. Just one eye-opening example: Nine of the last 10 recessions have been under Republicans.

If you have a little basic mathematical literacy, you’ll see some problems. A little political literacy will lead to your detecting several more. But let’s consider it.

Ten recessions back gets us to 1953. Since then, we have had 30 years of Democratic presidents and 35 years of Republican presidents; if recessions were randomly distributed, we’d still expect to see more of them coinciding with Republican presidencies simply because there have been more of them. In fact, most presidencies have coincided with one or more recessions.

On the specifics, the argument is weak. But how much should we make of that coincidence in general? Democrats plead on behalf of Barack Obama that he came into office during a terrible economic crisis, and that he and his policies should not be blamed for the weak growth and disappointing labor-market performance that marked his time in office. That’s not unfair. But the same could be said of, e.g., Gerald Ford, who had to deal with an OPEC-inflicted quadrupling of oil prices in 1973. Does anybody think Gerald Ford’s policies caused that? John Kennedy came into office at the tail end of a recession, which officially ended in February of his first year in office. Does any serious person believe that in the course of less than a month President Kennedy implemented policies that ended the recession? That would be a deeply silly contention. Even more juvenile is assuming that business cycles are inextricably linked to election cycles — without offering a lick of evidence or even a plausible mechanism for that being the case.

Recession-counting also ignores the fact that some recessions are the result of excellent public policy. The Reagan administration came into office with the country suffering from a serious inflation problem, and the tight monetary policy that the administration undertook to rein in that inflation produced a recession, as it was expected to. The recession was the price we paid for getting inflation under control. Inflation rose again toward the end of the Reagan-era boom, and once again, monetary tightening was used to control inflation at the cost of inflicting the mild recession that Bill Clinton rode to power. Oddly, Jere Glover ignores inflation. I wonder why.

People talk about ‘Reagan deficits’ and the ‘Clinton surplus,’ but it would be much more sensible to talk about the Tip O’Neill deficits and the Gingrich surplus.

Besides the most obvious economic stupidity, there is some pretty deep political stupidity at work here, too. For one thing, presidents have to deal with Congress, which actually does things like set tax rates and appropriate money. People talk about “Reagan deficits” and the “Clinton surplus,” but it would be much more sensible to talk about the Tip O’Neill deficits and the Gingrich surplus: Reagan wanted substantial spending cuts that were never implemented, and Clinton resisted even modest fiscal reform until he couldn’t. These things get a little more complicated than the R-vs.-D, black-hats/white-hats mode of analysis would suggest.

And, of course, there’s the hard-to-quantify fact that Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald J. Trump (“One of these things is not like the others / one of these things does not belong!”) pursued radically different economic policies. As, indeed, did Democratic presidents: There’s a great deal of daylight between Jack Kennedy’s economic thinking and Barack Obama’s. On the GOP side, Ike was a Republican throwback who pursued a policy agenda that he himself described as “progressive” while keeping an eye on the nickels and dimes, and he presided over a federal government that, in 1957, saw slightly lower taxes than we have today, three times the military spending, and a modest budget surplus. (Modern conservatives could live with a progressive like that, I think.) Nixon was a Wilsonian statist who imposed price controls on the economy. Reagan was a libertarian optimist who put growth over balanced budgets. Trump is an economic illiterate with no substantive policy agenda at all.

But he will crow about that 3.3 percent GDP growth last quarter, and will insist that it is the result of his policies. Which of those policies, I wonder? He may get his tax cut, but, for the moment, Trump has done almost nothing of substance on the economy, and what his administration has done — a bit of excellent regulatory reform — is unlikely to affect growth dramatically in the short term. Regulatory reform is a good investment, but one with a long timeline for payoff. When you hear someone crediting a president with an economic boom or strong wage growth, ask them in some detail about the actual mechanism they believe to be at work, some plausible chain of causality. You’ll rarely get a satisfying answer.

Japan's Nikkei finished the session lower by 1.1 percent and down 5.6 percent for the week.

China’s Shanghai Composite ended the day down 0.8 percent and off 3 percent for the week.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed out the day higher by 0.5 percent, but fell 1.3 percent for the week.

In European trading, London’s FTSE traded little changed, Germany’s DAX added 0.2 percent and France’s CAC was little changed.

Americans are justified to be angry about the economic recovery. As President Obama enters his final year, good-paying jobs remain scarce and family incomes are down about $1,650 on his watch.

Since Ronald Reagan ran the country, the availability of attractive employment has been trending down and slowing economic growth is often blamed. During Mr. Obama’s recovery, gross domestic product has advanced at a 2.2 percent annual pace, whereas the comparable figures for Reagan and Bill Clinton were 4.6 and 3.7 percent.

But that puts the story backward — the lack of workers adequately trained for a more technological demanding workplace is slowing growth, not the other way around.

Automation has been an enduring theme throughout American history. First, reapers and tractors consolidated farms and sent workers to factories. Then machines replaced workers in manufacturing, pushing them into more highly paid professions in medicine, education and technology but also less well-paid occupations in restaurants, retailing and other services.

Until recently, computer-programmed machines could be taught strenuous and repetitive tasks like attaching a heavy, rigid fender onto an automobile. Going forward, robots will increasingly replace people in activities requiring more subtle manual dexterity — like making shirts and harvesting fruit — and those requiring more complex cognitive processes like masonry construction, driving limousines and building new robots that adapt to changing environmental conditions.

The drugstore I visit in Washington no longer has cashiers — just a group of checkout machines and one clerk to assist technologically flummoxed patrons. Over the next two decades, robots will be capable of unloading pallets, stocking shelves, filling prescriptions, and generally running the store with minimal human intervention.

By 2030, it will become technologically possible to replace 90 percent of the jobs as we know them by smart machines. The real challenge will be training most Americans to engage in intellectually demanding and creative work, or the globalization of technology and competition will relegate most of us to very low-paying work better left to androids.

In 2016, Americans should be skeptical, not merely of false promises to restore prosperity made by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, but also outraged by the handiwork of mainstream politicians.

The latter’s efforts to make a high school diploma universal have made it a nearly worthless credential. Less than 40 percent of 12 graders are ready to read or learn math at the college level, and many fewer have skills to enter technically demanding positions without post-secondary training.

A college diploma is not much better. After pushing millions of unqualified students into universities through affirmative action and government loan programs, four in 10 graduates lack the complex reasoning skills needed for white-collar work as it exists today, never mind as it will be after machines equipped with high-level artificial intelligence can replace armies of stockbrokers, insurance adjusters and restaurant managers over the next several decades.

Meanwhile the president and his presumptive heir, Hillary Clinton, remain obsessed with sexism in education and the workplace. That nearly 60 percent of college degrees are now awarded to women and females often earn more than males in comparable positions are inconvenient facts when there are voters to be misled to extend a political dynasty.

And conservatives — including the likes of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio — oppose universal standards for more academic rigor like the Common Core.

The future lies in educating Americans, not being angry about false injustice or an omnipresent state, but rather in building and teaching the machines that will do the work that has burdened humanity since the first branch was shaped into a hunting implement.

Without young people trained and encouraged to do that sophisticated work, the locus of prosperity will permanently shift from America to Asia, where pragmatic leaders urge children to study engineering, not the superstitions peddled by pious academics and deceitful politicians.

As Congress and the White House near a deal to add an additional $ 310 billion to the program , some are calling for additional oversight and rule changes to prevent bigger chains from accepting any more money .
Ruth ’ s Chris Steak House , a chain that has 150 locations and is valued at $ 250 million , reported receiving $ 20 million in funding from the small business portion of the economic stimulus legislation called the Paycheck Protection Program . The Potbelly chain of sandwich shops , which has more than 400 locations and a value of $ 89 million , reported receiving $ 10 million last week .
Shake Shack , a $ 1.6 billion burger-and-fries chain based in New York City , received $ 10 million . After complaints from small business advocates when the fund went dry , company founder Danny Meyer and chief executive Randy Garutti announced Sunday evening that they would return the money .
They said they had no idea that the program would run out of money so quickly and that they understood the uproar .
“ Late last week , when it was announced that funding for the PPP had been exhausted , businesses across the country were understandably up in arms , ” the two wrote in a letter posted online . “ If this act were written for small businesses , how is it possible that so many independent restaurants whose employees needed just as much help were unable to receive funding ? ”
“ We now know that the first phase of the PPP was underfunded , and many who need it most , haven ’ t gotten any assistance . ”
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , who has tried to defend the program in recent days , wrote on Twitter that he was “ glad to see ” Shake Shack return the money .
In all , more than 70 publicly traded companies have reported receiving money from the program , according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Sen. Rick Scott ( R-Fla. ) criticized the program , saying that “ companies that are not being harmed at all by the coronavirus crisis have the ability to receive taxpayer-funded loans that can be forgiven . ”
“ I am concerned that many businesses with thousands of employees have found loopholes to qualify for these loans meant for small businesses , ” Scott said . “ Unfortunately , when it comes to the PPP , millions of dollars are being wasted . ”
Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) , chairman of the committee overseeing small businesses , addressed the criticism Monday morning on CNBC , saying that hotels and restaurants are some of the first and hardest-hit companies and that many of their locations are owned by true small businesses or individuals .
But he said that there have been “ some people approved , some companies , that I believe should not have been. ” He sharpened his criticism Monday afternoon , saying on Twitter that the program was not intended to reach multiple subsidiaries of a national brand , and that the administrative regulations “ should be corrected . ”
Asked Monday about the issue Monday , President Trump said : “ As you know , community banks all over the country ... they ’ re supposed to do it according to not only criteria , but according to what we think is right . But if somebody ’ s got something that we think is inappropriate , we ’ ll get it back . ”
Some of the companies receiving money are clients of JPMorgan Chase , adding fuel to criticism that Wall Street banks had helped their clients obtain large amounts . The bank put out a statement Sunday saying that it is “ proud to have secured more funding for small businesses than anyone else in the industry ” and that 80 percent of its PPP loans have been for businesses with less than $ 5 million in revenue .
JPMorgan explained that larger companies may have been served more quickly because its commercial banking unit , which serves larger clients , was able to complete “ most of the applications it received ” while many more applications poured in from traditional small businesses .
The PPP program was intended to benefit workers at businesses and nonprofit employers with fewer than 500 employees that are unable to obtain credit elsewhere , according to the Small Business Act , which formed the basis for the program .
But after intensive lobbying by the restaurant and hotel industries during the weeks leading to the passage of the $ 2 trillion Cares Act economic stimulus package , Congress allowed separate subsidiaries and locations to apply as businesses , even if they were part of a national or international chain .
Thus multiple Ruth ’ s Chris locations could apply under separate entities even though the parent company employed about 5,740 people at the end of last year , according to public filings . Other industries and advocates lobbied against affiliation rules as well , including the private equity industry .
Hotels , with three-quarters of their rooms empty and nearly 4 million people out of work , have been taking advantage of the program . Philadelphia ’ s Hersha Hospitality Trust and Condor Hospitality Trust , a Maryland-based owner of 15 hotels in eight states , reported last week that they had applied for loans .
Other firms receiving money , according to securities filings , include J. Alexander ’ s Holdings , operator of 47 restaurants in 16 states ( $ 15 million ) ; Fiesta Restaurant Group , which operates Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana ( $ 10 million ) ; plus a chain of revolving sushi restaurants , Kura Sushi USA , ( $ 6 million ) .
Mnuchin has called the PPP a success , saying in a statement Friday that the program provided funding to more than 1.6 million small businesses in all 50 states .
“ The vast majority of these loans — 74 percent of them — were for under $ 150,000 , demonstrating the accessibility of this program to even the smallest of small businesses , ” Mnuchin said . He told CNN on Sunday that an additional $ 300 billion “ should be sufficient to reach almost everybody . ”
Executives at some chains have defended the PPP the way it is written , saying that the size of the parent company matters little because most of the money is required to go to workers , as a minimum of three-quarters of each loan must go to payroll in order for the government to forgive the debt .
“ Employees don ’ t care if we ’ re big or we ’ re a small business . They just want their job back , ” said Jon E. Bortz , founder and chief executive of Bethesda-based Pebblebrook Hotel Trust and board chairman for the American Hotel & Lodging Association , the industry ’ s top lobbying group . The AHLA has also argued that hotel owners should not have to spend three-quarters of stimulus funding on payroll .
Ruth ’ s Chris , a steakhouse chain based in Florida , sought the stimulus money so that the company would be “ well positioned to emerge from this situation a strong and viable entity , ” it said in a statement Monday .
As the program ran out of money , however , leaving thousands of small businesses without money to pay their workers , criticism mounted about some of the money going to national brands .
The initial PPP “ was flawed from top to bottom , ” said Florida small business owners Duncan and Rita MacDonald-Korth . “ The program has done very little to help genuine small businesses and instead has benefited large companies who have used subsidiary entities to benefit disproportionately and unfairly . ”
The couple created a petition asking that the program be limited to companies with fewer than 250 employees and that half of it be reserved for those with 50 employees or fewer .
Some critics point out that executives at larger chains often receive multimillion-dollar annual compensation packages . Other chains , such as Marriott and Hilton , have been criticized for inflating the value of their shares in recent years with share buybacks and dividend payments that left less cash on hand to pay workers once the pandemic hit .
Some chains , including those big hoteliers , have since cut executiv e pay and paused buybacks and dividends . Hilton said it is not seeking support from the Treasury Department . A Marriott spokeswoman said that the company had not applied for any stimulus funds on its own and while many of its franchisees had applied , they did so on their own accord .
In their letter , the Shake Shack executives said they were trying to do the best they could for their employees under the rules created by the government , but they acknowledged that other businesses could use the money more than they could .
“ Our people would benefit from a $ 10 million PPP loan but we ’ re fortunate to now have access to capital that others do not . Until every restaurant that needs it has had the same opportunity to receive assistance , we ’ re returning ours , ” they wrote .
Transparency of the small business spending has also become a paramount issue , as the legislation does not require the Small Business Administration to disclose the recipients , even though the agency typically discloses the name , address and executives for loans received .
Leading congressional Democrats are pressing the Trump administration to provide more data about how the money is being distributed .
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , along with Sens . Ben Cardin ( D-Md . ) , Jeanne Shaheen ( D-N.H. ) and Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , wrote to Mnuchin and Small Business Administration Administrator Jovita Carranza on Friday asking that PPP be replenished .
President Trump said at his daily coronavirus briefing Sunday that he hoped to reach an agreement for additional funding on Monday .
“ I think we are getting close to a deal , ” he said .
While the administration and congressional leaders closed in on agreement for a second round of funding , many small business owners struggled to hang on while awaiting aid .
Spending on hotels and restaurants accounts for less than 10 percent of the total money funds dispersed so far , according to the SBA . But many smaller , independent businesses owners around the country were shut out .
Emily Lemmerman , a self-employed steel-drum-tuner in Austin , Texas , applied for a PPP loan soon after the program opened , but never received an approval number from her bank , or any funds . On April 17 her bank , BBVA USA , emailed her to say government funds for PPP had been exhausted , but that it would continue processing her application `` provided additional funding is made available . ”
With widespread quarantining preventing her from traveling , her income has dropped to zero . `` Things are bleak , ” she said .
Craig Rae of Salisbury , N.C. , owns a small business providing home medical equipment and repairs to veterans . He said he applied April 4 for $ 72,000 and was told by his bank that he was among the first 700 applicants out of over 200,000 . He has not heard an answer back .
`` Since we can ’ t get any information whatsoever , we are now going to have to furlough employees that would otherwise be on the front lines , providing home medical equipment so that people can stay in their homes and minimize hospital overcrowding , '' he said .","Thousands of traditional small businesses were unable to get funding from the program before it ran dry.

The executive order , which had been pushed by progressive Democratic lawmakers , applies to all contractors performing services for the federal government and would affect more than 2 million employees , according to an administration official .
The president will then use Tuesday night 's address to press Congress to pass a Democratic plan to increase the overall federal wage to $ 10.10 over three years , then indexing it to inflation , while also raising the minimum wage for tipped workers , the official said .
Critics of the minimum wage push claim that raising the rate could have an adverse effect , discouraging businesses from hiring more workers at a time when the government is trying to spur job growth .
`` The minimum wage is mostly an entry level wage for young people , '' Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell told `` Fox News Sunday . '' `` We have a crisis in employment among young people right now , and generation 18 to 30 , people that got out of college , are finding there are no jobs for them . The last thing we want to do is have even fewer jobs for younger people . ''
But the president is reviving the issue as he tries to focus again on the economy . Obama , who does not have the power to unilaterally raise the minimum wage for private sector workers , also used last year 's State of the Union speech to call for a federal minimum wage hike .
“ Let ’ s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth , no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $ 9 an hour , ” the president said to applause in his 2013 address .
The new executive order affects only future contracts , not existing ones , and would only apply to contract renewals if other terms of the agreement changed . As a result , the order would benefit far fewer workers than the number foreseen by advocates of federal contract employees .
House Speaker John Boehner downplayed the impact the latest executive order would have . `` Let 's understand something : this affects not one current contract , it only affects future contracts with the federal government . And so I think the question is , how many people , Mr. President will this executive action actually help ? I suspect the answer is somewhere close to zero , '' he said Tuesday .
In December , Reps. Keith Ellison , D-Minn. , and Raul Grijalva , D-Ariz. , co-chairmen of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , wrote the president urging him to take the `` bold step '' of signing an executive order to increase wages for federal contractors , GovExec.com reported .
At the time , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued a lukewarm response when asked about the lawmakers ' request , according to the report .
“ This has always been done legislatively . And it has been done with support from Republicans and not just Democrats in the past , ” Carney said .
Obama , in an effort to avoid the appearance of being a lame duck president , is expected to use Tuesday 's State of the Union address to make clear his intentions to use his executive powers to achieve his goals when Congress fails to pass legislation .
Minimum wage is a perennial issue that has taken on a higher profile amid the slowly recovering economy and growing public debate about income inequality . A Quinnipiac University poll this month found 71 percent of Americans in favor of raising the minimum wage — including more than half of Republicans polled .
Five states passed minimum wage measures last year , and advocates hope that number will grow as states from New Hampshire to Washington consider proposals . Many would push families above the federal poverty line , which is $ 15,730 for a family of two . In Iowa , a bill would hike the minimum wage from $ 7.25 an hour to $ 10.10 .
Democrats across the political spectrum have lobbied for a higher minimum wage this year , after Obama got the ball rolling on the issue by calling for an increase in his February budget speech . Since then , union-organized demonstrations in front of profitable mega-chains such as Wal-Mart and McDonald 's have kept it in the public eye .","President Obama, in the first of potentially many executive actions tied to his State of the Union address, will unilaterally increase the minimum wage for workers under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour, from $7.25, in an effort to build momentum for a minimum wage hike for all Americans.

But the president is reviving the issue as he tries to focus again on the economy. Obama, who does not have the power to unilaterally raise the minimum wage for private sector workers, also used last year's State of the Union speech to call for a federal minimum wage hike.

“Let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour,” the president said to applause in his 2013 address.

The new executive order affects only future contracts, not existing ones, and would only apply to contract renewals if other terms of the agreement changed. As a result, the order would benefit far fewer workers than the number foreseen by advocates of federal contract employees.

House Speaker John Boehner downplayed the impact the latest executive order would have. ""Let's understand something: this affects not one current contract, it only affects future contracts with the federal government. And so I think the question is, how many people, Mr. President will this executive action actually help? I suspect the answer is somewhere close to zero,"" he said Tuesday.

In December, Reps. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., and Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., co-chairmen of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote the president urging him to take the ""bold step"" of signing an executive order to increase wages for federal contractors, GovExec.com reported.

At the time, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued a lukewarm response when asked about the lawmakers' request, according to the report.

“This has always been done legislatively. And it has been done with support from Republicans and not just Democrats in the past,” Carney said.

Obama, in an effort to avoid the appearance of being a lame duck president, is expected to use Tuesday's State of the Union address to make clear his intentions to use his executive powers to achieve his goals when Congress fails to pass legislation.

Minimum wage is a perennial issue that has taken on a higher profile amid the slowly recovering economy and growing public debate about income inequality. A Quinnipiac University poll this month found 71 percent of Americans in favor of raising the minimum wage — including more than half of Republicans polled.

Five states passed minimum wage measures last year, and advocates hope that number will grow as states from New Hampshire to Washington consider proposals. Many would push families above the federal poverty line, which is $15,730 for a family of two. In Iowa, a bill would hike the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10.

Democrats across the political spectrum have lobbied for a higher minimum wage this year, after Obama got the ball rolling on the issue by calling for an increase in his February budget speech. Since then, union-organized demonstrations in front of profitable mega-chains such as Wal-Mart and McDonald's have kept it in the public eye.

economy_and_jobs,CNN (Web News),0,http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/07/news/economy/january-jobs-report/index.html?hpt=hp_t1,Job growth remains weak ,2014-02-07,Annalyn Kurtz,"After a chilly month for job growth in December , hiring warmed up a bit in January . But not by much .
The U.S. economy added 113,000 jobs last month , according to the government . That 's an improvement from December , but was far weaker than hoped . Economists had been expecting an addition of 178,000 jobs .
They called the report `` disappointing '' and `` weak , '' but characterized broader economic growth as `` steady-as-she-goes . ''
`` The U.S. economy is very stable , '' said Julia Coronado , chief economist , North America for BNP Paribas . `` 2014 might not be a breakout year , but it 's not a disaster either . ''
Many economists had also been hoping that December 's weak job gains would be revised much higher , as many experts were quick to write off the December report as a fluke . The number was revised higher , but only by 1,000 jobs to 75,000 .
Lowest unemployment in 5 years , but : The unemployment rate was 6.6 % in January , as 10 million Americans were counted as unemployed . Overall , the unemployment rate has improved substantially since it peaked at 10 % in 2009 and is now at its lowest level in more than five years .
That said , much of the decline in unemployment has come for a discouraging reason : some Americans are dropping out of the labor force . As of January , only 63 % of Americans over age 16 participated in the labor market -- meaning they either had a job or looked for one . Although there was a slight improvement in January , participation is still hovering around its lowest level since 1978 .
While some of the decline is partly due to baby boomers retiring , economists are also concerned about the long-term unemployed , who may be giving up on the job market altogether . Following the report , one of President Obama 's top economic advisers , Jason Furman called the unemployment rate still `` unacceptably high . ''
About 3.6 million Americans have been unemployed for six months or more . Those who were relying on extended government benefits lost that lifeline in December .
`` These figures provide a stark reminder that despite the progress that has been made , the after-effects of the recession still linger and are creating hardship for many families , '' Furman wrote in a White House blog post .
The Federal Reserve has been stressing that its stimulus policies depend on the economic data , and while it has been aiming for an unemployment rate of 6.5 % , it 's expected to distance itself from using that number as its main measure of the job market .
`` Using the narrow , widely reported unemployment rate alone could suggest a misleadingly optimistic state of affairs , '' Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a prepared speech Thursday , ahead of the jobs report .
Recently appointed Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to testify before two Congressional committees next week .
Where are the jobs ? Surprisingly , more than half of January 's job gains came from traditional blue collar sectors . Goods-producing industries added more jobs than the services sector for the first time since 2005 .
Construction firms added 48,000 jobs and manufacturers added 21,000 jobs . The mining industry added 7,200 jobs .
But that was one of few bright spots in the report . The health care sector cut 400 jobs -- the first month of job losses since 2003 . Health care had been an industry with strong job growth throughout the recession .
Professional and business services added 36,000 jobs , but a large part of those jobs were through staffing agencies . About 15,000 jobs were added at restaurants and bars . Sporting goods , hobby , book and music stores cut 22,000 jobs .
Overall , the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis . As of January , 7.8 million jobs have come back , but once economists also account for population growth , they expect that it will still take years to get back to a pre-recession job market .","After a chilly month for job growth in December, hiring warmed up a bit in January. But not by much.

The U.S. economy added 113,000 jobs last month, according to the government. That's an improvement from December, but was far weaker than hoped. Economists had been expecting an addition of 178,000 jobs.

Many economists had also been hoping that December's weak job gains would be revised much higher, as many experts were quick to write off the December report as a fluke. The number was revised higher, but only by 1,000 jobs to 75,000.

Lowest unemployment in 5 years, but: The unemployment rate was 6.6% in January, as 10 million Americans were counted as unemployed. Overall, the unemployment rate has improved substantially since it peaked at 10% in 2009 and is now at its lowest level in more than five years.

That said, much of the decline in unemployment has come for a discouraging reason: some Americans are dropping out of the labor force. As of January, only 63% of Americans over age 16 participated in the labor market -- meaning they either had a job or looked for one. Although there was a slight improvement in January, participation is still hovering around its lowest level since 1978.

While some of the decline is partly due to baby boomers retiring, economists are also concerned about the long-term unemployed, who may be giving up on the job market altogether. Following the report, one of President Obama's top economic advisers, Jason Furman called the unemployment rate still ""unacceptably high.""

About 3.6 million Americans have been unemployed for six months or more. Those who were relying on extended government benefits lost that lifeline in December.

""These figures provide a stark reminder that despite the progress that has been made, the after-effects of the recession still linger and are creating hardship for many families,"" Furman wrote in a White House blog post.

The Federal Reserve has been stressing that its stimulus policies depend on the economic data, and while it has been aiming for an unemployment rate of 6.5%, it's expected to distance itself from using that number as its main measure of the job market.

""Using the narrow, widely reported unemployment rate alone could suggest a misleadingly optimistic state of affairs,"" Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a prepared speech Thursday, ahead of the jobs report.

Recently appointed Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to testify before two Congressional committees next week.

Where are the jobs? Surprisingly, more than half of January's job gains came from traditional blue collar sectors. Goods-producing industries added more jobs than the services sector for the first time since 2005.

Construction firms added 48,000 jobs and manufacturers added 21,000 jobs. The mining industry added 7,200 jobs.

But that was one of few bright spots in the report. The health care sector cut 400 jobs -- the first month of job losses since 2003. Health care had been an industry with strong job growth throughout the recession.

Professional and business services added 36,000 jobs, but a large part of those jobs were through staffing agencies. About 15,000 jobs were added at restaurants and bars. Sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores cut 22,000 jobs.

Overall, the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis. As of January, 7.8 million jobs have come back, but once economists also account for population growth, they expect that it will still take years to get back to a pre-recession job market.",www.money.cnn.com,left,8o92cKgFlWRTDrCC

In February , the economy added 236,000 jobs and the unemployment rate edged down to 7.7 percent . Over the last twelve months , the private sector has added 2.1 million jobs ; in contrast , employment in state , local , and federal governments has declined by more than 100,000 jobs .
Despite this progress , millions of Americans are still experiencing the effects of the Great Recession ; indeed , many workers have suffered protracted periods of joblessness or lower wages . A range of government safety-net programs have assisted those Americans who have found themselves struggling in a weak economy . But recent budget cuts , notably the sequestration that went into effect on March 1 , threaten to weaken this social safety net even while employment remains far from pre-recession levels .
In this month ’ s employment analysis , The Hamilton Project looks at current poverty trends in the United States , the important role of government support programs , and how sequestration could damage critical aspects of the safety net in the midst of continued labor-market weakness . We also continue to explore the “ jobs gap , ” or the number of jobs that the U.S. economy needs to create in order to return to pre-recession employment levels .
According to the official poverty rate as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau , 12.5 percent of Americans lived in poverty in 2007 , prior to the start of the Great Recession , a figure only slightly below the poverty rate in 1980 . In the wake of the recession , the official poverty rate has increased significantly , reaching 15.1 percent in 2010—its highest level in recent decades—and remained at that elevated level in 2011 . At first glance , then , it might appear that the nation has made little progress—or even gone backwards—in fighting the war on poverty , but this official rate doesn ’ t tell the whole story .
Some experts argue that the official rate is an inaccurate measure of the well-being of low-income Americans because it omits the effects of taxes and many anti-poverty programs that provide valuable support for low-income American families . In a 2008 discussion paper for The Hamilton Project , Rebecca Blank and Mark Greenberg explain why the official poverty rate is flawed and how it could be improved .
Blank and Greenberg advocate using an alternative measure of poverty , developed by the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) in the 1990s . This NAS rate accounts for changes in the costs of goods other than food—notably , health care—and makes different adjustments for family size and inflation . But most importantly , the official poverty rate only considers a family ’ s pre-tax money income , while the NAS measure also accounts for tax credits and noncash benefits like the earned income tax credit ( EITC ) , child tax credit , housing stipends , energy assistance , and food and nutrition programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP , formerly food stamps ) .
The graph below , based on measures from a recent paper by Bruce Meyer and James Sullivan , illustrates the difference between these two poverty metrics .
A frequent criticism of anti-poverty programs is that they incentivize people to work less , which in turn raises the official poverty rate . While certain programs , such as unemployment insurance , may have this effect for some individuals ( although evidence suggests that this effect is not very large ) , Bruce Meyer and Dan Rosenbaum and Nada Eissa and Jeffrey Liebman have shown that other key anti-poverty programs like the EITC actually provide very strong work incentives . While the overall effect of anti-poverty programs on the official poverty rate is , therefore , ambiguous , it is clear that government programs have greatly reduced the more-accurate NAS poverty rate .
The striking fact about the above graph is that , since the 1990s , the NAS poverty rate has fallen significantly and was 3.4 percentage points below the official measure in 2010 . In human terms , this means there are more than 10 million fewer people living below the poverty line , according to the NAS rate . Intuitively , this makes sense : the development and expansion of effective anti-poverty programs like the EITC , expansions in health insurance for low-income children and families , and more recent temporary expansions in the safety net during the Great Recession have reduced the number of Americans living in poverty over time . What ’ s more , the temporary recovery measures that policymakers enacted during the recession cushioned families against the most devastating effects of the weak economy .
Many of the current anti-poverty programs , therefore , are having a very real and positive impact that is not reflected in official poverty statistics . While too many Americans are still living in poverty , even more families would struggle to get by in the absence of support programs that have been enacted and expanded during the past three decades .
Despite the success of these policies in assisting at-risk families , some of these programs will be scaled back significantly as a result of the March 1 sequestration . The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , for instance , estimates that the extended unemployment benefits that were enacted during the recession kept 3.4 million Americans above the poverty line in 2010 alone . Yet under sequestration , extended unemployment benefits will be cut by almost 10 percent . Other longer-term safety-net programs that have been important in reducing the NAS poverty rate in recent years—including housing vouchers for very low-income Americans and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children ( WIC ) —will also be reduced . Sequestration , therefore , could have disproportionately negative impacts on those Americans who most need assistance in recovering from the recession .
Recently , The Hamilton Project released 15 Ways to Rethink the Federal Budget , a report including a range of proposals—written by experts from many policy and political backgrounds—for reducing the deficit through pro-growth policies that do not hinder the United States ’ recovery efforts . While there has been progress on improving the deficit and labor-market situations over the last few years , it is clear that more work remains to be done to help many American families in their transition back to full employment .

Conclusion

Although poverty—by any measure—has increased since the beginning of the recession in 2007, the evidence suggests that many anti-poverty programs enacted during the past several decades and the federal government’s response to the recession have played an important role in keeping many American families above the poverty line. Indeed, while much work remains to be done in supporting low-income families, the nation’s social safety net has been successful over the past few decades in giving many Americans the support they need to get ahead. Sequestration threatens to throw many American families back into poverty during the economic recovery by cutting the very programs that are helping them stay above water.

In the coming months, The Hamilton Project will continue to look at trends in poverty and how the federal government can do more to provide low-income Americans opportunities to become self-sufficient and succeed. From increasing access to post-secondary education to increasing incentives to work, there are many ways for government to reduce poverty in a way that promotes broad economic growth. Pursuing such policies will improve the lives of millions of Americans and strengthen our economy.",www.brookings.edu,center,rCEizqqBNonG1QSe

Median household income rose to $ 56,516 in 2015 , up 5.2 % from a year earlier , according to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau Tuesday . It marks the first increase in median income since 2007 , the year before the Great Recession started .
Also , the poverty rate ticked down to 13.5 % in 2015 , from 14.8 % a year earlier . And , the share of those without health insurance dropped below 10 % . That 's the first time all three measures have improved in nearly two decades , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
The data is sure to become a talking point in the 2016 presidential election . Donald Trump has repeatedly hammered home that income is $ 4,000 lower than it was in 2000 . ( That 's true if you are comparing it to 2014 data , which had been the most recent available . But Trump often referenced it as current figures , which makes it false . )
Hillary Clinton , meanwhile , will likely use the uptick to show that the economy is recovering .
Median income : The jump in median income was one of the largest annual increases Census has recorded . The growth was also widespread , with geographic regions and races ( except for Asians ) seeing increases .
Related : Trump 's economic speech : CNN 's Reality Check Team vets the claims
Behind the pay hike is the big increase in employment , Census officials said . Some 3.3 million more Americans were working full-time , year-round , pushing up median income . Some 1.4 million more men and 1 million more women had jobs last year .
`` Strong labor markets make a big difference in helping to connect low- and middle-income working families to the broader economy , '' said Jared Bernstein , senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
The annual unemployment rate fell to 5.3 % in 2015 , compared to 6.2 % the prior year .
The jump shows that the economy is improving , said Sheldon Danziger , president of the Russell Sage Foundation , a research group focusing on social issues .
Related : 'Tide has begun to turn ' on middle class jobs

More recent government data found that the uninsured rate fell to 8.6 % in the first quarter of this year . Some 27.3 million people lacked health coverage , according to the National Health Interview Survey , published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .","It's about time.

After years of watching their incomes go nowhere, America's middle class finally got a big raise last year.

Median household income rose to $56,516 in 2015, up 5.2% from a year earlier, according to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau Tuesday. It marks the first increase in median income since 2007, the year before the Great Recession started.

Also, the poverty rate ticked down to 13.5% in 2015, from 14.8% a year earlier. And, the share of those without health insurance dropped below 10%. That's the first time all three measures have improved in nearly two decades, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The data is sure to become a talking point in the 2016 presidential election. Donald Trump has repeatedly hammered home that income is $4,000 lower than it was in 2000. (That's true if you are comparing it to 2014 data, which had been the most recent available. But Trump often referenced it as current figures, which makes it false.)

Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, will likely use the uptick to show that the economy is recovering.

Median income: The jump in median income was one of the largest annual increases Census has recorded. The growth was also widespread, with geographic regions and races (except for Asians) seeing increases.

Behind the pay hike is the big increase in employment, Census officials said. Some 3.3 million more Americans were working full-time, year-round, pushing up median income. Some 1.4 million more men and 1 million more women had jobs last year.

""Strong labor markets make a big difference in helping to connect low- and middle-income working families to the broader economy,"" said Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The annual unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in 2015, compared to 6.2% the prior year.

The jump shows that the economy is improving, said Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, a research group focusing on social issues.

Measures that ""encourage increased employment, increased wages and increased health are beginning to pay off and finally matter,"" said Danziger, citing minimum wage increases and Medicaid expansion as examples.

The lowest-income Americans saw their incomes rise the most, while the Top 10% has the weakest growth.

Still, the nation hasn't fully healed.

Income remains 1.6% lower than it was in 2000, when it hit $57,790, and 2.4% below the 1999 peak at $57,909. Median earnings for men working full-time are still lower than they were in the 1970s, Danziger said.

Women have fared better. Their earnings are up 7.8% since 2000, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. Men's are down 0.1% over the same period.

Income inequality, however, remained at the same level as 2014. It has increased 5.5% since 1993.

Barack Obama let down his graying presidential hair a little bit on Wednesday. He also joked about coloring it.

Speaking to the City Club of Cleveland, Obama seemed to be in a reflective mood. During the question-and-answer period, he was asked by a seventh-grader what advice he would give to himself now, if he could go back to his first day in office.

""Maybe I should have told myself to start dyeing my hair now,"" Obama said. ""Before people noticed, because by a year in, it was too late.""

Obama also suggested he should have moved more quickly to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before political resistance mounted. And he should have done more to explain the depth and duration of the oncoming recession.

""I think I might have done a better job in preparing people so they kind of knew what was coming,"" Obama said. ""That would have helped explain why we needed to pass the Recovery Act, or why we needed to invest in the auto industry.""

House and Senate budget committees unveiled draft budgets that would sharply curtail federal spending and repeal the president's signature health care law.

""This balanced budget delivers to hard-working taxpayers a more effective, efficient and accountable government which supports Americans when it must and gets out of the way when it should,"" said Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

The House budget plan calls for even deeper spending cuts. It would also replace Medicare with a voucher-type system for future retirees.

The president called that a broken record.

""We know now that the gloom-and-doom predictions that justified this budget three, four, five years ago were wrong. Despite the economic progress, despite the mountains of new evidence, their approach hasn't changed,"" Obama said.

I vividly remember as a teenager obtaining my first job with a regular paycheck as a high school biology-laboratory assistant.

It’s hard to describe how excited I was to be receiving a salary and contributing to the upkeep of my family’s household, but the biggest thrill was doing something important while at the same time acquiring many skills that would prove useful in the future.

Through the kindness and interest of my high school science teachers, I gained great familiarity with many scientific techniques that enabled me to acquire a job in the science laboratory at a well-known university while I was still a high school student.

I was competing with college students for this job, but I had an advantage of experience, which worked in my favor.

I held a long list of different types of jobs as I was growing up. I think each of them provided valuable skills that I might not otherwise have acquired. When I worked as a mailroom clerk, I learned the importance of accuracy and speed, as well as organization.

One minor error upstream could have many negative ramifications downstream; meaning, no job is too small and no detail too minor not to require the utmost in attention and devotion.

The job market in America is quite challenging today, and it is well known that in most states, an individual can collect as much if not more from food stamps, housing subsidies and health care subsidies than he can by working a minimum-wage job. If one is only interested in being sustained, accepting many forms of public aid makes a great deal of sense.

However, if the goal is to pursue the American dream, taking even minimum-wage jobs makes even more sense. Between high school and college, I worked as a payroll office clerk receiving barely more than minimum wage, but I learned a great deal about office machines and many of the intricacies of making sure that people were paid on time.

When I worked as a student assistant to the police department while in college, I had the opportunity to meet many distinguished and well-known people from around the world and was exposed to things that I would never have seen otherwise.

Also, through relationships that I developed with my supervisors, I was able to obtain a much higher-paying factory job the next summer that eventually led to my dream summer job of driving very fancy, new sports cars off the assembly line.

There were many other jobs and many other opportunities and skills that were acquired, but the main point is that working leads to the acquisition of knowledge, experience, relationships and opportunities to move up, all of which are important components of realizing the American dream.

The president of the United States standing up there in the midst of this crisis—we started March with 89 cases; as I write, on March 19, we’re above 11,000—picking fights with the press, still insistently saying “Chinese virus,” taking credit for things he didn’t do, bragging about how it would all be much worse if he hadn’t banned travel from China. It’s terrifying, just terrifying to think that this man is the one in charge right now. He is essentially still not doing a goddamn thing about this. Where are these promised tests?

And it’s nearly as revolting to watch Republicans in Congress suddenly embrace government. It’s not as revolting as Trump, because at least they’re doing the right thing, or some version of the right thing. But it’s revolting to think about the hypocrisy of these people. Last week, I wrote: “You know how they say that everyone finds religion in a foxhole? Well, here’s Tomasky’s corollary: In an economic crisis, everybody becomes a Keynesian eventually.

economy_and_jobs,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2016/2/12/10979324/fed-negative-interest-rates,"The next recession could be around the corner, and the Fed isn't ready for it",2016-02-12,"Timothy B. Lee, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan","Around the world , markets are in chaos . Japan 's stock market plunged 5 percent on Friday , while markets in France , Germany , and the UK all saw big losses on Thursday . The US stock market is doing better than most , but it is also down since the start of the year . Oil hit a new low on Thursday of $ 26 per barrel .
These declines reflect growing concerns that the world economy is headed for another recession . Before 2007 we ’ d say , `` If things get bad , the Fed will cut interest rates . '' But with the Fed ’ s benchmark rate below 0.5 percent already , a substantial cut would mean rates that are below zero . That 's an unorthodox strategy , and it might not even be legal , according to testimony by Fed Chair Janet Yellen before congressional committees this week .
The Fed needs a new strategy : Stop targeting interest rates and instead target the growth of the overall economy . Moving away from interest rate targeting would give markets confidence that the Fed has the tools to deal with the next economic downturn , which would reduce the danger of another 2008-style meltdown .
Unfortunately , there 's little sign that the Fed is laying the groundwork for a shift in strategy . Instead , Yellen seemed to be in denial about the magnitude of the challenge she is facing .
`` Let ’ s remember that the labor market is continuing to perform well , '' she said to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday . `` We want to be careful not to jump to a conclusion about what is in store for the economy . '' Maybe not — but the Fed needs to be prepared for the worst .
The Fed needs a new game plan for the next recession
`` The Fed needs to change their fundamental approach , '' argues Scott Sumner , a monetary policy expert at the Mercatus Center . Right now the Fed 's policy discussions are all about where to set short-term interest rates . But not only does that approach stop working when interest rates fall to zero — as they did in 2008 — but interest rates are n't even what people actually care about .
Instead , Sumner argues , the Fed should start directly targeting a variable people do care about : either the inflation rate or ( even better ) the total amount of spending in the economy . He argues that the Fed should focus on setting long-run goals for these variables and then doing whatever it takes to meet those goals .
The Fed should stop targeting interest rates and instead target the growth of the overall economy
The Fed currently has an official target of 2 percent inflation . But the central bank 's actions make it clear that it 's not serious about this target . Last December , for example , the Fed 's own forecast showed that inflation would be around 1.6 percent in 2016 — and the forecast inflation rate had actually been falling . Yet the Fed raised interest rates anyway . That was a pretty clear signal to the markets that the Fed cared more about returning to `` normal '' interest rates than it did about achieving its inflation target .
The problem is n't just that the economy will grow a little bit slower in early 2016 than it could have otherwise . By ignoring its own targets , the Fed sent a message that it was n't really committed to robust growth over the long run , which undermines businesses ' confidence in the recovery and discourages investment .
The solution , Sumner argues , is for the Fed to use a strategy called level targeting to make its own targets more credible . Under a level targeting regime , the Fed would compensate for missing its target in one year by overshooting the following year . For example , in 2015 , the Fed 's preferred measure of inflation came in at 1.4 percent — 0.6 percent below the Fed 's 2 percent target . Under level targeting , the Fed would aim to achieve 2.6 percent inflation in 2016 , delivering 2 percent inflation on average in 2015 to 2016 . That would not only support faster economic growth in 2016 , it would also give the markets more confidence in the Fed 's forecasts for 2017 , 2018 , and beyond .
Abandoning interest rate targets allowed the Fed to beat inflation
Abandoning interest rate targeting might seem radical , but the Fed has actually done it once before , in the late 1970s . Back then , it seemed that no matter how high the Fed raised interest rates , it could n't get inflation under control . So in 1979 , the Fed stopped targeting interest rates altogether .
Instead , it simply set a target for the total amount of money in the economy . Fed Chair Paul Volcker knew that if the amount of money in circulation stopped rising , the inflation rate would eventually have to stop rising too . It took a couple of years ( and helped induce a major recession in 1980 ) , but it worked .
A big reason the strategy worked is that markets believed Volcker was serious about the target . Targeting the money supply directly signaled he was willing to let interest rates go as high as they had to in order to get inflation under control . Once markets believed he was serious , they started doing a lot of his work for him — and businesses began to curtail price increases in the expectation that the overall inflation rate was going to decline .
Today we 're facing the reverse situation . A big reason the economy has been recovering so slowly is that businesses are worried about sluggish growth — or , worse , another 2008-style meltdown — in the coming years . So they 've been reluctant to invest , making slow growth a self-fulfilling prophecy .
If the Fed can convince businesses that it 's serious about delivering consistent growth , businesses will start investing more in the expectation that demand for their products will grow — and that investment will itself produce growth .
Level targeting is a strategy for giving the market more confidence in the Fed 's long-term targets . And while inflation-based level targeting would work better than what we 're doing now , Sumner argues that the best strategy would be to target the total amount of spending in the economy . This approach , known as nominal GDP targeting , has been endorsed by prominent economists such as Christina Romer .
There are two big problems with the Fed 's current strategy of focusing on interest rates . The obvious one is that once rates hit zero , the conventional approach to monetary policy becomes ineffective . After rates hit zero in 2008 , the Fed was forced to use an ad hoc strategy known as `` quantitative easing '' to pump more money into the economy . Lacking experience with this new strategy , the Fed twice made the mistake of ending easing too early , slowing the economic recovery between 2010 and 2012 .
The larger problem with zero interest rates , however , is politics . People are used to thinking of low interest rates as a sign of easy money and vice versa , so the zero interest rate struck many as a sign of recklessly easy monetary policy . In the years after the financial crisis , critics warned that Fed policies would create runaway inflation .
In retrospect , it 's clear that these concerns were unfounded . The average inflation rate since 2008 has been well below the Fed 's 2 percent target , while the economy has suffered from persistently slow job and wage growth . But fear of a political backlash for doing `` too much '' discouraged Yellen 's predecessor , Ben Bernanke , from acting decisively to promote economic growth .
People are used to thinking of low interest rates as a sign of easy money
More recently , the Fed has come under a lot of pressure to `` normalize '' — that is , raise — rates above zero percent . After resisting these pressures for most of 2015 , the central bank finally pulled the trigger in December , boosting its target rate from zero percent to 0.25 percent . It did this despite the fact that — as ███ 's Matt Yglesias pointed out at the time — most economic indicators suggested that a rate hike would do more harm than good .
This is the flip side of the situation the Fed faced in the 1970s . Because interest rates were high , many people thought monetary policy was too tight , and the Fed faced a lot of pressure to cut rates . But cutting rates triggered another wave of inflation , forcing the Fed to raise rates once again . Interest rate targets had become a distraction , and abandoning them helped Volcker focus on the variable he really cared about : inflation .
Negative interest rates are one way the Fed could try to salvage the current regime of focusing on interest rates . But it 's not a very good one .
Just as you might have a savings account with your bank , so a nation 's banks all have accounts with their nation 's central bank . The money deposited in these accounts is called reserves , and in recent years a lot of banks around the world have chosen to build up huge reserve war chests . That 's frustrating to central bankers who have been trying to encourage banks to stimulate economic activity by lending out the money .
So recently Japan 's central bank and some central banks in Europe have been experimenting with negative interest rates on reserves . Last month , the Japanese central bank announced that banks would be assessed a 0.1 percent penalty on their reserves — an interest rate of -0.1 percent . A bank with a billion yen deposited with the Bank of Japan will now have to pay 1 million yen per year for the privilege .
Obviously , 0.1 percent is not a very big number , so the direct effects of Japan 's new policy wo n't be very large . But going negative breaks through an important psychological barrier — once a central bank has instituted a slightly negative interest rate , it 's more likely to cut rates further in the future .
In her testimony before Congress this week , Yellen was pressed on whether the Fed would follow its European and Japanese counterparts and impose a penalty on reserves . Yellen demurred , saying that the Fed 's experts were still studying whether negative interest rates would be legal and technically feasible .
There are real limits on how far negative interest rates can go
But even if the Fed ultimately decides to adopt negative rates , there are real limits on how far they can go . If negative interest rates get too steep , banks have an obvious alternative : They can get physical cash and store it in a big warehouse . By definition , cash is worth as many dollars a year from now as it is today .
There are a couple of ways central banks could try to make negative interest rates more feasible . University of Michigan economist Miles Kimball , for example , advocates a shift to a new form of electronic money that would allow central banks to impose economy-wide negative interest rates . Others argue that the Fed should raise its inflation target so that real , inflation-adjusted interest rates can go lower . But not only do both of these approaches have technical challenges , they 're also likely to be intensely unpopular with voters .
So even if the Fed adopted negative rates , it would n't improve the effectiveness of the current interest rate targeting regime very much . Just as the Fed got stuck at zero percent interest rates in 2008 , it could get stuck at -1 percent interest rates in 2017 or 2018 . So the Fed is going to need a new framework that 's less dependent on interest rates regardless . It might as well get started .","Around the world, markets are in chaos.

economy_and_jobs,CNN (Web News),0,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/10/news/economy/december-jobs-report/index.html?hpt=hp_t1,Jobs report: 2013 ends with weakest job growth in years,2014-01-10,Annalyn Kurtz,"Ouch ! The job market suddenly looks a lot weaker than economists ' had thought .
Hiring slumped sharply in December , as the economy added only 74,000 jobs , according to the government . This was the weakest month for job growth since January 2011 and came as a huge surprise to economists , who were expecting an addition of 193,000 jobs .
For all of 2013 , the economy added 2.2 million jobs -- on par with 2012 's gains .
Some economists believe December 's weak job gains could be a fluke , given other solid data recently . They expect the government to revise the numbers higher in the months ahead .
`` Just about every other measure of job growth suggests that employers are either hiring or intending to hire , extending hours and laying off fewer people , '' said Tim Hopper , chief economist for TIAA-CREF .
`` Let 's not panic , '' said Heidi Hartmann , president of the Institute for Women 's Policy Research , adding that `` it 's not a horrible year , all things considered . ''
The government also noted that `` unusually cold weather in parts of the country '' could have had some impact on construction jobs for example . That sector lost 16,000 jobs in December .
Meanwhile , the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 % in December , but the drop came mainly from workers leaving the labor force .
Job market dropouts could be doing other things , like retiring , enrolling in educational programs or taking care of relatives . But many have simply given up hope of finding work .
Only 62.8 % of the adult population is participating in the labor market now -- meaning they either have a job or are looking for one . That matches the lowest level since 1978 .
In the job market 's 2007 heyday , unemployment was under 5 % , but in the two years that followed , the recession wiped out 8.7 million jobs . To this day , not all those jobs have returned .

Are you unemployed ? Share your story with CNNMoney 's Annalyn Kurtz .","Ouch! The job market suddenly looks a lot weaker than economists' had thought.

Hiring slumped sharply in December, as the economy added only 74,000 jobs, according to the government. This was the weakest month for job growth since January 2011 and came as a huge surprise to economists, who were expecting an addition of 193,000 jobs.

For all of 2013, the economy added 2.2 million jobs -- on par with 2012's gains.

Some economists believe December's weak job gains could be a fluke, given other solid data recently. They expect the government to revise the numbers higher in the months ahead.

""Just about every other measure of job growth suggests that employers are either hiring or intending to hire, extending hours and laying off fewer people,"" said Tim Hopper, chief economist for TIAA-CREF.

""Let's not panic,"" said Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, adding that ""it's not a horrible year, all things considered.""

The government also noted that ""unusually cold weather in parts of the country"" could have had some impact on construction jobs for example. That sector lost 16,000 jobs in December.

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% in December, but the drop came mainly from workers leaving the labor force.

Job market dropouts could be doing other things, like retiring, enrolling in educational programs or taking care of relatives. But many have simply given up hope of finding work.

Only 62.8% of the adult population is participating in the labor market now -- meaning they either have a job or are looking for one. That matches the lowest level since 1978.

In the job market's 2007 heyday, unemployment was under 5%, but in the two years that followed, the recession wiped out 8.7 million jobs. To this day, not all those jobs have returned.

""We're going to have a long-term unemployment crisis for a long time,"" said Heidi Shierholz, economist with the Economic Policy Institute.

Along those lines, CNNMoney has talked to several people who have been unemployed for a while. Jamie May has been looking for a job for more than a year. Formerly a senior manager for a corporate housing company, she had a comfortable six-figure salary before the recession hit. But since then has been laid off three times.

""There are days I'm numb,"" she said. ""The mental toll -- the depression -- the feeling of being unworthy and unwanted, after being highly successful. I just want a job.""

Based in Austin, Texas, she has submitted applications for positions around the country, and has even indicated she would be willing to take jobs in the $30,000 to $40,000 range.

""The feedback is -- 'you're great, you have the credentials, but we want someone who knows the local market.' Or, ' we're concerned you'll leave when the economy picks up and you get a better offer,'"" she said.

Fred Royal in Houston used to work as an administrative assistant for a grocery chain. He lost his job in March, and gets the same message in interviews.

A shift in public policy from wealth concentration and extraction to one of assets rooted in communities is both feasible and broadly beneficial.

economy_and_jobs,Investor's Business Daily,2,https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariffs-first-bombs-china-trade-war/,"After Trump Tariffs Hit, China 'Not Afraid' To Fight Trade War",2018-03-22,Jed Graham,"President Donald Trump made punishing China for trade misdeeds official U.S. policy on Thursday , imposing tariffs of 25 % on up to $ 60 billion of imports , with a focus on high-tech goods . While not as hostile as the $ 60 billion worth of tariffs floated in recent days , the move signals the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic relations as the two countries vie for technological supremacy .
Trump said Thursday 's tariffs were `` the first of many , '' while China 's U.S. ambassador said Beijing is `` not afraid '' of a trade war .
The tariffs would apply to `` appropriate products , '' said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , as the U.S. strikes back at China 's `` policy of forced technology transfer '' and cybertheft . Those products will reportedly include robots , aerospace , high-speed rail , biotech and other categories .
Once the list of some 1,300 products is made official , U.S. companies will have a window to comment and potentially seek relief . Trump , who signed a `` memorandum targeting China 's economic aggression , '' according to the White House , characterized the tariffs not as the start of a trade war , but part of `` a very large negotiation '' with Beijing .
But Trump said Thursday 's action will be the `` first of many '' to tackle the `` out of control '' U.S.-China trade gap .
`` We do n't want a trade war with the United States , or with anybody else . But we are not afraid of it . If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us , we will fight , '' Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted on the Chinese embassy 's Facebook page . He said China `` would fight to the end .. with all necessary measures . ''
But he added that China will continue to work to `` manage our possible differences in a constructive way . '' He also said allegations that China is abetting intellectual property theft are `` groundless . ''
The Dow Jones industrial average , the S & P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite initially pared losses somewhat after the announcement , but sold off into the close , with all the major averages closing down at least 2.4 % . The Dow tumbled 2.9 % .
Even as U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports start to kick in on Friday , Trump is making China the central front in his trade war , aiming to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies , abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing . That became clearer after Lighthizer said that the European Union , Brazil , South Korea , Argentina and others would get at least temporary exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs as negotiations proceed .

Steel Stocks Dive On Trump Tariff Exemptions As China Trade Is Top Priority
Fed Rate Hike Is No Surprise , But Stock Market Weakens On Powell , 2019 Outlook
AI Stock And Alibaba IoT Partner With 217 % Growth Enters Buy Zone","President Donald Trump made punishing China for trade misdeeds official U.S. policy on Thursday, imposing tariffs of 25% on up to $60 billion of imports, with a focus on high-tech goods. While not as hostile as the $60 billion worth of tariffs floated in recent days, the move signals the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic relations as the two countries vie for technological supremacy.

Trump said Thursday's tariffs were ""the first of many,"" while China's U.S. ambassador said Beijing is ""not afraid"" of a trade war.

The tariffs would apply to ""appropriate products,"" said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, as the U.S. strikes back at China's ""policy of forced technology transfer"" and cybertheft. Those products will reportedly include robots, aerospace, high-speed rail, biotech and other categories.

Once the list of some 1,300 products is made official, U.S. companies will have a window to comment and potentially seek relief. Trump, who signed a ""memorandum targeting China's economic aggression,"" according to the White House, characterized the tariffs not as the start of a trade war, but part of ""a very large negotiation"" with Beijing.

But Trump said Thursday's action will be the ""first of many"" to tackle the ""out of control"" U.S.-China trade gap.

China 'Not Afraid' Of Trade War

China signaled it was ready for a trade war.

""We don't want a trade war with the United States, or with anybody else. But we are not afraid of it. If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will fight,"" Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted on the Chinese embassy's Facebook page. He said China ""would fight to the end..with all necessary measures.""

But he added that China will continue to work to ""manage our possible differences in a constructive way."" He also said allegations that China is abetting intellectual property theft are ""groundless.""

The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite initially pared losses somewhat after the announcement, but sold off into the close, with all the major averages closing down at least 2.4%. The Dow tumbled 2.9%.

Even as U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports start to kick in on Friday, Trump is making China the central front in his trade war, aiming to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies, abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing. That became clearer after Lighthizer said that the European Union, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and others would get at least temporary exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs as negotiations proceed. Exemptions already had been granted to Mexico and Canada.

The tariffs aimed against China aren't enough to have a noticeable impact on economic growth, and it's not yet clear how China will respond in the short term. But the stock market fallout on Thursday may reflect an understanding by investors that U.S. has begun confronting China in what will be a long-term conflict with major ramifications for economic relations.

""The damage will be real, it will probably be substantial, and it will mount over time,"" wrote Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""For companies that sell to China, or indeed any country outside the U.S., the effects are likely to be negative — which is why markets are reacting again.""

Dow Stocks Boeing, Caterpillar Hit Hard

Boeing (BA), which China has previously said could be targeted for reprisals if Trump starts a trade war, helped lead the Dow Jones lower early Thursday. Caterpillar (CAT), another Dow Jones component that could see exports suffer and also could face collateral damage if China retaliates against U.S. agricultural imports, also traded lower. Boeing was off 5.3% and Caterpillar 5.7% on the stock market today.

Ahead of the announcement, Best Buy (BBY) told Reuters on Wednesday that it will stop selling mobile phones from China's Huawei. Apple (AAPL), which contracts out global iPhone production in China and sells a lot of phones in the country, is also potentially vulnerable in a trade war. But Beijing has no incentive to make it harder for tech firms to use China as a manufacturing base. Shares of Apple, yet another Dow Jones component, fell 1.4% after sliding below the 50-day line Wednesday.

China Tariff Response Key

Stock market reaction will depend on the scale and timing of U.S. trade restrictions, and on China's response. So far, China seems to be emphasizing plans to respond by targeting soybeans and other agricultural imports, and halting progress on greater access to China's financial sector and other markets.

While China is expected to strike back, it may do so in a relatively limited fashion as it challenges Trump's actions at the World Trade Organization. That would initially limit the scope of the conflict.

That also would mirror the European Union's plan to retaliate if Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect, as they could as soon as Friday. The EU has detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice, but it plans to double down if the WTO ultimately finds Trump's tariffs justified on national-security grounds to be illegal.

Trump's authority to hit China with tariffs comes from section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which has seen little use since the WTO came on the scene. The act gives the president power to impose tariffs or other restrictions when a trading partner ""engages in discriminatory or other acts or policies which are unjustifiable or unreasonable and which burden or restrict United States commerce.""

The Trump administration has asked China to propose ways of narrowing the $375 billion U.S. goods deficit with Beijing by $100 billion, but it's not clear that a confrontational approach will yield progress.

China Trade War Impact On U.S. Consumers, Companies

Hitting China with massive tariffs may be difficult to do without hurting American consumers and American brands produced in China. As Trump prepares to direct relatively heavy economic fire toward China, trade groups representing Walmart (WMT), Apple, Best Buy and other retailers warned that tariffs would raise prices for American consumers, whether or not tariffs prove effective in shrinking the trade deficit. Under Armour (UAA), Nike (NKE) and other shoe companies echoed similar concerns. (Walmart and Nike are both Dow Jones components, with Nike reporting earnings late Thursday.)

Trump's economic advisors are focused on taxing U.S. imports that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership. Tariffs are expected to go hand-in-hand with investment restrictions that blunt China's ability to acquire American technology. Among the possibilities would be restricting the ability of Chinese companies to list on U.S. stock indexes.

Senator John McCain, the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said a revenue increase may be possible to avoid the threat of automatic cuts known as sequestration.

A previous proposal to reduce spending and raise revenue “could serve as a blueprint for further action,” McCain of Arizona said today at a Bloomberg Government defense conference in Washington.

The threat of automatic defense cuts “is so devastating that the secretary of defense will not even contemplate the plans necessary to implement sequestration,” said McCain, who cited elimination of tax breaks for ethanol as part of a potential compromise.

Automatic, across-the-board cuts of $1.2 trillion to both domestic and national-security programs will take place over a decade, beginning in January, if Congress and President Barack Obama don’t agree this year to make adjustments. The cuts were imposed after talks failed last year on a bipartisan plan to curb the nation’s soaring debt.

Efforts to forge a compromise have been frustrated by Republican lawmakers opposed to any revenue increase and Democrats who have said revenue must be part of the package.

The likeliest outcome is that Congress will avoid facing the fiscal challenge and pass a continuing resolution that would only postpone cuts, according to Dov Zakheim, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Pentagon comptroller.

Failure Predicted

“I don’t think this Congress can cut the deal,” Zakheim said at the conference.

If the automatic cuts do occur, gross domestic product will decline about 0.5 percent, Zakheim said. “It’s going to hit us immediately,” he said.

The Pentagon already plans to cut about $487 billion through fiscal 2021, and it would face more than $500 billion in additional reductions if Congress and the White House don’t agree by year’s end on a plan to shrink the U.S. deficit.

Representative Norm Dicks, a Democrat from Washington, said he’d like to see “positive steps taken” on a legislative fix before the November election.

“We will lose a million defense jobs if we allow sequestration to go forward,” he said on a conference panel. “This is all about trying to improve the economy of the United States and reduce the deficit.”

Notifying Workers

Dicks said in an interview after the panel that he’s “willing to consider” an accord that would reduce the Pentagon budget by about $10 billion a year, instead of more than $50 billion a year under the automatic cuts.

Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Senate Armed Services panel, said reductions at that level wouldn’t harm national security.

Defense contractors are required by law to notify employees in advance if they are likely to lose their jobs, Zakheim said.

The notification requirement is 60 days in most states, he said. With sequestration scheduled to take effect Jan. 2, the 60-day notices may come just days “before some of these folks are going to have to get re-elected,” he said of lawmakers.

“You’re going to see pink slips flying in October from contractors across the country” unless action is taken by then, said Representative Randy Forbes, a Republican from Virginia.

Hurting Subcontractors

A significant number of U.S. military personnel might also lose their jobs due to sequestration, Forbes said.

“We could be giving pink slips to 150,000 active-duty” military members,’’ he said. “That’s like doing away with the entire Marine Corps.”

The Pentagon’s biggest contractors, such as Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin Corp. and Chicago-based Boeing Co., “will survive,” Forbes said. The reductions are “going to hit dramatically on subcontractors,” he said.

“We have several million jobs that are at stake,” she said at the conference.

The economy continued to add jobs at a steady pace last month, and the unemployment rate remained low. Analysts have been looking for signs that wage growth might pick up, but it held steady, too.

Payrolls grew by a lower-than-expected 157,000 in July, and the unemployment rate edged down to 3.9 percent, as projected, the Labor Department said Friday.

However, payrolls were revised upward by 59,000 for the prior two months. They grew 248,000 in June, up from the previously reported 213,000, and 268,000 in May, compared with the 244,000 last reported. Over the prior 12 months, payrolls have been growing an average 203,000 per month.

Manufacturing jobs grew by 37,000 in July, jobs in professional and business services were up 51,000, and leisure and hospitality jobs rose 40,000.

Investors are measuring a number of headwinds and increasingly playing it safe . The global economy is showing signs of weakening , with the United States , China and Europe all facing the rising threat of a slowdown , which can hurt demand for commodities such as oil and pose a threat to company profits . Trade tensions between the U.S. and China appear to be getting worse instead of improving , contributing to the sell-off in tech stocks and multinational industrial companies .
For much of this year , investors were hopeful the U.S. and China would easily resolve their differences on trade . That hope has faded in the last two months . While U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping are expected to meet this month at a gathering of the Group of 20 major economies , the proposed limits on tech exports were one more reason to worry .

As the tech giants swoon , investors have lately turned to safer bets such as utilities , real estate companies and makers of household goods . They ’ ve also sought the safety of U.S. Treasuries .
The price of oil has been falling sharply in recent weeks and is now down 30 percent since October 3 .
Saudi Arabia and other countries started producing more oil after the Trump administration announced renewed sanctions on Iran , Nixon noted . The administration granted waivers to several countries allowing them to continue importing oil from Iran , creating a supply glut that pushed prices dramatically lower .
Nixon said OPEC countries will probably cut back on oil production , but some investors are worried that the buildup in crude stockpiles is a sign the global economy isn ’ t doing as well as expected .

The S&P 500 index lost 48.84 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,641.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 551.80 points, or 2.2 percent, to 24,465.64.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 119.65 points, or 1.7 percent, to 6,908.82. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks shed 27.53 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,469.01.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 3.7 percent in the last two days, and the S&P 500 is off 3.4 percent. The Nasdaq, heavily populated with technology stocks, is off 4.7 percent. The S&P 500 index has fallen 9.9 percent from the record high it set exactly two months ago.

Investors are measuring a number of headwinds and increasingly playing it safe. The global economy is showing signs of weakening, with the United States, China and Europe all facing the rising threat of a slowdown, which can hurt demand for commodities such as oil and pose a threat to company profits. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China appear to be getting worse instead of improving, contributing to the sell-off in tech stocks and multinational industrial companies.

For much of this year, investors were hopeful the U.S. and China would easily resolve their differences on trade. That hope has faded in the last two months. While U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping are expected to meet this month at a gathering of the Group of 20 major economies, the proposed limits on tech exports were one more reason to worry.

“A resolution doesn’t seem to be coming in the short term,” said Katie Nixon, the chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. “A lot of the companies that are front and center (like) Alphabet, Apple, IBM ... could be significantly limited in the way they export their technology.”

Apple fell 4.8 percent to $176.98 and is down 23.7 percent from the peak it reached October 3, though it’s still up almost 5 percent this year. Microsoft lost 2.8 percent to $101.71 and IBM fell 2.6 percent to $117.20

As the tech giants swoon, investors have lately turned to safer bets such as utilities, real estate companies and makers of household goods. They’ve also sought the safety of U.S. Treasuries.

The price of oil has been falling sharply in recent weeks and is now down 30 percent since October 3.

Saudi Arabia and other countries started producing more oil after the Trump administration announced renewed sanctions on Iran, Nixon noted. The administration granted waivers to several countries allowing them to continue importing oil from Iran, creating a supply glut that pushed prices dramatically lower.

Nixon said OPEC countries will probably cut back on oil production, but some investors are worried that the buildup in crude stockpiles is a sign the global economy isn’t doing as well as expected.

Earnings from retailers didn’t help investors’ mood. Target plunged skidded 10.5 percent to $69.03 after reporting earnings that missed Wall Street’s estimates due to higher expenses. Ross Stores, TJX and Kohl’s also fell on disappointing forecasts.

Tech stocks were among the biggest losers in Europe, too. Nokia and Ericsson, two top suppliers of telecom networks, each fell about 3 percent. European indexes fell, with Germany’s DAX index dropping 1.6 percent and the French CAC 30 falling 1.2 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 0.8 percent.

Stocks also declined in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 2 percent.

Benchmark U.S. crude lost 6.6 percent to $53.43 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 6.4 percent to $62.53 per barrel in London. Oil prices have nosedived since early October.

Wholesale gasoline fell 5.5 percent to $1.50 a gallon and heating oil skidded 4.6 percent to $1.99 a gallon. Natural gas dipped 3.8 percent to $4.52 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Bond prices were steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 3.06 percent.

Gold slipped 0.3 percent to $1,221.20 an ounce. Silver fell 0.9 percent to $14.27 an ounce. Copper slid 1.2 percent to $2.77 a pound.

The dollar fell to 112.40 yen from 112.54 yen. The euro fell to $1.1399 from $1.1453.",www.newsmax.com,right,AUWOl8cpf1duuF1O

When Republicans speak fondly these days of tax reform in the 1980s, what’s never mentioned is that the capital gains rate ended up at 28 percent — nearly double what Mitt Romney has been paying and 8 points higher than what even President Barack Obama wants.

It’s an important reminder for today’s Washington, so consumed with the top rates for upper-income households. Before any true tax reform, the first two big questions are what is the revenue target and what standard of progressivity will govern the revised code. Lowering rates is an understandable goal. Locking in those rates in advance puts the cart before the horse.

Indeed, the 1980s tax reformers didn’t set out to do away with the preferential treatment for capital gains: Ronald Reagan’s aides even toyed with a lower rate of 17.5 percent. But simple math drove the results as lawmakers sought to meet their revenue target and keep faith with an agreed-upon standard of how the tax burden would be distributed across different income groups.

House testimony in September by David Brockway, who was counsel to the Joint Tax Committee through the 1986 reform effort, drove home this point. If anything, the same pressures will be even greater on any reform effort now.

After last week’s elections, does House Speaker John Boehner truly expect Obama to accept a reform framework that doesn’t improve on the equities of the current code? And what aggregate revenue target is Boehner willing to commit himself to in return for keeping in place the current Bush-era rates while lawmakers write a reform package over the coming year?

The speaker’s office admits readily that neither question has been answered yet. Until that happens, all the Washington talk right now is chiefly that: talk.

Friday’s White House meeting offers a fresh start — and one timed to allow Boehner to first secure his own nomination as the speaker in party meetings this week. But Obama will also have to show more give on the spending side of the ledger if he expects Boehner to steer reluctant Republicans toward a year-end deal.

From his East Room appearance Friday, the president clearly feels he has the wind at his back. But as the past four years have proved, the real test of strength is not whether Obama can get his way but whether he has the self- confidence to give up something of his own to bring Republicans toward him.

This is a White House famous for patronizing Congress — a record made worse by the “do nothing” dynamics of this past election year. But two options to change the tone could be reforms in the food stamp program — a lightning rod for the GOP — and action on a long-discussed change in the inflation index used to adjust government benefits as well as tax brackets.

Each risks the ire of the left: AARP is already on the warpath, warning against any change in the CPI index for Social Security. But the reality is that thoughtful people in both parties can agree that long-range changes are needed.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, for example, has developed a model for a new CPI that eases the impact on the most elderly Social Security recipients and still saves about $150 billion over 10 years. In the case of food stamps, Obama bears responsibility for having turned a nutrition program into an economic stimulus machine. And reforms here could also make it easier to advance a long-delayed farm bill that promises billions in additional savings by ending an outdated system of direct cash payments to producers.

Among the topics they addressed were gun control , immigration reform , climate change , abortion and Obamacare .
The president said there is a continued “ sense of insecurity ” in America , with college students wondering how to pay their loans and many people not yet seeing the benefits of his signature health care law . He told volunteers that they need to stay involved on immigration and other issues because “ what you do day-to-day … will make the difference . ”
“ The key is to try to make sure that this town refocuses on the issues that matter most to people day to day , ” Mr. Obama said .

The attendees included House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat ; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat ; and Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards .
Organizing for Action Executive Director Jon Carson told supporters in an email that the group is gearing up for “ Action August ” — a month in which its goal is to raise the pressure on lawmakers who will be home for the summer recess on various issues stalled in Congress .
“ It ’ s all about making sure members of Congress hear directly from the people they represent , on the issues that matter to all of us , ” Mr. Carson said . “ At the top of the list , a comprehensive immigration reform bill is facing a tough path through the House — and we ’ re going to be out there demanding action from our representatives . ”
He said Organizing for Action supporters “ will be telling the truth about Obamacare , fighting the outright lies about what health care reform means for ordinary Americans . ”
Last week , when House Republicans voted again to repeal portions of the health care law , Mr. Obama chided them for “ refighting these old battles . ”
“ We ’ ll be calling out the climate deniers who are standing in the way of progress in Washington , and make sure the senators who hold the key votes on gun violence prevention hear from the people who sent them to Congress , ” Mr. Carson said . “ And we ’ ll be fighting attacks on a woman ’ s health choices wherever they pop up . ”
It was the second time Mr. Obama has spoken to the group since it formed in January , led by some of the president ’ s former campaign officials and making use of the campaign ’ s extensive email list of millions of supporters . Organizing for Action also stepped up its fundraising operation in the second quarter of this year , pulling in $ 8.2 million , compared with $ 4.9 million in the first quarter .
The organization has more than doubled its number of supporters since Jan. 1 , reaching 237,688 in the second quarter , up from about 110,000 at the end of the first quarter . Among its biggest donors in the second quarter were Fred Eychaner , president of the Chicago-based Newsweb Corp. , and David Shaw , co-founder of the New York investment firm D.E . Shaw . Each man donated $ 500,000 to Organizing for Action in the second quarter .
The organization is operating as a “ social welfare ” program within the meaning of Section 501c-4 of Internal Revenue Service code , although it has not applied for tax-exempt status .

“We’ll be calling out the climate deniers who are standing in the way of progress in Washington, and make sure the senators who hold the key votes on gun violence prevention hear from the people who sent them to Congress,” Mr. Carson said. “And we’ll be fighting attacks on a woman’s health choices wherever they pop up.”

It was the second time Mr. Obama has spoken to the group since it formed in January, led by some of the president’s former campaign officials and making use of the campaign’s extensive email list of millions of supporters. Organizing for Action also stepped up its fundraising operation in the second quarter of this year, pulling in $8.2 million, compared with $4.9 million in the first quarter.

The organization has more than doubled its number of supporters since Jan. 1, reaching 237,688 in the second quarter, up from about 110,000 at the end of the first quarter. Among its biggest donors in the second quarter were Fred Eychaner, president of the Chicago-based Newsweb Corp., and David Shaw, co-founder of the New York investment firm D.E. Shaw. Each man donated $500,000 to Organizing for Action in the second quarter.

The organization is operating as a “social welfare” program within the meaning of Section 501c-4 of Internal Revenue Service code, although it has not applied for tax-exempt status. Such groups are ostensibly to be nonpolitical, but the organization’s website says it was “established to support President Obama in achieving enactment of the national agenda Americans voted for on Election Day 2012.”

A national debate over the minimum wage

Democrats passed a bill this summer in the House of Representatives to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. As expected, the bill has not been taken up the Senate.

Nevertheless, a variety of states have passed legislation to gradually raise their state minimum wages. Connecticut will reach a $15 minimum wage by 2023. A few areas, notably New York City and the District of Columbia, are set to have $15-an-hour minimum wages in 2020.

A New York Times analysis of the effective national minimum wage — an average across all federal, state and local minimum wage laws — found a rate of $11.80 an hour in 2019. According to the Times, “this is probably the highest minimum wage in American history,” adjusted for inflation.

The Democratic case to business leaders for higher minimum wages increases boils down to this: it’s not going to be as bad as you think. As Rep. Bobby Scott, who led the effort for the House bill, put it in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Jessica Smith: “They'll have to adjust, but they're adjusting every year anyway.”

A key argument against raising to $15 is that it hurts the very people it’s trying to help. The National Restaurant Association opposed the House bill and — like many business groups — says their industry knows that “the wage hike is a job killer in their communities.”

The Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative group controlled by a public relations specialist for the restaurant industry, adds that “the majority of empirical research shows that a higher minimum wage reduces employment for the least-skilled while having little to no effect on poverty rates.”

economy_and_jobs,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/19/trump-predicts-economic-boom-as-final-tax-bill-heads-for-house-senate.html,"Trump predicts economic boom as final tax bill heads for House, Senate",2017-12-19,Brooke Singman,"President Trump on Tuesday predicted the already-humming U.S. economy is about to get a big boost , as the final version of the $ 1.5 trillion Republican tax bill heads to the floors of the House and the Senate .
“ Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size , ” Trump tweeted . “ Immediate expensing will have a big impact . Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed . Enjoy , and create many beautiful JOBS ! ”
The bill , which Trump hopes to have on his desk in a matter of hours in order to deliver a “ giant tax cut for Christmas , ” could pass Tuesday . It would mark the first major legislative win of Trump ’ s presidency .
“ It ’ s a huge deal , but not just for the White House . It ’ s a huge deal for America , ” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on “ Fox & Friends ” Tuesday morning , claiming middle-class Americans are “ going to see the benefit out of this tax package . ”
“ The fact that we have been pushing this tax cut package , this tax reform package – you ’ re really seeing that reflecting in our economy — our booming economy . Optimism is up , ” Sanders said .
As of Monday , Senate Republicans had garnered just enough support for the bill to pass – flipping both Sens . Susan Collins , R-Maine , and Mike Lee , R-Utah , to ‘ yes ’ votes .
“ The first major overhaul of our tax code since 1986 , this legislation will provide tax relief to working families , encourage the creation of jobs right here in America and spur economic growth that will benefit all Americans , ” Collins said on the Senate floor Monday .
Only one member of the Senate GOP is not yet on board – Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona , who said he was still “ looking at the bill , still reading the bill , still working on some other issues . ”
Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , will not be present for Tuesday ’ s vote , as he has returned to his home state for rehabilitation as he battles brain cancer .
Republicans will have to garner a simple majority of the 99 senators present for the vote .
On the House side , Republicans can only lose 22 votes to still approve the bill .
This week , a dozen Republican lawmakers switched from ‘ no ’ to ‘ yes ’ votes -- primarily from high-tax states like New York , New Jersey and California . Twelve of them voted against the House tax bill last month , which passed 227-205 , due to the $ 10,000 cap on the state and local property taxes . That cap , which is important to taxpayers in high-tax states , remains in the final bill .
Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y. , said he would vote ‘ no ’ on the final bill , saying his constituents were unsatisfied .
Democrats in both chambers , however , have a laundry list of criticisms over the bill , after the caucus was excluded from closed-door drafting sessions . Democrats continue to slam the legislation as favoring big corporations and wealthy Americans , and hurting middle-class Americans .
“ This is a president who has said many times before he is willing to work with Democrats , he wants to work with Democrats , ” Sanders said Tuesday , noting that Democratic Sens . Dick Durbin and Joe Manchin , among others , were at the White House Monday evening . “ This is a president that would be certainly happy to have their vote . ”
Sanders noted that “ more money for Americans in their pockets ” should not be something Democrats “ need to be begged to be a part of . ”
The final bill is a combination of elements from both the House and Senate bills that were recently passed . The bill cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent . The bill doubles the standard deduction used by about two-thirds of U.S. households , to $ 24,000 for married couples , which would sunset in eight years , along with tax cuts for individuals—both would expire in 2026 .
The bill also doubles the per-child tax credit from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per child , with up to $ 1,400 available in refunds for families who owe little or no taxes .
The legislation also repeals a paramount part of ObamaCare , removing the requirement that all Americans have health insurance , or face a penalty .
The bill would bring average initial tax cuts for Americans across all income lines , but by 2027 , it would boost average levies for everyone earning up to $ 75,000 . Nonpartisan congressional tax analysts , The Jointed Committee on Taxation , calculated that in 2019 , people earning $ 20,000 to $ 50,000 would see tax cuts averaging 10 percent or more . Those making $ 200,000 to $ 1 million would see reductions averaging slightly less .
But by 2023 , people making under $ 30,000 would see tax increases , while those earning more would see their tax cuts get smaller .
But Republican leaders brushed aside negative projections , and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , Rep. Kevin Brady , R-Texas , said “ that ’ s just cherry-picking the numbers . ”
“ People are excited about a stronger economy and bigger paychecks , ” Brady said .
The bill will hit the House floor first on Tuesday , with a vote expected Tuesday afternoon . The Senate will likely vote on the bill late Tuesday , into early Wednesday .","President Trump on Tuesday predicted the already-humming U.S. economy is about to get a big boost, as the final version of the $1.5 trillion Republican tax bill heads to the floors of the House and the Senate.

“Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size,” Trump tweeted. “Immediate expensing will have a big impact. Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed. Enjoy, and create many beautiful JOBS!”

The bill, which Trump hopes to have on his desk in a matter of hours in order to deliver a “giant tax cut for Christmas,” could pass Tuesday. It would mark the first major legislative win of Trump’s presidency.

“It’s a huge deal, but not just for the White House. It’s a huge deal for America,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on “Fox & Friends” Tuesday morning, claiming middle-class Americans are “going to see the benefit out of this tax package.”

“The fact that we have been pushing this tax cut package, this tax reform package – you’re really seeing that reflecting in our economy — our booming economy. Optimism is up,” Sanders said.

As of Monday, Senate Republicans had garnered just enough support for the bill to pass – flipping both Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, to ‘yes’ votes.

“The first major overhaul of our tax code since 1986, this legislation will provide tax relief to working families, encourage the creation of jobs right here in America and spur economic growth that will benefit all Americans,” Collins said on the Senate floor Monday.

Only one member of the Senate GOP is not yet on board – Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who said he was still “looking at the bill, still reading the bill, still working on some other issues.”

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., will not be present for Tuesday’s vote, as he has returned to his home state for rehabilitation as he battles brain cancer.

Republicans will have to garner a simple majority of the 99 senators present for the vote.

On the House side, Republicans can only lose 22 votes to still approve the bill.

This week, a dozen Republican lawmakers switched from ‘no’ to ‘yes’ votes -- primarily from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. Twelve of them voted against the House tax bill last month, which passed 227-205, due to the $10,000 cap on the state and local property taxes. That cap, which is important to taxpayers in high-tax states, remains in the final bill.

Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said he would vote ‘no’ on the final bill, saying his constituents were unsatisfied.

“It’s certainly unpopular in my district,” King said.

Democrats in both chambers, however, have a laundry list of criticisms over the bill, after the caucus was excluded from closed-door drafting sessions. Democrats continue to slam the legislation as favoring big corporations and wealthy Americans, and hurting middle-class Americans.

“This is a president who has said many times before he is willing to work with Democrats, he wants to work with Democrats,” Sanders said Tuesday, noting that Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin and Joe Manchin, among others, were at the White House Monday evening. “This is a president that would be certainly happy to have their vote.”

Sanders noted that “more money for Americans in their pockets” should not be something Democrats “need to be begged to be a part of.”

The final bill is a combination of elements from both the House and Senate bills that were recently passed. The bill cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The bill doubles the standard deduction used by about two-thirds of U.S. households, to $24,000 for married couples, which would sunset in eight years, along with tax cuts for individuals—both would expire in 2026.

The bill also doubles the per-child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child, with up to $1,400 available in refunds for families who owe little or no taxes.

The legislation also repeals a paramount part of ObamaCare, removing the requirement that all Americans have health insurance, or face a penalty.

The bill would bring average initial tax cuts for Americans across all income lines, but by 2027, it would boost average levies for everyone earning up to $75,000. Nonpartisan congressional tax analysts, The Jointed Committee on Taxation, calculated that in 2019, people earning $20,000 to $50,000 would see tax cuts averaging 10 percent or more. Those making $200,000 to $1 million would see reductions averaging slightly less.

But by 2023, people making under $30,000 would see tax increases, while those earning more would see their tax cuts get smaller.

But Republican leaders brushed aside negative projections, and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said “that’s just cherry-picking the numbers.”

“People are excited about a stronger economy and bigger paychecks,” Brady said.

The bill will hit the House floor first on Tuesday, with a vote expected Tuesday afternoon. The Senate will likely vote on the bill late Tuesday, into early Wednesday.

The chances of the Senate moving forward with legislation that would restore expired unemployment benefits dimmed Monday.

The bill’s fate hung in the balance all day as Democrats desperately sought Republican votes to advance the bill. In a sign of how seriously the White House is taking the issue, President Barack Obama personally worked the phone lines.

Story Continued Below

Obama spoke with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) about the need to extend the benefits. The White House also reached out to the office of Sen. Mark Kirk, but the senator said he wasn’t able to connect with Obama. The Illinois Republican said Obama’s outreach was evidence that the Senate Democrats don’t have the votes.

“He doesn’t normally like calling us,” Kirk said of Obama.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) abruptly decided to delay a procedural vote, which had been scheduled Monday evening, until 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday.

Democrats need five Republicans to join them to advance the legislation, which would bring back the benefits that expired on Dec. 28 and extend them for three months. So far, there are just two Republicans publicly committed to supporting the legislation as written: Collins and Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who co-sponsored the measure with Sen. Jack Reed.

The effort to attract Republicans appeared to falter as GOP lawmakers were nearly universal in their criticism of the bill for not covering the $6.5 billion cost of the extension.

Democrats are scrambling to win the vote on Tuesday but even if they fail, there’s a sense that they’ll win politically by painting Republicans as opposed to benefits for the long-term unemployed. Democrats have indicated they’ll bring the legislation back to the Senate floor repeatedly if it fails.

Still, there is at least some reason to be optimistic that lawmakers might later reach a consensus.

But he still wasn’t sure the bill would get across the finish line — and Democrats have warned they may force Republicans to reject their proposal more than once.

If you enjoy having a good argument , Friday 's report on the labor market gives you plenty to chew over . Find a debate partner and let 's get started .
First , these are the facts : The Labor Department data showed February was a good period for job creation . During the short , cold month , employers added 236,000 jobs — far more than the 160,000 most economists had been predicting . And the unemployment rate fell from January 's 7.9 percent to 7.7 percent — the lowest level since December 2008 .
OK , we have our facts . Now let 's start debating the five points that economists are mulling .
One Side : The White House noted that the employment numbers were collected before Feb. 16 . That was before Congress allowed dramatic , across-the-board budget cuts to launch on March 1 under the `` sequester '' process .
Liberals fear that as the federal spending cuts fully come into play this spring and summer , job growth will suffer . `` Unfortunately , the heavy-handed budget cuts forced by the sequester threaten serious harm to our economy and to our nation 's long-term unemployed workers , who are among the Americans who 'll feel these stupid and senseless cuts most deeply , '' said Christine Owens , head of the National Employment Law Project , which advocates for low-wage workers .
The Other Side : Conservatives say the sequester is reassuring businesses that this time , House Republicans will rein in federal debt and get government out of the way of the private sector .
House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , released a statement saying `` our spending-driven deficit threatens our economy , and responsible spending cuts are needed . ''
One Side : Finally , the unemployment rate for people without a diploma is dropping — down to 11.2 percent last month from January 's 12 percent . In February 2012 , that rate was 14.8 percent .
Some businesses argue that Congress should not derail the growth in low-wage jobs by raising the federal minimum wage from $ 7.25 an hour to $ 9 or more , as proposed by President Obama . `` For every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage , estimates show employment may fall as much as 6.6 percent for young black and Hispanic teens ages 16 to 19 , '' according to the Employment Policies Institute , which is backed by the restaurant industry .
The Other Side : Low-wage workers are concentrated in restaurant work and low-end retail . If those workers had more money to spend , they would buy more food , gasoline , clothes and other goods . That higher demand would stimulate the economy and lead to even more job creation , the argument goes . `` Every time we raise the minimum wage , employment goes up . The economy gets stronger , '' Sen. Tom Harkin , D-Iowa , said Tuesday as he unveiled his legislation to raise the wage .
One Side : The job market is weaker than we 'd like to believe because millions of Americans have given up on finding jobs . Last month , only 63.5 percent of adults were in the labor market , down from 63.6 in January , and from 63.9 in February 2012 , seasonally adjusted .
`` Most of the reduction in unemployment from its 10 percent peak in October 2009 has been accomplished through a significant drop in the percentage of adults working or looking for work , '' said Peter Morici , an economics professor at the University of Maryland . `` Were the participation rate the same as when President Obama took office , it would be about 10.9 percent . ''
The Other Side : The job market could turn out to be stronger than expected this year because housing is perking up so quickly . `` Construction stands out , adding 48,000 jobs , its best month in nearly six years , '' said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight .
One Side : Average hourly earnings rose 4 cents to $ 23.82 in February , up 2.1 percent from a year earlier . That 's more than the 1.6 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index over roughly the same time . With wages outpacing inflation , the outlook is bright for consumer spending .

A new CardHub study shows consumers ended 2012 with $ 36.2 billion in new debt , piled on top of the old bills .

Many analysts say things are looking up for stocks — corporate earnings are strong , borrowing costs are low , and consumer demand is perking up . This year , housing , autos , agriculture , banking , manufacturing and many other sectors are going to generate strong profits and send share prices even higher , they say .

If you enjoy having a good argument, Friday's report on the labor market gives you plenty to chew over. Find a debate partner and let's get started.

First, these are the facts: The Labor Department data showed February was a good period for job creation. During the short, cold month, employers added 236,000 jobs — far more than the 160,000 most economists had been predicting. And the unemployment rate fell from January's 7.9 percent to 7.7 percent — the lowest level since December 2008.

OK, we have our facts. Now let's start debating the five points that economists are mulling.

1. Across-The-Board Cuts Haven't Hit — Yet

One Side: The White House noted that the employment numbers were collected before Feb. 16. That was before Congress allowed dramatic, across-the-board budget cuts to launch on March 1 under the ""sequester"" process.

Liberals fear that as the federal spending cuts fully come into play this spring and summer, job growth will suffer. ""Unfortunately, the heavy-handed budget cuts forced by the sequester threaten serious harm to our economy and to our nation's long-term unemployed workers, who are among the Americans who'll feel these stupid and senseless cuts most deeply,"" said Christine Owens, head of the National Employment Law Project, which advocates for low-wage workers.

The Other Side: Conservatives say the sequester is reassuring businesses that this time, House Republicans will rein in federal debt and get government out of the way of the private sector.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, released a statement saying ""our spending-driven deficit threatens our economy, and responsible spending cuts are needed.""

2. High School Dropouts Are Doing Better

One Side: Finally, the unemployment rate for people without a diploma is dropping — down to 11.2 percent last month from January's 12 percent. In February 2012, that rate was 14.8 percent.

Some businesses argue that Congress should not derail the growth in low-wage jobs by raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $9 or more, as proposed by President Obama. ""For every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, estimates show employment may fall as much as 6.6 percent for young black and Hispanic teens ages 16 to 19,"" according to the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry.

The Other Side: Low-wage workers are concentrated in restaurant work and low-end retail. If those workers had more money to spend, they would buy more food, gasoline, clothes and other goods. That higher demand would stimulate the economy and lead to even more job creation, the argument goes. ""Every time we raise the minimum wage, employment goes up. The economy gets stronger,"" Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said Tuesday as he unveiled his legislation to raise the wage.

3. Fewer Are Looking For Work

One Side: The job market is weaker than we'd like to believe because millions of Americans have given up on finding jobs. Last month, only 63.5 percent of adults were in the labor market, down from 63.6 in January, and from 63.9 in February 2012, seasonally adjusted.

""Most of the reduction in unemployment from its 10 percent peak in October 2009 has been accomplished through a significant drop in the percentage of adults working or looking for work,"" said Peter Morici, an economics professor at the University of Maryland. ""Were the participation rate the same as when President Obama took office, it would be about 10.9 percent.""

The Other Side: The job market could turn out to be stronger than expected this year because housing is perking up so quickly. ""Construction stands out, adding 48,000 jobs, its best month in nearly six years,"" said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight.

4. Wages Are Growing

One Side: Average hourly earnings rose 4 cents to $23.82 in February, up 2.1 percent from a year earlier. That's more than the 1.6 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index over roughly the same time. With wages outpacing inflation, the outlook is bright for consumer spending.

The Other Side: Consumers are still overwhelmed by old debts, so it may be a long time before they can afford shopping sprees. ""We still haven't made the reversal in course necessary to start actually paying down what we owe,"" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, head of CardHub, a credit-card research site. A new CardHub study shows consumers ended 2012 with $36.2 billion in new debt, piled on top of the old bills.

5. Rising Jobs Bode Well For Stocks

One Side: After the jobs report was released Friday morning, stocks continued rising, with the Dow Jones industrial average setting new records.

Many analysts say things are looking up for stocks — corporate earnings are strong, borrowing costs are low, and consumer demand is perking up. This year, housing, autos, agriculture, banking, manufacturing and many other sectors are going to generate strong profits and send share prices even higher, they say.

The Other Side: The Federal Reserve has been keeping interest rates super low, making it easier for people to buy homes and cars and for businesses to expand. But if Fed policymakers see the economy improving too quickly, they could change course and start nudging up interest rates.

Payroll growth was disappointing for a second straight month in September as employers added 156,000 jobs, which raised questions about the health of an economy that was expected to perk up from a prolonged slump in the second half of the year.

The unemployment rate rose to 5% from 4.9%, the Labor Department said Friday, as a rise in employment was more than offset by a sharp increase in the labor force, or the number of Americans working and looking for jobs.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast 172,000 payroll gains.

Businesses added 167,000 jobs, led by professional and business services and health care. Federal, state and local governments cut 11,000.

Job gains for July and August were revised down by 7,000.

Average hourly wages rose 6 cents to $25.79 and are up 2.6% the past year, roughly in line with recent increases. Wage growth has picked up this year from the 2% pace that has marked much of the recovery but hasn't climbed as much as expected in light of the near-normal unemployment rate. The Fed seeks stronger earnings gains and inflation before raising interest rates again. The Fed has stood pat since lifting its key rate in December for the first time in nine years.

The tepid payroll increases ""won’t stop the Fed from hiking interest rates at the December ... meeting, but it should quell any speculation of a move at the November meeting,"" economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.

One reason wage growth was restrained is that the labor force increased by 444,000 as some discouraged workers on the sidelines resumed their job searches in a more vibrant labor market. That nudged up the labor force participation rate — the portion of adults working or looking for jobs — which has risen to 62.9% from 62.4% a year ago.

“It’s another bellwether of confidence,” Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in an interview. “People are participating because they can get jobs.”

Although the trend has kept the unemployment rate from falling this year and tempered pay increases, it’s helping heal a labor market that was badly bruised in the Great Recession. Last month, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said policymakers left interest rates unchanged, largely to encourage more economic activity and a return of discouraged workers to the labor force.

Other positives: The average workweek picked up to 34.4 hours from 34.3 hours, and employers added 23,000 temporary workers. When businesses increase the hours of employees and bring on more temps, they’re often inclined to ramp up permanent hiring in the months ahead.

The job market has been volatile this year. Unusually weak showings in the spring preceded blockbuster gains averaging more than 250,000 in June and July. A lackluster performance in August was at least partly blamed on Labor’s tendency to initially underestimate employment growth that month by an average 62,000 over the past five years, based on subsequent revisions.

Will schizophrenic job market show good side?

A similar but less pronounced pattern has plagued September. Labor’s count was revised up by an average 36,000 during the five-year period. Varying starts to the school year and the completion of summer jobs can affect seasonal adjustments for both months.

The September report is likely to be closely scrutinized by the Fed, which has indicated it plans to raise interest rates in coming months for the first time in 2016, assuming jobs and other data support the move.

Average monthly job growth has slowed to 178,000 this year from its booming 229,000 pace in 2015, but that could be a natural result of a low unemployment rate that supplies employers with a smaller pool of available workers. Some Fed policymakers have noted that only about 100,000 payroll gains a month are needed to bring down the jobless rate.

Here's why shifts in job market favor women

""Job openings are at record highs, yet you're not seeing job growth pick up,"" says David Berson, chief economist of Nationwide. ""Employers are having a difficult time finding what they consider to be qualified workers.""

Other economists have attributed the labor market’s subdued performance to factors such as a sluggish economy since late last year, the oil industry slump, weakness overseas and business uncertainty because of the presidential election.

Some recent data highlight an economy and labor market that remain on solid footing. A service sector activity report this week revealed the largest increase in hiring on record last month. And initial jobless claims, a gauge of layoffs, remain near pre-recession lows.

The inequality bed-wetters are misleading you.

The inequality police are worried that we are living in a new Gilded Age. We should be so lucky: Between 1880 and 1890, the number of employed Americans increased by more than 13 percent, and wages increased by almost 50 percent. I am going to go out on a limb and predict that the Barack Obama years will not match that record; the share of employed Americans is lower today than it was when he took office, and household income is down. Grover Cleveland is looking like a genius in comparison.

The inequality-based critique of the American economy is a fundamentally dishonest one, for a half a dozen or so reasons at least. Claims that the (wicked, wicked) “1 percent” saw their incomes go up by such and such an amount over the past decade or two ignore the fact that different people compose the 1 percent every year, and that 75 percent of the super-rich households in 1995 were in a lower income group by 2005. “The 3 million highest-paying jobs in America paid a lot more in 2005 than did the 3 million highest-paying jobs in 1995” is a very different and considerably less dramatic claim than “The top 1 percent of earners in 1995 saw their household incomes go up radically by 2005.” But the former claim is true and the latter is not.

Paul Krugman, who persists in Dickensian poverty, barely making ends meet between six-figure sinecures, is a particularly energetic scourge of the rich, and he is worried about conspicuous consumption: “For many of the rich, flaunting is what it’s all about. Living in a 30,000 square foot house isn’t much nicer than living in a 5,000 square foot house; there are, I believe, people who can really appreciate a $350 bottle of wine, but most of the people buying such things wouldn’t notice if you substituted a $20 bottle, or maybe even a Trader Joe’s special.” In an earlier piece on the same theme, he urged higher taxes as a way to help the rich toward virtue: “While chiding the rich for their vulgarity may not be as offensive as lecturing the poor on their moral failings, it’s just as futile. Human nature being what it is, it’s silly to expect humility from a highly privileged elite. So if you think our society needs more humility, you should support policies that would reduce the elite’s privileges.” That is, seize their money before they order the 1982 Margaux.

Further, if your assumption here is that this is about redistribution, then you should want the billionaires’ incomes to go up, not down: The more money they make, the more taxes they pay, and the more money you have to give to the people you want to give money to, e.g., overpaid, lazy, porn-addicted bureaucrats. Maybe you think that the tax rates on the rich are too low, especially given that the very rich tend to have income taxed at the capital-gains rate rather than at the much higher income-tax rate.

What Paul Krugman et al. should do rather than fret about the rich and their conspicuous consumption is take the advice of a superior economist, the one who suggested that we should “focus on the stagnation of real wages and the disappearance of jobs offering middle-class incomes, as well as the constant insecurity that comes with not having reliable jobs or assets.” That’s not advice for a rich-are-too-rich problem, it’s advice for a poor-are-too-poor problem. And those are not the same problem.

That those words were Professor Krugman’s own makes it all the more puzzling that he fails to follow where they lead. The late 19th century saw substantial improvements in the standard of living for average working people in the United States. The early 21st century, not so much. This Gilded Age has a lot of catching up to do before it is anything near as successful as the last one.

Still , President Obama will face voters with the highest unemployment rate of any incumbent since Franklin Roosevelt . The rate rose in October because more people began seeking work and were counted as unemployed . The government counts people without jobs as unemployed only if they ’ re looking for one .
Most sectors of the economy outside manufacturing posted healthy growth , and job gains were particularly strong in the traditional leading sectors in the U.S. : health care , retailing , and business services . Manufacturing has been in a slump due to lower export sales to Europe and Asia and the weakening global economy .
“ It ’ s a very favorable report , strong in most areas , ” said Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at Miller , Tabak & Co .
The report showed that the soft spell the economy experienced during the summer has rebounded , with job growth now exceeding this year ’ s average of 153,000 a month . Even employment in construction — the hardest hit occupation in the wake of the housing crisis — posted robust growth of 17,000 jobs during October .
“ The U.S. economy has left the summer doldrums behind , ” said Harm Bandholz , economist at Unicredit Markets . He noted that the better-than-expected growth in jobs in recent months likely is the source of increasing optimism seen in consumer confidence reports , which have soared to four-year highs recently .
The small increase in the unemployment rate to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent had been widely expected as the dramatic drop reported in September from 8.1 percent had looked “ too good to be true ” to most economists .
Economists said the report was a small plus for Mr. Obama in his extremely tight race with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney .
“ Obviously , these are positive numbers , ” said Fabian Eliasson , vice president at Mizuho Corporate Bank . “ It ’ s favorable for the current administration ahead of the election . ”
Heidi Shierholz , analyst at the Economic Policy Institute , noted that the department ’ s two surveys of households and businesses were in agreement last month on the strengthening in the economy after several months of divergence . Households reported a robust increase in employment of 410,000 in October — more than twice the increase reported by businesses . That could indicate that more people became self-employed or were working as contractors .
Unemployment has dropped significantly from the 10 percent high seen in October 2009 , exactly three years ago , Ms. Shierholz noted , “ but it still has a long way to go to get back to full employment . ”

Tax bills , road projects , agriculture spending — they ’ ve all become “ jobs ” bills .
In the 18 months since the 112th Congress first met , about 90 bills that promise to create or preserve jobs have been introduced — about three times the previous two-year congressional cycle and seven times more than the Congress before that .
With the Labor Department reporting Friday that employers nationwide added only 80,000 jobs in June for an unemployment rate unchanged at 8.2 percent , expect that list to grow before the next Congress convenes in January .
“ Today ’ s report is further evidence that Congress should be focusing on creating jobs and helping the middle class , not re-fighting old battles for political gain , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , said Friday .
Mr. Reid said the Senate this week will move toward votes on a series of “ common-sense jobs bills ” that include a small-business tax cut designed to reward hiring and provide incentives for payroll growth .
“ Putting Americans back to work should be our top priority , not tea party politics or partisan maneuvering , ” the majority leader said .
But job-creation policies , like most everything else on Capitol Hill , rarely are devoid of partisan and political spin . And just what constitutes a “ jobs bill ” often is in the eye of the beholder , as Republicans characterized the employment report as proof that the jobs agenda of the Obama administration and the Democrat-controlled Congress has been a bust .
“ Today ’ s report shows the private sector clearly isn ’ t ‘ doing fine ’ and that President Obama ’ s policies have failed , ” said House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican . “ The president needs to stop betting on his failed policies and start working with Republicans to remove government obstacles to job creation . ”
Republicans who control the House chronically note that Mr. Reid has failed to act on more than two dozen of their “ jobs ” bills that passed their chamber . Mr. Boehner frequently holds up a card at news conferences embossed with the list to highlight his argument .
House GOP leaders say they will introduce their own legislation this summer to “ rein in job-crushing red tape , ” including a measure to continue tax cuts instituted during the administration of President George W. Bush that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year .
Some of the so-called “ jobs ” bills seem a bit of a stretch .
For example : The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act , which doesn ’ t specifically mention jobs , would require the Interior and Agriculture departments “ to more efficiently develop domestic sources of the minerals and mineral materials of strategic and critical importance to United States economic and national security and manufacturing competitiveness . ”
But in a Friday news release titled “ House to Consider Another Job Creating Bill Next Week , ” House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings , Washington Republican , said the measure will streamline government red tape in mining and related industries — thus fostering job growth .
The Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act , which the House passed but is indefinitely stalled in the Senate , also is labeled as a jobs bill by House GOP leadership . The bill would exempt “ farm dust ” from falling under Clean Air Act regulations , a move that the bill ’ s backers say would protect American farm jobs .
A massive bill that cleared Congress last month to fund federal transportation projects was a rare example of legislation claimed by both parties to boost job growth .
“ This is the jobs bill for the 112th Congress , ” said House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John L. Mica , Florida Republican . Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , Montana Democrat , called the measure — which promises to save or create almost 3 million jobs — an important “ investment in good-paying American jobs . ”
But the “ highway bill ” almost was derailed when House GOP leaders initially insisted it include a provision for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would carry oil from the tar sands of the Canadian province Alberta to Nebraska and eventually the Gulf Coast . Republicans gave in to Democratic demands to leave the pipeline out of the bill .
Keystone highlighted a frequent debate regarding so-called jobs bills : just how many jobs would be preserved or created . GOP backers often put the number at tens of thousands , a figure dismissed by opponents as excessively optimistic .
While lawmakers consider just about any legislation they like a jobs bill , they also are quick to tag measures they loathe as job killers . Enter President Obama ’ s health care law , which Republicans say will force employers to lay off workers or close up shop altogether .
Rep. Michele Bachmann , Minnesota Republican and former presidential candidate , told CNN in late June that the “ No . 1 reason [ small businesses ] aren ’ t hiring is because of Obamacare . ”
“ Without a shadow of a doubt , millions of jobs are going to now leave America ” because of the health care law , she said .
Mr. Boehner has scheduled a mostly symbolic vote this week to repeal the health care law “ as part of Republicans ’ focus on removing government barriers to private-sector job creation . ”

Obama repeatedly invokes tax fairness as a major campaign issue , returning over and over to the phrase `` fair share , '' as he did on June 22 when he talked about a policy `` that asks the wealthiest Americans to help pay down our deficit , to do their fair share . ''
At a May 14 campaign stop , he used similar language , saying the idea is to make `` sure that everybody is paying their fair share . ''
`` You got the top 2 percent paying almost half of all income taxes . Is that fair ? '' Sen. Jon Kyl , R-Ariz .
Kyl was referring to official figures showing how much various income levels earn of the nation 's total income compared to how much they pay of the nation 's total income taxes .
IRS figures show the top 1 percent of earners take home 16.9 percent of the nation 's total income , but pay 36.7 percent of the nation 's income taxes .
The top 5 percent take home a little more than 31 percent of total income but pay almost 59 percent of all income taxes .
And the top 10 percent earn just over 43 percent of the total income but pay more than 70 percent of all income taxes .
`` How are you going to make it fairer ? If they pay 75 percent ? , '' asks Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute . `` If they pay 90 percent ? If they pay all of it ? Will that finally be fair ? ''
As it now stands , 90 percent of all Americans pay only 30 percent of all income taxes .
`` If we want an income tax system that is fair according to the Obama administration 's own standards , we already have it , '' Sen. Kyl says . `` The argument that top-tier earners are not doing enough just does not hold water . ''
However , advocates of higher rates for the wealthiest Americas typically argue that it is much easier for those top earners to pay more in taxes , as compared to lower-income Americans who have much less discretionary income .
The president does not mention another factor in the fairness equation -- close to half of American workers pay no federal income taxes at all .
`` That 's extremely progressive , '' says Arthur Brooks . `` That 's more progressive than our European friends , as a matter of fact . ''
And Kyl notes , `` people who do not share in the sacrifice of paying taxes have little direct incentive to care whether the government is spending and taxing too much . ''
The administration often points to the ultra wealthy who sometimes pay lower rates because they have a lot of deductions . But the averages for all groups paint a more accurate picture .
The top 1 percent , for instance , pay an average tax rate of more than 24 percent . The top 5 percent -- a tax rate of a little more than 20 percent . The top 10 percent -- about 18 percent .
For the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers , the average rate is 1.85 percent .
Though fairness is one of the president 's favorite themes , polls suggest voters are not that receptive .
A Democratic think tank polled independents in 12 battleground states and found the president 's fairness message does not resonate .
`` They do n't see themselves as victims in the system , so about 60 percent of them say our system is basically fair , '' explains Lanae Erickson Hatalsky of the Democratic think tank Third Way . `` When you ask them how to grow an economy , they did n't talk about fairness . They talked about opportunity . ''
`` When the president of the United States or any politician basically equates spreading the wealth around with fairness , that 's fundamentally at odds with what most Americans think fairness means . ''
Even Democrats who agree the system is progressive , though , still argue taxes on the wealthy may have to go up .
`` We have a country that 's aging . We have deficit problems going forward , '' says Chuck Marr of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities . `` And so in the coming years there 's going to be pressure to sort of bring these taxes off the bottom where they are now . ''
Nevertheless , few dispute the tax system is progressive , or that the wealthy pay what many see as a fair share .
In fact , one recent poll by the newspaper The Hill asked people what the maximum tax rate should be , and 75 percent of them said 30 percent or below . That 30 percent is higher than the 24 percent the top 1 percent is actually paying . But the current top tax bracket carries a 35 percent rate , and the president wants to raise that to almost 40 .","President Obama has elevated one question to a key campaign issue -- what is a ""fair share"" of taxes?

Obama repeatedly invokes tax fairness as a major campaign issue, returning over and over to the phrase ""fair share,"" as he did on June 22 when he talked about a policy ""that asks the wealthiest Americans to help pay down our deficit, to do their fair share.""

At a May 14 campaign stop, he used similar language, saying the idea is to make ""sure that everybody is paying their fair share.""

Republicans, however, question the premise.

The top 5 percent take home a little more than 31 percent of total income but pay almost 59 percent of all income taxes.

And the top 10 percent earn just over 43 percent of the total income but pay more than 70 percent of all income taxes.

""How are you going to make it fairer? If they pay 75 percent?,"" asks Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute. ""If they pay 90 percent? If they pay all of it? Will that finally be fair?""

As it now stands, 90 percent of all Americans pay only 30 percent of all income taxes.

""If we want an income tax system that is fair according to the Obama administration's own standards, we already have it,"" Sen. Kyl says. ""The argument that top-tier earners are not doing enough just does not hold water.""

However, advocates of higher rates for the wealthiest Americas typically argue that it is much easier for those top earners to pay more in taxes, as compared to lower-income Americans who have much less discretionary income.

The president does not mention another factor in the fairness equation -- close to half of American workers pay no federal income taxes at all.

""That's extremely progressive,"" says Arthur Brooks. ""That's more progressive than our European friends, as a matter of fact.""

And Kyl notes, ""people who do not share in the sacrifice of paying taxes have little direct incentive to care whether the government is spending and taxing too much.""

The administration often points to the ultra wealthy who sometimes pay lower rates because they have a lot of deductions. But the averages for all groups paint a more accurate picture.

The top 1 percent, for instance, pay an average tax rate of more than 24 percent. The top 5 percent -- a tax rate of a little more than 20 percent. The top 10 percent -- about 18 percent.

For the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers, the average rate is 1.85 percent.

Though fairness is one of the president's favorite themes, polls suggest voters are not that receptive.

A Democratic think tank polled independents in 12 battleground states and found the president's fairness message does not resonate.

""They don't see themselves as victims in the system, so about 60 percent of them say our system is basically fair,"" explains Lanae Erickson Hatalsky of the Democratic think tank Third Way. ""When you ask them how to grow an economy, they didn't talk about fairness. They talked about opportunity.""

""When the president of the United States or any politician basically equates spreading the wealth around with fairness, that's fundamentally at odds with what most Americans think fairness means.""

Even Democrats who agree the system is progressive, though, still argue taxes on the wealthy may have to go up.

""We have a country that's aging. We have deficit problems going forward,"" says Chuck Marr of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. ""And so in the coming years there's going to be pressure to sort of bring these taxes off the bottom where they are now.""

Nevertheless, few dispute the tax system is progressive, or that the wealthy pay what many see as a fair share.

In fact, one recent poll by the newspaper The Hill asked people what the maximum tax rate should be, and 75 percent of them said 30 percent or below. That 30 percent is higher than the 24 percent the top 1 percent is actually paying. But the current top tax bracket carries a 35 percent rate, and the president wants to raise that to almost 40.",www.foxnews.com,right,o38YQc2lDCOKZ3HB

NEW YORK - Welcome to the good-news-could-be-bad-news economy.

Friday’s Labor Department report showing a better-than-expected gain of 195,000 jobs in June was a heartening sign for many that the economic recovery continues to move ahead at a modest pace. But it could ultimately turn out to be bad news, especially for Democrats, because it means that the Federal Reserve might start winding down its extraordinary efforts to boost the economy later this year.

And if the Fed takes the juice away too soon it could tank the stock market, crush housing prices, snuff out the four-year-old economic recovery, and make life exceedingly difficult for any Democrat who hopes to run in 2016 for what will essentially be President Barack Obama’s third-term.

To an unprecedented extent in recent years, the Fed has become the focal of point of U.S. economic policy. The central bank under Bernanke filled in for a polarized political process in Washington whose main recent contributions include a downgrade of the nation’s credit rating in 2011 and a crudely designed set of spending cuts this year.

To fill the breach, Bernanke has kept the Fed’s target for short-term interest rates at effectively zero and exploded the bank’s balance sheet by buying up huge amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage debt. The effect has been to boost home and auto spending, which in turn is driving much of the economic recovery, such as it is. The traditional drivers of stronger long-term growth, including business investment and higher wages, are largely absent. Friday’s jobs report showed wages rising 10 cents to $24.01. Over the year, hourly earnings are up 2.2 percent, not the kind of growth likely to survive higher interest rates.

And the jobs being created are not the kind of high-wage positions that tend to drive a robust economy. The leisure, hospitality and retail industries added 112,000 of all the jobs created in June. Professional and business services added just 53,000. The average workweek was unchanged at 34.5 hours, suggesting employers do not see much need to try and boost production. The number of workers who want full-time jobs but were only employed part time surged by 322,000 to 8.2 million, a figure some attributed to employers declining hire workers full-time in order to avoid the mandate to provide coverage under President Barack Obama’s health reform law. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.6 percent.

Despite all this, the Fed still appears to be planning to start winding down its asset purchases as soon as September, a precursor to eventually increasing interest rates, on the theory that economy will soon be able to stand on its own.

If the Fed gets it wrong and pulls the plug too quickly, economists say it could send interest rates soaring and tip the economy back into recession. That in turn could rob Democrats of one of the advantages they have in the 2014 midterms and make the environment much less hospitable to Hillary Clinton or any other Democrat who hopes to succeed Obama in 2016.",www.politico.com,left,XWcdtzmuFiLz46Ps

Erin Bradford still hasn ’ t been able to file for unemployment insurance — more than a month after she first started trying .
Bradford , an actress in New York City who worked multiple jobs to support her acting career , turned to New York state ’ s unemployment office to file a claim for benefits when she lost her steady work on March 14 . It has been a frustrating and opaque process for her , to say the least .
“ I have easily called an average of 100 times a day since I began the process , ” Bradford told me in an email . “ It feels like it ’ s the early 2000s and you are calling into a radio station . Most mornings I wake up early so that I can be one of the first people to call in , but apparently a lot of people have had the same idea . ”
Bradford is one of an estimated 1.2 million people in New York — and more than 22 million people nationwide — who suddenly found themselves out of work in the past several weeks and have been trying to access unemployment insurance as the coronavirus continued spreading across the United States . The staggering fallout of an economic crisis on par with the Great Depression has hit certain sectors of the economy , like restaurants , small businesses , and retail , especially hard .
The recently passed CARES Act expanded unemployment insurance eligibility , meaning most people who have been laid off will qualify for an additional $ 600 a week from the federal government . The bill also established a new program — called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance ( PUA ) — that provides benefits for freelancers , gig economy workers , independent contractors , and self-employed individuals who previously were not eligible . The expanded benefits will continue until July , and members of Congress are already looking at options to extend it .
But the rollout of these benefits has been rocky and uneven . Some states , like Ohio , won ’ t even start accepting PUA applications until mid-May ( retroactive pay was written into the law , so people who are unable to file until then won ’ t lose out on their full benefits ) .
The unemployment insurance fiasco is a perfect storm : a massive , crippling recession meeting many state programs that were underfunded and out of date to begin with . Programs in states like Florida — where former Gov . Rick Scott purposely designed the online system to make it hard for people to access , the Washington Post reported — have made it even more difficult for people to get help when they need it most .
Current Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that just 4 percent of people who have applied in Florida have so far received unemployment benefits — that ’ s 33,623 people out of more than 850,000 applicants .
“ These benefits are layered on top of a system that works well in some states and works terribly in others , ” said Michele Evermore , a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project . “ When a recession rolls around , how are people surprised that it ’ s hard to get benefits ? ”
Where you live can determine how soon you get your unemployment insurance benefits
Unemployment insurance benefits vary by state , but the amount you receive is not the only factor that depends on where you live . The process to get the money is faster in some states than others .
███ was contacted by a recently laid-off worker named AJ in Florida , who said he and his wife were trying to access Florida ’ s online unemployment system with very little success .
“ My wife and I try to apply for unemployment and the website does not load . The phone system also does not work , ” he said . “ There is no alternative , we just keep going in circles . We feel abandoned on all levels . ”
It ’ s a completely different story in Washington state , where Stevie Hanna got the news she would be laid off from her job at a market research company on April 1 , “ which is not the day to fire people , ” she added .
It was a stressful time ; Hanna had moved to Washington for her job and had lived there only about four months . With some confusion about whether her work history made her eligible for benefits in Washington or in her former state of Michigan , it took about a week for Washington ’ s Employment Security Department to process her claim .
“ Today everything is good , but it was touch and go for a week , ” Hanna told me in a phone interview . “ But at this point I ’ m impressed that they were able to get me through the system in a few weeks . ... I have no idea how I got that lucky . I do feel very fortunate that I am in Washington . ”
Brigit Stadler , a self-employed lifestyle and documentary photographer , also lives in Washington state . Her work is seasonal , and when the coronavirus hit , she had to cancel the cherry blossom photo shoots she had planned for this spring in Seattle . Because Stadler owns her own business , she couldn ’ t just apply for traditional UI right off the bat ; she had to wait for Washington to set up its Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program .
“ I know others in other states are having a lot of difficulties filing , so I ’ ve basically just been checking for updates so as to not add to an already overloaded system , ” Stadler told me . “ I ’ ll be applying for benefits on Monday now that they ’ ve given us a firm date for when the system will be able to handle those of us who are self-employed . ”
Stadler recognizes she ’ s one of the lucky ones ; her husband is still employed and able to help support her and their two sons . But she was just starting to turn a profit with her business , and the loss of her photography income has been a blow to her efforts to pay down student loans and have extra income to help pay for the cost of living in Seattle .
“ While we ’ re in a very privileged position , the lost income isn ’ t insignificant , as Seattle is still a very expensive place , ” she said .
In more ways than one , Washington seems to be ahead of the curve with its response to the coronavirus . Not only have cases and deaths fallen in a state that was considered an initial hot spot in the US , but Washington also announced that its expanded unemployment insurance benefits — including the PUA program for freelancers — was scheduled to be up and running by April 18 . That was a lot sooner than some other states .
In New York City , submitting her online application was just the first step for Bradford . Because she worked multiple part-time jobs , she had to call the unemployment office and speak to a representative over the phone to complete the process . Then the hard part began .
Bradford told me that each time she called , she got one of three responses : one telling her that her call couldn ’ t be completed as dialed , one automated message that all lines were busy , and finally , another automated reply that asked questions about her claim ( which she answered using her phone ’ s keypad ) , collected her Social Security number , and transferred her to a representative . But unless someone is available at that exact moment , callers are disconnected and have to start the process over again , Bradford said .
“ As someone who works in entertainment , I have many , many friends going through this process , and [ I ] can count on one hand the amount of people I know who have been able to get through the phone lines , ” she added . Bradford got so frustrated that she called Gov . Andrew Cuomo ’ s office directly .
The last Bradford had heard , New York had redone its website and was no longer asking applicants to call ; instead , people would be contacted directly . As of April 17 — a month after she first applied — she hadn ’ t yet received a call .
“ I will be okay for the next month or so , but if this lasts into the summer , that will no longer be the case and my savings will essentially be depleted , ” Bradford told me . “ It has made me more cautious with my spending , and even when things go back to normal , I and many many others will have to recover from this lost income . ”
Many states had underfunded unemployment insurance systems before the coronavirus hit
Congress passing expanded unemployment benefits was just the first step . The process of actually getting that money into the bank accounts of people who need it is much harder .
States first have to wait for the Trump administration to issue guidance so they know they ’ re administering a benefit correctly . Then they have to set up their own policies and interpret them to decide who qualifies , Evermore said . Finally , states have to program the computers in their unemployment systems with the new information — and some states rely on mainframes and programming that haven ’ t been updated since the 1970s .
“ The key aspects of UI were weak going into this , ” said Andy Stettner , a senior fellow at the Century Foundation . “ The IT infrastructure was weak ; most states hadn ’ t gotten off of these ancient mainframes . The concern is , they ’ ve never done anything with this type of volume . ”
A recent report by The Verge ’ s Makena Kelly found that at least 12 states use a decades-old coding language called COBOL in their UI offices , which means specific programmers who know how to use the language are needed to run it . With so many laid-off workers trying to access benefits at once , the old code on some of these systems is crashing websites and leading to other problems .
“ There is no alternative , we just keep going in circles . We feel abandoned on all levels . ”
The process is more straightforward for people who have been laid off from an employer and are eligible for regular UI , but it ’ s very complicated for freelancers and others who are waiting for PUA programs to be ready for applicants . Washington state , as previously mentioned , is seemingly ahead of the curve , with a goal of getting its PUA program up and running by April 18 . After setting an initial date of April 30 , Massachusetts announced it would start accepting PUA applications this week . Officials in Pennsylvania said freelancers and gig workers could start applying by the end of the month .
But other states , including Ohio , are already looking at a May timeline before they can get their PUA programs ready to accept applications , and others haven ’ t released timelines . New York and Michigan , for instance , are asking people to submit PUA claims but are holding on to them until their programs are up and running .
There ’ s consensus in Congress that another relief bill is needed , and Democrats have been talking about either extending the extra $ 600 a week in federal aid or adding more weeks before an individual would be kicked off regular UI benefits ( without the extra $ 600 per week ) , according to a senior Democratic aide .
But the problems that currently exist have led unemployment experts like Stettner and Evermore to say that Congress also needs to fund the system itself by helping states add more employees and get better technology to help connect people to the benefits they so badly need .
“ It ’ s really not a sexy item to fund UI administration , ” Evermore said , noting it ’ s an issue that has to compete against other demands , like education funding and cancer research . “ The only times any improvements have ever happened with UI has been because a recession exposed holes in the coverage . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told ███ that she recognizes the need , but also admitted it could take weeks before Congress is able to appropriate the money . ( Congress is not set to return to Capitol Hill until May 4 at the earliest . )
“ The states need resources in order to administer the UI , ” Pelosi said . “ Some are much better prepared than others or just have a different timetable . So one of the things we may have to do is get more resources to the state agencies that do this . ”
In the meantime , the holes in the system are being blown wide open with a mammoth recession .

Bradford, an actress in New York City who worked multiple jobs to support her acting career, turned to New York state’s unemployment office to file a claim for benefits when she lost her steady work on March 14. It has been a frustrating and opaque process for her, to say the least.

“I have easily called an average of 100 times a day since I began the process,” Bradford told me in an email. “It feels like it’s the early 2000s and you are calling into a radio station. Most mornings I wake up early so that I can be one of the first people to call in, but apparently a lot of people have had the same idea.”

Bradford is one of an estimated 1.2 million people in New York — and more than 22 million people nationwide — who suddenly found themselves out of work in the past several weeks and have been trying to access unemployment insurance as the coronavirus continued spreading across the United States. The staggering fallout of an economic crisis on par with the Great Depression has hit certain sectors of the economy, like restaurants, small businesses, and retail, especially hard.

The recently passed CARES Act expanded unemployment insurance eligibility, meaning most people who have been laid off will qualify for an additional $600 a week from the federal government. The bill also established a new program — called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) — that provides benefits for freelancers, gig economy workers, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals who previously were not eligible. The expanded benefits will continue until July, and members of Congress are already looking at options to extend it.

But the rollout of these benefits has been rocky and uneven. Some states, like Ohio, won’t even start accepting PUA applications until mid-May (retroactive pay was written into the law, so people who are unable to file until then won’t lose out on their full benefits).

The unemployment insurance fiasco is a perfect storm: a massive, crippling recession meeting many state programs that were underfunded and out of date to begin with. Programs in states like Florida — where former Gov. Rick Scott purposely designed the online system to make it hard for people to access, the Washington Post reported — have made it even more difficult for people to get help when they need it most.

Current Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that just 4 percent of people who have applied in Florida have so far received unemployment benefits — that’s 33,623 people out of more than 850,000 applicants.

“These benefits are layered on top of a system that works well in some states and works terribly in others,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. “When a recession rolls around, how are people surprised that it’s hard to get benefits?”

Where you live can determine how soon you get your unemployment insurance benefits

Unemployment insurance benefits vary by state, but the amount you receive is not the only factor that depends on where you live. The process to get the money is faster in some states than others.

Vox was contacted by a recently laid-off worker named AJ in Florida, who said he and his wife were trying to access Florida’s online unemployment system with very little success.

“My wife and I try to apply for unemployment and the website does not load. The phone system also does not work,” he said. “There is no alternative, we just keep going in circles. We feel abandoned on all levels.”

It’s a completely different story in Washington state, where Stevie Hanna got the news she would be laid off from her job at a market research company on April 1, “which is not the day to fire people,” she added.

It was a stressful time; Hanna had moved to Washington for her job and had lived there only about four months. With some confusion about whether her work history made her eligible for benefits in Washington or in her former state of Michigan, it took about a week for Washington’s Employment Security Department to process her claim.

“Today everything is good, but it was touch and go for a week,” Hanna told me in a phone interview. “But at this point I’m impressed that they were able to get me through the system in a few weeks. ... I have no idea how I got that lucky. I do feel very fortunate that I am in Washington.”

Brigit Stadler, a self-employed lifestyle and documentary photographer, also lives in Washington state. Her work is seasonal, and when the coronavirus hit, she had to cancel the cherry blossom photo shoots she had planned for this spring in Seattle. Because Stadler owns her own business, she couldn’t just apply for traditional UI right off the bat; she had to wait for Washington to set up its Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.

“I know others in other states are having a lot of difficulties filing, so I’ve basically just been checking for updates so as to not add to an already overloaded system,” Stadler told me. “I’ll be applying for benefits on Monday now that they’ve given us a firm date for when the system will be able to handle those of us who are self-employed.”

Stadler recognizes she’s one of the lucky ones; her husband is still employed and able to help support her and their two sons. But she was just starting to turn a profit with her business, and the loss of her photography income has been a blow to her efforts to pay down student loans and have extra income to help pay for the cost of living in Seattle.

“While we’re in a very privileged position, the lost income isn’t insignificant, as Seattle is still a very expensive place,” she said.

In more ways than one, Washington seems to be ahead of the curve with its response to the coronavirus. Not only have cases and deaths fallen in a state that was considered an initial hot spot in the US, but Washington also announced that its expanded unemployment insurance benefits — including the PUA program for freelancers — was scheduled to be up and running by April 18. That was a lot sooner than some other states.

In New York City, submitting her online application was just the first step for Bradford. Because she worked multiple part-time jobs, she had to call the unemployment office and speak to a representative over the phone to complete the process. Then the hard part began.

Bradford told me that each time she called, she got one of three responses: one telling her that her call couldn’t be completed as dialed, one automated message that all lines were busy, and finally, another automated reply that asked questions about her claim (which she answered using her phone’s keypad), collected her Social Security number, and transferred her to a representative. But unless someone is available at that exact moment, callers are disconnected and have to start the process over again, Bradford said.

“As someone who works in entertainment, I have many, many friends going through this process, and [I] can count on one hand the amount of people I know who have been able to get through the phone lines,” she added. Bradford got so frustrated that she called Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office directly.

The last Bradford had heard, New York had redone its website and was no longer asking applicants to call; instead, people would be contacted directly. As of April 17 — a month after she first applied — she hadn’t yet received a call.

“I will be okay for the next month or so, but if this lasts into the summer, that will no longer be the case and my savings will essentially be depleted,” Bradford told me. “It has made me more cautious with my spending, and even when things go back to normal, I and many many others will have to recover from this lost income.”

Many states had underfunded unemployment insurance systems before the coronavirus hit

Congress passing expanded unemployment benefits was just the first step. The process of actually getting that money into the bank accounts of people who need it is much harder.

States first have to wait for the Trump administration to issue guidance so they know they’re administering a benefit correctly. Then they have to set up their own policies and interpret them to decide who qualifies, Evermore said. Finally, states have to program the computers in their unemployment systems with the new information — and some states rely on mainframes and programming that haven’t been updated since the 1970s.

“The key aspects of UI were weak going into this,” said Andy Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. “The IT infrastructure was weak; most states hadn’t gotten off of these ancient mainframes. The concern is, they’ve never done anything with this type of volume.”

A recent report by The Verge’s Makena Kelly found that at least 12 states use a decades-old coding language called COBOL in their UI offices, which means specific programmers who know how to use the language are needed to run it. With so many laid-off workers trying to access benefits at once, the old code on some of these systems is crashing websites and leading to other problems.

“There is no alternative, we just keep going in circles. We feel abandoned on all levels.”

The process is more straightforward for people who have been laid off from an employer and are eligible for regular UI, but it’s very complicated for freelancers and others who are waiting for PUA programs to be ready for applicants. Washington state, as previously mentioned, is seemingly ahead of the curve, with a goal of getting its PUA program up and running by April 18. After setting an initial date of April 30, Massachusetts announced it would start accepting PUA applications this week. Officials in Pennsylvania said freelancers and gig workers could start applying by the end of the month.

But other states, including Ohio, are already looking at a May timeline before they can get their PUA programs ready to accept applications, and others haven’t released timelines. New York and Michigan, for instance, are asking people to submit PUA claims but are holding on to them until their programs are up and running.

There’s consensus in Congress that another relief bill is needed, and Democrats have been talking about either extending the extra $600 a week in federal aid or adding more weeks before an individual would be kicked off regular UI benefits (without the extra $600 per week), according to a senior Democratic aide.

But the problems that currently exist have led unemployment experts like Stettner and Evermore to say that Congress also needs to fund the system itself by helping states add more employees and get better technology to help connect people to the benefits they so badly need.

“It’s really not a sexy item to fund UI administration,” Evermore said, noting it’s an issue that has to compete against other demands, like education funding and cancer research. “The only times any improvements have ever happened with UI has been because a recession exposed holes in the coverage.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told Vox that she recognizes the need, but also admitted it could take weeks before Congress is able to appropriate the money. (Congress is not set to return to Capitol Hill until May 4 at the earliest.)

“The states need resources in order to administer the UI,” Pelosi said. “Some are much better prepared than others or just have a different timetable. So one of the things we may have to do is get more resources to the state agencies that do this.”

In the meantime, the holes in the system are being blown wide open with a mammoth recession.

The economics of gentrification

The experience of expensive, politically liberal coastal cities tends to dominate media discussions of urbanism, so it's important to note that these cities are the exception rather than the rule. Most American central cities are relatively affordable, and many of them — especially in the Midwest — are still suffering from the population loss and disinvestment associated with white flight. A Detroit, Cleveland, or St. Louis could greatly benefit from an influx of affluent newcomers whose presence would create new job opportunities and bolster local tax bases.

At the same time, in any city it does seem to be true that an influx of newcomers will tend to raise prices. Research by Veronica Guerrieri, Daniel Hartley, and Erik Hurst shows empirically how this works. Price increases tend to concentrate in specific neighborhoods rather than spreading across a city as a whole. They model this as a question of spillovers. More and less affluent people place systematically different values on different kinds of retail opportunities. So affluent young people might be drawn to proximity to a Whole Foods and an array of independent coffee shops and yoga studios, while working-class families might prefer a cheaper supermarket and proximity to some home-based day care providers. When affluent people start moving to a neighborhood, the retail mix shifts in favor of things affluent people like, which draws more affluent people to that specific neighborhood but not necessarily to other places in the city.

""In tight housing markets,"" they write, ""the poor do worse when the rich get richer,"" whereas in slack markets, ""some evidence suggests that increases in others' income, holding own income constant, may be beneficial.""

When houses are plentiful, in other words, gentrification can be a win-win — increases in other people's incomes create new opportunities for the poor. But when houses are scarce, increases in other people's incomes merely exacerbate scarcity and leave the poor worse off than ever.

Neighborhoods need to change faster

So what creates a ""slack"" housing market where gentrification can be a win-win? Data from the real estate website Trulia shows it can basically happen one of two ways.

Markets like Detroit, Cleveland, or Rochester are cheap essentially because they are economically depressed. There are plenty of empty houses, so if affluent newcomers show up and fix some of them up it doesn't generate any real scarcity.

Tight markets like New York and the Bay Area can't replicate that approach to affordability. But they could learn a lesson from the other kind of slack housing market — Sunbelt markets like Raleigh and Atlanta where new houses are being built at a very rapid clip.

Those fast-growing metros are mostly adding houses by spreading their geographical footprint deeper into the suburbs. That's not necessarily an appealing option for cities whose sprawl is limited by oceans or already-gargantuan commuting times. But fortunately, technology exists that allows house builders to pack large quantities of dwellings into limited land.

They say it took conscious policy to create a strong middle class, we can do it again

Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, is the senior senator from Massachusetts. Her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, is the co-founder and president of Business Talent Group, a global consulting marketplace, and chairman of Demos, a nonprofit public policy organization. They are the authors of ""The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are (Still) Going Broke,"" from which parts of this article are adapted The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs.

(CNN) America's middle class is starting to crumble.

When we delivered that message in a book called ""The Two-Income Trap"" back in 2003, it seemed fairly shocking. Today, not so much.

A dozen years ago, if anyone thought about it at all, they seemed to think that America's middle class was pretty close to invulnerable. Solid and invincible — and maybe even a little dull. After all, our middle class had survived wars, scandals, epidemics and a Great Depression. Surely it could survive whatever the 21st century had to throw at us.

Amelia Warren Tyagi

Even when reports surfaced about rising levels of economic pain, there was a story to explain it — a very comfortable story that made it easier to ignore the bad news. Books, newscasts and breathless five-part series in the local paper came to the same conclusion as your Aunt Edith, the guy in the next office, and pretty much everyone else: Americans are in trouble because they are overspending! Just look at all those Nike sneakers and big-screen TVs. The malls are jam-packed, dog leashes are studded with rhinestones, and everyone — everyone! — has a microwave.

Rising health-care costs? Job insecurity? Climbing foreclosures? (Yes, back in 2003 they were already climbing .) Plug your fingers in your ears, la-la-la I can't hear you. The message was clear: Everything is great. And, if it isn't so great for you personally, then it's your own dang fault.

`` I do n't think we 're having a recession , '' Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington from his New Jersey golf club . `` We 're doing tremendously well . Our consumers are rich . I gave a tremendous tax cut and they 're loaded up with money . ''
Larry Kudlow , Trump 's top economic adviser , also played down fears of a looming recession and predicted the economy will perform well in the second half of 2019 . In Sunday television interviews , he said that consumers are seeing higher wages and are able to spend and save more .
`` No , I do n't see a recession , '' Kudlow said . `` We 're doing pretty darn well in my judgment . Let 's not be afraid of optimism . ''
A strong economy is key to Trump 's reelection prospects . Consumer confidence has dropped 6.4 % since July . The president has spent most of the week at his golf club in New Jersey with much of his tweeting focused on talking up the economy .
Kudlow acknowledged a slowing energy sector , but said low interest rates will help housing , construction and auto sales .
Kudlow also defended the president 's use of tariffs on goods coming from China . Before he joined the administration , Kudlow was known for opposing tariffs and promoting free trade during his career as an economic analyst . Kudlow said Trump has taught him and others that the `` China story has to be changed and reformed . ''
`` We can not let China pursue these unfair and unreciprocal trading practices , '' Kudlow said .
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said the U.S. needed to work with allies to hold China accountable on trade . He said he fears Trump is driving the global economy into a recession .
`` This current trade war that the president has entered our country into is not working , '' O'Rourke said . `` It is hammering the hell out of farmers across this country . ''
Last month , the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark rate — which affects many loans for households and businesses — by a quarter-point to a range of 2 % to 2.25 % . It 's the first rate cut since December 2008 during the depths of the Great Recession . Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the Fed was worried about the consequences of Trump 's trade war and sluggish economies overseas .
`` Weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S. economy , '' he said .
Breaking with historical norms , Trump has been highly critical of Powell as he places blame for any economic weakness on the nation 's central bank for raising interest rates too much over the past two years .
Peter Navarro , who advises Trump on trade policy , shared that sentiment .
`` The Federal Reserve chairman should look in the mirror and say , ' I raised rates too far , too fast , and I cost this economy a full percentage point of growth , ' '' Navarro said .
Navarro also said that U.S. consumers are not affected by the administration 's trade war with China , though tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers , not by China , and are often passed along to U.S. businesses and consumers through higher prices .
Kudlow himself told Fox in May that U.S. consumers and businesses ultimately end up paying the tariffs that the administration imposes on billions of dollars of Chinese goods .
Trump acknowledged at least a potential impact when he paused a planned 10 percent tariff hike for many items coming from China , such as cellphones , laptops , video game consoles , some toys , computer monitors , shoes and clothing .

`` There is clearly no strategy for dealing with the trade war in a way that will actually lead to results for American farmers or American consumers , '' said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend , Indiana , a Democratic presidential candidate .

Here's who we heard from, who we've been reading, and what they had to say.

Dean Baker, Center for Economic and Policy Research

Baker, an economist at the liberal-leaning research center, pointed to Wall Street as a driver of the wealth gap.

""We have done almost nothing to rein in Wall Street, which means great fortunes will be made scamming the productive economy in various ways,"" he said.

Baker pointed to the government's recurrent ""too-big-to fail"" subsidies to the nation's 10 largest banks, an annual payout that Bloomberg View has estimated at $83 billion — and that has shielded investors from losses.

""This is effectively payment from the government to the big banks,"" Baker says. ""The government is providing enormously valuable insurance for which it is not charging.""

That, and tax code loopholes ""just invite gaming,"" he says.

His top proposals to address problems he's identified: impose a modest tax on financial transactions including trades of stocks, bonds and derivatives to raise money and discourage ""flipping"" or the quick reselling of assets for profits; break up the big banks so they aren't too big to fail; and limit interest deductions to prevent private equity companies ""from showing big profits by loading companies with debt.""

Says Baker, ""These are all reasonably straightforward, and would go a very long way.""

Scott Frew, Rockingham Capital Partners

Frew, general partner of the Connecticut-based hedge fund, says he views the phenomenon of the growing income inequality as arising out of globalization and the nation's response to it.

""Globalization and the various free trade agreements that have accompanied it [including NAFTA] were sold as win-win arrangements, but have proved to be a lot closer to zero-sum,"" he said. ""The rising standard of living in the developing world has its mirror image in the falling ones here.""

Policymakers who have attempted to stanch the flow of wealth from the U.S. to the developing world — encouraging easy credit, for example — have ended up instead exacerbating the problem, Frew says.

Their actions, he says, ""most certainly widened the gap [in the U.S.] between the extremely prosperous upper echelons and everybody else.""

The wealthy have profited from the migration of American jobs overseas — from Wall Streeters selling IOU's to the developing world, to company owners outsourcing overseas. It's a practice Frew characterized as a ""highly profitable form of labor cost arbitrage.""

He also notes that U.S. businesses additionally benefit from their reliance on the government to provide welfare benefits to working Americans being paid poverty-level wages.

Since taxes aren't levied on businesses to specifically offset the costs of those government benefits, which help boost their profits, ""these corporations and their owners benefit twice over.""

The Financial Times' FTAlphaville, financial markets blog

In a post this week, the blog's Cardiff Garcia laid out the arguments for raising the federal minimum wage (job stability, less reliance on government benefits, workers spending more, etc) and those against (potential to depress employment, not clear if lower turnover a good thing, not as cost-effective as other ideas), and came up with this:

""So what's the right stand to take on the minimum wage in the absence of a better idea that's politically feasible? Honestly, we don't know.""

The post prompted a spirited conversation in the blog's comments section.

In its final report on the impacts of the stimulus , the White House ’ s Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) is touting some numbers . On its own , the stimulus saved 6 million jobs , and when combined with additional fiscal measures that followed , 9 million jobs were saved through the end of 2012 , the CEA reports .
“ The investments made through the Recovery Act will have a positive impact on long-run growth , raising the economy ’ s potential output and ultimately offsetting much of the Act ’ s initial cost , ” CEA chairman Jason Furman said in a blog post Monday .
The stimulus was initially priced at $ 787 billion , but later revised upward to $ 830 billion . According to the CEA report , the Recovery Act alone raised the level of gross domestic product by between 2 and 3 percent from late 2009 through mid-2011 .
Addition fiscal measures signed by the president that also contributed to the recovery , the CEA says , include a temporary payroll tax cut , extensions of emergency unemployment compensation , and expanded business tax incentives .
According to the CEA , when the stimulus and subsequent fiscal measures are combined , half of the total fiscal support for the economy , or $ 689 billion , came in the form of tax cuts , mostly directed at families . The remainder went to rebuilding roads and bridges , funding teacher jobs , and emergency unemployment assistance .
Mr. Obama signed the Recovery Act less than a month after taking office , amid the nation ’ s worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . Four million private-sector jobs had been lost , as had trillions of dollars in household wealth .

In its final report on the impacts of the stimulus, the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) is touting some numbers. On its own, the stimulus saved 6 million jobs, and when combined with additional fiscal measures that followed, 9 million jobs were saved through the end of 2012, the CEA reports.

“The investments made through the Recovery Act will have a positive impact on long-run growth, raising the economy’s potential output and ultimately offsetting much of the Act’s initial cost,” CEA chairman Jason Furman said in a blog post Monday.

The stimulus was initially priced at $787 billion, but later revised upward to $830 billion. According to the CEA report, the Recovery Act alone raised the level of gross domestic product by between 2 and 3 percent from late 2009 through mid-2011.

Addition fiscal measures signed by the president that also contributed to the recovery, the CEA says, include a temporary payroll tax cut, extensions of emergency unemployment compensation, and expanded business tax incentives.

According to the CEA, when the stimulus and subsequent fiscal measures are combined, half of the total fiscal support for the economy, or $689 billion, came in the form of tax cuts, mostly directed at families. The remainder went to rebuilding roads and bridges, funding teacher jobs, and emergency unemployment assistance.

Mr. Obama signed the Recovery Act less than a month after taking office, amid the nation’s worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Four million private-sector jobs had been lost, as had trillions of dollars in household wealth. No House Republicans voted for the Recovery Act, and in the Senate, only three Republicans voted yes. The stimulus – as well as the bailouts of Wall Street, housing, and the auto industry – is seen as a driving force behind the launch of the tea party movement.

Republicans call the stimulus a waste of taxpayer dollars.

“If you recall five years ago, the notion was that if the government spent all this money – that, by the way, was borrowed – that somehow the economy would begin to grow and create jobs. Well, of course, it clearly failed,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R) of Florida said Monday in a video statement.

And they’re challenging Obama’s seriousness in actually addressing the economic inequality he warned about. “We are facing an inequality crisis — one to which the president has paid lip service, but seems uninterested in truly confronting or correcting,” Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said in the tea party response to Obama’s State of the Union address.

The Obama administration is searching for a ""sweet spot"" in economic policy: measures that could increase job growth right now without worsening the federal deficit. That task gained new urgency this month when the Labor Department reported a sharp slowdown in job growth in May.

The challenge could force the president to try to revive his ""grand bargain"" with Republicans.

For the first couple of months this year, the sun shone on the U.S. job market, which seemed to be recovering without much help from Washington. Storm clouds began to gather in the past three months, though. Former White House economic adviser Larry Summers says the outlook now is a lot less rosy.

""It was reasonable to hope several months ago that the economy was finally going to reach escape velocity,"" Summers says. ""I don't think one can continue to have those judgments today.""

The one silver lining, Summers says, is the remarkably low interest rates at which the U.S. government can still borrow money. That creates an opportunity for the government to give the economy a temporary lift — by spending money on public works projects and other investments that will only cost more down the road.

""You're going to have to restore Kennedy Airport sometime. Why not do it now when construction unemployment is so high and interest rates are so low?"" he says.

An End To 'Stimulus In Isolation'?

The jobs bill President Obama proposed to Congress last year did include modest investments in public works, as well as money to help local governments keep teachers on the payroll.

Alan Krueger, who chairs the president's Council of Economic Advisers, says that if Congress had approved those measures, the May jobs report might not have been so gloomy.

""We lost 28,000 construction jobs, 8,000 education jobs. Had the president's proposal passed, which he reiterated and included in his budget, we would be in a better situation for workers in those two sectors,"" Krueger says.

With unemployment climbing to 8.2 percent last month, some economists now see a need for more aggressive federal action. But the president is constrained by anti-spending Republicans in Congress and a ballooning federal deficit.

Fiscal watchdog Maya MacGuineas, who heads the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, sees no chance for a big new round of spending — one that would simply add to the government's red ink.

""I think the days of stimulus in isolation are over,"" she says. ""I don't think they could pass Congress and I don't think they would work.""

But MacGuineas says the story might be different if the short-term stimulus were part of a larger package that also included long-term deficit reduction.

From 'Inconceivable To Inevitable'?

There's already pressure in Washington to make such a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff at the end of this year. That's when all of the Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire, and when automatic spending cuts are set to go into effect. The combination would be a major shock to the fragile economy.

""The only real option to avoid these bad scenarios is if we come together and compromise on replacing the fiscal cliff on some kind of comprehensive debt deal that's phased in more gradually and is more consistent with economic growth,"" MacGuineas says.

Republicans — and some Democrats — say they're determined to prevent the tax cuts from expiring in December, though the Congressional Budget Office warned this week that further extensions will mean even wider deficits.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, argues the threat of higher taxes is one reason employers aren't hiring.

“The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!” Trump said Monday in a posting on Twitter.

And, usually, the answer is he doesn’t have an answer,"" Obama said. But the Trump tweet cuts off the second sentence of that quote and segues into Trump talking about growth in manufacturing jobs.

Trump, in an earlier tweet on Monday, misquoted Obama on the magic wand quote, saying that the former president had been talking about GDP, which he wasn’t.

In the 70 years since the Labor Department started publishing monthly jobless numbers, the growth rate has been higher than the unemployment level more than 20 percent of the time when compared with GDP, which is reported quarterly.

GDP growth exceeded the jobless rate as recently as the first quarter of 2006, when unemployment was about 4.7 percent and quarterly GDP growth was 5.4 percent, government data show.

The Trump administration has recently promoted false statistics on jobless rates and the stock market’s performance as it has touted Trump’s record on the economy.

Last month, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted to reporters that Trump had tripled Obama’s eight-year job creation record for black workers in just 18 months, quoting numbers that were not even close to accurate.

“This president since he took office, in the year and a half that he’s been here has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans,” Sanders told reporters. “That’s 700,000 African-Americans that are working now that weren’t working when this president took place. When President Obama left, after eight years in office, he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans.”

The U.S. economy added about 3 million jobs for black workers while Obama was in office, according to BLS data. Hassett’s office took responsibility in a tweet for providing Sanders with inaccurate data.

On Sunday, Trump said in a tweet that “the Stock Market is up almost 50% since Election.”

That’s not the case for the S&P 500 Index, which has increased about 35 percent since Trump was elected on Nov. 8, 2016.

Before taking office, Trump regularly accused federal officials of falsifying economic data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index touched a near 14-year high on Wednesday, while oil prices fell in a volatile session as traders were caught between a build in U.S. stockpiles and the chance of an agreement on an output cut.

On Wall Street, declines in bank stocks more than offset gains in the technology sector. The S&P 500 had ended on Tuesday at a 10-week high while the Dow industrials set a record close, fueled by a post-U.S. election rally.

""People with money on the sidelines are looking for a place to put it. They're looking for names that haven't rallied as much and ones that have rallied are taking a bit of a breather,"" said Paul Hickey, co-founder at research firm Bespoke Investment Group in Harrison, New York.

The dollar has surged in the past week, tracking Treasury yields higher on the expectation that increased U.S government spending could trigger higher inflation and force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy more quickly than expected.

The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 54.92 points, or 0.29 percent, to 18,868.14, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 3.45 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,176.94 while the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 18.96 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,294.58.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell 0.21 percent, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> edged down 0.11 percent.

Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 0.7 percent but remained near a four-month low hit Monday.

VOLATILE OIL, STRONG GREENBACK

Oil prices fell in choppy trading as the market weighed Russia's comments on a possible meeting with Saudi Arabia about output cuts against a bigger-than-expected U.S. crude storage build.

U.S. crude last fell 0.9 percent to $45.41 a barrel and Brent traded at $46.42, down 1.1 percent on the day. Crude had risen more than 1 percent after a statement from the Russian energy minister.

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plans to cut taxes and increase infrastructure spending could boost economic activity while adding to the deficit, and his proposals to deport illegal immigrants and impose tariffs on cheap imports are seen driving inflation higher.

That prospect triggered a selloff in U.S. bonds that lifted yields across the board, and raised expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise faster than previously anticipated, giving support to the dollar.

U.S. interest rate futures are pricing in an 81 percent chance of a rate hike of 25 basis points at the next Fed meeting, scheduled for December.

The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against a basket of currencies, hit 100.57 <.DXY>, its highest since April 2003. It was last up 0.14 percent at 100.37.

The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.0686, while the yen was little changed at 109.09 per dollar, having earlier fallen to 109.75. The greenback rose to an eight-year high against the Chinese yuan of 6.8798 yuan .

""The market has gone a bit too far ahead of itself. It looks vulnerable for a short-term pullback,"" said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York, referring to the dollar rally.

The recent sharp gains in the dollar may cause Fed policymakers to reconsider raising rates because of its repercussions on U.S. exports, analysts said.

""It's reaching its limit. It could feed back negatively on U.S. growth,"" Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at Pimco, said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York.

Weaker-than-forecast U.S. producer prices and industrial production data on Wednesday supported Treasury prices and capped dollar gains.

Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.2172 percent, down from 2.238 percent on Tuesday.

Spot gold fell 0.0 percent to $1,224.80 an ounce. U.S. gold futures rose 0.04 percent to $1,225.00.

Copper fell 1.7 percent to $5,433.15 a tonne.

After adding a robust 275,000 new jobs back in January, job growth appears to be slowing. The Labor Department reports that the economy added only 69,000 jobs in May.

Meanwhile, despite the worst recession in generations, there are still countless small business owners plugging away around the country, seeking to expand and hire more employees.

""This year we hired two more technicians, and we hope to hire one more,"" says Srinivas Konanki, who employs 20 people at Pipette Calibration Services, a laboratory equipment company he owns with his wife.

The Konankis operate just outside Boston. Their company calibrates very precise lab tools called pipettes, which measure and dispense liquids.

A pipette looks kind of like an oversized ballpoint pen, with a click button on the top. But instead of pushing out a pen tip, the button is used to dispense liquid — sort of like a fancy squirt gun.

""The difference here is that you are actually measuring what you're squirting,"" Konanki says, rather than just indiscriminately shooting water. ""And so this [measures] very accurate volumes.""

Konanki is expert in the workings of pipettes. His wife, Manjula Konanki, jokes that he could talk about them for hours.

But get them talking about their business, and the Konankis take a more serious tone.

""We, as a small business, have been very careful as to how we spend our money,"" Srinivas says.

It's All About Optimism

For any business, job growth has a lot to do with confidence. To hire new workers, an entrepreneur needs to be optimistic that business will keep picking up.

The economic environment has given business owners plenty of cause for caution. One thing troubling Srinivas is the ongoing economic turbulence in Europe. Many European countries run research labs in the Boston area, and ""when they make cuts, they make cuts all over,"" he says. ""And when that happens, we see our business cut down.""

His other big concern is potential cutbacks in U.S. government spending, particularly potential cuts to the National Institutes of Health.

That's because, at the end of the year, as part of what's called ""sequestration,"" the NIH could be hit with an across-the-board 8 percent funding cut.

Sequestration will only happen if Congress is unable to hit budget-cutting targets it imposed on itself through legislation last year. But a failure to reach those targets would trigger dramatic broad-based cuts like those proposed for the NIH, among numerous government agencies.

""Congress is saying, 'We're going to make this difficult,' "" Stevenson says. That sends a signal to all the actors in the economy, she says, that ""there is potential for real damage to our economy coming in the future, and you should prepare for it today.""

Some Green Shoots

Despite all these unanswered questions, the U.S. is still managing to add new jobs each month.

""We've had slow growth, but it is growth,"" not losses, says David Kotok, chief economist at Cumberland Advisors, a Florida-based investment advisory firm.

Kotok acknowledges that job growth has slowed since the start of the year. But while he says that's disappointing, he also sees reasons to be optimistic.

Pioneer Natural Resources tumbled 5.6 percent and Halliburton lost 3.4 percent.

Target slipped 4.4 percent. Target has been struggling to boost U.S. traffic, rescue its botched expansion into Canada and regain shoppers’ trust after hackers stole millions of customers’ data last year. The retailer last week chose PepsiCo Inc. executive Brian Cornell to replace Gregg Steinhafel, who was ousted amid the turmoil this year.

Motorola Solutions Inc. decreased 4.2 percent. The telecommunications equipment provider reported second-quarter earnings and sales figures that were more than 24 percent short of analyst forecasts.

Earnings Season

Of the S&P 500 members that have posted financial results so far this season, 76 percent have beaten earnings estimates and 66 percent have exceeded sales projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Profit for the S&P 500’s constituents probably climbed 9.4 percent in the second quarter, while sales increased 4.2 percent, analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.

Groupon tumbled 17 percent as of 4:44 p.m. in New York. After the market closed, the company forecast third-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst estimates.

Time Warner Inc. slumped 12 percent in after-hours trading as Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc. withdrew its $75 billion takeover offer. Fox shares rose 8.3 percent.

Dollar General gained 3.4 percent during regular trading as people with knowledge of the matter said the company is weighing a bid for Family Dollar that would challenge Dollar Tree Inc.’s $8.5 billion takeover of the discount retailer. Family Dollar last week agreed to be acquired by Dollar Tree after investors Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz had pushed for a sale.

Family Dollar jumped 2 percent while Dollar Tree fell 2.2 percent.

Airlines Drop

Delta Air Lines Inc. fell 2.8 percent and United Continental Holdings Inc. slid 3.4 percent during regular trading, after business newspaper Vedomosti reported Russia may limit or ban trans-Siberian flights by European Union airlines, citing people familiar with the matter.

Coach Inc. surged 4.3 percent. The luxury handbag maker posted fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates as men’s goods and rising demand in China helped counter slumping sales of women’s bags and accessories in North America.

Avis Budget Group Inc. climbed 2.6 percent. The car-rental company raised its forecast for this year’s earnings and sales.",www.bloomberg.com,center,AbwXSDfoCYsNzYGj

A new Congressional Budget Office report examining trends in family wealth confirms what most Americans know from experience: The poor are buried in debt, the middle class is stuck, and—shocker—the most wealthy are piling up all the green.

The report, released late last week, puts its findings simply: “The distribution [of wealth] among the nation’s families was more unequal in 2013 than it had been in 1989.” It lays out some stark figures: Families in the top 10 percent of wealth distribution now hold more than three-quarters of the nation’s total family wealth.

The U.S. labor market may not be as weak as February ’ s payrolls number suggested , but the report provides a reality check that a long-forecast slowdown is arriving .
Employers added 20,000 jobs during the month , the fewest since September 2017 , missing all economist estimates and bucking a recent trend of strong February readings . Analysts said the unexpectedly low figure doesn ’ t mean conditions rapidly deteriorated -- citing weather effects and payback from outsize gains in prior months -- but they pointed to the likelihood of a moderation in job gains this year as economic growth cools .
“ I don ’ t think you want to say that 20,000 is the new trend , but the trend probably is shifting down , ” said Michael Feroli , chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York . “ It ’ s hard to know with precision how much of a downshift there will be . We ’ ll see job growth better than this , but not as good as we saw last year . ”
U.S. stocks dropped along with the dollar , with the Standard & Poor ’ s 500 Index falling for a fifth day , while benchmark Treasury yields were steady as markets weighed the jobs report with the risk of greater inflation pressures .
While the payroll gains disappointed , the report ’ s other highlights were largely positive : the unemployment rate declined by more than forecast and hourly wages rose from a year earlier at the fastest pace since 2009 , figures that bode well for consumer spending . Some industries hit hard in February are typically closely tied to weather patterns , including construction and retail , while the lingering effects of the partial government shutdown may have created some volatility .
“ There was always going to be noise in this as a result of the shutdown , ” Constance Hunter , chief economist at KPMG LLP , said on ███ Television .
Policy makers and economists are likely to wait for several months of weak hiring before concluding there ’ s cause for concern in the labor market . The figures also validate the Federal Reserve ’ s January decision to pause interest-rate hikes while awaiting signs of a more-persistent acceleration in inflation .
What ███ ’ s Economists Say “ The fact that hiring was weak , but the unemployment rate declined and jobless claims have not materially increased , signals that labor market conditions are not materially deteriorating . ”
“ The Fed just picked a really good time to go into hibernation , so they really don ’ t have to deal with any of this , ” said Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC .
A separate government report Friday showed new-home construction rebounded in January by more than expected as building permits hit a nine-month high , indicating the housing market is stabilizing amid lower mortgage rates .
Economists were already expecting monthly payroll gains to average about 170,000 this year , following a 223,000 pace in 2018 that was driven by corporate investment and consumer demand fueled by tax cuts . The effects of fiscal stimulus , including a boost in government spending , are expected to fade while President Donald Trump ’ s trade war with China remains an overhang on businesses .
The report also showed signs that companies are paying up for employees in a tight market . Average hourly earnings for private workers rose 0.4 percent from the prior month , topping estimates , following a 0.1 percent gain . That indicates the economy may get a lift from wage increases at companies including Amazon Inc. along with Costco Wholesale Corp. , which said Thursday it ’ s boosting starting wages .
Another positive highlight : The U-6 , or underemployment rate , plunged to 7.3 percent , the lowest since 2001 , from 8.1 percent . This includes part-time workers who want a full-time job and those less active in seeking work .
“ There ’ s no reason to panic , ” Ryan Sweet , head of monetary policy research at Moody ’ s Analytics Inc. “ You average the couple months together and the jobs market is still doing well . Job growth will slow this year , as the economy begins to moderate . But 20,000 jobs is not what we ’ re going to be creating month-in and month-out . ”

“I don’t think you want to say that 20,000 is the new trend, but the trend probably is shifting down,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. “It’s hard to know with precision how much of a downshift there will be. We’ll see job growth better than this, but not as good as we saw last year.”

U.S. stocks dropped along with the dollar, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index falling for a fifth day, while benchmark Treasury yields were steady as markets weighed the jobs report with the risk of greater inflation pressures.

While the payroll gains disappointed, the report’s other highlights were largely positive: the unemployment rate declined by more than forecast and hourly wages rose from a year earlier at the fastest pace since 2009, figures that bode well for consumer spending. Some industries hit hard in February are typically closely tied to weather patterns, including construction and retail, while the lingering effects of the partial government shutdown may have created some volatility.

“There was always going to be noise in this as a result of the shutdown,” Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG LLP, said on Bloomberg Television.

Policy makers and economists are likely to wait for several months of weak hiring before concluding there’s cause for concern in the labor market. The figures also validate the Federal Reserve’s January decision to pause interest-rate hikes while awaiting signs of a more-persistent acceleration in inflation.

What Bloomberg’s Economists Say “The fact that hiring was weak, but the unemployment rate declined and jobless claims have not materially increased, signals that labor market conditions are not materially deteriorating.”

“The Fed just picked a really good time to go into hibernation, so they really don’t have to deal with any of this,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.

A separate government report Friday showed new-home construction rebounded in January by more than expected as building permits hit a nine-month high, indicating the housing market is stabilizing amid lower mortgage rates.

Economists were already expecting monthly payroll gains to average about 170,000 this year, following a 223,000 pace in 2018 that was driven by corporate investment and consumer demand fueled by tax cuts. The effects of fiscal stimulus, including a boost in government spending, are expected to fade while President Donald Trump’s trade war with China remains an overhang on businesses.

The report also showed signs that companies are paying up for employees in a tight market. Average hourly earnings for private workers rose 0.4 percent from the prior month, topping estimates, following a 0.1 percent gain. That indicates the economy may get a lift from wage increases at companies including Amazon Inc. along with Costco Wholesale Corp., which said Thursday it’s boosting starting wages.

Another positive highlight: The U-6, or underemployment rate, plunged to 7.3 percent, the lowest since 2001, from 8.1 percent. This includes part-time workers who want a full-time job and those less active in seeking work.

“There’s no reason to panic,” Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics Inc. “You average the couple months together and the jobs market is still doing well. Job growth will slow this year, as the economy begins to moderate. But 20,000 jobs is not what we’re going to be creating month-in and month-out.”

Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) announced plans to close about 200 U.S. stores as part of its first earnings report since it merged with European drug retailer Alliance Boots last year.

The government shutdown has forced the partial or complete closure of some of the nation's most popular national parks and has furloughed thousands of federal land agency workers.

The folks that are responsible stewarding, maintaining and watching out for one of the great legacies of the United States are absent; they're gone.

This means all kinds of under-the-radar, yet critical, work has mostly stopped — from timber sales to wildfire prevention projects to the general upkeep and enforcement of laws on millions of acres of U.S. public lands.

It ’ s also a symbol of how the president thinks about free enterprise . Free enterprise to the president means taking money from the taxpayers and giving it freely to his friends . ”
-- Mitt Romney at a campaign appearance outside of failed California solar-panel maker Solyndra .
President Obama has been preparing supporters for weeks about a couple of serious setbacks to his re-election hopes that may come this month : a slackening economy and a possible defeat for his health law at the Supreme Court .
Justices could this month deliver a stinging blow to the president if they were to strike down the central tenant of Obama ’ s 2010 health law : a requirement that all Americans purchase private health insurance or be enrolled in a government program .
This would be particularly bad because without this provision , the law would urgently need to be revisited and reassert itself as a campaign issue . Obama has so far mostly focused on attacking his rival , Mitt Romney , and urging the nation “ forward. ” Obama has only raised the health law as an issue when looking to solidify his base , and then only on narrow principles , not the history-making entitlement it created .
Justices later this month will render their decision on the law , and whatever they decide , it will change the trajectory of the race . The health law is the incumbent ’ s single-greatest liability . It led to the Democratic disaster of 2010 and still galls many independent voters for its size and the slipshod manner in which it was crafted . Mostly , though , it is so disliked because it represented a distraction from the more urgent work of righting the economy .
Every time Obama and his advisers said he was making a hard pivot to jobs in 2010 and 2011 , it was an implicit admission that his attention had been elsewhere . Not good . That the “ hard pivot ” consisted mostly of campaign speeches denouncing congressional Republicans didn ’ t help much either .
That ’ s why today ’ s unemployment numbers are such bad news for the president . The re-litigation of Obama ’ s central achievement as president will come just as Americans are buckling up for another dip in the road to recovery .
The May jobs numbers are dire . The total unemployment rate jumped to 14.8 percent from 14.5 percent in April . The narrow measure of those unemployed but still looking for work ticked up from 8.1 percent to 8.2 percent . That means that not only did the workforce shrink as discouraged workers dropped out , but that there was a net loss of jobs .
That means that even before the really rough stuff began in Europe , the U.S. job market was already in decline . The downward revision of April ’ s overall economic measure ( do they ever revise up ? ) shows that the problems in the U.S. economy are very real .
The economy only added 115,000 jobs in March , just treading water , but causing the real unemployment rate to rise as folks fled the job market . That number was revised this morning to 77,000 jobs , meaning that the contraction had already begun . We were sinking , not treading water two months ago .
The May number of 69,000 jobs added is a sharpening of the trend . The president today will still technically able to say that the economy has added jobs for dozens of months in a row , but it won ’ t really be true .
Both April and May saw too few jobs added to keep up with population growth , meaning that we have been running a jobs deficit .
That brings us to the other history-making act of the Obama era : the 2009 stimulus that ladled out more than $ 787 billion in a bid to revive the economy , then in free-fall . Romney has a tricky time talking about Obama ’ s health law , given his own state-level plan in Massachusetts , but he sure loves to talk about the stimulus .
Americans largely believe that the stimulus was either bad for the economy or ineffective and with four years of deficits above $ 1 trillion , expensive and ineffective is not a good place to be . As this downturn continues or accelerates , watch for Romney to sharpen his attacks on Obama ’ s rescue effort and to let others pick up on the subject of the health law .
This is the third June in a row that has brought unhappy economic news for a president hoping to show progress on the economy . Add in the health-law decision and you could have the makings of a very unhappy summer for the president .
“ Confidential : [ White House ] is working on some very explicit language on importation to kill it in health care reform . This has to stay quiet . ”

The industry would win that and several other major prizes in exchange for publicly supporting the controversial legislation , lobbying lawmakers and funding a public relations effort on the law ’ s behalf . The email , released Thursday , was obtained by House Republicans investigating closed-door dealings in the creation of the law .

President Obama has been preparing supporters for weeks about a couple of serious setbacks to his re-election hopes that may come this month: a slackening economy and a possible defeat for his health law at the Supreme Court.

Justices could this month deliver a stinging blow to the president if they were to strike down the central tenant of Obama’s 2010 health law: a requirement that all Americans purchase private health insurance or be enrolled in a government program.

This would be particularly bad because without this provision, the law would urgently need to be revisited and reassert itself as a campaign issue. Obama has so far mostly focused on attacking his rival, Mitt Romney, and urging the nation “forward.” Obama has only raised the health law as an issue when looking to solidify his base, and then only on narrow principles, not the history-making entitlement it created.

Justices later this month will render their decision on the law, and whatever they decide, it will change the trajectory of the race. The health law is the incumbent’s single-greatest liability. It led to the Democratic disaster of 2010 and still galls many independent voters for its size and the slipshod manner in which it was crafted. Mostly, though, it is so disliked because it represented a distraction from the more urgent work of righting the economy.

Every time Obama and his advisers said he was making a hard pivot to jobs in 2010 and 2011, it was an implicit admission that his attention had been elsewhere. Not good. That the “hard pivot” consisted mostly of campaign speeches denouncing congressional Republicans didn’t help much either.

That’s why today’s unemployment numbers are such bad news for the president. The re-litigation of Obama’s central achievement as president will come just as Americans are buckling up for another dip in the road to recovery.

The May jobs numbers are dire. The total unemployment rate jumped to 14.8 percent from 14.5 percent in April. The narrow measure of those unemployed but still looking for work ticked up from 8.1 percent to 8.2 percent. That means that not only did the workforce shrink as discouraged workers dropped out, but that there was a net loss of jobs.

That means that even before the really rough stuff began in Europe, the U.S. job market was already in decline. The downward revision of April’s overall economic measure (do they ever revise up?) shows that the problems in the U.S. economy are very real.

The economy only added 115,000 jobs in March, just treading water, but causing the real unemployment rate to rise as folks fled the job market. That number was revised this morning to 77,000 jobs, meaning that the contraction had already begun. We were sinking, not treading water two months ago.

The May number of 69,000 jobs added is a sharpening of the trend. The president today will still technically able to say that the economy has added jobs for dozens of months in a row, but it won’t really be true.

Both April and May saw too few jobs added to keep up with population growth, meaning that we have been running a jobs deficit.

That brings us to the other history-making act of the Obama era: the 2009 stimulus that ladled out more than $787 billion in a bid to revive the economy, then in free-fall. Romney has a tricky time talking about Obama’s health law, given his own state-level plan in Massachusetts, but he sure loves to talk about the stimulus.

Americans largely believe that the stimulus was either bad for the economy or ineffective and with four years of deficits above $1 trillion, expensive and ineffective is not a good place to be. As this downturn continues or accelerates, watch for Romney to sharpen his attacks on Obama’s rescue effort and to let others pick up on the subject of the health law.

This is the third June in a row that has brought unhappy economic news for a president hoping to show progress on the economy. Add in the health-law decision and you could have the makings of a very unhappy summer for the president.

Each December, economists make predictions. And each new year, they get hit by unexpected events that make them look more clueless than prescient.

This year's bolt out of the blue was the plunge in oil's price, which no one saw coming.

Still, top economists' forecasts did get a lot right for 2014. One year ago, most were predicting healthy growth, tame inflation, low interest rates, rising stock prices and declining unemployment — and that's just what we got.

Now they are looking ahead, and once again, their forecasts are brimming with good cheer. These are among the most common predictions for 2015:

GDP will keep growing quickly. The gross domestic product — a measure of all U.S. goods and services — has been on a tear. The Commerce Department's latest revision shows GDP advancing at an astonishing 5 percent over July, August and September.

That growth spurt suggests the U.S. economy has momentum heading into the new year. Lower energy prices will give consumers more money to spend, and that should help boost revenues for stores, restaurants, hotels and more.

""Our assessment for growth in 2015 will now be around 3 percent,"" wrote Doug Handler, chief U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight. For an economy in its sixth year of expansion, a 3 percent annual pace would be impressive.

Employers will hire and pay more. In 2013, the unemployment rate averaged 7.4 percent. Last December, economists were predicting a slide to about 6.6 percent.

As it turned out, the jobless rate tumbled to 5.8 percent, and now economists see the rate dipping to 5.5 percent or lower in the coming year.

""With stronger economic growth, the U.S. will add about 230,000 jobs per month on average next year,"" according to the forecast of Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group. That would add up to about 2.8 million net new jobs in 2015.

Currently, the country has 2.8 million people struggling with long-term unemployment. So if Faucher's prediction were to come true, workers finally could enjoy a healthy market where job openings and willing workers would match up. And the increased demand for workers would help push up stagnant wages.

Stocks will go higher. The stock market has been zooming up for years now. The Dow Jones industrial average stood at 6,627 in early March 2009, during the worst of the Great Recession. But with the recovery going strong, the stock average has been pushing above 18,000.

The Center for Immigration Studies is releasing the study Thursday morning , a day ahead of the final Labor Department unemployment report of the campaign season , which is expected to show a sluggish job market more than three years into the economic recovery .

His numbers are stark : Since the first quarter of 2009 , the number of immigrants of working age ( 16 to 65 ) who are employed has risen 2 million , from 21.2 million to 23.2 million . During the same time , native-born employment has risen just 1 million , to reach 119.9 million .
It ’ s a trend years in the making : Immigrants are working more , and native-born Americans are working less .
In 2000 , 76 percent of natives aged 18 to 65 were employed , but that dropped steadily to 69 percent this September .

“ Most of the areas of the U.S. economy that are hiring right now , like agriculture and high-tech industries , are those where immigrants have always been overly represented , ” Mr. Nowrasteh said .
He also said immigrants are quicker to jump into the rebounding job market while native-born Americans , who under federal law have more welfare options and access to unemployment benefits , are slower to find work .
Mr. Nowrasteh and Mr. Camarota said another factor could be immigrants ’ mobility .
Natives have roots wherever they live , and it may take higher wages to get them to move for jobs , even if their homes are in depressed areas . Immigrants already have uprooted themselves and can more easily pick places where jobs are available .
Indeed , Mr. Camarota ’ s numbers show that most of the immigrant employment growth went to new arrivals , not to foreign-born residents already in the United States — a figure that suggests immigrants already settled here were having some of the same difficulties as the native-born .
There is some bright news : an uptick over the past year among native-born Americans accounting for two-thirds of all new employment growth .
Net immigration — both legal and illegal — averaged more than 1.1 million in the 1990s and slightly less than 900,000 in the past decade .
Mr. Camarota said it didn ’ t slow much despite the economic downturn .
“ We have a situation where the job market — the bottom fell out , yet we kept legal immigration relatively high without even a national debate , ” he said . “ As a consequence , a lot of the job growth has been going to immigrants . ”

Mr. Romney has talked about legalizing a small number of illegal immigrants , though he has been studiously vague about his specific plans in an effort to try not to alienate voters on either side of the issue .
Mr. Obama did take action this year to grant many illegal immigrants up to 30 years of age a tentative legal status that prevents them from being deported and authorizes them to work in the United States .

In April , the U.S. economy added 164,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 % , according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics . This unemployment rate matches a level last seen in December 2000 .
Nonfarm payrolls were expected to have grown by 193,000 in April with the unemployment rate forecast to fall to 4 % , according to estimates from Bloomberg . This decline in the unemployment rate breaks a six-month streak of the unemployment rate sitting at 4.1 % .
The unemployment rate fell to a more than 17-year low in April while job gains disappointed . ( Source : BLS ) More
Other key numbers economists were watching out for in Friday ’ s report were wage gains , which tallied 0.1 % over the prior month and 2.6 % over the same month last year in April .
Economists had forecast a 0.2 % and 2.7 % increase in monthly and annual wage gains , respectively .
An increase in wages is seen as a sign of potential inflation pressures building in the economy . In March , the Fed ’ s preferred measure of inflation showed a 1.9 % increase over the prior year .
In its monetary policy statement released Wednesday , the Fed acknowledged that inflation has “ moved close to 2 percent , ” a change from its previous language acknowledging price increases running consistently below its 2 % target .
Neil Dutta , an economist at Renaissance Macro , said after Friday ’ s report that it ’ s time to cut estimates for NAIRU — or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment — as a 3.9 % unemployment rate with a 2.6 % annual increase in wages is far outside what most economists expected possible a few years ago . Unemployment rates at these levels , in other words , were expected in the past to bring about rapidly rising wages ; a 2.6 % annual increase in pay is not a rapid increase .

In April, the U.S. economy added 164,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This unemployment rate matches a level last seen in December 2000.

Nonfarm payrolls were expected to have grown by 193,000 in April with the unemployment rate forecast to fall to 4%, according to estimates from Bloomberg. This decline in the unemployment rate breaks a six-month streak of the unemployment rate sitting at 4.1%.

Other key numbers economists were watching out for in Friday’s report were wage gains, which tallied 0.1% over the prior month and 2.6% over the same month last year in April.

Economists had forecast a 0.2% and 2.7% increase in monthly and annual wage gains, respectively.

An increase in wages is seen as a sign of potential inflation pressures building in the economy. In March, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation showed a 1.9% increase over the prior year.

In its monetary policy statement released Wednesday, the Fed acknowledged that inflation has “moved close to 2 percent,” a change from its previous language acknowledging price increases running consistently below its 2% target.

Neil Dutta, an economist at Renaissance Macro, said after Friday’s report that it’s time to cut estimates for NAIRU — or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment — as a 3.9% unemployment rate with a 2.6% annual increase in wages is far outside what most economists expected possible a few years ago. Unemployment rates at these levels, in other words, were expected in the past to bring about rapidly rising wages; a 2.6% annual increase in pay is not a rapid increase.

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has found himself embroiled in the latest international banking scandal to hit Washington, D.C., following revelations that the Cabinet secretary was concerned as far back as 2008 with problems in how large, international banks were setting the LIBOR benchmark interest rate.

In a two-page memo addressed to Mervyn King, the head of the Bank of England, Geithner, who was president of the New York Federal Reserve at the time, warned that steps must be taken to “improve the integrity and transparency of the rate-setting process,” according to a June 2008 email obtained by POLITICO on Thursday.

The LIBOR manipulation scandal exploded last month when London’s Barclays bank was fined hundreds of millions of dollars for its practices, which led to the resignation of its CEO Bob Diamond.

The newly unveiled 2008 note to King is poised to draw more questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill on exactly what Geithner knew about banks’ efforts to manipulate LIBOR and to what extent the former New York Fed president tried to mitigate the problem.

The benchmark interest rate, published every business day in London, gauges the cost of borrowing between banks. The number of banks that contribute to the process varies per currency (there are 18 for the U.S. dollar). The rate, published midday, affects the cost of lending for a range of products, such as mortgages and credit cards.

A group of 12 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council on Thursday, demanding a full investigation. “This scandal calls into further question the integrity of many Wall Street banks and whether our prosecutors and regulators are up to the task of regulating them,” the senators wrote.

The lecture he prepared was fairly unpersuasive on a number of levels , starting with the extent to which Hassett found himself trying to back-date the inflection point to Election Day 2016 , well before any actual Trump policies had taken effect .
But in an administration whose messaging is normally nonstop risible nonsense , Hassett stands out for a tendency to stick to ideas that are at least plausible and worth debating . And while his arguments about a Trump-induced boom are overstated , it ’ s a mistake for Trump ’ s critics to overcorrect by pretending his policies have nothing to do with the good news we ’ ve seen this year .
The truth is , Trump ’ s policymaking success helps settle a long-running argument between the liberal and centrist wings of the Democratic Party that ’ s been raging ever since the passage of the first stimulus bill in 2009 — is it more important to address deficit reduction or to provide a still-depressed economy with additional stimulus ?
The progressive diagnosis of the situation was that as late as 2016 , the economy remained in a somewhat depressed state and would benefit from additional fiscal stimulus . Trump took over in 2017 , pushed for and obtained an increase in military spending , and in exchange gave Democrats $ 128 billion in additional domestic spending . ( The money went mostly to infrastructure , child care , opioid treatment disaster relief , and college tuition subsidies . ) He cut taxes , and sat back and watched the pace of economic growth accelerate while deficit scolds brayed ineffectually .
Rather than churlishly refusing to admit this helped , Trump ’ s critics should learn the lesson . Many of us were right all along — and others were wrong and should own up to it .
The claim by Trump ’ s detractors that he fundamentally inherited a growing economy is , of course , true . This is a special point of emphasis for Obama administration veterans who had the misfortune of picking up the baton from the Bush administration in the middle of a chaotic financial crisis with aggregate demand collapsing globally . Trump has been governing on a kind of easy mode , and the dark picture he painted of the state of the economy in 2016 was nonsense .
At the same time , the economy he inherited remained in some ways depressed due to the lingering effects of the Great Recession .
Don ’ t take my word for it . In the spring of 2016 , the Obama Council of Economic Advisers ’ annual report referred to the “ the yet incomplete labor market recovery ” as one of the main challenges facing the country . The same report also argued at some length in Chapter 6 that this incomplete labor market recovery could be effectively addressed through a new round of fiscal stimulus targeting federal infrastructure .
The Obama administration couldn ’ t get congressional Republicans to agree to this , but my guess is that had Hillary Clinton won she would have adopted Bill Clinton ’ s suggest to tempt them with a corporate tax cut gimmick , and we would have gotten a modest regressive tax cut and a big increase in spending and economic growth would have accelerated somewhat . Instead , Trump won — so we got a big regressive tax cut and a modest increase in spending and economic growth accelerated somewhat .
In other words , given that Democrats were saying pre-Trump that a little extra fiscal boost would help get us to full employment , there ’ s no rational basis for denying that Trump providing a little extra fiscal boost is helping get us to full employment .
None of this is to say that Trump is secretly an amazing president or that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a fantastic piece of legislation .
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , having starved the economy of needed fiscal stimulus for six years , which inflicted enormous suffering on millions of jobless Americans who could otherwise have found work , executed an unprincipled pivot on deficits largely to blow America ’ s fiscal capacity on tax cuts for rich people . That ’ s what Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush did , too . It ’ s not a good idea . Using the money to address real social needs — a child allowance , clean energy , preschool — would be a much better idea .
Republicans have their priorities , and they are not Democrats ’ priorities . That ’ s why we have competition between political parties .
Rather than quibble about credit , what Democrats need to do is remember the lessons of the past the next time they get to govern . Republicans who complain about the deficit when the Democrats are in the White House aren ’ t yearning for a grand bargain , they just disagree with Democrats ’ priorities .
Similarly , the reason CEOs grouse about Democratic presidents while hailing similar economic performance under Republican presidents is that CEO ’ s are wealthy older white men with conservative political opinions who like it when the GOP controls the White House . Getting obsessed with their whining isn ’ t going to help anyone .
Fiscal stimulus when the labor market is short of full employment works — just ask Donald Trump .","Monday afternoon, in lieu of a normal White House press briefing, we were greeted with the odd spectacle of Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett greeting the press corps with charts and graphs designed to make it clear that Donald Trump’s election is responsible for 2018’s rosy economic conditions.

(The money went mostly to infrastructure, child care, opioid treatment disaster relief, and college tuition subsidies.) He cut taxes, and sat back and watched the pace of economic growth accelerate while deficit scolds brayed ineffectually.

Rather than churlishly refusing to admit this helped, Trump’s critics should learn the lesson. Many of us were right all along — and others were wrong and should own up to it.

Trump inherited a growing, depressed economy

The claim by Trump’s detractors that he fundamentally inherited a growing economy is, of course, true. This is a special point of emphasis for Obama administration veterans who had the misfortune of picking up the baton from the Bush administration in the middle of a chaotic financial crisis with aggregate demand collapsing globally. Trump has been governing on a kind of easy mode, and the dark picture he painted of the state of the economy in 2016 was nonsense.

At the same time, the economy he inherited remained in some ways depressed due to the lingering effects of the Great Recession.

Don’t take my word for it. In the spring of 2016, the Obama Council of Economic Advisers’ annual report referred to the “the yet incomplete labor market recovery” as one of the main challenges facing the country. The same report also argued at some length in Chapter 6 that this incomplete labor market recovery could be effectively addressed through a new round of fiscal stimulus targeting federal infrastructure.

The Obama administration couldn’t get congressional Republicans to agree to this, but my guess is that had Hillary Clinton won she would have adopted Bill Clinton’s suggest to tempt them with a corporate tax cut gimmick, and we would have gotten a modest regressive tax cut and a big increase in spending and economic growth would have accelerated somewhat. Instead, Trump won — so we got a big regressive tax cut and a modest increase in spending and economic growth accelerated somewhat.

In other words, given that Democrats were saying pre-Trump that a little extra fiscal boost would help get us to full employment, there’s no rational basis for denying that Trump providing a little extra fiscal boost is helping get us to full employment.

Democrats — remember this next time!

None of this is to say that Trump is secretly an amazing president or that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a fantastic piece of legislation.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, having starved the economy of needed fiscal stimulus for six years, which inflicted enormous suffering on millions of jobless Americans who could otherwise have found work, executed an unprincipled pivot on deficits largely to blow America’s fiscal capacity on tax cuts for rich people. That’s what Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush did, too. It’s not a good idea. Using the money to address real social needs — a child allowance, clean energy, preschool — would be a much better idea.

Republicans have their priorities, and they are not Democrats’ priorities. That’s why we have competition between political parties.

Rather than quibble about credit, what Democrats need to do is remember the lessons of the past the next time they get to govern. Republicans who complain about the deficit when the Democrats are in the White House aren’t yearning for a grand bargain, they just disagree with Democrats’ priorities.

Similarly, the reason CEOs grouse about Democratic presidents while hailing similar economic performance under Republican presidents is that CEO’s are wealthy older white men with conservative political opinions who like it when the GOP controls the White House. Getting obsessed with their whining isn’t going to help anyone.

Fiscal stimulus when the labor market is short of full employment works — just ask Donald Trump.",www.vox.com,left,V2wYxYXJcv7CBhPt

A three-month extension of federal unemployment benefits for 1.3 million jobless Americans won a key procedural vote in the Senate on Tuesday.

The 60-37 vote indicates there's enough Republican support to move the Emergency Unemployment Compensation, which expired on Dec. 28, forward to a full vote. As The Associated Press writes, the measure ""is the leading edge of a Democratic program that also includes raising the minimum wage and closing tax loopholes on the wealthy and corporations.""

The vote does not guarantee final passage in the Senate and the measure still must clear the Republican-controlled House.

As NPR's Craig Windham reported, GOP lawmakers opposed the bill because it does not include spending cuts to pay the cost of the extension.

The vote was originally scheduled for Monday evening, but it was abruptly delayed because, as Politico reports, supporters did not have the votes they needed.

On Monday, Politico wrote that Democrats needed five Republicans to join them to reach the needed 60-vote threshold, and at that time just two Republicans were in their column.

Speaking in the chamber just before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell lashed out at the Democrats and President Obama:

""Remember: These are the same folks who gave us the stimulus, who gave us tax increases, and who gave us Obamacare,"" he said. ""All of it was done in the name of helping the little guy — in the name of greater equality. And what's it given us? This mess.""

Federal unemployment benefits were signed into law in 2008 by President George W. Bush to provide an average of $300 a week to jobless Americans for an additional 28 weeks after their state benefits expired. It was meant as a stopgap measure during the recession, which saw the worst unemployment in decades. As the length and depth of the recession dragged on, the measure was extended more than 10 times.

Reuters says:

""The Democrat-led Senate plans to escalate the fight in coming weeks by bringing up for a vote a bill to increase the federal minimum wage, which has stood at $7.25 an hour since July 2009. Democrats want the minimum wage to rise over three years to $10.10 and then be indexed to inflation in the future.""

President Obama said Tuesday that the vote was ""good news"" and that unemployment insurance ""has been a vital lifeline for millions of people"" hurt by the recession.

""They are out there looking for jobs,"" he said.

""I can't remember a time where I met an American who would rather have an unemployment check than the pride of a real job,"" he said.

The president was introduced by Katerine Hackett, who has been out of work for the long term.

Enjoy the high while it lasts .","On the evening of November 8, 2016, as it became clear that assumptions about Hillary Clinton's certain electoral victory were wrong, investors began to squirm. Dow futures dropped by more than 700 points that night, and the liberal economist Paul Krugman wrote at The New York Times that ""if the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never.""

The next morning, however, the stock market completed a stunning reversal to end at a record high. What some have called a ""Trump rally"" has continued ever since, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovering just above the 20,000 mark at press time.

One explanation for Wall Street's seeming euphoria is that investors believe they're now less likely to see the continuation of tax hikes and micro-regulation desired by the Clinton campaign.

True, it's impossible to know what Donald Trump's win heralds on the policy front in the long term. But at least for now, the market appears to be betting that the new president will make good on campaign promises that businesses expect to be good for their bottom lines. The Republican sweep could pave the way, for instance, for a long overdue reform of the individual and corporate tax codes.

Right now, explains Cato Institute researcher Chris Edwards, corporations keep just $65 of every $100 in profits they earn, after taxes are taken out. ""Trump is saying they will get to keep $85,"" he says. ""If the profit stream increases by 30 percent ($85 vs. $65), so should the market value.""

Winning tactic?,2014-01-06,Francine Kiefer,"For months now , it has been clear that Republicans will try to make the 2014 midterm elections all about `` Obamacare '' as they push to win majority control of the Senate . This week , Democrats will counter in earnest with their election theme . Starting Monday , they will turn to issues of income inequality in a bid not only to rouse their base , but also to win support from middle-class Americans who worry that only the rich are getting richer .
Senate majority leader Harry Reid ( D ) will try on Monday to clear a legislative hurdle to allow a vote on extending unemployment insurance for 1.3 million long-term jobless Americans whose benefits expired Dec. 28 . Look , too , for Senate Democrats to push for a higher federal minimum wage . Democrats are making both efforts against the historic backdrop of President Lyndon Johnson ’ s “ war on poverty , ” launched 50 years ago this week in his State of the Union message .
President Obama , meanwhile , will carry the torch further on Jan. 28 , when he ’ ll use his State of the Union address to echo a pre-Christmas speech in which he declared that income inequality and declining social mobility are “ the defining challenge of our time . ”
It is a political strategy that carries some risks . Some Americans are already wary of Mr. Obama 's aims , wondering whether he lied to them – falsely telling them they could keep health insurance plans they liked – in order to win passage of legislation that makes insurance widely available to the poor . Moreover , the inequality issue has the potential to expose a fault line among Democrats , with liberals such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pushing the party to go much further down the path of federal entitlements and benefits than many others are comfortable going .
So far , the party appears to be stopping short of an Occupy Wall Street revival . Extending long-term unemployment benefits and raising the minimum wage both have majority public support , according to polls . Those polls also reveal a broad unease about the widening income inequality .
But with the Republican base fired up for what is shaping up to be a low-turnout midterm election , the clearest target for Democrats ' new push is likely Democratic voters themselves . The question , then , becomes : How far should Democrats go ?
“ Democrats must be careful in how they frame the issue ” of inequality , says John Pitney Jr. , a congressional expert at Claremont McKenna College in California . “ If voters think that the idea is to redistribute wealth from the middle class to the poor , Democrats will lose badly . ”
Since the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act on Oct. 1 , the problem that most concerns Americans has been “ dissatisfaction with the government , ” not the economy generally , which has fallen into second place , followed by health care , according to Gallup . The gap between the rich and poor is farther down the list : Only 2 percent rank it as the country 's top problem . Therein lies the balancing act for Democrats trying to steer public interest away from the problems of Obamacare to an issue – helping the downtrodden – where the party holds an historic advantage .
For now , Democrats appear to be opting for caution . About 2 in 3 Americans want Congress to boost the minimum wage , according to a Washington Post-ABC poll released last month . Obama supports a Senate bill to raise the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour , up from $ 7.25 an hour , where it has stood since 2009 .
The attempt is to help the working poor . Whether you contrast the wage growth of the lowest-income earners with the highest in America , or look at the percentage of overall wealth controlled by the richest , economic inequality has intensified . Meanwhile , the poverty rate – roughly 15 percent for the past three years – is up from a low of 11 percent in 1973 .
The Washington Post-ABC poll shows a majority of Americans concerned about this trend : 57 percent of the public says Congress should pursue policies aimed at rebalancing an economy that ’ s out of whack .
Likewise , 55 percent of Americans support maintaining unemployment insurance for the long-term jobless , according to a recent Hart Research poll . While affecting only a slice of the workforce , such a move resonates with many Americans who fear they may lose their jobs , and worry about what will happen to them if they do . “ That ’ s why this issue could work for Democrats , ” says Mr. Pitney .
Democrats are also carefully choosing their rhetoric . Some have invoked the popular Pope Francis , who recently warned that income inequality will lead to “ an economy of exclusion. ” Some are citing economist Mark Zandi , former adviser to Sen. John McCain ( R ) of Arizona , who defends benefits for the long-term unemployed as a boost to economic growth . They note that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finds that failure to renew unemployment benefits will cost more than 200,000 jobs . And they are highlighting individual cases to put human faces on their arguments .
In this way , Democrats can hope to turn the tables on Republicans . Going back to the Great Depression and the New Deal , Democrats have made defending the downtrodden their trademark – and that issue can be a challenge for Republicans , who sometimes sound out-of-touch . A prime example : 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney ’ s comment about the 47 percent of Americans who are “ dependent on government ” and “ unwilling to take personal responsibility and care for their lives. ” It reinforced his plutocrat image in the 2012 campaign , which Obama went on to win handily even in a bad economy .
Some Republicans are trying to counter the Democrats on income inequality . Sen. Mike Lee of Utah ( who helped lead the fight to shut down the government ) and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin are using softer language , promoting private-sector solutions that emphasize volunteerism and charity , and touting tax cuts as a way to spur growth . “ The perception that the GOP does not care about people ” is “ a major deficiency , ” a Republican National Committee review of the 2012 campaign found . The review suggested that the party “ be the champion of those who seek to climb the economic ladder . ”
“ Washington has gummed up the works , ” Representative Ryan told an Iowa crowd in November , according to the Washington Post . “ It ’ s made it harder for people to get ahead , and the idea of upward mobility , of equal opportunity , is slipping farther and farther away from people who haven ’ t seen it for generations. ” For months , Ryan – Mr. Romney ’ s running mate , who may well seek the presidency in 2016 – has been meeting with neighborhood leaders in cities nationwide . He ’ s expected soon to lay out a plan to combat poverty .
Republican lawmakers may well block an extension of jobless benefits if it ’ s not paid for by offsetting savings , and they generally oppose an increase to the minimum wage as a disincentive to hire . But even if Democrats in Congress do n't come away with a legislative win on these points , their efforts to defending the disadvantaged will play well with the Democratic base .
Democrats are “ outlining an agenda ” not only for this year , but also for future years , says congressional historian Julian Zelizer at Princeton University . “ A lot of Democrats feel the last two years have been consumed with health care … and the deficit , ” he explains . “ Until you shift the debate , you ’ re not going to be able to get in a position where you can push for legislation like the [ higher ] minimum wage . And this is the right time because the Republicans are in a moment of division ” over whether to obstruct or to compromise .
Democrats , too , have their internal arguments . One has broken out between the left wing , led by consumer crusader and freshman Senator Warren , and the Democratic centrists , many of whom come from the Clinton camp . Warren is barricading entitlement programs against cuts and even advocates increasing Social Security benefits ; centrists counter that the only way to invest in the infrastructure , education , and green energy that will make America competitive is to curtail the entitlement spending that will explode as baby boomers retire in their social-safety hammocks .

The split , for now , is mostly an inside-the-Beltway dustup . Neither Republicans nor Democrats are moving toward a fiscal “ grand bargain ” that would trade cuts to Medicare and Social Security for tax increases .
