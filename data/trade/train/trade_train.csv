Lockhart, Ella Nilsen, Nicole Narea","One of the most persistent claims about Donald Trump ’ s rise is that it ’ s a response to economic anxiety and struggles among white working-class Americans .
This is a comforting notion , particularly for those on the left . It suggests that large numbers of Americans are not being drawn to a racist demagogue because he ’ s a racist demagogue , but because of the failures of modern capitalism . It also implies that these voters could be won over by a robust left-wing economic agenda that addressed their plight .
But there ’ s also plenty of data suggesting that this isn ’ t a satisfying explanation . Trump ’ s rise has always seemed more closely related to prejudice than economics . Analysis of surveys has shown consistently that racial resentment correlates more strongly with Trump support than one ’ s income or degree or pessimism about the economy .
Now , Gallup ’ s Jonathan Rothwell ( via the Washington Post ) has offered a particularly detailed argument that there ’ s a lot more than pure economic anxiety at work here . Gallup 's regular surveys offered Rothwell a large dataset of 87,428 Americans who told pollsters whether they held a favorable or unfavorable view of Donald Trump . That sample size let him drill down geographically , analyzing support for Trump at the regional and local level — even , on some questions , down to individual zip codes .
He then linked that geographic information to data about the decline in manufacturing , about how affected each area was by the rise of Chinese imports , about intergenerational mobility , about racial segregation , and about white mortality rates .
That let him test each of those factors as explanations for Trump . Is Trump support correlated with areas affected by globalization , as many commentators have suggested ? Check the Chinese import data . Does Trump support coincide with increased death rates for white middle-aged women , an increase chronicled by Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton ? Check the health data .
Trump 's base is not poor whites — it 's way more complicated than that
What Rothwell found was revelatory , to say the least . He finds that individuals who are struggling economically are not more likely to support Trump , nor are people living in areas that have suffered a loss of manufacturing jobs , an influx of immigration , or competition from China . By contrast , people in areas where whites are struggling health-wise , and in terms of intergenerational mobility ( and in areas that are very racially segregated ) , do seem more likely to back Trump .
Trump supporters are richer , not poorer , than average : For one thing , Rothwell found that both across the overall population and among whites , support for Trump is correlated with higher income , not lower . That ’ s not surprising ; low-income people have always preferred Democrats . But it definitely contradicts the image of Trump as spokesman for the economically struggling .
Rothwell also found that Trump supporters are no likelier to be unemployed or to have left the workforce . The problem of men dropping out of the labor force doesn ’ t seem to be a factor behind Trump ’ s rise .
`` The individual data do not suggest that those who view Trump favorably are confronting abnormally high economic distress , by conventional measures of employment and income , '' he concludes .
Nonetheless , Trump supporters tend to be blue-collar and less educated : On the other hand , Rothwell also finds that Trump supporters are more likely to work in blue-collar fields and to have less education . This fact , however , sits uneasily with Trump ’ s greater support among the wealthy and lower support among the poor , and suggests that his sweet spot is less-educated people in blue-collar fields who are nonetheless doing pretty well economically .
Trump does well in racially segregated areas : Turning to the geographic data , Rothwell finds that segregated , homogenous white areas are Trump 's base of support . `` People living in zip codes with disproportionately high shares of white residents are significantly and robustly more likely to view Trump favorably , '' he writes . `` Those living in zip codes with overall diversity that is low relative to their commuting zone are also far more likely to view Trump favorably . '' Put another way : If you 're in the whitest suburb in your area , you 're likelier to back Trump .
Trump doesn ’ t do well in areas affected by trade or immigration : This is perhaps the most surprising finding . Contact with immigrants seems to reduce one 's likelihood of supporting Trump , as areas that are farther from Mexico and with smaller Hispanic populations saw more Trump support .
Areas with more manufacturing are significantly less likely to support Trump . An increase in the level of manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2007 predicted higher Trump support — which is the opposite of what you 'd expect , given the narrative around this campaign . While the finding is n't statistically significant , greater exposure to Chinese imports predicts lower support for Trump , despite his agitation for higher tariffs on the country .
Trump-friendly areas are struggling in other ways : While individual Trump supporters appear to be doing pretty solid economically , they tend to live in areas that are struggling on two important dimensions .
Rothwell finds that Trump support increases mildly in areas with lower intergenerational mobility , as measured by data from economist Raj Chetty and his team . `` This is not meant to suggest that with undue certainty that growing up in a place that causes lower social mobility causes Trump support , '' Rothwell clarifies . `` This analysis only identifies the correlation . ''
Much stronger is the relationship between Trump support and higher regional white mortality . Overall mortality is also predictive , but nowhere near as much as white mortality , and particularly middle-aged white mortality .
The findings on mobility and white middle-aged mortality are commuting zone level , connected to the wider region in which the respondent lived rather than their specific municipality or neighborhood . That makes it hard to draw too many fine conclusions about how well that regional data reflects the circumstances of the respondent ’ s own life .
Some commentators have speculated that this result implies parents are worried for their children based on how their area as a whole is doing ( even if they personally are doing fine ) . There ’ s nothing in the study suggesting this is the mechanism , but it ’ s potentially plausible .

Also plausible is basically the opposite conclusion : These are relatively well-off less-educated blue collar workers who see poorer blue collar whites who are suffering ( as indicated by low mobility and poor health in the region ) and view them as undeserving recipients of government aid . That ’ s less a story about personal anxiety and more one about class politics between the petit bourgeois and the proletariat .
But the basic point is the straightforward story of Trump supporters as poor whites abandoned by the loss of manufacturing to China is not the case . The story is , at least , much more complicated .

President Trump’s criticism of NATO and NATO nations (which the Left exaggerates and distorts) is on point. He is not “against” NATO, and never has been. He’s just against NATO nations refusing to pay their fair share for their own defense, fobbing both the job and the bill off on American service members and taxpayers. He reiterated his point Monday in a speech before troops of U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.

“We strongly support NATO; we only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper contributions to the NATO alliance, which many of them have not been doing — many of them have not been even close,” Trump said.

Trump is right. NATO countries don’t pay their fair share and never have. Most of their “armies” have about half the fire power of the Tampa Police Department. (If you have a taste for the surreal, allow me to remind you that the Dutch army is unionized.) Europeans would rather spend their money elsewhere, usually on extensive and expensive welfare programs, than on their own defense. They have lost their taste for liberty, if they ever had much. Besides, why spend all that money to defend yourself when Uncle Sucker will do it for you?

This is nothing new. America obliged Larry Thornberry and (fill in the name here of your favorite 70ish fellow who has a DD214, an honorable discharge, and a draft card in his file cabinet), along with countless millions like them, to spend time in uniform to see to it, among other things, that the commie hordes to the east did not overrun Western Europe. While America was drafting its young men in the millions, hardly any European countries troubled theirs with national service. The Brits had national service for a while after The War but ended it in 1960. Germany had it between 1956 and 2011, though it was for just six months and was easy to get out of. Turkey requires a year from its young men. America has truck stops bigger than the other European countries that require military service. As for the Dutch army, which I gather cannot fire its weapons (when its soldiers have them) without permission from their shop stewards, I wouldn’t bet on it with any comfort if it was up against the River City Volunteer Fire Department.

By 1966, when I was going on liberty in various European cities (Malmo, Copenhagen, Gibraltar, Vigo, Genoa, Palma), Europe had been rebuilt and was nearly as prosperous as the U.S. By then it could afford to attend to its own defense, but chose not to use its resources in that way. (See above re: Uncle Sucker.) I watched young European men my age, not in uniform, wearing clothes I could not afford and patronizing restaurants that were beyond my reach on the $164 dollars a month I was pulling in as a third class petty officer (along with, to be fair, all the creamed chipped beef on toast I could eat). I reasonably asked myself then, why am I having to interrupt my life to haul water for these layabouts? (Serving to help defend America I had no problem with.) It grated then. Still does a half century later when nothing has changed. These parasites are still looking the other way when the check arrives at the table. Most European countries spend less on their own defense than Imelda Marcos spent on shoes.

Perhaps the Donald will change this. I’m not optimistic. Europeans officials who would dare attempt to make their countries responsible in this area would doubtless be voted out of office. Europeans are satisfied with allowing Americans to put their backsides on the line so Europeans don’t have to get off theirs.

In the summer of 1966, the destroyer I was on was part of a NATO North Atlantic carrier battle group for a couple of months. This was when some European countries still had remnants of their WWII fleets. We operated with the British carrier HMS Ark Royal and a Dutch cruiser, the name of which I would never try to pronounce, let alone spell. Both of these ships have since been made into razor blades (as has the ship I served on) and have not been, and will not be, replaced. Neither country now has a carrier or a cruiser. Now the Royal Navy is little more than the Royal Coast Guard.

The Royal Navy has more admirals than it has warships. Britannia no longer rules the waves, unless you count the ripples in Elizabeth II’s bath water.

trade,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/09/trump-trade-policy-at-crossroads/,Trump’s Trade Policy at a Crossroads,2019-09-17,"Thomas J. Duesterberg, Jim Geraghty, Kyle Smith, Luke Thompson, Zachary Evans, David French, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Tobias Hoonhout, Kevin D. Williamson","As an election and the threat of a recession loom , the president faces down the problems of China , WTO reform , and a weakened global economic order .
After President Trump ’ s nearly three years in the White House , we can begin to decipher the general outlines of a trade strategy . While moving in the right direction , making up for years of inattention and complacency with regard to the abuse of global rules by China and others , the inconsistent and heavy-handed approach employed by the president threatens to undermine the open-trade-based global economic order and the robust growth of the American economy that has resulted from his more consistent tax , regulatory , and energy policies .
Indeed , the vacillation and unpredictability of Trump ’ s trade policy have raised economic uncertainty to its highest levels since the 2008 recession , which in turn has weakened investment , employment gains , and market confidence . Even though critics from Europe , former U.S. government officials , and card-carrying free-market purists pine for a return to some aspirational “ liberal , rules-based order , ” what is really needed is a much more determined and consistent critique of those countries most responsible for undermining the order that actually does reign , and a clearer concept of the importance of trade strategy to strengthening national security , including long-term economic security .
The most important Trump trade initiative is certainly taking on the long-neglected task of challenging China ’ s systematic disregard of international rules and the basics of fair , reciprocal trade .

As an election and the threat of a recession loom, the president faces down the problems of China, WTO reform, and a weakened global economic order.

After President Trump’s nearly three years in the White House, we can begin to decipher the general outlines of a trade strategy. While moving in the right direction, making up for years of inattention and complacency with regard to the abuse of global rules by China and others, the inconsistent and heavy-handed approach employed by the president threatens to undermine the open-trade-based global economic order and the robust growth of the American economy that has resulted from his more consistent tax, regulatory, and energy policies.

Indeed, the vacillation and unpredictability of Trump’s trade policy have raised economic uncertainty to its highest levels since the 2008 recession, which in turn has weakened investment, employment gains, and market confidence. Even though critics from Europe, former U.S. government officials, and card-carrying free-market purists pine for a return to some aspirational “liberal, rules-based order,” what is really needed is a much more determined and consistent critique of those countries most responsible for undermining the order that actually does reign, and a clearer concept of the importance of trade strategy to strengthening national security, including long-term economic security.

The most important Trump trade initiative is certainly taking on the long-neglected task of challenging China’s systematic disregard of international rules and the basics of fair, reciprocal trade. The confrontation with the world’s rising superpower is fully justified on economic and national-security grounds, especially because the overlap between commercial and security-specific technologies in the contemporary economy continues to grow. Unilateral action on China was necessary because the rules and enforcement history of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are insufficient to address Beijing’s egregious trade and industrial policies.

Williamson","President-elect Donald Trump has shown Republicans how to forge a new electoral college majority by energizing blue-collar voters . His victory , with its demands to restrict trade and immigration , also marks the end of free-market advocates ’ control over the Republican party . But there is a way that these advocates might find common ground with blue-collar Republicans to accelerate wage growth , better fund looming pension benefits without tax increases , and defeat the next iteration of liberalism .
Republicans have always been a coalition of voting minorities , and their share of the vote has been slowly shrinking as the country ’ s demographics have shifted . Trump ’ s blue-collar voters offer the GOP a way to enlarge its base . It won ’ t be easy , however , to find common ground between Trump supporters and traditional free-market Republicans .
As growth has slowed and government spending has reached historic highs , it ’ s no surprise that the beneficiaries of government policies — workers , retirees , newly arriving immigrants , and the poor — have started competing with one another for benefits . Tea-party Republicans want spending cuts to ensure the solvency of their pensions . Blue-collar Trump voters want restrictions on trade and immigration to raise their wages . Both factions fear that government spending slows growth .
It would be easier to find common ground if free-market advocates recognized that an abundance of low-skilled workers can slow wage growth in an economy with constrained resources . Most economists assume that the amount of capital invested per worker largely determines productivity and that productivity determines wages . From this perspective , an abundance of low-skilled workers doesn ’ t slow wage growth when savings don ’ t constrain GDP growth .
But in today ’ s knowledge-based economy , capital no longer drives productivity . Companies such as Google can scale to economy-wide success without much capital . Properly trained talent and the economy ’ s capacity and willingness to bear risk now constrain growth , while savings sit unused despite near-zero interest rates . An increase in low-skilled workers spreads constrained resources — talented supervision , for example — over a greater number of workers . This slows productivity and wage growth , because low-skilled workers don ’ t add to constrained resources in proportion to the demands they place on them .
When manufacturers move plants to Mexico , most economists are confident that opportunistic risk-takers will reemploy displaced workers and that competition between employers will increase investment , productivity , and wages . But properly trained talent has moved to Silicon Valley and outsourced blue-collar employment to Asia , while the engineers who remain design products and factories that increase the productivity and wages of Mexican workers . This brain drain slows low-skilled American productivity and wage growth ; it is no surprise that the wages of displaced manufacturing communities have been stagnant for decades .
Meanwhile , 40 million foreign-born adults and their 20 million native-born adult children , including 35 million predominantly low-skilled Hispanic adults , depend on the same limited pool of talented supervisors and job creators to raise their wages . With these constraints on growth , an increase in low-skilled employment puts downward pressure on wages .
Struggling workers want America to deploy its constrained resources in their behalf and not in behalf of newly arriving low-skilled immigrants and offshore workers . They want high-paying jobs , not handouts . And retiring Baby Boomers , who are expected to increase government spending by 9 percent of GDP over the next 30 years , want reassurance that their pensions will be paid . To dismiss these concerns as racist underestimates their legitimacy .
Despite Trump ’ s good intentions , America can ’ t maximize prosperity and remain competitive by manufacturing something for $ 20 that it can buy for $ 2 .
Despite Trump ’ s good intentions , America can ’ t maximize prosperity and remain competitive by manufacturing something for $ 20 that it can buy for $ 2 . It must trade with low-wage economies . Like innovation , trade increases prosperity by lowering the cost of goods . If displaced workers couldn ’ t find work at higher wages than the now-lower cost of imported goods , the goods wouldn ’ t be cheaper to manufacture offshore . Trade necessarily lowers the cost of goods more than wages , which makes the economy richer as a whole .
But low-skilled workers bear 100 percent of the cost of lower wages , while high-wage workers , retirees , and the non-working poor capture a large portion of the value of cheaper goods . Given this imbalance , it ’ s unclear whether trade benefits low-skilled workers . Anyone claiming to know is either naïve or disingenuous . But given the value of trade , it would be wise for blue-collar Republicans to accept compensatory income redistribution through progressive taxation rather than demanding heavy protectionist restrictions .
Nevertheless , workers needn ’ t endure perennial trade deficits , which reduce the demand for low-wage work , for the country to enjoy the benefits of trade . Trade deficits occur when countries such as Germany lend the U.S. economy the proceeds from the sale of goods to Americans , rather than using them to buy goods made by American workers . To prevent trade deficits from reducing the wages and employment of lower-skilled workers — the economy can always achieve full employment at lower wages — Americans must borrow and spend these savings . But today , savings sit unused despite near-zero interest rates , putting downward pressure on wages as they accumulate .
We could eliminate trade deficits by issuing a dollar of import licenses for every dollar of exports and allowing licenses to be traded freely . Such a simplification would minimize the discretion of policymakers by eliminating the need for tariffs and quotas , which are impossible to manage effectively .
It ’ s worrisome to give policymakers limited control over trade , but trade deficits may be worse . Economics teaches us that the first dollars of imports are much lower-cost than American-made goods ; the last dollars , however — imports in excesses of exports — are virtually the same cost as American-made goods . Were that not the case , we would continue to buy cheaper offshore goods . For little additional benefit to consumers , we allow the rest of the world to dump its unused savings onto America at great cost to low-skilled employment and wages , growth , the stability of banks , and the efficacy of monetary policy . In turn , slow growth inflames demands to increase government spending , restrict free trade , and repudiate an unsympathetic and uncompromising establishment — so much so that these sentiments have overtaken the Republican party . Balanced trade would help mitigate these grievances .
In addition to eliminating trade deficits , we could lower corporate taxes to make America a more competitive place to create jobs , increasing demand for employment and putting upward pressure on wages . We could also increase the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled workers .

Free-market advocates can find common ground with blue-collar workers.

President-elect Donald Trump has shown Republicans how to forge a new electoral college majority by energizing blue-collar voters. His victory, with its demands to restrict trade and immigration, also marks the end of free-market advocates’ control over the Republican party. But there is a way that these advocates might find common ground with blue-collar Republicans to accelerate wage growth, better fund looming pension benefits without tax increases, and defeat the next iteration of liberalism.

Republicans have always been a coalition of voting minorities, and their share of the vote has been slowly shrinking as the country’s demographics have shifted. Trump’s blue-collar voters offer the GOP a way to enlarge its base. It won’t be easy, however, to find common ground between Trump supporters and traditional free-market Republicans.

As growth has slowed and government spending has reached historic highs, it’s no surprise that the beneficiaries of government policies — workers, retirees, newly arriving immigrants, and the poor — have started competing with one another for benefits. Tea-party Republicans want spending cuts to ensure the solvency of their pensions. Blue-collar Trump voters want restrictions on trade and immigration to raise their wages. Both factions fear that government spending slows growth.

It would be easier to find common ground if free-market advocates recognized that an abundance of low-skilled workers can slow wage growth in an economy with constrained resources. Most economists assume that the amount of capital invested per worker largely determines productivity and that productivity determines wages. From this perspective, an abundance of low-skilled workers doesn’t slow wage growth when savings don’t constrain GDP growth.

But in today’s knowledge-based economy, capital no longer drives productivity. Companies such as Google can scale to economy-wide success without much capital. Properly trained talent and the economy’s capacity and willingness to bear risk now constrain growth, while savings sit unused despite near-zero interest rates. An increase in low-skilled workers spreads constrained resources — talented supervision, for example — over a greater number of workers. This slows productivity and wage growth, because low-skilled workers don’t add to constrained resources in proportion to the demands they place on them.

When manufacturers move plants to Mexico, most economists are confident that opportunistic risk-takers will reemploy displaced workers and that competition between employers will increase investment, productivity, and wages. But properly trained talent has moved to Silicon Valley and outsourced blue-collar employment to Asia, while the engineers who remain design products and factories that increase the productivity and wages of Mexican workers. This brain drain slows low-skilled American productivity and wage growth; it is no surprise that the wages of displaced manufacturing communities have been stagnant for decades.

Meanwhile, 40 million foreign-born adults and their 20 million native-born adult children, including 35 million predominantly low-skilled Hispanic adults, depend on the same limited pool of talented supervisors and job creators to raise their wages. With these constraints on growth, an increase in low-skilled employment puts downward pressure on wages.

Struggling workers want America to deploy its constrained resources in their behalf and not in behalf of newly arriving low-skilled immigrants and offshore workers. They want high-paying jobs, not handouts. And retiring Baby Boomers, who are expected to increase government spending by 9 percent of GDP over the next 30 years, want reassurance that their pensions will be paid. To dismiss these concerns as racist underestimates their legitimacy.

Despite Trump’s good intentions, America can’t maximize prosperity and remain competitive by manufacturing something for $20 that it can buy for $2.

Despite Trump’s good intentions, America can’t maximize prosperity and remain competitive by manufacturing something for $20 that it can buy for $2. It must trade with low-wage economies. Like innovation, trade increases prosperity by lowering the cost of goods. If displaced workers couldn’t find work at higher wages than the now-lower cost of imported goods, the goods wouldn’t be cheaper to manufacture offshore. Trade necessarily lowers the cost of goods more than wages, which makes the economy richer as a whole.

But low-skilled workers bear 100 percent of the cost of lower wages, while high-wage workers, retirees, and the non-working poor capture a large portion of the value of cheaper goods. Given this imbalance, it’s unclear whether trade benefits low-skilled workers. Anyone claiming to know is either naïve or disingenuous. But given the value of trade, it would be wise for blue-collar Republicans to accept compensatory income redistribution through progressive taxation rather than demanding heavy protectionist restrictions.

Nevertheless, workers needn’t endure perennial trade deficits, which reduce the demand for low-wage work, for the country to enjoy the benefits of trade. Trade deficits occur when countries such as Germany lend the U.S. economy the proceeds from the sale of goods to Americans, rather than using them to buy goods made by American workers. To prevent trade deficits from reducing the wages and employment of lower-skilled workers — the economy can always achieve full employment at lower wages — Americans must borrow and spend these savings. But today, savings sit unused despite near-zero interest rates, putting downward pressure on wages as they accumulate.

We could eliminate trade deficits by issuing a dollar of import licenses for every dollar of exports and allowing licenses to be traded freely. Such a simplification would minimize the discretion of policymakers by eliminating the need for tariffs and quotas, which are impossible to manage effectively.

It’s worrisome to give policymakers limited control over trade, but trade deficits may be worse. Economics teaches us that the first dollars of imports are much lower-cost than American-made goods; the last dollars, however — imports in excesses of exports — are virtually the same cost as American-made goods. Were that not the case, we would continue to buy cheaper offshore goods. For little additional benefit to consumers, we allow the rest of the world to dump its unused savings onto America at great cost to low-skilled employment and wages, growth, the stability of banks, and the efficacy of monetary policy. In turn, slow growth inflames demands to increase government spending, restrict free trade, and repudiate an unsympathetic and uncompromising establishment — so much so that these sentiments have overtaken the Republican party. Balanced trade would help mitigate these grievances.

In addition to eliminating trade deficits, we could lower corporate taxes to make America a more competitive place to create jobs, increasing demand for employment and putting upward pressure on wages. We could also increase the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled workers. Talented innovators, entrepreneurs, and supervisors create employment and increase productivity, which also puts upward pressure on wages.

Restricting low-skilled immigration would achieve this effect, but it would also reduce production and slow growth. A more effective policy would recognize that the cost of retiring Baby Boomers, China’s eventual military threat, and federal debt at 75 percent of GDP necessitate faster growth than America can achieve organically. Doubling the number of full-time, 95th-percentile, ultra-high-skilled workers from 5.5 million to 11 million might double America’s growth rate and tax revenues. Unlike most other taxpayers, these workers pay significantly more in taxes than they consume in government services. With America already issuing over 1 million green cards per year, a doubling is achievable. By refusing to replace low-skilled immigration with ultra-high-skilled immigration, Democrats have squandered America’s most significant opportunity for growth. Republicans must capitalize on this forgone opportunity.

Every faction of the Republican coalition must recognize that, in the next election, Democrats will compete fiercely for the blue-collar voters they have neglected. To build an enduring alliance with these new Republican voters, free-market advocates must find common ground with them and use it to both accelerate wage growth and increase tax revenues without tax increases.

The Chinese government said Friday it ""immediately"" retaliated against increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports as President Donald Trump's administration effectively launched a trade war with its most important trading partner.

China’s foreign ministry in Beijing said that tit-for-tat duties on U.S. goods took effect straight away after Washington’s 25 percent tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods kicked in at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Friday.

The ministry gave few other details.

Beijing had previously flagged that China would make a ""necessary counterattack"" if needed on a similar amount of U.S. exports including soybeans and cars. The U.S. levies mostly target China's industrial goods and some electronic components. A long list of targeted Chinese products directly purchased by Americans such as TVs, printers and washing machines was sharply revised in June following a trade hearing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 600 points Friday after the latest escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China rattled investors . The broad sell-off sent the S & P 500 to its fourth straight weekly loss .
Stocks tumbled after President Donald Trump responded angrily on Twitter following China ’ s announcement of new tariffs on $ 75 billion in U.S. goods . In one of his tweets he “ hereby ordered ” U.S. companies with operations in China to consider moving them to other countries — including the U.S .
Trump also said he ’ d respond directly to the tariffs — and after the market closed he delivered , announcing that the U.S. would increase existing tariffs on $ 250 billion in Chinese goods to 30 % from 25 % , and that new tariffs on another $ 300 billion of imports would be 15 % instead of 10 % . Those announcements are likely to influence stock markets in Asia when trading opens there Monday .
Friday ’ s developments mark the latest escalation of an ongoing trade dispute between Washington and Beijing that has given investors whiplash as they try to assess its potential impact on the global economy . The tweets from Trump around 11 a.m. ignited a wave of selling as investors fled stocks in favor of U.S. government bonds , pushing yields higher . The price of gold also rose .
“ The market is spooked by the escalation in the trade war , ” said Janet Johnston , portfolio manager at TrimTabs Asset Management . “ Investors are looking for an endgame and we haven ’ t seen it yet . ”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 600 points Friday after the latest escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China rattled investors. The broad sell-off sent the S&P 500 to its fourth straight weekly loss.

Stocks tumbled after President Donald Trump responded angrily on Twitter following China’s announcement of new tariffs on $75 billion in U.S. goods. In one of his tweets he “hereby ordered” U.S. companies with operations in China to consider moving them to other countries — including the U.S.

Trump also said he’d respond directly to the tariffs — and after the market closed he delivered, announcing that the U.S. would increase existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30% from 25%, and that new tariffs on another $300 billion of imports would be 15% instead of 10%. Those announcements are likely to influence stock markets in Asia when trading opens there Monday.

Friday’s developments mark the latest escalation of an ongoing trade dispute between Washington and Beijing that has given investors whiplash as they try to assess its potential impact on the global economy. The tweets from Trump around 11 a.m. ignited a wave of selling as investors fled stocks in favor of U.S. government bonds, pushing yields higher. The price of gold also rose.

“The market is spooked by the escalation in the trade war,” said Janet Johnston, portfolio manager at TrimTabs Asset Management. “Investors are looking for an endgame and we haven’t seen it yet.”

The S&P 500 fell 75.84 points, or 2.6%, to 2,847.11. The index is now down 4.5% for the month. It’s still up 13.6% for the year.

The Dow lost 623.34 points, or 2.4%, to 25,628.90. The average briefly dropped 745 points. The Dow has had five declines of 2% or more this year, with three of them coming this month.

The Nasdaq gave up 239.62 points, or 3%, to 7,751.77. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks skidded 46.52 points, or 3.1%, to 1,459.49.

Trump also said Friday morning that he was “ordering” UPS, Federal Express and Amazon to block any deliveries from China of the powerful opioid drug fentanyl. The stocks of all three companies fell as traders tried to assess the possible implications.

President Donald Trump plans to proceed with duties on roughly $200 billion more worth in Chinese goods as soon as Monday, a senior administration official confirmed Saturday, escalating what has already become a protracted trade battle between the world’s two largest economies.

The White House could announce on Monday or Tuesday that it will slap a 10 percent tariff rate on the $200 billion list of goods, the official told POLITICO. But those tariffs could reach as high as 25 percent, as Trump proposed last month increasing the tariff rate.

“We’ll start at 10,” the official said.

The administration has threatened these set of tariffs for months as punishment for China’s policies that have resulted in intellectual property theft or mandated technology transfers on U.S. companies doing business there. A public comment period on Trump's latest set of tariffs formally ended last week, clearing the way for the president to make good on the threat.

In recent months, the administration has typically done an analysis of public comments before carrying through on announced tariffs, which right now are imposed on about $53 billion in Chinese imports. But Trump’s remarks in recent weeks have indicated that he does not want to delay his plan.

However, pressure from American businesses may have succeeded in the administration restraining its fire just a bit in the latest round. Many businesses had urged Trump to consider the effects of the tariffs on consumers, especially ahead of the retail holiday season.

""Continuing the tit-for-tat tariff escalation with China only serves to expand the harm to more U.S. economic interests, including farmers, families, business, and workers,"" the National Retail Federation and 150 other business groups said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this month.

The president has also threatened to impose tariffs on virtually all $505 billion that the United States imports from China. “I hate to say that, but behind that, there’s another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One last week.

In Cumberland , a town of about 2,200 residents in rural northwest Wisconsin , Ardisam Inc. has warned U.S. trade officials of the harm that a 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods could have on its business and the community .
Ardisam is one of the town ’ s largest employers , and over 58 years , its product line has grown to include hunting and fishing gear , garden equipment and the Yardbird Chicken Plucker for home poultry enthusiasts .
If left in place , the tariff stands to “ completely eliminate ” the profit on some products , according to the company .
“ Put simply , two things could happen … the consumer will end up paying the tariff , or Ardisam will discontinue selling these products and reduce its workforce accordingly to adjust to the reduction in business , ” company President Michael Furseth said in a letter this summer to U.S. trade officials .
“ Under either scenario , individual Americans will suffer . In a town the size of Cumberland , the result of a workforce reduction would have a disproportionately negative impact on the entire community , ” Furseth said .
The company added 42 jobs in the last three years in Cumberland , where it has about 140 employees . While most of its manufacturing is done in Asia , the jobs in Cumberland have an average wage of $ 52,000 a year .
Ardisam says it can ’ t easily sidestep the tariffs by finding other suppliers for things like electric log splitters .
“ There is currently no large-scale manufacturing of these products happening in the U.S. , and the amount of time and resources necessary to establish this level of manufacturing would undoubtedly jeopardize the industry as a whole and particularly Ardisam ’ s business and jobs in Cumberland , ” Furseth said .
In Genoa City , a town of about 3,100 in Walworth County , Wisconsin , Electronic Specialties imports from China testing equipment , such as multi-volt meters used by automotive mechanics and homeowners .
“ Maybe some people are absorbing the tariffs , but it ’ s hard to believe they could do that and stay in business , ” said company president Steve White .
Electronic Specialties has only 10 employees . But that doesn ’ t preclude layoffs should its profit sink from rising costs .
“ I know that if I were to lay someone off , it would be a big blow to their life , ” White said .
Trump 's supporters say the short-term pain that some companies are feeling from the trade wars will be offset by the negotiation of better trade deals . And , supporters say , the U.S. is long overdue in standing up against practices such as China 's theft of American technology .
Even permanent higher tariffs on foreign-made goods wouldn ’ t be bad , supporters say , if it encourages companies to bring work to the U.S .
“ It ’ s better to make these moves now while the economy is strong , ” said Van Mobley , a Concordia University associate professor of history who follows trade issues .
“ I think some of the tariffs on China are here to stay . … I wouldn ’ t bet on the Chinese making the changes we want , ” Mobley said .
Manufacturers say they ’ re looking at every option to mitigate trade war damage . That could include sourcing products elsewhere to get around tariffs .
“ As we move forward , everything is on the table , particularly with new programs where we haven ’ t set up the manufacturing yet , ” said Austin Ramirez , president and chief executive officer of HUSCO International , in Waukesha . HUSCO manufactures components used in the automotive and construction equipment industries .
Ramirez said the higher tariffs have cost his company about $ 1 million a month .

“ We ’ ve had a conversation with one of customers , debating how long we think the tariffs are going to be around . And the estimate was from six months to forever , ” VanderZanden said .
Amerequip , which has 360 employees , has nearly tripled its annual revenue since 2012 to about $ 90 million this year .

The U.S. economy has been doing well enough that manufacturers and retailers have been able to absorb some of the rising costs , but it 's getting harder to do as the full weight of new tariffs settles in , according to Slater .
As early as Christmas , shoppers may see some higher prices as the impact of trade wars is felt in the marketplace .

'Individual Americans will suffer'

In Cumberland, a town of about 2,200 residents in rural northwest Wisconsin, Ardisam Inc. has warned U.S. trade officials of the harm that a 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods could have on its business and the community.

Ardisam is one of the town’s largest employers, and over 58 years, its product line has grown to include hunting and fishing gear, garden equipment and the Yardbird Chicken Plucker for home poultry enthusiasts.

If left in place, the tariff stands to “completely eliminate” the profit on some products, according to the company.

“Put simply, two things could happen … the consumer will end up paying the tariff, or Ardisam will discontinue selling these products and reduce its workforce accordingly to adjust to the reduction in business,” company President Michael Furseth said in a letter this summer to U.S. trade officials.

“Under either scenario, individual Americans will suffer. In a town the size of Cumberland, the result of a workforce reduction would have a disproportionately negative impact on the entire community,” Furseth said.

The company added 42 jobs in the last three years in Cumberland, where it has about 140 employees. While most of its manufacturing is done in Asia, the jobs in Cumberland have an average wage of $52,000 a year.

Ardisam says it can’t easily sidestep the tariffs by finding other suppliers for things like electric log splitters.

“Maybe some people are absorbing the tariffs, but it’s hard to believe they could do that and stay in business,” said company president Steve White.

Electronic Specialties has only 10 employees. But that doesn’t preclude layoffs should its profit sink from rising costs.

“I know that if I were to lay someone off, it would be a big blow to their life,” White said.

Will pain be worth it?

Trump's supporters say the short-term pain that some companies are feeling from the trade wars will be offset by the negotiation of better trade deals. And, supporters say, the U.S. is long overdue in standing up against practices such as China's theft of American technology.

Even permanent higher tariffs on foreign-made goods wouldn’t be bad, supporters say, if it encourages companies to bring work to the U.S.

“It’s better to make these moves now while the economy is strong,” said Van Mobley, a Concordia University associate professor of history who follows trade issues.

“I think some of the tariffs on China are here to stay. … I wouldn’t bet on the Chinese making the changes we want,” Mobley said.

There's a lot of uncertainty, said Mike VanderZanden, president of Amerequip Corp., a manufacturer in Kiel, in northeast Wisconsin.

“We’ve had a conversation with one of customers, debating how long we think the tariffs are going to be around. And the estimate was from six months to forever,” VanderZanden said.

Amerequip, which has 360 employees, has nearly tripled its annual revenue since 2012 to about $90 million this year.

But in the last six months it’s been hit with 30 percent higher costs for steel as domestic and foreign suppliers alike have raised prices in a global marketplace.

What started as a trickle is now more like a flood, said Dennis Slater, president of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, a Milwaukee-based trade group representing construction and agricultural machinery companies.

CLOSE President Donald Trump brought the world's two biggest economies to the brink of a trade war Friday by announcing a 25 percent tariff on up to $50 billion in Chinese imports to take effect July 6. Here's how it could affect the U.S. economy and consumers. (June 15) AP

The U.S. economy has been doing well enough that manufacturers and retailers have been able to absorb some of the rising costs, but it's getting harder to do as the full weight of new tariffs settles in, according to Slater.

As early as Christmas, shoppers may see some higher prices as the impact of trade wars is felt in the marketplace.

That's left consumer product companies nervous.

""It scares the hell out of me, to be perfectly honest, because I don't know how the consumer is going to react,"" said Marc Stevermer, director of operations for La Crosse Technology, the maker of home-based weather stations and other products.

Companies such as La Crosse could hold off on raising their product prices, hoping the new tariffs disappear, but that strategy could backfire should the trade wars continue to erode their profits.

""We would be marching ourselves off a cliff,"" Stevermer said.

Even the cost of a good night's sleep may go up, as baby cribs and mattresses are caught in the trade war with China.

Delta Children's Products Corp. has a mattress factory and product design center in Neenah, in Wisconsin's Fox Valley. The New York-based company says it is the world's largest maker of baby cribs.

Many of its products and raw materials are imported from China.

The tariffs are making it harder for families to afford a new crib, said Joseph Shamie, Delta Children's president.

""Now, more moms are going to turn to less safe hand-me-downs,"" he said.

To sidestep the tariffs, the company has looked at moving manufacturing from China.

But that would take at least a year, Shamie said, and it would be a costly endeavor to establish another factory and line up suppliers.

""If we invest in the changes, and the tariffs go away, then we have wasted a lot of time and money. But if we don't, and the tariffs continue, we have a huge problem,"" he said.

China is demanding the release of telecoms giant Huawei's chief financial officer, who has been detained in Canada.

She was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December, but the news was not made public at her request.

China says her detention is possibly a rights abuse.

Ms Meng has sought a publication ban on the details of the arrest, which has been granted by the courts.

Huawei said it was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"".

Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung.

The gloves are off

By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia Business Correspondent

It is hard to overstate the symbolism and significance of this event. Huawei is the crown jewel of Chinese tech and Ms Meng is effectively its princess.

Even though it's still not clear what the charges against her are, this is not simply a case about the arrest of one woman, or just one company.

This arrest could materially damage the relationship between the US and China at possibly one of the most sensitive times between the two countries in their long and torrid history.

The gloves are off. Things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse.

What could be behind it?

US media reported that Huawei is under investigation for potential violations of US sanctions against Iran.

One report in the New York Times said the US commerce and treasury departments had subpoenaed the firm over suspected violation of sanctions against both Iran and North Korea.

US lawmakers have repeatedly accused the company of being a threat to US national security, arguing that its technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government.

Meanwhile, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Thursday that he had known in advance about Ms Meng's arrest.

He told National Public Radio that he didn't know if President Donald Trump had also been aware.

In a statement, Huawei said it had complied with ""all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.""

The arrest is a top trending topic on Chinese social media, BBC Monitoring says, with many users criticising the US and Canada for what they call ""low"" and ""bullying"" tactics.

Why is Huawei a concern to the West?

Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control.

It's A Beast,2015-05-26,Danielle Kurtzleben,"Just How Big Is The Asia Trade Deal Obama Wants ? It 's A Beast
One of the most basic facts about the Trans-Pacific Partnership is also the most important : It 's huge .
The trade deal got over a big hurdle Friday when the Senate voted in favor of giving the Obama administration `` fast-track '' authority to negotiate the deal with Canada and 10 Asian nations .
That leaves the U.S. House , and it 's unclear it has the votes yet . If it passes , though , TPP , which has angered many in the president 's party , would be by far the largest free trade agreement the U.S. has in effect .
The 12 nations involved in TPP make up about 36 percent of global gross domestic product , or GDP , according to data from the International Monetary Fund . That sets the TPP well apart from the 14 free trade agreements the U.S. currently has in effect with 20 countries ( to be fair , the U.S. accounts for nearly 23 percent of global GDP by itself ) .
Not only that , but these nations together account for about one-third of global trade , according to the Brookings Institution .
So the TPP stands apart from other trade agreements in its size . But that 's only one dimension of its impact . Another way the TPP is gargantuan is tougher to quantify in a bar graph : its scope . It not only covers basic trade issues like tariffs , but also a variety of other areas like labor and environmental and intellectual property .
Politics White House Pushes For Fast-Track Trade Authority White House Pushes For Fast-Track Trade Authority Listen · 2:55 2:55

One of the most basic facts about the Trans-Pacific Partnership is also the most important: It's huge.

The trade deal got over a big hurdle Friday when the Senate voted in favor of giving the Obama administration ""fast-track"" authority to negotiate the deal with Canada and 10 Asian nations.

That leaves the U.S. House, and it's unclear it has the votes yet. If it passes, though, TPP, which has angered many in the president's party, would be by far the largest free trade agreement the U.S. has in effect.

The 12 nations involved in TPP make up about 36 percent of global gross domestic product, or GDP, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. That sets the TPP well apart from the 14 free trade agreements the U.S. currently has in effect with 20 countries (to be fair, the U.S. accounts for nearly 23 percent of global GDP by itself).

Not only that, but these nations together account for about one-third of global trade, according to the Brookings Institution.

So the TPP stands apart from other trade agreements in its size. But that's only one dimension of its impact. Another way the TPP is gargantuan is tougher to quantify in a bar graph: its scope. It not only covers basic trade issues like tariffs, but also a variety of other areas like labor and environmental and intellectual property.

Agribusiness companies, for example, are excited about having new avenues for their products. The labor and environmental provisions, the administration also argues, will force other nations to up their game on those issues, ""leveling the playing field.""

Doctors Without Borders has also argued the deal could make for more expensive generic drugs, restricting access to medicine for some consumers.

However, some wish the pact went further — environmental groups like the Sierra Club, for example, believe the provisions won't do enough to address overfishing.

But then, no one outside members of Congress, negotiators and a small group of cleared individuals has access to the pact, so it's hard to know exactly how far it will (or won't) go.

If Congress grants the administration fast-track (also known as Trade Promotion Authority), it will mean two to four months for public comment before Congress gives the deal an up-or-down vote, with no amendments or debate.

'' Finally , on Wednesday , the president tweeted that `` Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely , but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion . ''
I am not sure what Trump means by `` a different structure . '' Nor am I sure what a new framework would require . And I 'm certainly not sure there 's any upside to trying to make sense of all these conflicting statements .
Did the Chinese commit to the reduction of their bilateral `` trade surplus '' with the U.S. ? Maybe . Are they committing to lowering their tariffs on American cars ? Probably . Will the Chinese agree to changes in rules on foreign investment and ownership in China ? Sounds like it . Will they stick to their commitments ? Maybe , maybe not .
Yet one thing is sure : To the extent that China reduces its tariffs on some U.S. products and , in turn , America holds back on imposing tariffs on Chinese products , American and Chinese consumers will be the true winners of these negotiations . But not in the way many people think .
Reduced American tariffs on imports from China are great for the American people . Some Chinese exporters will also gain , but the bulk of the benefits will be reaped by consumers in the U.S . The same goes for China : The gains from reducing their tariffs on American exports will accrue overwhelmingly to Chinese consumers .
Let 's suppose that the only way to truly satisfy the Trump administration 's protectionists , and hence to put a permanent end to the threat of a trade war , is for China to increase purchases of U.S. goods by an annual $ 200 billion in order to zero out the trade deficit . This is not a far-fetched assumption , since it was the ███ administration officials gave last week after the original announcement of the US-China detente .
That means they 'll probably be disappointed . The Chinese government can make all the promises it wants about lowering its tariffs on American products , thus increasing demands for US goods . But those promises do not come close to assuring a reduction of the bilateral trade deficit , despite the fact that a reduction of Chinese tariffs would certainly increase Chinese purchases of U.S. goods .
Bilateral trade imbalances are meaningless because trade is global , not bilateral . That 's why it 's called globalization .
Suppose that there are only three countries : the U.S. , China , and France . In 2018 , Americans buy $ 1 billion of steel from the Chinese ; the Chinese buy $ 1 billion of wine from France ; and the French buy $ 1 billion of lumber from America . Each country 's current account would be balanced—that is , it exports the same amount that it imports . But each country will still have a bilateral trade deficit with another country .
Now suppose that in 2019 China reduces some tariffs it has against exports from America . The Chinese then , in 2019 , buy $ 500 million of lumber from America . From where , we must ask , did China get this $ 500 million ? After all , dollars do n't fall from the sky , and Chinese people have to acquire them one way or another before they can spend them .
One possibility is that China has increased the amount of steel it sold to Americans that year to $ 1.5 billion . In that case , the Chinese would spend $ 500 million on American lumber and ( we may assume ) the remaining $ 1 billion of its export earnings , as in 2018 , on wine from France . The French , as in 2018 , spend $ 1 billion buying American lumber .
In the above hypothetical example , America 's bilateral trade deficit with China would remain in 2019 the same as it was in 2018— $ 1 billion—even though the Chinese bought more American exports .
Each country continues to have an overall current account that is technically `` balanced . '' We Americans in 2019 do export more lumber , but we also import more steel . The additional jobs created in the U.S. by the reduction of Chinese tariffs are offset by additional jobs destroyed : More Americans work in the lumber industry and fewer in the steel industry .
Things could play out many different ways if the Chinese were in fact going to buy more U.S. exports . We can find many scenarios in which America 's trade deficit with China falls on paper . Indeed , it 's even possible to describe realistic scenarios in which America 's trade deficit with China rises .

EU officials have been giving more details of the deal brokered in Washington.

It will report at the end of November - after the midterm elections in the US.

The pledge to buy more American soybeans is actually a promise not to interfere in market forces that mean the EU is buying more anyway. ""We are not turning into a Soviet-style economy,"" said an official.

trade,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/donald-trump-nafta-232992,Trump could hit a brick wall on NAFTA,2016-12-28,"Doug Palmer, Lorraine Woellert, Ben White, Isaac Arnsdorf","President-elect Donald Trump may have ridden to the White House on a wave of working-class hatred for NAFTA , but he ’ s going to find it tough to deliver on his promise to scrap the trade agreement that he blames for sending U.S. jobs abroad .
Dramatically changing the pact could instead threaten 14 million American jobs that rely on trade with Canada and Mexico and send tremors throughout the North American business community , which has invested billions of dollars in developing ways to manufacture everything from cars and airplanes to pharmaceutical products using labor from multiple countries .
“ There could be some tectonic shifts , ” said Dan Ikenson , director of the trade policy center at the free-market Cato Institute . “ The slightest hint that things are going to be disrupted could cause capital flight from the U.S . ”
Trump ’ s contempt for NAFTA has been a cornerstone of his message to the working-class voters who elected him . The pact was forged by an earlier generation of Republican leaders , including President George H.W . Bush , Secretary of State James Baker and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills , before being signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994 .
But few business groups are clamoring for a renegotiation , and many are warning that Trump ’ s threat to withdraw from NAFTA will actually cause the loss of millions of industrial jobs instead of saving them .
“ You want to get rid of NAFTA ? ” U.S. Chamber of Commerce Tom Donohue asked in an interview with Fox News earlier this year . “ NAFTA is 14 million jobs in the United States . ”
Meanwhile , the National Association of Manufacturers calls NAFTA “ a boost to U.S. manufacturing competitiveness . ”
“ We look forward to working with government officials — the incoming administration , leaders in Mexico and Canada — on possible improvements to reduce barriers and improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness given the agreement is now over 20 years old , '' Linda Dempsey , vice president of international economic affairs at the manufacturers group , wrote in an email . `` At the same time , it is critical not to put at risk the 2 million U.S. manufacturing workers whose jobs rely on U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico . ”
So far , Trump has offered few details about what changes he ’ d like to make to the pact , other than threatening to withdraw from it entirely unless Mexico and Canada agree to new terms . Business groups are hoping they can persuade him to instead “ fix ” the agreement in ways that will benefit them .
In an ironic twist , many business groups hope Trump will steal ideas from another trade agreement — the Trans-Pacific Partnership — as he seeks to upgrade NAFTA . That should be possible , since both Canada and Mexico are part of the 12-nation deal that Trump is vowing to jettison on his first day in office . They ’ d like to see rules similar to those in the TPP covering digital trade and the movement of electronic business data across borders , concerns that didn ’ t exist when negotiators crafted NAFTA .
Meanwhile , whatever Trump decides to do on NAFTA , it won ’ t be as easy as simply issuing an edict . He ’ ll have to work closely with his counterparts in Mexico and Canada .
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have each indicated their willingness to revisit parts of NAFTA , but they have some leverage considering the estimated 9 million American jobs that depend on trade with Canada and the 5 million that depend on trade with Mexico . And they won ’ t stand for tariffs or other punitive measures that Trump has suggested .
Canada and Mexico are the second- and third-largest markets for U.S. farm goods , behind China . The three North American countries are also closely integrated in many manufacturing sectors , such as autos and steel , making any talk of U.S. tariff hikes to bring jobs back to the United States a double-edged sword because it could make the entire region less competitive .
“ What we ’ re looking for is to move forward , not backtracking , ” Kenneth Smith Ramos , head of Mexico ’ s trade and NAFTA office in Washington , told ███ Pro earlier this month . “ So , anything involving [ an ] increase in tariffs , anything along those lines , we feel is a big detriment .

Dramatically changing the pact could instead threaten 14 million American jobs that rely on trade with Canada and Mexico and send tremors throughout the North American business community, which has invested billions of dollars in developing ways to manufacture everything from cars and airplanes to pharmaceutical products using labor from multiple countries.

“There could be some tectonic shifts,” said Dan Ikenson, director of the trade policy center at the free-market Cato Institute. “The slightest hint that things are going to be disrupted could cause capital flight from the U.S.”

Trump’s contempt for NAFTA has been a cornerstone of his message to the working-class voters who elected him. The pact was forged by an earlier generation of Republican leaders, including President George H.W. Bush, Secretary of State James Baker and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, before being signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994.

But few business groups are clamoring for a renegotiation, and many are warning that Trump’s threat to withdraw from NAFTA will actually cause the loss of millions of industrial jobs instead of saving them.

“You want to get rid of NAFTA?” U.S. Chamber of Commerce Tom Donohue asked in an interview with Fox News earlier this year. “NAFTA is 14 million jobs in the United States.”

Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers calls NAFTA “a boost to U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.”

“We look forward to working with government officials — the incoming administration, leaders in Mexico and Canada — on possible improvements to reduce barriers and improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness given the agreement is now over 20 years old,"" Linda Dempsey, vice president of international economic affairs at the manufacturers group, wrote in an email. ""At the same time, it is critical not to put at risk the 2 million U.S. manufacturing workers whose jobs rely on U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico.”

So far, Trump has offered few details about what changes he’d like to make to the pact, other than threatening to withdraw from it entirely unless Mexico and Canada agree to new terms. Business groups are hoping they can persuade him to instead “fix” the agreement in ways that will benefit them.

In an ironic twist, many business groups hope Trump will steal ideas from another trade agreement — the Trans-Pacific Partnership — as he seeks to upgrade NAFTA. That should be possible, since both Canada and Mexico are part of the 12-nation deal that Trump is vowing to jettison on his first day in office. They’d like to see rules similar to those in the TPP covering digital trade and the movement of electronic business data across borders, concerns that didn’t exist when negotiators crafted NAFTA.

Meanwhile, whatever Trump decides to do on NAFTA, it won’t be as easy as simply issuing an edict. He’ll have to work closely with his counterparts in Mexico and Canada.

Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have each indicated their willingness to revisit parts of NAFTA, but they have some leverage considering the estimated 9 million American jobs that depend on trade with Canada and the 5 million that depend on trade with Mexico. And they won’t stand for tariffs or other punitive measures that Trump has suggested.

Canada and Mexico are the second- and third-largest markets for U.S. farm goods, behind China. The three North American countries are also closely integrated in many manufacturing sectors, such as autos and steel, making any talk of U.S. tariff hikes to bring jobs back to the United States a double-edged sword because it could make the entire region less competitive.

“What we’re looking for is to move forward, not backtracking,” Kenneth Smith Ramos, head of Mexico’s trade and NAFTA office in Washington, told POLITICO Pro earlier this month. “So, anything involving [an] increase in tariffs, anything along those lines, we feel is a big detriment. It’s shooting ourselves in the foot.”

The veteran trade negotiator said he would also like to remind the incoming Trump administration that Canada and Mexico are the top two export destinations for the United States, taking in more than $500 billion in U.S. goods each year.

“We are your top clients,” Ramos said. “Mexico is not a country that simply comes to ask for concessions from the United States. We work together with the U.S. We sell a lot to the U.S., but we buy more from the U.S. than all the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries combined and all of Western Europe combined.

“The United States has been losing, for many years, 600 to 800 Billion Dollars a year on Trade,” Mr. Trump tweeted Monday. “With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry, we’re not going to be doing that anymore!”

It marked a sharp change in tone for the president, who had been saying publicly in recent weeks that he intended to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the White House soon, suggesting a final agreement was near.

Sources familiar with the talks said Mr. Trump issued the threat after learning from Mr. Lighthizer that China was trying to back out of a commitment to change Chinese law to reflect the terms of the anticipated trade deal.

The dispute has major implications for provisions of the deal aimed at ending China’s practice of forcing U.S. companies doing business there to reveal proprietary technologies and other intellectual property, Bloomberg reported.

Previously, Mr. Trump had postponed deadlines for a trade agreement in an effort to buy more time for negotiations. But on Sunday, he complained on Twitter that a deal with Beijing was coming “too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!”

China’s financial markets dropped sharply Monday following Mr. Trump’s tariff warning, leading Asian markets down. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 5.6% and the Shenzhen stock exchange dropped 7.4% — their biggest single-day losses since 2016.

U.S. stock markets fell sharply, 450 points at the opening bell Monday, but pared most of their losses throughout the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 66.47 points, or 0.25%, to finish at 26,438.48.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 0.50%, and the S&P 500 ended the day down 0.45%.

Germany’s stock exchange fell 1.01%.

During a Rose Garden ceremony at mid-day honoring the Army military academy’s football team, Mr. Trump said the country is “setting records — over 100 days of stock market wins.”

“And our unemployment numbers are the best in 51 years,” Mr. Trump said.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He had called for talks to resume when Trump pressed him for details during a bilateral meeting later in the afternoon with the Indian prime minister . It was not immediately clear , however , if Mnuchin was referring to a phone call Liu made to U.S. officials or his comments at a technology conference earlier in the day .
Trump reiterated Monday that China wants to reach a deal on trade “ very badly , ” repeating claims that the country ‘ s economy is bending under the pressure of U.S. tariffs .
“ I think they want to make a deal . I 'm not sure they have a choice . And I do n't say that as a threat , ” he said in a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron .
But the confusion continued over whether a call between U.S. and Chinese officials actually took place and if so , when it occurred . In addition , no date for an expected round of high-level talks in September has been announced .
`` We 've had many calls , '' Trump said Monday , when pressed by a reporter on the issue . `` Secretary Mnuchin is here , and [ he 's ] had many calls over the last 24 hours , but certainly over the last 48 hours . We 've had many calls , not just one . These are high-level calls . They want to make a deal . And by the way , I think a deal is going to be made . ''
Macron said Trump , in private meetings with other G-7 leaders , “ clearly showed us his willingness to arrive at an agreement “ with China .
“ What 's bad for the world economy is uncertainty and the quicker an agreement is arrived at , the quicker that uncertainty will dissipate , ” Macron said . “ That 's what we discussed yesterday and that 's the American president 's wish. “
Trump ’ s whiplash-inducing comments come just 24 hours after White House officials — seeking to clarify a statement the president made about having second thoughts on his escalating trade war — said his only “ regret ” was that he didn ’ t raise tariffs further on Chinese imports . That claim followed Trump ’ s announcement Friday that he planned to increase existing tariffs on $ 250 billion of Chinese goods , from 25 percent to 30 percent , and to hike a new round of tariffs on another $ 300 billion in Chinese exports from 10 percent to 15 percent .
Asked about the mixed signals coming out of the White House , Trump shrugged and said : `` Sorry , it 's the way I negotiate ... It 's done very well for me over the years and it 's doing better for the country . ''
Then , he again blamed his predecessors for allowing China to run up a huge trade surplus with the United States and failing to take strong steps to deal with unfair trade practices and the theft of U.S. intellectual property .
Adding to the confusion , Trump projected an air of indifference over the past several days about whether a deal would be reached because of the tariff revenue now being collected on Chinese imports .
“ I ’ m getting a lot of money in tariffs . It ’ s coming in by the billions , ” Trump told reporters here Sunday morning , adding that he believes China wants “ to make a deal much more than I do . ”
The president also opened the door to using his executive powers to declare a national emergency with respect to China ’ s trade practices , saying , however , that he currently has no plans to do so .
“ It has become unquestionably clear that the administration ’ s tariff war against China is politically motivated . What Washington wants from its largest trade partner is for it to be content to play second fiddle and meekly do as it demands , ” China Daily , a state-owned newspaper , wrote in an editorial on Sunday .
By Monday , however , both U.S. and Chinese officials appeared open to resuming talks on trade — that is , as long as such discussions remain “ calm , ” Liu said at a conference in China .
“ We think an escalation of the trade war is against the interest of China , the U.S. and the entire world , ” said Liu , who is China ’ s top trade negotiator .
Trump said he appreciated Liu 's call for discussions to remain calm and said he felt the same way , even though it was the United States that ratcheted up tensions in recent weeks by announcing a new round of tariff increases .
`` I thought it was a beautiful statement , '' Trump said in response to Liu . `` I thought it indicated a lot . ''
Liu added that China “ will strive to protect the integrity of industrial chains , ” an element of the trade dispute that Trump mentioned earlier in the day .
“ They have supply chains that are unbelievably intricate and people are leaving and they are going to other countries , including the United States , by the way , ” Trump said .
Many household U.S. companies have supply chains in China , where major disruptions have occurred as a result of the ongoing trade war . On Monday , Trump suggested the U.S. is “ going to get a lot of ” production back if his administration reaches a deal with the Chinese .
Liu , who never mentioned whether phone conversations took place , said Beijing is “ willing to solve the problem through consultation and cooperation with a calm attitude . ”

The 25 % levy came into effect at midnight Washington time .
China has retaliated by imposing a similar 25 % tariff on 545 US products , also worth a total of $ 34bn .
Beijing accused the US of starting the `` largest trade war in economic history '' .
`` After the US activated its tariff measures against China , China 's measures against the US took effect immediately , '' said Lu Kang , a foreign ministry spokesman .
Two companies in Shanghai told the BBC that customs authorities were delaying clearance processes for US imports on Friday .
The American tariffs are the result of President Donald Trump 's bid to protect US jobs and stop `` unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China '' .
The White House said it would consult on tariffs on another $ 16bn of products , which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month .
The imposition of the tariffs had little impact on Asian stock markets . The Shanghai Composite closed 0.5 % higher , but ended the week 3.5 % lower - its seventh consecutive week of losses .
Tokyo closed 1.1 % higher , but Hong Kong fell 0.5 % in late trading .
Hikaru Sato at Daiwa Securities said markets had already factored in the impact of the first round of tariffs .
Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels , and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union , Mexico and Canada .
He has also threatened a 10 % levy on an additional $ 200bn of Chinese goods if Beijng `` refuses to change its practices '' .
The president upped the stakes on Thursday , saying the amount of goods subject to tariffs could rise to more than $ 500bn .
`` You have another 16 [ billion dollars ] in two weeks , and then , as you know , we have $ 200bn in abeyance and then after the $ 200bn , we have $ 300bn in abeyance . OK ? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300 , '' he said .

US tariffs on $34bn (£25.7bn) of Chinese goods have come into effect, signalling the start of a trade war between the world's two largest economies.

The 25% levy came into effect at midnight Washington time.

China has retaliated by imposing a similar 25% tariff on 545 US products, also worth a total of $34bn.

Beijing accused the US of starting the ""largest trade war in economic history"".

""After the US activated its tariff measures against China, China's measures against the US took effect immediately,"" said Lu Kang, a foreign ministry spokesman.

Two companies in Shanghai told the BBC that customs authorities were delaying clearance processes for US imports on Friday.

The American tariffs are the result of President Donald Trump's bid to protect US jobs and stop ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"".

The White House said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products, which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month.

The imposition of the tariffs had little impact on Asian stock markets. The Shanghai Composite closed 0.5% higher, but ended the week 3.5% lower - its seventh consecutive week of losses.

Tokyo closed 1.1% higher, but Hong Kong fell 0.5% in late trading.

Hikaru Sato at Daiwa Securities said markets had already factored in the impact of the first round of tariffs.

Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada.

He has also threatened a 10% levy on an additional $200bn of Chinese goods if Beijng ""refuses to change its practices"".

The president upped the stakes on Thursday, saying the amount of goods subject to tariffs could rise to more than $500bn.

""You have another 16 [billion dollars] in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200bn in abeyance and then after the $200bn, we have $300bn in abeyance. OK? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300,"" he said.

The US tariffs imposed so far would affect the equivalent of 0.6% of global trade and account for 0.1% of global GDP, according to Morgan Stanley in a research note issued before Mr Trump's comments on Thursday.

Beverage makers , including Heineken HEINY -2.07 % NV , Molson Coors Brewing Co. and Coca-Cola Co. , who use aluminum cans had warned Mr. Trump last month of increases in production costs if the tax were imposed . Some of those costs are likely to be passed on to consumers , according to analysts . The Beer Institute , a trade group , said Thursday the tariff would amount to a $ 347.7 million tax on brewers and result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs .
“ Businesses don ’ t assume cost increases , they pass them on to consumers , ” said Nico von Stackelberg , a consumer-goods analyst at Liberum .
More than half of the beer produced annually in the U.S. is sold in aluminum containers and is traditionally marketed to cost-conscious consumers . Cans of Natural Ice , known as “ Natty Ice , ” are staples of cash-strapped college students and Bud Light has become a symbol of working class America , which is a key part of Mr. Trump ’ s political base .
Cans are cheaper and easier to ship than bottles and they protect against ultraviolet rays , reducing the risk of beer going stale , or skunked .
The tariffs could also hurt craft beer . Part of the reason artisanal brew is increasingly sold in cans , producers say , is that aluminum offers a good surface for colorful , effective branding .
Industry watchers say the planned levies may exacerbate a shift by consumer away from beer toward spirits and wine , which are mainly sold in bottles .
Soda companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc. , use more aluminum cans than makers of alcoholic beverages , though only about 29 % of soda and other soft drinks are sold in cans , according to the American Beverage Association , an industry group . Coca-Cola and PepsiCo declined to comment .
Beer makers aren ’ t taking the tariff sitting down . MillerCoors , the U.S. division of Molson Coors , tweeted that “ American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of this misguided tariff , ” adding that there isn ’ t enough can sheet aluminum available in the U.S. to satisfy demand .

Mr. von Stackelberg says roughly 25 % of AB InBev ’ s cost of goods sold in the U.S. stems from aluminum purchases .

Fears that Donald Trump is embroiling America in a global trade war intensified on Wednesday after China imposed tit-for-tat import taxes on the US and stock markets plunged .
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped and then rallied after markets fell in Europe and Asia on worries of an intensifying trade conflict between the world ’ s two biggest economies – the latest example of Trump taking his appetite for disruption to the global stage .

There are carrots and sticks in life ... Both sides benefit by positive solutions that lower barriers . ”
Kudlow said China should take Trump “ seriously ” on tariffs but that ultimately the president was a “ free-trader ” . He added : “ Sometimes the path to this kind of growth is a little rocky . That ’ s the way the world works . ”
China ran a $ 375bn goods trade surplus with the US in 2017 . Trump has demanded that the China cut the trade gap by $ 100bn . Beijing said it has made a “ request for consultations ” at the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) in response to the US tariffs , triggering that body ’ s dispute settlement mechanism .
Geng Shuang , a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , told reporters in Beijing that China ’ s door to dialogue with Washington remained open “ but the US has missed the opportunity time and time again ” . He said talks between the two countries required “ mutual respect and equal treatment , instead of being coerced by one party unilaterally and condescendingly ” .
Economists have expressed concern that global economic activity might stall if other governments are prompted to raise their own import barriers .
William Zarit , chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China , told the Associated Press : “ US companies at this point would like to see robust communication between the US government and the Chinese government and serious negotiation on both sides , hopefully to avoid a trade war .

Fears that Donald Trump is embroiling America in a global trade war intensified on Wednesday after China imposed tit-for-tat import taxes on the US and stock markets plunged.



The Dow Jones industrial average dropped and then rallied after markets fell in Europe and Asia on worries of an intensifying trade conflict between the world’s two biggest economies – the latest example of Trump taking his appetite for disruption to the global stage.

After Washington unveiled plans to impose tariffs on $50bn in Chinese imports Tuesday, China hit back with plans to tax a matching $50bn of US products, including beef, cars, planes, soybeans and whiskey.

The US president has worn stock market success as a badge of honour and proof that, despite myriad controversies, the economy is booming under his presidency. But there are concerns that his aggressive tariffs and “America first” instincts could undermine confidence and cause a slowdown.

Why trade deficits are not a sign of economic trouble , and trade surpluses are not necessarily a sign of economic health .
The problem with all this trade-deficit talk is that nobody seems to know what trade deficits are , what they mean , or what causes them .
A trade deficit is nothing like a budget deficit . Each year ’ s federal budget deficit adds to the total debt owed by the federal government . Trade deficits don ’ t do that , which is one reason why “ trade deficit ” is not a very useful term . A trade deficit is just a bookkeeping entry , not a debt that has to be paid . Countries don ’ t trade — people do . Americans are no more harmed by the trade deficit with Germany than you are by your trade deficit with Kroger .
Trade deficits are not caused by tariffs or other protectionist policies , and neither are trade surpluses . You wouldn ’ t know it to hear President Trump talk , but the United States and the European Union have on average almost the same tariff rate : 1.7 percent for the United States vs. 2.0 percent for the European Union , according to World Bank data . ( Obviously , there is significant variation by item ; Germany imposes a 10 percent tariff on imported automobiles , and the United States charges a 25 percent tariff on light trucks , a consequence of the so-called Chicken War . ) In both cases , those average tariffs have been cut by nearly half since the early 1990s . China , which gives the Trump administration such agita , has cut its average tariff by nearly 90 percent since the 1990s , from a very high 32.2 percent to 3.5 percent — and its economy has thrived during that period .
Not only are trade deficits not driven mainly by trade policy , they are not really driven by consumer behavior , either . It ’ s true that many Americans prefer German cars and French wines — and cheap electronics and T-shirts made in China — but trade deficits mostly are the result of several other causes : macroeconomic factors such as tax policies and savings rates , the strength of a country ’ s currency , and , most important , its attractiveness to investors . Ironically , the corporate tax reform that President Trump is rightly proud of may contribute to higher trade deficits by making the United States a more attractive place to invest . Money invested in businesses and factories is not available for the purchase of consumer goods .
Trade deficits are not a sign of economic trouble , and trade surpluses are not necessarily a sign of economic health . The last time the U.S. ran a trade surplus with the world was 1975 , when our economy was in a shambles . Britain ran a trade deficit from Waterloo to the Great War , a century marking the height of its power , and it grew vastly wealthy .
When the Germans run a $ 63 billion trade surplus with the United States , as they did last year , that means they have $ 63 billion on their hands . What can they do with that money ? They can sit on it , as the Chinese and many other people around the world do , preferring to keep their savings in strong and steady dollars rather than in yuan , euros , or pesos . They can use it to buy dollar-denominated assets such as shares in Apple or Ford . Or they can invest it directly in the United States , as the Germans have with their automobile factories in the United States .
Far from being victimized by such trade , Americans are enriched by it . We get $ 118 billion in German-made goods in exchange for $ 54 billion in U.S.-made goods , which leaves $ 64 billion over to invest in American assets . Do you know who the largest U.S. automobile exporter is ? It is BMW Manufacturing , which builds SUVs in Spartanburg , S.C. , where it employs more than 9,000 people . Our trade deficit with Germany made that possible — that ’ s where the money to build the factory came from . Ask the autoworkers in South Carolina whether they think that ’ s a good tradeoff .
BMW , like Mercedes-Benz and General Motors , gets a lot more value out of each worker than it used to , through massive investments in robotics and other technology . American factories produce more than they ever have — our factory output has nearly doubled since 1990 , and is much higher than it was in the so-called golden age of the 1950s and 1960s — but they need fewer people than they once did . As manufacturing payrolls have declined slightly , employment in other parts of the economy has grown substantially , and that — not trade deficits — is why manufacturing ’ s relative share of employment has declined .
We ’ ve seen that before : with farm jobs . Today , a small number of skilled workers operating sophisticated machinery on cotton and wheat farms can do the work that once required hundreds or thousands of hands . The United States is not worse off because fewer people work as farmhands : We are better off — radically . And we aren ’ t worse off because one autoworker can now do the work that once took 20 men .
U.S. farmers are the best in the world at what they do . The Chinese may talk a good nationalist game , but when Chinese bellies rumble , they are filled with Iowa-grown soybeans . One-third of U.S. soybeans are exported to China , and not because of some Machiavellian trade scheme carried out by Washington . And not because the Chinese are suckers , either . It ’ s a case of best product , best price .
We aren ’ t worse off because one autoworker can now do the work that once took 20 men .
President Trump now proposes to spend $ 12 billion to bail out U.S. farmers hurt by his batty trade war . That figure will grow if the trade war continues .
It took decades of hard work and innovation to make U.S. farmers the best in the world at what they do . It took the U.S. government about two weeks to make them into welfare cases .
Worse , the Trump administration is doing so for no good reason , because it doesn ’ t really understand trade deficits .
All our farmers really need is for the Trump administration to stop helping them .","Cars at the port of Yokohama, Japan, in 2010. (Toru Hanai/Reuters)

When the Germans run a $63 billion trade surplus with the United States, as they did last year, that means they have $63 billion on their hands. What can they do with that money? They can sit on it, as the Chinese and many other people around the world do, preferring to keep their savings in strong and steady dollars rather than in yuan, euros, or pesos. They can use it to buy dollar-denominated assets such as shares in Apple or Ford. Or they can invest it directly in the United States, as the Germans have with their automobile factories in the United States.

Far from being victimized by such trade, Americans are enriched by it. We get $118 billion in German-made goods in exchange for $54 billion in U.S.-made goods, which leaves $64 billion over to invest in American assets. Do you know who the largest U.S. automobile exporter is? It is BMW Manufacturing, which builds SUVs in Spartanburg, S.C., where it employs more than 9,000 people. Our trade deficit with Germany made that possible — that’s where the money to build the factory came from. Ask the autoworkers in South Carolina whether they think that’s a good tradeoff.

BMW, like Mercedes-Benz and General Motors, gets a lot more value out of each worker than it used to, through massive investments in robotics and other technology. American factories produce more than they ever have — our factory output has nearly doubled since 1990, and is much higher than it was in the so-called golden age of the 1950s and 1960s — but they need fewer people than they once did. As manufacturing payrolls have declined slightly, employment in other parts of the economy has grown substantially, and that — not trade deficits — is why manufacturing’s relative share of employment has declined.

We’ve seen that before: with farm jobs. Today, a small number of skilled workers operating sophisticated machinery on cotton and wheat farms can do the work that once required hundreds or thousands of hands. The United States is not worse off because fewer people work as farmhands: We are better off — radically. And we aren’t worse off because one autoworker can now do the work that once took 20 men.

U.S. farmers are the best in the world at what they do. The Chinese may talk a good nationalist game, but when Chinese bellies rumble, they are filled with Iowa-grown soybeans. One-third of U.S. soybeans are exported to China, and not because of some Machiavellian trade scheme carried out by Washington. And not because the Chinese are suckers, either. It’s a case of best product, best price.

We aren’t worse off because one autoworker can now do the work that once took 20 men.

It was good while it lasted.

President Trump now proposes to spend $12 billion to bail out U.S. farmers hurt by his batty trade war. That figure will grow if the trade war continues.

It took decades of hard work and innovation to make U.S. farmers the best in the world at what they do. It took the U.S. government about two weeks to make them into welfare cases.

Worse, the Trump administration is doing so for no good reason, because it doesn’t really understand trade deficits.

All our farmers really need is for the Trump administration to stop helping them.

Lynch,"President Donald Trump will announce Thursday a series of trade enforcement actions designed to punish China for years of widespread violations of U.S. intellectual property rights , the White House said .
Though White House plans remain fluid , the president is expected to announce steep tariffs on around $ 50 billion in Chinese products along with restrictions on Chinese investment in the U.S. designed to mirror limits faced by Americans investing in China , industry executives said .
Tighter visa policies for Chinese students are also being considered , according to the executives , who declined to be identified in order to discuss private conversations .
The trade crackdown on China follows years of fruitless negotiations that failed to halt `` China 's state-led , market-distorting efforts to force , pressure , and steal U.S. technologies and intellectual property , '' said Raj Shah , principal deputy press secretary .
Since the 1983 formation of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade , the two countries have tried in various diplomatic settings to hammer out agreements on the economic issues that divide them .
But years of broken Chinese promises explain why the president is preparing to take the toughest — and potentially most disruptive — U.S. trade actions against China in a generation , according to an official with the U.S. trade representative 's office .
`` China uses these dialogues to delay and run out the clock and make you ask for things they already said they were going to do , '' the official said . `` The administration has not been satisfied with the type of responses we 've been getting from China . ''
The official requested anonymity in order to provide context for the president 's announcement of new steps designed to punish China for violating U.S. intellectual property rights by stealing trade secrets or forcing companies to surrender them in return for market access .
Administration officials are bracing for a firm Chinese response to any action . Chinese President Xi Jinping , fresh from eliminating term limits on his rule , presides over a government that already has drawn up lists of potential American products for retaliation in a trade war .
`` China is not going to want to come to the negotiating table from a position of weakness , '' said Claire Reade , former USTR chief counsel for China trade enforcement . `` They 've been thinking of this since Trump was elected . ''
In testimony Wednesday before the House Ways and Means Committee , Robert E. Lighthizer , the U.S. trade representative , called China 's intellectual property rights practices `` an assault '' on American high-technology industries .
After the hurried rollout earlier this month of new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum , the Trump administration is portraying the coming China moves as the result of a deliberative inter-agency process .
The president opted for new trade barriers after sounding out officials in Beijing about a potential deal , the official said .
Starting with Chinese President Xi Jinping 's visit to Trump 's Mar-a-Lago Florida retreat last spring , U.S. and Chinese officials met for talks aimed at resolving lingering trade differences .
`` There 's very little evidence that China 's actual behavior was changing for the better , '' the official said .
The president sees the record $ 375 billion deficit in goods trade with China as evidence that U.S. businesses are being unfairly treated . Many economists say that bilateral trade scores reflect broader economic forces , including Americans ' propensity to buy imported goods rather than save .
When last year 's talks made little headway , Trump in August ordered Lighthizer to investigate whether China was discriminating against U.S. companies with its intellectual property practices .
The administration says that U.S. companies face pressure to hand over technology to their Chinese partners to gain needed government permits and licenses . Chinese hackers also have penetrated computer networks of companies such as as U.S. Steel , making off with confidential business plans . And Chinese investors , including state-backed funds , have been encouraged by their government to acquire U.S. intellectual property by buying Silicon Valley companies , officials said .
Chinese companies often register U.S. trademarks as their own in China and effectively hold out for `` ransom '' from the legitimate owner , according to a January report from Lighthizer 's office .
U.S. companies also complained of only `` relatively modest progress made by China over the last several years in reducing '' the use of pirated software and a continuing problem with trade secret theft from their China-based research centers , the report added .","President Donald Trump will announce Thursday a series of trade enforcement actions designed to punish China for years of widespread violations of U.S. intellectual property rights, the White House said.

The likely 2016 presidential candidate has yet to show her hand on whether she supports the latest effort to pass “ fast track ” trade promotion authority , but that could happen as soon as Monday morning when she takes the stage with prominent labor leaders at a Washington event put on by a liberal-leaning political think tank .
What she says there — or in coming weeks — could improve or imperil her position with unions , Democratic colleagues in Congress , the business community and the sitting president .
If she comes out for fast track , it will alienate her labor and environmental base . If she opposes the legislation , it puts her at odds with President Barack Obama and her previous support as secretary of state for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement , opening her to charges of being a flip-flopper .
Progressive Democrats urging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to get in the presidential race want Clinton to clarify her position as early as possible , given pending action in Congress on a “ fast track ” trade promotion authority bill , said Neil Sroka , a spokesman for Democracy for America , the group founded by former Vermont Gov . Howard Dean .
“ There is no doubt that the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the fight over fast track is going to be part of the presidential election , ” given the expectation that Clinton and others could declare their candidacy in April , the same month fast track could hit the Senate floor , Sroka said .
“ It very well might be some of the first questions she is asked as a presidential candidate could be about TPP and fast track , ” Sroka added . “ There ’ s lots of reasons that people are excited about getting Elizabeth Warren into the presidential race , but her outspokenness in the battle against TPP … is something that speaks to the progressive base ’ s concerns and is attracting people to this campaign . ”
Union groups , including the AFL-CIO labor federation , also have deep concerns about the prospective trade pact with Japan and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific that , along with the United States , represent more than 40 percent of world gross domestic product . They fear the deal will encourage companies to move more jobs overseas , suppressing wages in the United States .
Clinton , as Obama ’ s secretary of state , is closely associated with the agreement , which could grow to cover 21 economies in the region , including China . “ Our hope is that a TPP agreement with high standards can serve as a benchmark for future agreements — and grow to serve as a platform for broader regional interaction and eventually a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific , ” she wrote in October 2011 .
The issue is front and center as Obama pushes for approval of trade promotion authority , a bill that would allow him to submit trade agreements , like the proposed TPP , to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote without any amendments . The next president , whoever it is , could also use the authority to negotiate a deal bringing China into the pact .
The Obama administration is already negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China that could be a stepping stone to a free trade pact . In addition , the United States , China and others in the region recently agreed on a path , known as the Beijing Roadmap , to pursue the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific .
That raises the stakes of the current fight in Congress over trade promotion authority , which is also known as fast track because of its expedited voting procedures that union groups and many progressive Democrats detest .
Clinton ’ s husband , former President Bill Clinton , used the procedure to win approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement , which the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute blames for hundreds of thousands of lost jobs .
“ Every single thing in our trade deals should be openly discussed and subject to public oversight and the full legislative process , ” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a recent speech . “ There should be no question about that . Fast track is wrong and undemocratic . It ’ s a rotten process , and the American labor movement intends to kill it . ”
Although administration officials insist it ’ s not part of their calculus , finishing congressional action on the pact this year could be a big help to Clinton — particularly if rivals on the left , such as Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , were to enter the 2016 race , both of whom have criticized the TPP pact and fast-track trade legislation .
Clinton voted against the fast-track legislation the last time it was approved in 2002 , although her husband repeatedly pushed for the same authority when he was president .
Now , Obama — another erstwhile critic of trade agreements — wants Congress to approve the legislation quickly so he can wrap up the TPP pact and submit it to Congress for a vote later this year .
Clinton ’ s office did not respond to an emailed request for her current position on trade issues .
Although she has been quiet on trade since stepping down as secretary of state in early 2013 , Clinton was a vocal advocate of the TPP agreement while in office and also pushed for congressional approval of free trade deals with South Korea , Colombia and Panama opposed by many Democrats , particularly in the House of Representatives .
“ Our landmark deal with South Korea could increase exports of American goods by more than $ 10 billion and grow South Korea ’ s economy by 6 percent , ” Clinton said in a speech in Vladivostok , Russia , in September 2012 , relying on U.S. government estimates that , at least in the early years of the Korea agreement , appear now to be too optimistic .
“ In addition to lowering tariffs , the agreement also includes improvements on intellectual property protection and enforcement , fair labor practices , environmental protection , regulatory due process , ” Clinton said . “ That ’ s also true of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a new far-reaching regional trade agreement that will bring together at least 11 economies , developed and developing alike , into a single Pacific trading community . ”
Clinton ’ s embrace of the TPP agreement show how far both she and Obama had come on trade since the 2008 Democratic primary , when the two rivals and former Sen. John Edwards repeatedly used the North American Free Trade Agreement as a punching bag to whip up votes among union supporters .
Although Clinton ’ s husband pushed NAFTA through Congress early in his administration , and went on to win congressional approval of a world trade agreement in 1994 and permanent normal trade relations with China in 2000 , Hillary promised a “ timeout ” from new trade agreements and a smarter approach to trade policy if elected in 2008 .
Seven years later , the same issues are playing out as Obama is pushing to win approval of trade promotion authority .
Last month , the AFL-CIO executive council approved a moratorium on political donations to candidates for federal office to focus its resources on defeating TPA , a pointed reminder to Democrats of its fundraising abilities .
On Monday , Clinton will be sharing the stage with leaders of two unions represented on the council , Randi Weingarten , president of the American Federation of Teachers , and Lee Saunders , president of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , for a roundtable discussion on revitalizing urban communities .
After voting against trade promotion authority in 2002 , Clinton supported most of the agreements negotiated by President George W. Bush over the next six years , with the notable exception of a free trade deal with Central American countries and the Dominican Republican in 2005 . That controversial agreement , which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called a “ job killer , ” was fiercely opposed by most Democrats
“ But Obama and Clinton were hard nos on CAFTA , ” said Scott Miller , a senior adviser on trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , who previously was director of global trade policy at the consumer products giant Proctor & Gamble . “ They were never even close to yeses . ”
The two rivals also skipped a vote on the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement in December 2007 , as did Sen. John McCain , who won the Republican presidential nomination the following year .
During the 2008 Democratic primary race , both Obama and Clinton took “ what I would characterize as a populist turn [ on trade ] , particularly during the Pennsylvania and the Ohio primaries , but the candidates tried hard not to get too far from each other , ” Miller said .
One memorable moment came during a debate in Cleveland , when both Obama and Clinton said they would use the threat of withdrawing from NAFTA to force Mexico to negotiate stronger labor and environmental terms for the agreement .
“ I think actually Sen. Clinton ’ s answer on this one is right , ” Obama said . “ I think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced . ”
Obama never followed through on that idea after he was elected president .
But both Mexico and Canada are part of the negotiations on the TPP pact , which the Obama administration says will upgrade the labor and environmental provisions of NAFTA by making them enforceable .
Still , the Obama administration ’ s effort to portray TPP as “ the most progressive ” trade agreement to date has not changed many minds on the left .
“ There ’ s no reason to believe the TPP is going to be a better deal than NAFTA was for the American middle class , ” Sroka said . “ I think the base of the party wants to have a nominee in 2016 that reflects concern with the trade deals and what trade deals have done to working families . ”","Hillary Clinton is about to have her big trade moment.

The likely 2016 presidential candidate has yet to show her hand on whether she supports the latest effort to pass “fast track” trade promotion authority, but that could happen as soon as Monday morning when she takes the stage with prominent labor leaders at a Washington event put on by a liberal-leaning political think tank.

Although administration officials insist it’s not part of their calculus, finishing congressional action on the pact this year could be a big help to Clinton — particularly if rivals on the left, such as Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), were to enter the 2016 race, both of whom have criticized the TPP pact and fast-track trade legislation.

Clinton voted against the fast-track legislation the last time it was approved in 2002, although her husband repeatedly pushed for the same authority when he was president.

Now, Obama — another erstwhile critic of trade agreements — wants Congress to approve the legislation quickly so he can wrap up the TPP pact and submit it to Congress for a vote later this year.

Clinton’s office did not respond to an emailed request for her current position on trade issues.

Although she has been quiet on trade since stepping down as secretary of state in early 2013, Clinton was a vocal advocate of the TPP agreement while in office and also pushed for congressional approval of free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama opposed by many Democrats, particularly in the House of Representatives.

“Our landmark deal with South Korea could increase exports of American goods by more than $10 billion and grow South Korea’s economy by 6 percent,” Clinton said in a speech in Vladivostok, Russia, in September 2012, relying on U.S. government estimates that, at least in the early years of the Korea agreement, appear now to be too optimistic.

“In addition to lowering tariffs, the agreement also includes improvements on intellectual property protection and enforcement, fair labor practices, environmental protection, regulatory due process,” Clinton said. “That’s also true of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a new far-reaching regional trade agreement that will bring together at least 11 economies, developed and developing alike, into a single Pacific trading community.”

Clinton’s embrace of the TPP agreement show how far both she and Obama had come on trade since the 2008 Democratic primary, when the two rivals and former Sen. John Edwards repeatedly used the North American Free Trade Agreement as a punching bag to whip up votes among union supporters.

Although Clinton’s husband pushed NAFTA through Congress early in his administration, and went on to win congressional approval of a world trade agreement in 1994 and permanent normal trade relations with China in 2000, Hillary promised a “timeout” from new trade agreements and a smarter approach to trade policy if elected in 2008.

Seven years later, the same issues are playing out as Obama is pushing to win approval of trade promotion authority.

Last month, the AFL-CIO executive council approved a moratorium on political donations to candidates for federal office to focus its resources on defeating TPA, a pointed reminder to Democrats of its fundraising abilities.

On Monday, Clinton will be sharing the stage with leaders of two unions represented on the council, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, for a roundtable discussion on revitalizing urban communities.

After voting against trade promotion authority in 2002, Clinton supported most of the agreements negotiated by President George W. Bush over the next six years, with the notable exception of a free trade deal with Central American countries and the Dominican Republican in 2005. That controversial agreement, which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called a “job killer,” was fiercely opposed by most Democrats

“But Obama and Clinton were hard nos on CAFTA,” said Scott Miller, a senior adviser on trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who previously was director of global trade policy at the consumer products giant Proctor & Gamble. “They were never even close to yeses.”

The two rivals also skipped a vote on the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement in December 2007, as did Sen. John McCain, who won the Republican presidential nomination the following year.

During the 2008 Democratic primary race, both Obama and Clinton took “what I would characterize as a populist turn [on trade], particularly during the Pennsylvania and the Ohio primaries, but the candidates tried hard not to get too far from each other,” Miller said.

One memorable moment came during a debate in Cleveland, when both Obama and Clinton said they would use the threat of withdrawing from NAFTA to force Mexico to negotiate stronger labor and environmental terms for the agreement.

“I think actually Sen. Clinton’s answer on this one is right,” Obama said. “I think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced.”

Obama never followed through on that idea after he was elected president.

But both Mexico and Canada are part of the negotiations on the TPP pact, which the Obama administration says will upgrade the labor and environmental provisions of NAFTA by making them enforceable.

Still, the Obama administration’s effort to portray TPP as “the most progressive” trade agreement to date has not changed many minds on the left.

“There’s no reason to believe the TPP is going to be a better deal than NAFTA was for the American middle class,” Sroka said. “I think the base of the party wants to have a nominee in 2016 that reflects concern with the trade deals and what trade deals have done to working families.”",www.politico.com,left,XPGaezVKRJ2swlTb

In most filings, U.S. Steel said it was capable of producing the metal for tubing, casing, piping and sheeting that companies asked for permission to import.

The Commerce Department must still deal with nearly 20,000 petitions in its queue. While the administration has said the exclusions are an effective way to ensure the fairness of the tariffs, companies that have applied for the exclusions criticized the exercise as both long and disorganized.

“This is the most screwed-up process,” said Mark Mullen, president of Griggs Steel, a steel distributor in the Detroit area. “This is a disservice to our industry and the biggest insult to our intelligence that I have ever seen from the government.”

Mr. Mullen has made 90 requests and has not been told the status of any of them. He is waiting to submit 2,000 more requests, “but they take so damn long,” he said.

As the chaotic exclusion process continues, Mr. Trump is expanding his trade efforts on multiple new fronts, threatening tariffs on up to $450 billion of products from China and roughly $350 billion of imported autos and auto parts.

Although the president has famously said trade wars are “easy to win,” the lingering difficulties of the steel and aluminum tariffs, which were put into place three months ago, show the inevitable complexity of trying to reshape the rules of global trade in a matter of months.

Ruffling U.S. ties with one of its closest allies, President Trump is sharply criticizing an Obama-era agreement with Australia — a deal that also reportedly prompted the American leader to tell Australia's prime minister that his was the ""worst"" phone call Trump received after his inauguration.

Late Wednesday night, the president vented his anger on Twitter, saying: ""Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!""

As the Australian Broadcasting Network notes, Trump's tweet ""incorrectly labels refugees 'illegal immigrants' and cites 'thousands' of people instead of 1,250.""

The deal concerns refugees, many of them children, who've been housed in offshore detention centers on Nauru and other islands. The arrangement has been controversial in Australia, particularly after incidents of abuse emerged.

Turnbull says he's disappointed that details about his communication with Trump were leaked — and while acknowledging that the talk was ""very frank and forthright,"" he has dismissed the version of events reported by some outlets, that the American president hung up on his Australian counterpart.

""The report that the president hung up is not correct,"" Turnbull told Sydney radio station 2GB. ""The call ended courteously.""

A more nuanced approach

By Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor

""America First, not America alone."" It was the key line of the speech, and a message echoed by other leading members of the White House power pack here.

This is all about trade and the US approach.

The fear was that America under Mr Trump would throw up a series of trade barriers, increasing protectionism at a time when most government leaders at Davos - Narendra Modi of India, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Emmanuel Macron of France - were preaching the gospel of globalisation.

But today we heard a more nuanced manifesto. America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade.

Which may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week following the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines.

After signing an order Monday abandoning the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Trump has set his sights on renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a prospect that worries the automotive industry.

Trump laid out his strategy after being sworn in last week. In a post on the White House website, the administration pledges in a statement to negotiate ""tough and fair"" trade agreements with the goal of creating more U.S. jobs as a top goal.

""This strategy starts by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and making certain that any new trade deals are in the interests of American workers,"" the statement says. ""President Trump is committed to renegotiating NAFTA. If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States’ intent to withdraw from NAFTA.""

A “ global depression ” will occur if Mr. Trump follows through on his threatened 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods , rival candidate Jeb Bush warned during the presidential campaign last year .
No one wins in a trade war , said President Xi himself in a speech two months ago .
The grain of truth here is that , yes , an all-out trade clash between the two largest economies would have immediate and negative consequences for workers and consumers around the world . But all of this may , at the same time , miss a key point : The global trade system has deep flaws that are related to China , not Trump .
For years , China has been welcomed by the world into trade linkages , on the expectation that over time it will play the game of commerce the way others generally do . Trade experts say that hasn ’ t happened . Even many of the same CEOs and economists who warn against a trade war say China has been violating both the letter and spirit of global trade rules .
Trump ’ s election win stemmed partly from the resonance of his critique of trade policies as harming US workers .

Mr. Atkinson , who heads the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation , a think tank in Washington , doesn ’ t endorse all of Trump ’ s espoused trade views .

Under President Barack Obama , the office of the US Trade Representative ramped up its engagement on alleged violations by China .

Among the biggest sore spots is the way foreign companies doing business in China are pressured to transfer knowledge to Chinese partner firms in industries such as aerospace . The World Trade Organization prohibits countries from making such demands , yet the Chinese arrangements are , in practice , hard to prosecute .

Few signals from summit

As Trump and Xi met at the Trump-branded Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, there were few early signs of either progress or breakdown.

A White House statement said the US president ""noted the challenges caused by Chinese government intervention in its economy and raised serious concerns about the impact of China's industrial, agricultural, technology, and cyber policies on United States jobs and exports.""

But both leaders talked in largely positive terms about their meetings. And US officials announced that the two sides planned a 100-day push to discuss trade issues. [Editor's note: The article has been updated by adding the previous two paragraphs.]

███ has obtained a draft copy of TPP ’ s intellectual property chapter as it stood on May 11 , at the start of the latest negotiating round in Guam . While U.S. trade officials would not confirm the authenticity of the document , they downplayed its importance , emphasizing that the terms of the deal are likely to change significantly as the talks enter their final stages . Those terms are still secret , but the public will get to see them once the twelve TPP nations reach a final agreement and President Obama seeks congressional approval .
Still , the draft chapter will provide ammunition for critics who have warned that TPP ’ s protections for pharmaceutical companies could dump trillions of dollars of additional health care costs on patients , businesses and governments around the Pacific Rim . The highly technical 90-page document , cluttered with objections from other TPP nations , shows that U.S. negotiators have fought aggressively and , at least until Guam , successfully on behalf of Big Pharma .

But Malpani of Doctors Without Borders said U.S. negotiators have basically functioned as drug lobbyists .

“ We consider this the worst-ever agreement in terms of access to medicine , ” he said . “ It would create higher drug prices around the world—and in the U.S. , too .","A recent draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal would give U.S. pharmaceutical firms unprecedented protections against competition from cheaper generic drugs, possibly transcending the patent protections in U.S. law.

POLITICO has obtained a draft copy of TPP’s intellectual property chapter as it stood on May 11, at the start of the latest negotiating round in Guam. While U.S. trade officials would not confirm the authenticity of the document, they downplayed its importance, emphasizing that the terms of the deal are likely to change significantly as the talks enter their final stages. Those terms are still secret, but the public will get to see them once the twelve TPP nations reach a final agreement and President Obama seeks congressional approval.

Still, the draft chapter will provide ammunition for critics who have warned that TPP’s protections for pharmaceutical companies could dump trillions of dollars of additional health care costs on patients, businesses and governments around the Pacific Rim. The highly technical 90-page document, cluttered with objections from other TPP nations, shows that U.S. negotiators have fought aggressively and, at least until Guam, successfully on behalf of Big Pharma.

The draft text includes provisions that could make it extremely tough for generics to challenge brand-name pharmaceuticals abroad. Those provisions could also help block copycats from selling cheaper versions of the expensive cutting-edge drugs known as “biologics” inside the U.S., restricting treatment for American patients while jacking up Medicare and Medicaid costs for American taxpayers.

Elizabeth Warren Is Right to Be Concerned.,2015-05-19,"Michael Wessel, Mark Brzezinski, Bjorn Lyrvall","Michael Wessel is a cleared liaison to two statutory advisory committees and was a commissioner on the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission , as well as the international trade co-chair for the Kerry-Edwards Presidential Campaign .
“ You need to tell me what ’ s wrong with this trade agreement , not one that was passed 25 years ago , ” a frustrated President Barack Obama recently complained about criticisms of the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) . He ’ s right . The public criticisms of the TPP have been vague . That ’ s by design—anyone who has read the text of the agreement could be jailed for disclosing its contents . I ’ ve actually read the TPP text provided to the government ’ s own advisors , and I ’ ve given the president an earful about how this trade deal will damage this nation . But I can ’ t share my criticisms with you .
I can tell you that Elizabeth Warren is right about her criticism of the trade deal . We should be very concerned about what 's hidden in this trade deal—and particularly how the Obama administration is keeping information secret even from those of us who are supposed to provide advice .
So-called “ cleared advisors ” like me are prohibited from sharing publicly the criticisms we ’ ve lodged about specific proposals and approaches . The government has created a perfect Catch 22 : The law prohibits us from talking about the specifics of what we ’ ve seen , allowing the president to criticize us for not being specific . Instead of simply admitting that he disagrees with me—and with many other cleared advisors—about the merits of the TPP , the president instead pretends that our specific , pointed criticisms don ’ t exist .
What I can tell you is that the administration is being unfair to those who are raising proper questions about the harms the TPP would do . To the administration , everyone who questions their approach is branded as a protectionist—or worse—dishonest . They broadly criticize organized labor , despite the fact that unions have been the primary force in America pushing for strong rules to promote opportunity and jobs . And they dismiss individuals like me who believe that , first and foremost , a trade agreement should promote the interests of domestic producers and their employees .
I ’ ve been deeply involved in trade policy for almost four decades . For 21 years , I worked for former Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt and handled all trade policy issues including “ fast track , ” the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization ’ s Uruguay Round , which is the largest trade agreement in history . I am also a consultant to various domestic producers and the United Steelworkers union , for whom I serve as a cleared advisor on two trade advisory committees . To top it off , I was a publicly acknowledged advisor to the Obama campaign in 2008 .
Obama may no longer be listening to my advice , but Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren might as well be . Warren , of course , has been perhaps the deal ’ s most vocal critic , but even the more cautious Clinton has raised the right questions on what a good TPP would look like . Her spokesman , Nick Merrill , said : “ She will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation , improve labor rights , protect the environment and health , promote transparency and open new opportunities for our small businesses to export overseas . As she warned in her book Hard Choices , we shouldn ’ t be giving special rights to corporations at the expense of workers and consumers . ”
On this count , the current TPP doesn ’ t measure up . And nothing being considered by Congress right now would ensure that the TPP meets the goal of promoting domestic production and job creation .
The text of the TPP , like all trade deals , is a closely guarded secret . That fact makes a genuine public debate impossible and should make robust debate behind closed doors all the more essential . But the ability of TPP critics like me to point out the deal ’ s many failings is limited by the government ’ s surprising and unprecedented refusal to make revisions to the language in the TPP fully available to cleared advisors .
Bill Clinton didn ’ t operate like this . During the debate on NAFTA , as a cleared advisor for the Democratic leadership , I had a copy of the entire text in a safe next to my desk and regularly was briefed on the specifics of the negotiations , including counterproposals made by Mexico and Canada . During the TPP negotiations , the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) has never shared proposals being advanced by other TPP partners . Today ’ s consultations are , in many ways , much more restrictive than those under past administrations .
All advisors , and any liaisons , are required to have security clearances , which entail extensive paperwork and background investigations , before they are able to review text and participate in briefings . But , despite clearances , and a statutory duty to provide advice , advisors do not have access to all the materials that a reasonable person would need to do the job . The negotiators provide us with “ proposals ” but those are merely initial proposals to trading partners . We are not allowed to see counter-proposals from our trading partners . Often , advisors are provided with updates indicating that the final text will balance all appropriate stakeholder interests but we frequently receive few additional details beyond that flimsy assurance .
Those details have enormous repercussions . For instance , rules of origin specify how much of a product must originate within the TPP countries for the resulting product to be eligible for duty-free treatment . These are complex rules that decide where a company will manufacture its products and where is will purchase raw materials . Under the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , 62.5 percent of a car needed to originate within NAFTA countries . In the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement , it was lowered to 50 percent . It further dropped to 35 percent in the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement ( KORUS ) . In essence , under our agreement with Korea , 65 percent of a car from South Korea could be made from Chinese parts and still qualify for duty-free treatment when exported to the U.S .
That fact is politically toxic , and for that reason , we should expect the TPP agreement to have higher standards . But will it reach the 62.5 percent NAFTA requirement ? Or will it be only a slight improvement over KORUS ? Without access to the final text of the agreement , it ’ s impossible to say .
State-owned enterprises may , for the first time , be addressed in the TPP . But , once again , the details are not clear . Will exemptions be provided to countries like Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore , all of which could be heavily impacted by such a rule ? What will be the test to determine what is or is not acceptable behavior ? Will injury be required to occur over a substantial period of time , or will individual acts of non-commercial , damaging trade practices be actionable ? Again , it ’ s impossible to say for sure .
Advisors are almost flying blind on these questions and others .
Only portions of the text have been provided , to be read under the watchful eye of a USTR official . Access , up until recently , was provided on secure web sites . But the government-run website does not contain the most-up-to-date information for cleared advisors . To get that information , we have to travel to certain government facilities and sign in to read the materials . Even then , the administration determines what we can and can not review and , often , they provide carefully edited summaries rather than the actual underlying text , which is critical to really understanding the consequences of the agreement .
Cleared advisors were created by statute to advise our nation ’ s trade negotiators . There is a hierarchal structure , starting with the USTR ’ s Advisory Committee on Trade Policy & Negotiations at the top—a committee that includes people like Steelworkers President Leo Gerard , Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga , Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson and Jill Appell , co-owner of Appell ’ s Pork Farms . Then there are specific Committees covering subjects like labor , the environment and agriculture that make up the next tier . The last tier consists of the Industry Trade Advisory Committees ( ITACS ) , which focus on individual sectors such as steel and aerospace . At last count , there were more than 600 cleared advisors . The vast majority of them represent business interests .
In an effort to diminish criticism , USTR is now letting cleared advisors review summaries of what the negotiators have done . In response to a question about when the full updated text will be made available , we ’ ve been told , “ We are working on making them available as soon as possible. ” That ’ s not the case overseas : Our trading partners have this text , but the government ’ s own cleared advisors , serving on statutorily-created advisory committees , are kept in the dark .
Questions pervade virtually every chapter of the proposed agreement , including labor and the environment , investor-state , intellectual property and others . The answers to these questions affect the sourcing and investment decisions of our companies and resulting jobs for our people . Our elected representatives would be abdicating their Constitutional duty if they failed to raise questions .
Senator Warren should be commended for her courage in standing up to the President , and Secretary Clinton for raising a note of caution , and I encourage all elected officials to raise these important questions . Working Americans can ’ t afford more failed trade agreements and trade policies .
Congress should refuse to pass fast track trade negotiating authority until the partnership between the branches , and the trust of the American people is restored . That will require a lot of fence mending and disclosure of exactly what the TPP will do . That begins by sharing the final text of the TPP with those of us who won ’ t simply rubber-stamp it .","Michael Wessel is a cleared liaison to two statutory advisory committees and was a commissioner on the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission, as well as the international trade co-chair for the Kerry-Edwards Presidential Campaign.

I am also a consultant to various domestic producers and the United Steelworkers union, for whom I serve as a cleared advisor on two trade advisory committees. To top it off, I was a publicly acknowledged advisor to the Obama campaign in 2008.

Obama may no longer be listening to my advice, but Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren might as well be. Warren, of course, has been perhaps the deal’s most vocal critic, but even the more cautious Clinton has raised the right questions on what a good TPP would look like. Her spokesman, Nick Merrill, said: “She will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and health, promote transparency and open new opportunities for our small businesses to export overseas. As she warned in her book Hard Choices, we shouldn’t be giving special rights to corporations at the expense of workers and consumers.”

On this count, the current TPP doesn’t measure up. And nothing being considered by Congress right now would ensure that the TPP meets the goal of promoting domestic production and job creation.

The text of the TPP, like all trade deals, is a closely guarded secret. That fact makes a genuine public debate impossible and should make robust debate behind closed doors all the more essential. But the ability of TPP critics like me to point out the deal’s many failings is limited by the government’s surprising and unprecedented refusal to make revisions to the language in the TPP fully available to cleared advisors.

Bill Clinton didn’t operate like this. During the debate on NAFTA, as a cleared advisor for the Democratic leadership, I had a copy of the entire text in a safe next to my desk and regularly was briefed on the specifics of the negotiations, including counterproposals made by Mexico and Canada. During the TPP negotiations, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has never shared proposals being advanced by other TPP partners. Today’s consultations are, in many ways, much more restrictive than those under past administrations.

All advisors, and any liaisons, are required to have security clearances, which entail extensive paperwork and background investigations, before they are able to review text and participate in briefings. But, despite clearances, and a statutory duty to provide advice, advisors do not have access to all the materials that a reasonable person would need to do the job. The negotiators provide us with “proposals” but those are merely initial proposals to trading partners. We are not allowed to see counter-proposals from our trading partners. Often, advisors are provided with updates indicating that the final text will balance all appropriate stakeholder interests but we frequently receive few additional details beyond that flimsy assurance.

Those details have enormous repercussions. For instance, rules of origin specify how much of a product must originate within the TPP countries for the resulting product to be eligible for duty-free treatment. These are complex rules that decide where a company will manufacture its products and where is will purchase raw materials. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 62.5 percent of a car needed to originate within NAFTA countries. In the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, it was lowered to 50 percent. It further dropped to 35 percent in the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). In essence, under our agreement with Korea, 65 percent of a car from South Korea could be made from Chinese parts and still qualify for duty-free treatment when exported to the U.S.

That fact is politically toxic, and for that reason, we should expect the TPP agreement to have higher standards. But will it reach the 62.5 percent NAFTA requirement? Or will it be only a slight improvement over KORUS? Without access to the final text of the agreement, it’s impossible to say.

State-owned enterprises may, for the first time, be addressed in the TPP. But, once again, the details are not clear. Will exemptions be provided to countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore, all of which could be heavily impacted by such a rule? What will be the test to determine what is or is not acceptable behavior? Will injury be required to occur over a substantial period of time, or will individual acts of non-commercial, damaging trade practices be actionable? Again, it’s impossible to say for sure.

Advisors are almost flying blind on these questions and others.

Only portions of the text have been provided, to be read under the watchful eye of a USTR official. Access, up until recently, was provided on secure web sites. But the government-run website does not contain the most-up-to-date information for cleared advisors. To get that information, we have to travel to certain government facilities and sign in to read the materials. Even then, the administration determines what we can and cannot review and, often, they provide carefully edited summaries rather than the actual underlying text, which is critical to really understanding the consequences of the agreement.

Cleared advisors were created by statute to advise our nation’s trade negotiators. There is a hierarchal structure, starting with the USTR’s Advisory Committee on Trade Policy & Negotiations at the top—a committee that includes people like Steelworkers President Leo Gerard, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson and Jill Appell, co-owner of Appell’s Pork Farms. Then there are specific Committees covering subjects like labor, the environment and agriculture that make up the next tier. The last tier consists of the Industry Trade Advisory Committees (ITACS), which focus on individual sectors such as steel and aerospace. At last count, there were more than 600 cleared advisors. The vast majority of them represent business interests.

In an effort to diminish criticism, USTR is now letting cleared advisors review summaries of what the negotiators have done. In response to a question about when the full updated text will be made available, we’ve been told, “We are working on making them available as soon as possible.” That’s not the case overseas: Our trading partners have this text, but the government’s own cleared advisors, serving on statutorily-created advisory committees, are kept in the dark.

How can we properly advise, without knowing the details?

Questions pervade virtually every chapter of the proposed agreement, including labor and the environment, investor-state, intellectual property and others. The answers to these questions affect the sourcing and investment decisions of our companies and resulting jobs for our people. Our elected representatives would be abdicating their Constitutional duty if they failed to raise questions.

Senator Warren should be commended for her courage in standing up to the President, and Secretary Clinton for raising a note of caution, and I encourage all elected officials to raise these important questions. Working Americans can’t afford more failed trade agreements and trade policies.

Congress should refuse to pass fast track trade negotiating authority until the partnership between the branches, and the trust of the American people is restored. That will require a lot of fence mending and disclosure of exactly what the TPP will do. That begins by sharing the final text of the TPP with those of us who won’t simply rubber-stamp it.

There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep ‘ punching ’ at it… I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol ’ Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn ’ t know you can ’ t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. ” Kevin Drum , Mother Jones
“ China presents a more formidable rival than the former Soviet Union ever was . Which means that allies matter more than ever to U.S. power . But unlike his predecessors in the age of the Soviet threat , Trump ’ s first move in his campaign against China was to sabotage the alliances that once enhanced U.S. leverage… The United States can not impose its will on China . But it can work with others to write rules that China can not afford to ignore. ” David Frum , The Atlantic
“ The way to compete with China on trade is neither sweeping tariffs nor the administration ’ s futile insistence that China change its fundamental economic model… [ We need ] public investment in research and production to increase our international competitiveness … A much more focused trade policy would do something our trade competitors , including China itself , does : to see around the next corner of global demand where no country has yet to establish a comparative advantage . China did so with the assembly of consumer electronics , but that ’ s a low value-added play . We should do so in green technology… There ’ s a clear path to quickly getting unstuck , one that evinces strong progressive values and an export strategy that supports American workers and their communities , not multinational corporations. ” Jared Bernstein , New York Times
“ From what we can see , there is nothing in this tentative deal that wouldn ’ t have existed in the absence of the past two years of wrangling . Intellectual property reform has been a long-standing project for President Xi Jinping . China ’ s first dedicated IP courts were established back in 2014 and have generally dealt fairly with non-Chinese litigants . Penalties , the most glaring weakness in the post-2014 system , are already being toughened . Perhaps that ’ s come as a result of U.S. pressure — but it fits just as well with China ’ s domestic priorities… If little has been achieved when [ US ] leverage was at its highest , even less is going to be achieved once that leverage is ratcheted back down . ” David Fickling , Bloomberg
“ The deal on Friday pushes the thorny issue of China ’ s state support for its industries down the road , most likely complicating relations between the world ’ s two largest economies for years to come… It seems to affirm the belief , held by many Chinese officials , that Mr. Trump will back off from his trade-war threats if markets tumble , or if his supporters in agricultural states suffer too much . Even before Friday , Mr. Trump had delayed or canceled tariffs four times this year . Such policy shifts could ultimately encourage Beijing to draw out negotiations [ for phase II ] even further , to reach the best possible deal. ” Keith Bradsher , New York Times
“ While the benefits of the trade war are speculative , its costs are real : The Tax Foundation estimates that Trump ’ s tariffs have cost Americans more than $ 88 billion so far , making this one of the biggest tax hikes in history . To cushion the blow , the administration gave $ 28 billion to farmers — twice the cost of the 2009 auto industry bailout… [ Meanwhile ] the real issues with China — from trade barriers to militarism in the South China Sea to human rights violations — remain unaddressed. ” Max Boot , Washington Post
“ While Lighthizer and Trump are crowing about an expected $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion in annual agricultural sales , few analysts believe those numbers are realistic . The highest level of farm products the U.S. has ever exported to China was $ 26 billion in 2012 . Plus , this first phase deal doesn ’ t do anything about the 25 % tariffs already in place on the bulk of goods that China exports to the U.S . Considering this fact , how aggressive will China really be about pursuing increased agricultural purchases and intellectual property protections ? ” Editorial Board , San Francisco Chronicle

The right supports the deal as a modest but positive step , and argues that the US has the advantage in future negotiations .
The right supports the deal as a modest but positive step , and argues that the US has the advantage in future negotiations .
“ The trade deal that President Trump announced with China on Friday isn ’ t VE Day , but it ’ s still welcome economic news . The modest deal is essentially a detente that eliminates the damage from pending U.S. tariffs and even makes some progress on longstanding problems like China ’ s intellectual property theft… China is promising to stop conditioning business licenses or other permits on tech transfers to joint-venture partners… China is also promising new protections against patent theft—notably requiring Chinese firms that inform a U.S. competitor if it is selling a product that includes technology that might infringe on the U.S. firm ’ s patent . This so-called patent linkage will give U.S. firms recourse to object before they ’ ve lost market share to the cheating firm…
“ Mr . Trump has done more to address Chinese cheating than any previous President , and he is smart to step back and test if China will honor these new commitments . The deal will also help China ’ s reformers , who want to make these policy changes to overcome its own many economic weaknesses . If China ’ s mercantilists block reform , Mr. Trump or the next President can revisit the terms . Mr. Trump is showing good faith in giving China a chance to show it can play by the rules of honest global trade . ”
“ This looks like a win… Politically , the timing of this is obviously good for the president . He can claim another win on trade just two days after a US-Mexico-Canada trade deal to replace NAFTA was approved in principle by Nancy Pelosi . The vote on that deal is set to take place next week . Pelosi actually took some heat for handing Trump a win in the same week he is being impeached . But more important than the partisan win is the possible end to at least a portion of the trade war with China . That should result in some price relief on consumer goods and even stronger economic growth in the near term . All of that is bound to help the stock market and public perception of the strength of the economy . ”
“ The U.S. has a far more adaptive and diverse economy than China . China ’ s economy is inefficient , bloated , dysfunctional—plagued by institutions and policies that are not fit for their purposes . If the tariff war resumes , it will continue to prove much more disruptive to China than to the U.S… Mr. Xi ’ s purging of more than 1.5 million officials , including top generals and party members , will come back to bite him . In addition to holding a weaker economic hand , Mr. Xi is far more vulnerable to internal rebellion , and therefore more desperate for economic pain relief , than the American president… In every negotiation , pressure is relative , and the U.S. has more political and economic leverage than China…
“ Mr . Trump is properly recasting China as the main threat to a fair and sustainable global economic system . Multinational companies are gradually assessing the commercial risk that sovereign risk poses to them—the possibility that China will arbitrarily alter laws or regulations or fail to honor government bonds when they mature . ”
“ While Chinese concessions will almost surely fall short , the US didn ’ t give up leverage ( as some wanted ) and can respond either to meaningful progress by China or the lack…
“ The US should use [ the deal ] to test Beijing ’ s intentions . Will American exports soar $ 200 billion and coercive technology practice halt – no . But clear progress on both fronts would be an excellent outcome . In this light , complaints the deal doesn ’ t go far enough smack of preferring American capitulation . Sizable tariffs were applied barely six months ago ; the PRC won ’ t undertake major change at the convenience of an increasingly shrill American investor class . The US can now wait to see how China ’ s deeds fit its words — a good position in an election year . ”
It ’ s worth noting that “ conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions… ‍ “ In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer ’ s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey — notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) ”
“ If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? … the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . ”
Others note , “ I ’ d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump ’ s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “ I think Joe Sixpack ’ s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama ’ s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack ’ s attention you are going to have to do better than this . ”","Others argue that “Biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person.

Ol’ Joe is just out of touch! He doesn’t know you can’t use words like that. Meanwhile, every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this. Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade.” Kevin Drum, Mother Jones

“China presents a more formidable rival than the former Soviet Union ever was. Which means that allies matter more than ever to U.S. power . But unlike his predecessors in the age of the Soviet threat, Trump’s first move in his campaign against China was to sabotage the alliances that once enhanced U.S. leverage… The United States cannot impose its will on China. But it can work with others to write rules that China cannot afford to ignore.” David Frum, The Atlantic

“The way to compete with China on trade is neither sweeping tariffs nor the administration’s futile insistence that China change its fundamental economic model… [We need] public investment in research and production to increase our international competitiveness … A much more focused trade policy would do something our trade competitors, including China itself, does: to see around the next corner of global demand where no country has yet to establish a comparative advantage. China did so with the assembly of consumer electronics, but that’s a low value-added play. We should do so in green technology… There’s a clear path to quickly getting unstuck, one that evinces strong progressive values and an export strategy that supports American workers and their communities, not multinational corporations.” Jared Bernstein, New York Times

“From what we can see, there is nothing in this tentative deal that wouldn’t have existed in the absence of the past two years of wrangling. Intellectual property reform has been a long-standing project for President Xi Jinping. China’s first dedicated IP courts were established back in 2014 and have generally dealt fairly with non-Chinese litigants. Penalties, the most glaring weakness in the post-2014 system, are already being toughened. Perhaps that’s come as a result of U.S. pressure — but it fits just as well with China’s domestic priorities… If little has been achieved when [US] leverage was at its highest, even less is going to be achieved once that leverage is ratcheted back down. ” David Fickling, Bloomberg

“The deal on Friday pushes the thorny issue of China’s state support for its industries down the road, most likely complicating relations between the world’s two largest economies for years to come… It seems to affirm the belief, held by many Chinese officials, that Mr. Trump will back off from his trade-war threats if markets tumble, or if his supporters in agricultural states suffer too much. Even before Friday, Mr. Trump had delayed or canceled tariffs four times this year. Such policy shifts could ultimately encourage Beijing to draw out negotiations [for phase II] even further, to reach the best possible deal.” Keith Bradsher, New York Times

“While the benefits of the trade war are speculative, its costs are real: The Tax Foundation estimates that Trump’s tariffs have cost Americans more than $88 billion so far , making this one of the biggest tax hikes in history. To cushion the blow, the administration gave $28 billion to farmers — twice the cost of the 2009 auto industry bailout… [Meanwhile] the real issues with China — from trade barriers to militarism in the South China Sea to human rights violations — remain unaddressed.” Max Boot, Washington Post

“While Lighthizer and Trump are crowing about an expected $40 billion to $50 billion in annual agricultural sales, few analysts believe those numbers are realistic . The highest level of farm products the U.S. has ever exported to China was $26 billion in 2012. Plus, this first phase deal doesn’t do anything about the 25% tariffs already in place on the bulk of goods that China exports to the U.S. Considering this fact, how aggressive will China really be about pursuing increased agricultural purchases and intellectual property protections?” Editorial Board, San Francisco Chronicle

The left is critical of the deal, arguing that its predicted benefits are unrealistic and that it does not address the root issues.

From the Right

The right supports the deal as a modest but positive step, and argues that the US has the advantage in future negotiations.

From the Right

The right supports the deal as a modest but positive step, and argues that the US has the advantage in future negotiations.

“The trade deal that President Trump announced with China on Friday isn’t VE Day, but it’s still welcome economic news. The modest deal is essentially a detente that eliminates the damage from pending U.S. tariffs and even makes some progress on longstanding problems like China’s intellectual property theft… China is promising to stop conditioning business licenses or other permits on tech transfers to joint-venture partners… China is also promising new protections against patent theft—notably requiring Chinese firms that inform a U.S. competitor if it is selling a product that includes technology that might infringe on the U.S. firm’s patent. This so-called patent linkage will give U.S. firms recourse to object before they’ve lost market share to the cheating firm…



“Mr. Trump has done more to address Chinese cheating than any previous President, and he is smart to step back and test if China will honor these new commitments. The deal will also help China’s reformers, who want to make these policy changes to overcome its own many economic weaknesses. If China’s mercantilists block reform, Mr. Trump or the next President can revisit the terms. Mr. Trump is showing good faith in giving China a chance to show it can play by the rules of honest global trade.”

Editorial Board, Wall Street Journal

“This looks like a win… Politically, the timing of this is obviously good for the president. He can claim another win on trade just two days after a US-Mexico-Canada trade deal to replace NAFTA was approved in principle by Nancy Pelosi. The vote on that deal is set to take place next week. Pelosi actually took some heat for handing Trump a win in the same week he is being impeached. But more important than the partisan win is the possible end to at least a portion of the trade war with China. That should result in some price relief on consumer goods and even stronger economic growth in the near term. All of that is bound to help the stock market and public perception of the strength of the economy.”

John Sexton, Hot Air

“The U.S. has a far more adaptive and diverse economy than China. China’s economy is inefficient, bloated, dysfunctional—plagued by institutions and policies that are not fit for their purposes. If the tariff war resumes, it will continue to prove much more disruptive to China than to the U.S… Mr. Xi’s purging of more than 1.5 million officials, including top generals and party members, will come back to bite him. In addition to holding a weaker economic hand, Mr. Xi is far more vulnerable to internal rebellion, and therefore more desperate for economic pain relief, than the American president… In every negotiation, pressure is relative, and the U.S. has more political and economic leverage than China…



“Mr. Trump is properly recasting China as the main threat to a fair and sustainable global economic system. Multinational companies are gradually assessing the commercial risk that sovereign risk poses to them—the possibility that China will arbitrarily alter laws or regulations or fail to honor government bonds when they mature.”

John Lee, Wall Street Journal

“While Chinese concessions will almost surely fall short, the US didn’t give up leverage (as some wanted) and can respond either to meaningful progress by China or the lack…



“The US should use [the deal] to test Beijing’s intentions. Will American exports soar $200 billion and coercive technology practice halt – no. But clear progress on both fronts would be an excellent outcome. In this light, complaints the deal doesn’t go far enough smack of preferring American capitulation. Sizable tariffs were applied barely six months ago; the PRC won’t undertake major change at the convenience of an increasingly shrill American investor class. The US can now wait to see how China’s deeds fit its words — a good position in an election year.”

Derek Scissors, American Enterprise Institute

It’s worth noting that “conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party. In Washington State, voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions… ‍ “In Seattle, the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger. In Colorado, voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap, money that the state Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers. In Sussex County, N.J., voters approved, by a 2-to-1 margin, a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (Washington, Colorado, New Jersey — notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately.)”

Jim Geraghty, National Review

“If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy. In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors?… the nation does not want another war. How we avoid it, however, is becoming difficult to see. John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing, but his soul is marching on.”

Patrick Buchanan, The American Conservative

Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After all that has emerged about Trump so far, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”

It ’ s a pretty safe bet that no candidate is going to campaign as a free trader in the 2020 Democratic primary , setting up the potential for a large-scale realignment on a major policy issue for the party .
The Democratic Party faces a fork in the road , on an issue where President Donald Trump has scrambled all the old alliances .
“ I think we ’ re at a tipping point , ” says Thea Lee , who leads the lefty Economic Policy Institute , which is skeptical of free trade agreements . “ You could see Democrats retreat to their comfort blanket . My hope is we can convince people that ’ s not an option . We ’ re not going to go back to the status quo ante . What we need to do is have a forward-looking vision . ”
Former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama , in part because of their decision to work with congressional Republicans , put the party on the path of free trade . They pursued trade liberalization in service of embracing global competition ; the left ’ s dire warnings of jobs shipping overseas went unheeded . Then Trump staged a protectionist takeover of the Republican Party on his way to the White House .
Conversations with aides to 2020 contenders show Democrats are all over the map on trade . There ’ s a contingent of vocal trade skeptics , like Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who are making the case that Trump — despite all his tough talk on trade — has not been aggressive enough to protect American workers and failed to live up to his promises . Trade-friendly Democrats like former Rep. Beto O ’ Rourke and former Vice President Joe Biden could stake out more of a Clinton/Obama-esque free-trade position in this debate . Stuck between are the likes of Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg . Harris , particularly , has had to answer to the demands of a global California economy without alienating the left-wing grassroots .
One chart , from the Peterson Institute , breaks down the 2020 Democratic field . The institute ’ s experts observed “ Democratic contenders offer widely different perspectives on US trade policy , and thus on US engagement with the world in a post-Trump era . ”
Democrats are on the cusp of a fundamental reorientation for their trade agenda . How 2020 Democrats respond to Trump ’ s brinksmanship will go a long way to define the United States ’ future role in the global economy . Trade is one issue where the president has a lot of freedom to set his or her own agenda once in office , even if a president ultimately needs Congress to ratify new trade deals , giving the Democratic left a real chance to reorient the country ’ s trade policy if one of their candidates prevails .
Manufacturing jobs have dropped precipitously in the United States over the past 50 years . Thousands of American workers were left unemployed when the massive GM plant in Lordstown , Ohio , closed while the company has been increasing production in Mexico , and when the textile industry in North Carolina moved to cheaper labor markets in Brazil , China , Vietnam , and Bangladesh . The labor unions decimated by that macroeconomic trend make up an important piece of any Democratic primary coalition .
Trade skeptics point to multinational companies moving US jobs overseas as one of the material consequences of US trade agreements , an argument Trump adopted during the general election and in the White House . Progressives believe free trade has done more to line corporate pockets than protect workers or the climate .
“ Do trade agreements protect multinational corporations that want to outsource and earn big profits and not be subject to a lot of annoying government regulations , or should they protect workers and consumers and the environment ? ” Lee says . “ I would argue right now we don ’ t have the rules right . We ’ ve adopted a very corporate approach to trade . ”
Democrats have always been more skeptical of trade , but a reorientation at the top of the party in the 1990s led the two most recent Democratic presidents to aggressively pursue free trade deals . Before that , Republicans were the ones seeking the free trade agreements , with a narrower sliver of mainstream Democrats joining them over the objections of their left wing .
The North American Free Trade Agreement — despite Trump ’ s claim that it was “ given to us by Bill Clinton ” — was originally negotiated by Republican President George H.W . Bush . Nearly half of the House Democratic conference , along with a handful of conservative Republicans , voted against it . Labor and environmental groups decried the deal as too weak , and many feared the jobs that would be sent overseas . Even the two top Democrats — House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and House Majority Whip David Bonior — opposed it at the time . Likewise , the Central America Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) , George W. Bush ’ s expansion of NAFTA , passed in 2005 , almost entirely with Republican support ; only 15 Democrats signed on to it .
And the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a behemoth trade deal between countries bordering the Pacific Ocean , including the United States , Mexico , Canada , Japan , Vietnam , Australia , and Chile , which was supposed to be Obama ’ s liberal successor to NAFTA , died after the 2016 election , on the strength of opposition from not only Trump but also from progressives . It became so politically untenable that Hillary Clinton , who praised the deal during her time as Obama ’ s secretary of state , withdrew her support during the primary election in 2016 .
Her move showed that even the Obama-style trade liberalization was going to be a hard sell for Democrats . That is only truer heading into 2020 , as Trump ’ s decision to rip up the old rules about trade has emboldened progressive Democrats who see an opening to outflank the president on one of their core issues .
Some Democrats genuinely thought you could balance trade with populism . It hasn ’ t work out .
Obama , who had voted against CAFTA in his first year in the US Senate , railed against outsourcing jobs on the campaign trail . He said he would renegotiate NAFTA , calling it “ devastating ” and “ a big mistake . ”
But as president , he adopted the more trade-friendly stance that trade was merely a scapegoat for other economic factors — globalization , first and foremost — a belief that permeated his administration as it went to work on the TPP deal that would eventually fail .
“ Trade agreements are how you shape globalization to reflect our interests and our values , ” Mike Froman , who was Obama ’ s US trade representative , told ███ . “ Since you don ’ t get a chance to vote on technology or even globalization , trade agreements have become the scapegoat for other quite legitimate concerns about jobs and wages . ”
Free trade proponents argue most of the job losses in manufacturing have actually been the byproduct of better technology , not trade . They assert the benefits of liberal trade are real but more diffuse — lower prices for consumers on a wide range of goods , namely — while the drawbacks tend to be acute , like when a factory closes because its production is moved elsewhere .
A decade ago , George W. Bush ’ s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that each American household had reaped $ 10,000 in benefits on average that could be attributed to more liberal trade after World War II .
“ Increased trade has made the United States more productive and has contributed to large increases in the U.S. standard of living , ” the report stated .
Democrats who believe in free trade make the case that more investment in a social safety net and domestic programs would alleviate some of the populist anger over trade . For example , building a robust jobs retraining program would help to combat the effects of outsourcing .
Some programs do exist ; Trade Adjustment Assistance , a 1960s entitlement program that has been expanded over the years , offers unemployment benefits and jobs training programs . But the results have been mixed ; younger participants typically fare better than older workers , who generally suffer more financially from outsourced jobs . But those who did enroll in the jobs programs did better than those who did not .
Part of the problem is that the two sides disagree on whether they are even having the right debate . “ It ’ s not either-or . It ’ s both , ” Lee says . “ The comfortable fiction that trade is blameless and it ’ s all technology is not supported by the facts . ”
For Democrats , the 2020 primary will center on the question of credibility . The Obama and Clinton compromises on trade have made hawks more cautious about other contenders with less established records . The left is eyeing much of the 2020 field warily for that reason .
Bernie Sanders has opposed just about every free trade agreement that ’ s come before Congress since they got there in early 1990s . Elizabeth Warren , who fiercely opposed the TPP , enjoys the same cache with the left . They ’ ll argue that Trump ’ s real record hasn ’ t matched up to his populist rhetoric .
The free trade skeptics believe in those two . “ They ’ ve saying that stuff for a long time , ” Lee says . “ I have less confidence in some of the people who have been all over the map and now want to appeal to voters after having been in a lot of different places . That ’ s been a pattern with Democratic politicians in the past . ”
Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar have also generally opposed free-trade deals in office , though it is not a signature issue for them in the same way it is for Sanders and Warren . Still , Booker opposed giving Obama fast-track authority for TPP as did Klobuchar , who also voted against the Central American free trade agreement in 2006 .
Biden , if he runs , has a worker-friendly image , but he will inherit the free trade mantle as a veteran of the Obama administration . Beto O ’ Rourke voted for the TPP deal in the House , which might make him unacceptable to trade hardliners , though he said during his Senate campaign last year that he wanted to see an improved NAFTA negotiated in the coming years .
“ We can not lose that critically important relationship with Mexico and Canada and , by extension , the rest of the world , ” O ’ Rourke said last April . “ Whether it is the energy we produce , whether it is the cotton we grow , whether it is the cattle we raise , all of this has a connection to the rest of the world and very often is looking for a market somewhere else . ”
The TPP was one of the hottest issues in politics during Harris ’ s 2016 Senate campaign , and Harris initially declined to take a firm stance on it : “ We want to strike a balance that allows America ’ s economy to prosper , and that ’ s going to be about our workers and our businesses , ” she said in April 2015 , neither endorsing nor really opposing the trade deal . But once Rep. Loretta Sanchez , a fierce TPP critic , entered the race against her , Harris came out against the trade pact , stating it did not adequately protect US workers or the environment .
Since then , Harris has sat at every intersection of the trade debate . She talks about giving workers a voice and protecting American jobs . But she doesn ’ t approve of Trump ’ s protectionism , a trade regime that she sees as destroying the United States ’ international relations , as well as taking a toll on consumers and manufacturers .
Democrats will decide their post-Trump trade agenda in the 2020 primary
In real-world policy terms , the debate is really about trade agreements and , to some extent , the World Trade Organization . It ’ s about which rules are set for trade and which rules are enforced .
Trade agreements are negotiated by the administration and given preferential treatment for speedy approval in Congress — that ’ s why trade is an issue where presidents can have enormous influence . Those agreements are filled with “ chapters ” — rules , or the basis for rules and regulations rather , on specific issues like intellectual property and labor rights and environmental protections . The president picks the people who wrote these trade agreements and those rules . Trump has not only introduced his headline-grabbing tariffs , but the White House has also overseen the rewriting of a North American trade agreement .
Left-wing Democrats like Warren , and Sanders do not want to go back to the Obama brand of open trade policy . So they have to now distinguish their protectionism , which Sanders popularized on the national political stage during the 2016 election , from Trump ’ s .
Some of their solutions can feel a little abstract — “ negotiate better trade deals ! ” Not far afield from what Donald Trump was promising during the 2016 campaign . It ’ s a weakness even lefty wonks recognize .
“ To be honest , it ’ s something I would like to see all of us on the progressive side spend a lot more time fleshing out , ” Lee says . “ What does a progressive globalization trade agenda look going forward ? People have a little bit of a hard time articulating it . ”
Meanwhile , more free trade–friendly Democrats have a completely different challenge ; their positions on trade are easily distinguishable from Trump ’ s ( they largely support free trade ) but politically dangerous with the progressive grassroots .
Americans broadly are actually more positive toward trade liberalization ( and wary of protectionism ) than the rhetoric from the current president or the progressive firebrands might lead you to believe . There is an audience for it . But not necessarily in a Democratic primary .","Share All sharing options for: The big divide among 2020 Democrats over trade — and why it matters

For Democrats, the 2020 primary will center on the question of credibility. The Obama and Clinton compromises on trade have made hawks more cautious about other contenders with less established records. The left is eyeing much of the 2020 field warily for that reason.

Bernie Sanders has opposed just about every free trade agreement that’s come before Congress since they got there in early 1990s. Elizabeth Warren, who fiercely opposed the TPP, enjoys the same cache with the left. They’ll argue that Trump’s real record hasn’t matched up to his populist rhetoric.

Somewhere in the middle sits Kamala Harris.

Trade agreements are negotiated by the administration and given preferential treatment for speedy approval in Congress — that’s why trade is an issue where presidents can have enormous influence. Those agreements are filled with “chapters” — rules, or the basis for rules and regulations rather, on specific issues like intellectual property and labor rights and environmental protections. The president picks the people who wrote these trade agreements and those rules. Trump has not only introduced his headline-grabbing tariffs, but the White House has also overseen the rewriting of a North American trade agreement.

Left-wing Democrats like Warren, and Sanders do not want to go back to the Obama brand of open trade policy. So they have to now distinguish their protectionism, which Sanders popularized on the national political stage during the 2016 election, from Trump’s.

Some of their solutions can feel a little abstract — “negotiate better trade deals!” Not far afield from what Donald Trump was promising during the 2016 campaign. It’s a weakness even lefty wonks recognize.

“To be honest, it’s something I would like to see all of us on the progressive side spend a lot more time fleshing out,” Lee says. “What does a progressive globalization trade agenda look going forward? People have a little bit of a hard time articulating it.”

Meanwhile, more free trade–friendly Democrats have a completely different challenge; their positions on trade are easily distinguishable from Trump’s (they largely support free trade) but politically dangerous with the progressive grassroots.

Americans broadly are actually more positive toward trade liberalization (and wary of protectionism) than the rhetoric from the current president or the progressive firebrands might lead you to believe. There is an audience for it. But not necessarily in a Democratic primary.",www.vox.com,left,ijGjkwsNWN6d4MSl

The US has reached a deal with Canada to lift tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in a move that could lead to approval for a new North American trade deal.

In a joint statement, the US and Canada announced that a 25% tariff on steel imports, and of 10% on aluminium, will end in 48 hours.

It is widely expected the US and Mexico will make a similar announcement soon.

The US implemented the tariffs last year on grounds of ""national security"".

Under the agreement, there will be no quotas on how much steel or aluminium the three countries buy from overseas.

However, the US and Canada will monitor imports and if a country is determined to be buying in too much, one of the other nations can request a consultation and potentially re-impose tariffs.

What does the agreement mean?

Getting rid of the tariffs is viewed as a key hurdle to approval for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal which was signed in 2018. It replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Providing that Washington and Mexico City also announce an agreement to lift levies on steel and aluminium, the US, Mexico and Canada will ask their respective governments to ratify USMCA.

Canada also announced that it would lift tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium that it implemented last year in retaliation for the Trump administration's levies.

A win awaits for the 'tariff man'

Analysis by Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent

The spotlight had been on rising trade tensions between the US and China.

So America's decision to lift tariffs on steel and aluminium coming from Canada and Mexico was a surprise bit of good news.

As it holds the line with China, the US is now pushing forward with a trade deal much closer to home.

Remember the USMCA trade agreement - meant to replace NAFTA? No?

Hardly a surprise. It has been languishing in the background.

For almost a year now these tariffs had been an obstacle to ratification of the deal. Canada and Mexico had vowed not to move ahead as long as they were in place. And several members of Congress had also raised objections.

This now raises the odds of it crossing the finishing line, opening up a new era of trade expansion in North America.

For Mr Trump, who loves tariffs so much he called himself the 'tariff man', this would be a big win.

And who knows, trade peace in North America might even strengthen his hand in negotiations with China.

It also targeted US farm goods as well as items like tomato ketchup and household products.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday: ""These tariffs were harming workers and consumers on both sides of the border. As we look at moving forward with the new NAFTA, it didn't make a lot of sense to continue to have tariffs on steel and aluminium between our countries.""

What about other countries hit with US tariffs?

European Union steel and aluminium exports to the US are still subject to the tariffs, but there has been some good news for trade relations between the two - on Friday President Donald Trump delayed a decision on whether to impose levies on cars and car part imports.

The White House has put back the decision by six months to allow more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan.

Tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars and car parts were under consideration.

A report by the Commerce Department claimed that imports of foreign-made cars and auto parts into the US were a threat to national security.

The report has not been published, but in Friday's announcement Mr Trump cited its findings which conclude that US carmakers are missing out on revenues to invest in research and development (R&D).

It said: ""The lag in R&D expenditures by American-owned producers is weakening innovation and, accordingly, threatening to impair our national security.""

The president said he agreed with the study's finding that imported cars and trucks were ""weakening our internal economy"".

How are US relations with major trading partners?

The deal with Canada, as well as the delay in higher tariffs on EU and Japanese cars and auto parts, come at a critical time for the US and China - the world's two biggest economies.

Trump is shaking up the world economic order with his zeal for tariffs and embrace of trade conflict. He threw a meeting of the Group of Seven into turmoil by revoking support for the group’s joint statement and berating the summit’s host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Economists expect the direct impact on the U.S. economy to be modest. But if the president follows through on all the duties he’s threatened, including the tariffs against China, U.S. inflation could accelerate by 15 basis points, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

What Our Economists Say The U.S.-China trade conflict is entering a new and potentially damaging phase. ... Bloomberg Economics’s immediate assessment is that if the tariffs come into effect (and ‘if’ does remain a question) that would be a drag for both countries, but -- absent an outsize impact on confidence -- one that would be difficult to discern in the aggregate growth numbers.

Trump’s tariffs may also influence his efforts to bring peace to the Korean peninsula following his summit with leader Kim Jong Un this week in Singapore. Beijing is an important player in talks with North Korea on abandoning its nuclear-weapons program.

‘It’s Foolish’

Wang Huiyao, director of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization and an adviser to China’s cabinet, said Trump’s measures will damage U.S.-China cooperation over North Korea.

“It’s foolish on the part of the Trump team,” he said. “He needs China’s collaboration on North Korea and he gives the impression that he’s burning the bridge after crossing the river.”

Trump had appeared to be taking a more conciliatory approach with China before Friday. His top economic advisers had held weeks of high-level negotiations to ease tensions, with China offering to boost purchases of American goods by $25 billion.

Also, the president earlier this month decided to soften a penalty on Chinese telecom-equipment maker ZTE Corp, resisting opposition from Congress.

In April, the U.S. banned ZTE from buying American technology for seven years, effectively putting the company out of business. But Trump said this month ZTE could avoid the ban if it paid at least $1 billion in penalties, among other things. U.S. senators are seeking ways to block the deal in Congress.

At this point , upward of 75 House Republicans could vote against trade promotion authority if it comes up for a vote in the coming weeks , according to aides and lawmakers involved in the process . Some of the lawmakers fear job losses in their districts from free trade ; others distrust Obama and oppose giving him more power .
House GOP leaders will begin officially canvassing for votes Friday , but they ’ ve been in private strategy sessions for weeks , learning about the intricacies of the bill from Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) .
House Democrats , meanwhile , say just 12 to 20 of their lawmakers support Obama ’ s request . That figure , if it holds , would amount to a stinging rebuke of a president by his own party .
“ It ’ s very low on the Democratic side , ” Rep. Jim Clyburn ( D-S.C. ) said , commenting on the support . House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer ( D-Md . ) said the 12-to-20 figure is “ probably pretty accurate ” but added the White House is keeping the count . The Senate is generally expected to pass the measure .
The fast-track legislation would allow Obama to submit trade agreements to Congress for straight up-or-down votes without amendments . Critics consider the procedure undemocratic , but proponents say other countries won ’ t make their best offers in trade talks with the United States if they know Congress could change the terms of the pact .
Obama needs the bill to complete the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership with Japan and 10 other countries . The pact would cover approximately 40 percent of world economic output , making it the biggest free trade agreement to date . Business groups are pushing hard for the trade bill and the Asia-Pacific agreement , but labor and many activist groups strongly oppose both .

More than 30 pro-business lawmakers who are members of the moderate New Democrat Coalition will meet with Obama on Thursday at the White House .

Obama met last week with Clyburn , CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina , and Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas and Greg Meeks of New York about the trade measure . Clyburn said he ’ s still undecided .

Butterfield said he will continue to research the topic , “ because I want to give the president and those proponents the benefit of the doubt. ” But Democratic support is “ lacking , ” he said .
Democrats who support TPA recognize the weak numbers and say administration officials are doing a lousy job wrangling support . They ’ re spending too much time on policyand no time on politics and casting too wide a net in search of elusive support .

The trade fight is turning into a battle over “ raw numbers , ” Connolly added . “ What ’ s the universe we ’ ve got , and what ’ s the universe they ’ ve got . ”
However , Connolly , who is generally supportive of the pact , added , “ This is President Barack Obama ’ s trade deal , and we shouldn ’ t allow Democrats to forget that . ”

“ We ’ re still working through , ” House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) said Wednesday . “ But this is going to be a bipartisan effort . And we want to see that equal push from the administration . ”
Failing to pass TPA would be an enormous defeat for the major power centers in Washington — but especially for Obama , who has made this trade deal central to his second-term economic agenda . Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) is supportive of free trade and the TPA bill , which was shepherded by his close ally Ryan , and he is pushing for the legislation in closed meetings .
“ Last week , the Ways and Means Committee advanced its bipartisan TPA bill , legislation that will help us achieve the best trade agreements for American workers and job creators , ” Boehner said during a Wednesday morning meeting , according to a source in the room . “ This is a key Republican economic priority , and I look forward to working with Paul and everyone in this room to pass this bill . ”
Boehner has long made clear that Democrats would have to provide a significant number of votes to get the bill through the House . But Democratic leaders are actively working against Obama .

US President Donald Trump has issued a strong warning to anyone trading with Iran, following his re-imposition of sanctions on the country.

""Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,"" the president tweeted.

Some re-imposed sanctions took effect overnight and tougher ones relating to oil exports will begin in November.

Iran's president said the measures were ""psychological warfare"" which aimed to ""sow division among Iranians"".

The sanctions follow the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, earlier this year.

The deal, negotiated during the presidency of Barack Obama, saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.

Mr Trump has called the deal ""one-sided"", ""disastrous"" and the ""worst I've ever seen"". He believes renewed economic pressure will force Iran to agree to a new deal.

The European Union, which remains committed to the original agreement, has spoken out against the sanctions, vowing to protect firms doing ""legitimate business"" with Iran.

What else did Mr Trump say in his latest tweet?

He praised the ""most biting sanctions ever imposed"" and said they would ""ratchet up to another level"" in November.

""I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!"" he said.

On Monday he had said that Iran faced a choice to ""either change its threatening, destabilising behaviour and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation"".

""I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime's malign activities, including its ballistic missile programme and its support for terrorism,"" he said.

What are the sanctions?

Mr Trump signed an executive order that brought sanctions back into place at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT) on Tuesday. They target:

The purchase or acquisition of US banknotes by Iran's government

Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals

Graphite, aluminium, steel, coal and software used in industrial processes

Transactions related to the Iranian rial currency

Activities relating to Iran's issuance of sovereign debt

Iran's automotive sector

A second phase is planned to come back into effect on 5 November which will have implications for Iran's energy and shipping sectors, petroleum trading and transactions by foreign financial institutions with the Central Bank of Iran.

What has the reaction been?

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the US government had ""turned their back on diplomacy"".

They also unveiled a ""blocking statute"", which is intended to protect European firms doing business with Iran despite the new US sanctions.

Alistair Burt, the UK's minister of state for the Middle East, told the BBC: ""If a company fears legal action taken against it and enforcement action taken against it by an entity in response to American sanctions, then that company can be protected as far as EU legislation is concerned.""

He said Iran would simply ""batten down the hatches"" until the next US election.

However, German car and lorry maker Daimler, which announced a joint venture in Iran last year, confirmed this week that it has now ceased activities in the country.

How will Iran's economy be affected?

Iran has already seen unrest since last December over a poorly-performing economy.

Rising food prices, unemployment and even poor water supplies have led to protests in a number of cities.

Demonstrations in Tehran in June were said to be the capital's biggest since 2012.

How much they are tied to the new US sanctions policy is hard to determine, but one definite link is the effect on Iran's currency. It lost around half of its value after Mr Trump announced the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.

Iran acted by easing its foreign exchange rules on Sunday, and the rial has strengthened by 20% since then.

Iranians have been hoarding gold as a safeguard, pushing it to a record high in Tehran.

The sanctions may bite hardest in November, when the US blocks Iranian oil sales.

This could halt about half of Iran's exports of some two million barrels a day, although Iran may look to China and Russia to keep its industry afloat.

The International Monetary Fund said in March that Iran's net official reserves could decline this year to $97.8bn, which would finance about 13 months of imports. And analysts at BMI Research say Iran's economy could contract by 4.3% in 2019.

However, Barbara Slavin, of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told the Wall Street Journal that when sanctions hit hard, it often means ordinary people become ""totally dependent"" on their government and so sanctions do not tend to topple regimes.

What do young Iranians think?

As the first tranche of new US sanctions kicks in, young Iranians have been sharing their stories with BBC Persian. Many are already feeling the effects, as the economy had slowed down in anticipation of what was to come.

""I used to work in marketing for a home appliance manufacturer,"" said Peyman. ""I lost my job as the company can't import the components.""

Aerospace engineer Ali lost his job of 13 years because his company couldn't import equipment.

""Now I'm working as a taxi driver to feed my family,"" he said. Many people say they're no longer being paid on time and are finding it hard to make ends meet.

A construction worker, also called Ali, said he hadn't been paid for 13 months. Omid, a doctor, was doing overtime to pay the rent and save up to get married.

Many people said they were losing hope. Sama said falling exchange rates meant her monthly salary was now worth half what it was six months ago.

""Buying a house or a nice car is like a dream now, she said. ""Even buying a good mobile phone soon will be impossible for people like me.""",www.bbc.com,center,ZVIIjjg51BQwuDka

BIARRITZ, France – Fears of a global recession and a mélange of other troubling issues awaited President Donald Trump and other leaders of the world’s most industrialized economies as they arrived on Saturday at a seaside resort village in southwest France for their annual G-7 summit.

Economists are warning that the world’s biggest economies, including the U.S., Britain and Germany, are in danger of falling into recession. Tensions are high in the Middle East amid Iran’s seizure of foreign ships traveling through the Strait of Hormuz. Disputes over trade and climate change continue to test the G-7 leaders’ desire for unity.

And then there’s Trump, who has stoked divisions within the group.

Just last month, Trump touched off a transcontinental contretemps with French President Emmanuel Macron over France’s new digital services tax that has angered American tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Trump threatened to retaliate by – mon dieu! – slapping tariffs on imported French wines. He repeated the threat Friday night before departing the White House for France.

The tariff threat prompted a response from European Union Council President Donald Tusk, who told reporters Saturday “If the U.S. imposes tariffs on France, the E.U. will respond in kind.""

“G-7 member countries and attendees are understandably heading into this weekend's summit with some trepidation,” said Lauren Wright, a political scientist at Princeton University.

In these kinds of settings, Wright said, many dynamics and personalities come into play, with each leader concerned about challenges at home in addition to the broader issues that require everyone’s attention and cooperation.
