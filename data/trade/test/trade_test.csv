The Trump administration set Sunday as a deadline for Canada to strike a deal.

A win for Trump?

Andrew Walker, BBC Economics Correspondent

Is this a win for President Trump? He certainly has got Canada and Mexico to agree some important things he wanted.

It will be harder, or at least more expensive, for car makers to use parts from outside North America, notably from China. American dairy farmers are getting better access to the highly protected Canadian market.

There may well be some political benefit for him in the forthcoming Congressional elections.

But he has another wider objective - to reduce the imbalance in US international trade, with individual trade partners and globally.

The US imports more than it exports and President Trump wants to change that. Judging whether he has won in that sense will need more time.

However, many economists don't think trade balances are primarily the outcome of trade policy - instead they reflect government borrowing, private investment and savings decisions and international capital movements.

What has been the reaction?

The Canadian dollar jumped to a five-month high and the Mexican peso rose to its highest level for seven weeks on news of the deal.

Meredith Crowley, international trade economist at the University of Cambridge, said the agreement on dairy looked to be a ""cosmetic concession"" so in one way Canada had done well out of the pact.

She said the insertion of a minimum wage level for car parts workers could lead to similar clauses in other trade deals.

""If it turns out to be very politically popular in the US it could [be used again],"" she said,

Canadian dairy farmers were critical. ""We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood,"" said Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada.

Republicans and President Barack Obama are both eager to act on a massive Asia-Pacific deal , an even bigger agreement with the European Union and legislation that would fast-track their approval by Congress — all of which have a shot of moving next year .
So while many in Washington are bracing for stalemates on issues as wide-ranging as health care to immigration , the climate could be just right to move the kind of bipartisan trade agreements not seen since NAFTA 20 years ago .
And with trillions of dollars at stake for both the domestic and global economies , trade could become a signature issue for both Republicans and the president as they look to claim significant political victories .
“ The temperature is rising , and I think , at least now , we have President Obama making very direct comments to support the trade agenda in a way that I hadn ’ t seen in a long while , ” said Mireya Solis , a senior fellow and Japan expert at the Brookings Institution .
The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement , which would cover about 40 percent of the world ’ s gross domestic product and about a third of global trade , is expected to get a huge boost from the GOP takeover of the Senate , with Republicans eager to pass legislation that would expedite congressional approval of that and several other pacts .
But the trade promotion authority legislation , which would allow Obama to send the agreement to lawmakers for an up-or-down vote with no amendments , could also serve as a legislative vehicle for a slew of other trade bills that have been waiting in the wings , including measures to renew tariff cuts for developing nations , sub-Saharan Africa and U.S. manufacturers , and to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank .
The last time Washington saw even a piece of this kind of trade action was in 2011 , when Congress approved the South Korea , Colombia and Panama free trade deals in rapid succession .
The United States is also expected to finish negotiations on major expansion of an Information Technology Agreement with nearly 80 countries that account for about 90 percent of world technology trade .

If all of that isn ’ t enough , the U.S. is also pushing a new Environmental Goods Agreement with 13 other members of the World Trade Organization — including China and the EU — that compose about 86 percent of global trade .

Republicans and President Barack Obama are both eager to act on a massive Asia-Pacific deal, an even bigger agreement with the European Union and legislation that would fast-track their approval by Congress — all of which have a shot of moving next year.

So while many in Washington are bracing for stalemates on issues as wide-ranging as health care to immigration, the climate could be just right to move the kind of bipartisan trade agreements not seen since NAFTA 20 years ago.

And with trillions of dollars at stake for both the domestic and global economies, trade could become a signature issue for both Republicans and the president as they look to claim significant political victories.

“The temperature is rising, and I think, at least now, we have President Obama making very direct comments to support the trade agenda in a way that I hadn’t seen in a long while,” said Mireya Solis, a senior fellow and Japan expert at the Brookings Institution.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which would cover about 40 percent of the world’s gross domestic product and about a third of global trade, is expected to get a huge boost from the GOP takeover of the Senate, with Republicans eager to pass legislation that would expedite congressional approval of that and several other pacts.

But the trade promotion authority legislation, which would allow Obama to send the agreement to lawmakers for an up-or-down vote with no amendments, could also serve as a legislative vehicle for a slew of other trade bills that have been waiting in the wings, including measures to renew tariff cuts for developing nations, sub-Saharan Africa and U.S. manufacturers, and to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.

The last time Washington saw even a piece of this kind of trade action was in 2011, when Congress approved the South Korea, Colombia and Panama free trade deals in rapid succession.

The United States is also expected to finish negotiations on major expansion of an Information Technology Agreement with nearly 80 countries that account for about 90 percent of world technology trade. The deal, which would eliminate duties on a long list of tech products, came within a hair’s breadth of concluding this month, but talks broke down after China refused to meet other countries’ demands for concessions on what goods to make duty-free.

The White House will also press forward with the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the U.S. and the 28-nation European Union, a deal even bigger than the TPP, with European Union leaders earlier this month calling for the talks to finish up by the end of 2015.

For example , where ’ s even an English-language version ? There ’ s nothing new about such agreements coming out in both English and Chinese , raising thorny questions about ensuring that key terms in both languages are commonly understood — on top of all the towering issues raised by China ’ s long record of flouting official commitments it ’ s made .
But if something worth announcing officially on both sides has actually been produced , why is the most detailed description so far this statement from the U.S. Trade Representative ’ s ( USTR ) office ?
Why does this statement contain plenty of specifics about U.S. tariff reductions ( except for the actual dates by which American levies on imports from China will be cut ) but no specifics about China ’ s own pledges ?
In that vein , no useful accounts have been released of what China will actually buy from the United States ( though it ’ s interesting that President Donald Trump has included manufactures on the list — not simply agricultural products and other commodities ) , and by when the Chinese will buy these goods . Special bonus — shortly after noon , the President said he “ thinks ” China will hit $ 50 billion in U.S. agriculture imports . Over what time period ? Heaven only knows .
Don ’ t forget — such import increases will be the most easily described and verifiable aspects of any agreement .
So maybe since these terms are still being left so vague , it shouldn ’ t be surprising that there ’ s absolutely nothing from the administration so far about “ structural reforms and other changes to China ’ s economic and trade regime in the areas of intellectual property , technology transfer , agriculture , financial services , and currency and foreign exchange . ”
Even the Trump administration has viewed these issues — which lie at the heart of the intertwined U.S.-China technology and national security rivalries , as well as of the purely economic rivalry — as so challenging to address diplomatically that rapid progress can ’ t be made .
Why else would Trump have settled for now for seeking a shorter term , interim agreement ?

OK, let’s assume that something deserving the name “U.S.-China trade deal” has been reached — even one dubbed “Phase One” or “preliminary.” Deep doubts would remain justified about whether it can possibly serve American interests.

For example, where’s even an English-language version? There’s nothing new about such agreements coming out in both English and Chinese, raising thorny questions about ensuring that key terms in both languages are commonly understood — on top of all the towering issues raised by China’s long record of flouting official commitments it’s made.

But if something worth announcing officially on both sides has actually been produced, why is the most detailed description so far this statement from the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR) office?

No specifics

Why does this statement contain plenty of specifics about U.S. tariff reductions (except for the actual dates by which American levies on imports from China will be cut) but no specifics about China’s own pledges?

In that vein, no useful accounts have been released of what China will actually buy from the United States (though it’s interesting that President Donald Trump has included manufactures on the list — not simply agricultural products and other commodities), and by when the Chinese will buy these goods. Special bonus — shortly after noon, the President said he “thinks” China will hit $50 billion in U.S. agriculture imports. Over what time period? Heaven only knows.

Don’t forget — such import increases will be the most easily described and verifiable aspects of any agreement.

Structural reforms

So maybe since these terms are still being left so vague, it shouldn’t be surprising that there’s absolutely nothing from the administration so far about “structural reforms and other changes to China’s economic and trade regime in the areas of intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange.”

Even the Trump administration has viewed these issues — which lie at the heart of the intertwined U.S.-China technology and national security rivalries, as well as of the purely economic rivalry — as so challenging to address diplomatically that rapid progress can’t be made.

Why else would Trump have settled for now for seeking a shorter term, interim agreement?

If genuine breakthroughs have been made that will strengthen and safeguard and enrich Americans, terrific. But if so, what’s the point of couching them in generalities? And if not, what’s the point in claiming major progress?

Dispute resolution

Also completely, and crucially, omitted are any indications of what’s actually meant by “a strong dispute resolution system that ensures prompt implementation and enforcement.”

In particular, if the United States doesn’t insist on the last word in judging Chinese compliance and meting out punishment when agreement terms are broken, then this deal will work no better on behalf of U.S.-based producers (employers and employees alike) than previous arrangements under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that pleased only the corporate Offshoring Lobby, its hired guns in Washington, D.C., and the Mainstream Media journalists who have long parroted its talking points.

So if the United States is not recognized as sole judge, jury, and court of appeals when dealing with Chinese compliance, history teaches that will be the case that the agreement literally will be worthless.

Politics are puzzling

The politics of this U.S. announcement are puzzling in the extreme as well.

China’s economy obviously has taken a much greater trade war hit than America’s — of course mainly because it’s so much more trade-dependent. Beijing’s dictators are struggling to contain unrest in Hong Kong.

The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace NAFTA, will offset some of the China-related losses suffered by the agriculture-heavy states so critical to Trump’s re-election hopes. The polls show unmistakably that the president is winning the impeachment battle in the court of public opinion.

And even before the congressional Democrats’ efforts to remove him from office began bogging down, their party’s slate of presidential candidates had started looking so weak to so many in Democratic ranks that a gaggle of newcomers jumped into the primary campaign on stunningly short notice.

In short, this is no time for Trump to reach any deal with China — whatever phase it’s called. In fact, it’s the time for the president to keep the pressure on (because whatever weakens the Chinese economy ipso facto benefits the United States these days).

And since a deal that promotes real U.S. interests remains impossible to reach because of verification obstacles, it’s also time for Trump to start signaling to American business that major tariffs on China are here to stay for the time being, and may even increase down the road.

That’s one way to eliminate any uncertainty employers are feeling about doing business with China that will increase the odds of building a new, improved bilateral relationship — not restore its epically failed predecessor.

Reasons to hope

The only reasons for optimism on the U.S.-China trade front right now? Just two that I can identify, but they’re hardly trivial.

First, for all the reasons cited above, the supposed Phase One deal is clearly still so tentative and, frankly, so flimsy, that it’s likely to fall apart sooner rather than later.

Second, U.S.-China decoupling will continue — precisely because the closely related technology and national security gulf dividing the two countries can’t be bridged diplomatically, and because even previously gullible U.S.-owned companies in numerous industries will now be thinking twice about exposing themselves, or exposing themselves further, to the whims of China’s utterly lawless and unreliable government.",www.marketwatch.com,right,3iqy1g5k36MAWzNR

The simplified version of what happened is this: Democrats really like TAA. Republicans like TPA.

The Obama administration really needs TPA to negotiate the trade deal, and so to torpedo the whole deal, Democrats voted down the worker assistance package in huge numbers.

So now, there's nothing to do but wait. The House voted today to give themselves until July 30 to get the votes they need to get the package passed. And by the numbers, it's clear that Obama and the House GOP have their work cut out for them in procuring those votes.

In an extremely polarized Congress, that's an unusually haphazard-looking mix of votes. To understand exactly who voted how and why, we've broken the vote down into four groups.

No on both: 143 Democrats, 49 Republicans

Who they are: Liberal democrats (including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi) and conservative Republicans.

What it means: The Democrats that have tended to be against TPP have also tended to be more liberal Dems — like Maryland's Donna Edwards and Minnesota's Keith Ellison — who have no problem breaking with President Obama. This group of House Dems are so against TPP that they were willing to sink TAA, a policy Dems tend to like. The other thing that makes this group notable?

These Republicans who voted against the trade agenda have given a mix of reasons — they're concerned about jobs, they think the deal is too secretive, and they simply don't want to give Obama more power, for example.

Yes on both: 27 Democrats, 81 Republicans

Who they are: Pro-TPP Republicans, Obama allies, and members in centrist, contested districts.

What it means: This group includes Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, one of the loudest supporters of TPP over the last few months. Among the few Democrats was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, falling in line behind Obama, and more centrist Dems like Texas' Henry Cuellar and California's Jim Costa.

Who they are: John Boehner and the largest chunk of Republicans.

trade,Washington Post,0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/29/trump-china-hong-kong-who/,Trump says U.S. to withdraw from World Health Organization and announces new broadsides against Beijing,2020-05-29,"David J. Lynch, Emily Rauhala, Foreign Affairs","In Rose Garden remarks , Trump alleged that the Chinese government covered up the coronavirus outbreak and instigated `` a global pandemic that has cost more than 100,000 American lives and over 1 million lives worldwide. ” The president also attacked the World Health Organization as effectively controlled by Beijing .
“ We will today be terminating our relationship ” with the WHO , the president said , adding that the organization ’ s more than $ 400 million annual U.S. contribution will be diverted to other health groups .
The president later issued a proclamation to protect sensitive American university research from Chinese spying and to bar an unspecified number of Chinese nationals from entering the United States for graduate study . He also directed an administration working group headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to evaluate Chinese corporations listed on U.S. financial markets as potential targets of future restrictions .
The moves seemed certain to intensify growing U.S.-China tensions , though investors on Friday took them in stride .
The president ’ s comments were as notable for what he did not say . There was no mention of his irritation with China ’ s failure to quickly increase purchases of American goods as required by the trade deal he signed in January . He also made no direct reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping , even as he said “ the world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government . ”
In one sign of Trump ’ s increased fury with the world ’ s second-largest economy , on Friday morning he tweeted simply : “ CHINA ! ”
His formal Friday announcement — while long on harsh rhetoric — was short on details . The president reiterated some familiar grievances , blaming the Chinese for stealing American trade secrets and jobs and assailing his predecessors for allegedly letting them get away with it .
He expanded his indictment of the Chinese government to include its program of island construction in the South China Sea , a national security concern he rarely addresses .
“ The Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many nations , ” he said .
Trump also stopped short of taking concrete action against the U.S.-listed Chinese companies he said posed “ hidden and undue risks ” for American investors . The Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators have complained for years about China ’ s refusal to grant access to their companies ’ audit records .
As of last year , 156 Chinese companies — including 11 with significant government ownership — traded on U.S. markets , according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission , a nonpartisan congressional body .
After Trump ’ s remarks , Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) suggested the president was trying to use China to distract from the pandemic and battered economy .
“ President Trump ’ s Rose Garden event just now was pathetic , '' he said . “ It perfectly encapsulates his inability to lead when our nation needs it most . The only question is whether President Trump is afraid to lead or just doesn ’ t know how . ”
Trump ’ s announcement followed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ’ s statement earlier this week that Hong Kong was no longer sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to deserve separate treatment . Under the 1997 handover agreement with the United Kingdom , China agreed to preserve the former British colony ’ s democratic system for 50 years . Xi ’ s decision to impose security legislation on Hong Kong directly rather than by working through the territory ’ s local legislature may mark the collapse of that “ one country , two systems ” approach .
Some advocates of a tougher U.S. approach to China were disappointed by the president ’ s 10-minute statement .
“ They didn ’ t do anything with regard to Hong Kong . His Hong Kong comments could have been issued as a statement a week ago , ” said Derek Scissors , a China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute . “ The administration has absolutely considered specific actions since the NPC proposal was made public but decided not to announce a single one . ”
Caught in the middle of the deepening U.S.-China dispute are more than 1,350 U.S. corporations with offices in Hong Kong .

“We will today be terminating our relationship” with the WHO, the president said, adding that the organization’s more than $400 million annual U.S. contribution will be diverted to other health groups.

The president later issued a proclamation to protect sensitive American university research from Chinese spying and to bar an unspecified number of Chinese nationals from entering the United States for graduate study. He also directed an administration working group headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to evaluate Chinese corporations listed on U.S. financial markets as potential targets of future restrictions.

The moves seemed certain to intensify growing U.S.-China tensions, though investors on Friday took them in stride.

AD

The president’s comments were as notable for what he did not say. There was no mention of his irritation with China’s failure to quickly increase purchases of American goods as required by the trade deal he signed in January. He also made no direct reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as he said “the world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government.”

AD

In one sign of Trump’s increased fury with the world’s second-largest economy, on Friday morning he tweeted simply: “CHINA!”

His formal Friday announcement — while long on harsh rhetoric — was short on details. The president reiterated some familiar grievances, blaming the Chinese for stealing American trade secrets and jobs and assailing his predecessors for allegedly letting them get away with it.

AD

He expanded his indictment of the Chinese government to include its program of island construction in the South China Sea, a national security concern he rarely addresses.

“The Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many nations,” he said.

Trump also stopped short of taking concrete action against the U.S.-listed Chinese companies he said posed “hidden and undue risks” for American investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators have complained for years about China’s refusal to grant access to their companies’ audit records.

AD

As of last year, 156 Chinese companies — including 11 with significant government ownership — traded on U.S. markets, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a nonpartisan congressional body.

AD

After Trump’s remarks, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) suggested the president was trying to use China to distract from the pandemic and battered economy.

“President Trump’s Rose Garden event just now was pathetic,"" he said. “It perfectly encapsulates his inability to lead when our nation needs it most. The only question is whether President Trump is afraid to lead or just doesn’t know how.”

Trump’s announcement followed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s statement earlier this week that Hong Kong was no longer sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to deserve separate treatment. Under the 1997 handover agreement with the United Kingdom, China agreed to preserve the former British colony’s democratic system for 50 years. Xi’s decision to impose security legislation on Hong Kong directly rather than by working through the territory’s local legislature may mark the collapse of that “one country, two systems” approach.

AD

AD

Some advocates of a tougher U.S. approach to China were disappointed by the president’s 10-minute statement.

“They didn’t do anything with regard to Hong Kong. His Hong Kong comments could have been issued as a statement a week ago,” said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute. “The administration has absolutely considered specific actions since the NPC proposal was made public but decided not to announce a single one.”

Caught in the middle of the deepening U.S.-China dispute are more than 1,350 U.S. corporations with offices in Hong Kong. The erosion of the city’s freedoms, including an independent judiciary, threatens to turn one of the global economy’s financial centers into just another Chinese city and calls into question the rationale for such a sizable commercial presence there.

The truth about US manufacturing

By Patrik Jonsson and Simon Montlake, Staff writers

Tom Fitch remembers attending a community meeting one night in 1997 at the North Lake Country Club here in Shelby, N.C., a small city of red-brick storefronts and wide boulevards.

He listened as members of the local business establishment claimed that the North American Free Trade Agreement would give local businesses and textile plants millions of new customers and boost job growth.

Mr. Fitch didn’t buy it. The owner of a boutique sign business, he already stood out amid the suit-and-tie crowd in his jeans and beaked cap. His concern was that the implementation of NAFTA would flood the United States with cheap imports and shutter local mills.

He turned out to be prescient.

Shelby lost 40 percent of its factory jobs between 1999 and 2014 and saw the poverty rate rise to double the national average.

Yet today a small renaissance is under way in the area. Schletter Inc., the US subsidiary of a German solar-panel manufacturer, has hired 305 people.

Shelby’s failures and fortunes represent a microcosm of the US in the era of more open global commerce. Free trade is often portrayed in stark, one-dimensional terms: as a menace that has cost the US millions of jobs while enriching China and Mexico.

But the truth is more complicated, and the big emerging question is: How much should the US pull back from free trade – if at all?

CIVICS 101: The United States' zig-zag course on trade

By Laurent Belsie, Staff writer

One driver of the American Revolution – for the very idea of America as an independent nation – was foreign trade. Many colonists chafed under England’s attempts to control and limit their ability to trade everything from sugar from the West Indies to fur with Native Americans. The Boston Tea Party came about not because Parliament raised the duties on tea (it actually lowered them), but because it gave the British East India Company duty-free access to the colonies, undercutting the local merchants and smugglers.

But if the United States was born with the ideals of freer trade, it has since sailed a zig-zag course between liberalization and protectionism.

It started innocently enough when Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, looking to fund the new federal government under the Constitution, imposed mild tariffs on imported goods. Tariffs soon shot upward as subsequent administrations looked to pay for wars and other operations. Under President Jefferson, Congress blocked virtually all international commerce for 16 months, an embargo with harsh economic consequences. By 1830, duties on imports stood at a whopping 60 percent, higher than even the disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariffs imposed a century later.

But South Carolina’s threat to nullify the tariff (and possibly secede) changed all that. From the Compromise Tariff of 1833 to 1860, average tariffs fell to less than 20 percent. Midwestern farmers could export their grain.

After the Civil War, tariffs began rising again with Republicans arguing they protected domestic industries. The era continued through 1930, when Congress passed the so-called Smoot-Hawley Tariff. By 1932, US imports and exports had fallen by two-thirds.

The Great Depression was so traumatic that Congress changed course again with the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. From then on the US has moved increasingly toward freer trade with average tariffs falling from 18.4 percent in 1934 to 1.3 percent by 2007. And postwar agreements have created an international infrastructure for negotiating multilateral trade deals and resolving disputes.

The current presidential election, where Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and the GOP’s Donald Trump have qualified their support for trade liberalization, represents a potential break from the bipartisan consensus that has lasted 70 years.

But the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has earned the ire of the far right and far left, represents only incremental liberalization (like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which spurred a similar backlash in the 1990s). If it doesn’t pass, the $5 trillion worth of US exports and imports will continue to flow, points out Douglas Irwin, a trade historian at Dartmouth College, in an e-mail. “Few are suggesting that we roll back the opening of trade.”

INTERVIEW: Robert Scott, the trade expert Trump cited 20 times

Robert Scott is a man of the moment. As an expert for the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington, Mr. Scott has long sounded alarms against the effects that global trade is having on the American economy. For many years, arguments like his were largely pushed to the side.

But presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump captured the concerns of many voters. Mr. Trump even cited Scott’s research 20 times in a July speech on manufacturing. In an interview with the Monitor, Scott shares his thoughts on how the debate about free trade is changing.

Scott shared his thoughts with the Monitor's Simon Montlake. His answers have been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q: In the political debate over the benefits of free trade, what aspects are missing or misrepresented?

I would like to rebalance trade. I think that’s a key issue. But there’s a much larger issue at stake and that is that trade redistributes income to a much, much larger number of people. Essentially, it redistributes income from everyone who doesn’t have a college degree to those that do, and the population that doesn’t have a college degree makes up a little bit less two-thirds of the labor force. It’s 100 million people.

OUR PICKS: Recommended reading and viewing

1. ""What is TPP? The massive trade deal, explained,"" by CNN

The Trans Pacific Partnership is a trade deal that encompasses 40 percent of the world's economy. There are 12 of them total participating in the deal, but just as important as those 12, is the one that's not: China.... The deal is all about setting the rules on labor, the environment, economics, around that Asia-Pacific region in a way that lets the United States have a lot to do with it and sort of prevents China from setting lower standards.

2. ""Is NAFTA a success story or damaging policy?"" by PBS News Hour

The prospect of reaching new cross-border trade deals was very much on the mind of President Obama during his trip to Mexico this week. But a trade agreement that is now two decades old, and still the subject of debate, is casting a long shadow over the president's plans.

3. ""Where Jobs are Squeezed by Chinese Trade, Voters Seek Extremes,"" by The New York Times

Between 2002 and 2010, districts in the top 5th percentile of trade exposure, on average, experienced a 19 percent greater drop in manufacturing employment relative to districts at the other end of the spectrum. Those hard-hit districts became, on average, far more conservative: the ideological equivalent of moving from Marco Rubio to Ted Cruz.

4. ""Five myths about trade,"" by The Washington Post

In a Michael Crichton-esque throwback to the 1980s, Trump loves to toss Japan into his triad of great trade villains, along with China and Mexico – especially in terms of automobiles.... But while it's true that Japan exports cars to the United States, it doesn't do that nearly as much as it used to, even though Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans dot the list of best-selling automobiles. Today, many Japanese brands build vehicles in the United States – more than twice as many autos as those shipped from Japan into U.S. ports.

5. ""Dissecting the miracle: The ingredients of German economic success are more complex than they seem,"" by The Economist

At first sight German industry does seem strong. Its main components – cars, chemicals, machine tools – have been the same for decades. Although Berlin has become a bit of a European digital hub, and Germany's SAP is the world's third-largest software company, the country has no Apple, Facebook or any other household name of the new economy. Look more closely, though, and German firms dominate some less obvious but crucial arteries of globalisation.

6. ""Currency manipulation and manufacturing job loss: Why negotiating 'great trade deals' is not the answer,"" by the Economic Policy Institute

Rebalancing the dollar could reduce the trade deficit and expand US GDP.... Thus, ending currency manipulation is one of the few policy issues that has a strong, bipartisan appeal in Congress. Making progress on this issue could empower a new president to work with Congress on other, more controversial issues such as expanded infrastructure spending. Thus, rebalancing the dollar and rebuilding US manufacturing are policy issues that could be adopted by any of the candidates running for national office in 2016.

HANNOVER , Germany — President Obama on Sunday defended a controversial trade deal between the United States and the European Union that he wants to finalize before leaving office in January .
Speaking at a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Obama said people around the world are unsettled by globalization but that trade has brought tremendous benefits and more jobs .
`` When people visibly see a plant lost or jobs lost , the narrative drives a lot of suspicion about these trade deals , '' he said . `` If you look at the benefits for our economies , it is indisputable that they are made stronger . ''
Obama said it was necessary to complete the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) agreement because 95 % of markets are outside U.S. borders . He said he was confident that TTIP could be completed by the end of the year . A separate trade pact covering 12 Pacific rim countries known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership could `` start moving forward '' once the U.S. presidential election is over , he said .
Obama praised Merkel several times during the news conference before the two leaders then opened the Hannover Messe , the world 's largest industrial technology trade fair .
`` This is as important a relationship as I have had during my presidency . Angela has been consistent and steady , '' Obama said . `` She has a really good sense of humor that she does n't always show in press conferences . That 's probably why she has lasted so long as a leader . She watches what she says . ''
He said Merkel was `` on the right side of history '' for her lenient policies to admit refugees , and she was `` courageous '' for her handling of Europe 's migrant crisis because it was a position that has harmed her political approval ratings .
Obama arrived in Germany on Sunday from London , where me met with British Prime Minister David Cameron , had lunch and dinner with members of the royal family and interjected his opinion into the United Kingdom 's contentious debate over whether that country should leave the EU .
Britain will hold a June 23 vote on the issue . The president angered anti-EU campaigners by saying the U.K. 's trade clout outside the 28-member bloc would be diminished .
TTIP 's supporters say the trade pact would make it easier and cheaper for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to do business together , as well as provide a much needed boost to the global economy amid persistent , sluggish growth . There is fierce opposition to TTIP in Germany — Europe 's largest economy and most important political voice — where it is believed the deal would erode consumer and environmental protections .
About 35,000 people marched in Hannover on Saturday against the proposed deal that would cover more than 800 million people .
Merkel said in the news conference that adopting TTIP was an important step that would allow European economies to grow . `` We need to speed matters up now , '' she said .
While in London , Obama said TTIP would bring millions of jobs and billions of dollars in benefits to both regions . About 300 U.S. companies are attending the trade show in Hannover .
Obama acknowledged that negotiating trade deals was `` tough ” because countries want to fight for their domestic interests . “ The main thing between the United States and Europe is trying to just break down some of the regulatory differences that make it difficult to do business back and forth , ” the president said .
A recent survey published by the Bertelsmann foundation , a Germany-based research group , found only one in five Germans favors the proposed trade pact , and one in three would reject it completely . In the U.S. , only 18 % of respondents oppose TTIP , the report found .

Now , the United States is imposing a new round of punishing tariff increases on Chinese goods .
Eleventh-hour negotiations got under way on Thursday between a high-level Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He and US negotiators led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer .
The pressure to salvage a trade deal between the two sides ratcheted up on Wednesday after the US formally filed paperwork that would make good on President Donald Trump 's Twitter threat earlier in the week to raise tariffs on Chinese imports .
From Friday , tariffs are increasing on $ 200bn worth of Chinese goods , from 10 to 25 percent . China promises to retaliate but has not offered specifics on possible countermeasures .
Senior Trump administration officials have accused Beijing of reneging on commitments made during earlier trade talks . Speaking at a rally in Florida on Wednesday , Trump had said China `` broke the deal '' . But Trump changed his tone on Thursday with a tweet saying he had received a `` beautiful letter '' from Chinese President Xi Jinping .
With the trade war entering its second year , the US and China are wrestling with a long list of hot-button issues .
Most analysts agree Beijing stands to lose more than Washington if the bilateral trade conflict is prolonged . China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) could fall by some 1.6 percent this year if punitive tariffs continue to squeeze Chinese companies out of American markets , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) estimates .
Meanwhile , strong US economic growth , a healthy job market and a less-jittery Wall Street have ushered in a bold new stance by the Trump administration .
The US economy grew 3.2 percent in the first quarter , unemployment is hovering at a 50-year low , and a US stock market rally this year has boosted investor confidence - albeit amidst a general perception that the US and China were moving towards a deal .
`` The US imported about $ 540bn in goods from China last year , and had exports to China of $ 120bn , '' Robert E Scott , an economist at the Economic Policy Institute , told ███ . `` Neither figure is a large share of US GDP , which reached $ 21.1 trillion in the first quarter . ''
`` Its $ 540bn in exports to the US in 2018 represented four percent of [ China 's $ 13.4 trillion ] economy , '' he said . `` In other words , China is roughly seven times as vulnerable to trade disruption as the United States in this particular dispute . ''
Given the strength of the US dollar , weakness in the Chinese yuan and Chinese importers absorbing additional costs , Scott believes the effect should be `` small and manageable '' for the US economy .
However , other experts believe the Trump administration 's position may not be as strong as headline indicators suggest .
`` [ US ] companies have absorbed much of the cost of tariffs so far , particularly in the goods that were only targeted at 10 percent , '' Andrew Coflan , a China analyst with Eurasia Group , told ███ .
`` Twenty-five percent , however , is much more difficult to absorb , given margins in global supply chains , '' Coflan added , referring to Friday 's increase . `` These costs will be passed on to consumers in a way that current tariffs have not been . This will lead to both inflation and job loss , two challenges that this administration has not had to deal with . ''
But even if the US starts to feel the heat , China is likely to experience more economic pain because of higher reliance on exports and increasing indebtedness .
The global economy could also experience the consequences , with trade flows and financial markets feeling ripple effects .
Talks stalled last week , reportedly because the Chinese side opted for regulatory rather than legislative implementation , which could be internally undone more easily .
`` Without the legal change , US officials will have more difficulty - nearly impossible - selling the deal , '' said Coflan .
Meanwhile , US delegates refuse to say what exactly tripped up the discussions with the Chinese .
The 150-page , seven-chapter draft of the trade deal addresses complex issues such as ending Beijing 's practice of forced technology transfers , implementing better protections for US intellectual property , and increasing market access for US firms .
Gary Clyde Hufbauer , a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , said it 's likely that `` China baulked at some of its earlier commitments regarding provincial subsidies and the opening of agriculture - pork and soybeans especially '' .
Regardless of why the talks appear to have faltered , many experts agree that - though the US is better prepared to weather the storm - repercussions are inevitable .
`` If Trump 's tariff threats mature into an all-out trade war , US GDP growth will be knocked down , possibly by 0.5 percent , and the stock market will take an even bigger hit , '' said Hufbauer , alluding to the market volatility that further trade uncertainty could bring .
Hufbauer added that consumers could experience significant price rises for a variety of products , while some US businesses could suffer .
`` On the US import side , a wide range of consumer goods sold in stores like Walmart and Target will become more expensive , '' he said . `` On the US export side , agricultural sales will stay depressed . Major business service firms like JPMorgan Chase will suffer , and US exports of hi-tech products like aeroplanes and turbines will fall . ''
As talks continue following the tariff increase , some analysts believe the Trump administration will step back from the brink .
`` I still think they 'll get a deal , '' Edward Alden , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , told ███ .
The US stock market just wants to see signs of nearing a deal , Alden added , emphasising that investors may not be concerned with the fine print .
Nevertheless , the draft agreement remains on the rocks , pending work by sizable teams on both sides .
`` The Chinese are hurting more [ now ] , but that does n't mean they could n't sustain a long trade war , '' Alden said .","A week ago, it looked like the world's two biggest economies were close to resolving their ongoing trade dispute.

Scott added the proportion for China is much greater.

""Twenty-five percent, however, is much more difficult to absorb, given margins in global supply chains,"" Coflan added, referring to Friday's increase. ""These costs will be passed on to consumers in a way that current tariffs have not been. This will lead to both inflation and job loss, two challenges that this administration has not had to deal with.""

But even if the US starts to feel the heat, China is likely to experience more economic pain because of higher reliance on exports and increasing indebtedness.

The global economy could also experience the consequences, with trade flows and financial markets feeling ripple effects.

'All-out trade war'

Talks stalled last week, reportedly because the Chinese side opted for regulatory rather than legislative implementation, which could be internally undone more easily.

""Without the legal change, US officials will have more difficulty - nearly impossible - selling the deal,"" said Coflan.

Meanwhile, US delegates refuse to say what exactly tripped up the discussions with the Chinese.

The 150-page, seven-chapter draft of the trade deal addresses complex issues such as ending Beijing's practice of forced technology transfers, implementing better protections for US intellectual property, and increasing market access for US firms.

Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said it's likely that ""China baulked at some of its earlier commitments regarding provincial subsidies and the opening of agriculture - pork and soybeans especially"".

Regardless of why the talks appear to have faltered, many experts agree that - though the US is better prepared to weather the storm - repercussions are inevitable.

""If Trump's tariff threats mature into an all-out trade war, US GDP growth will be knocked down, possibly by 0.5 percent, and the stock market will take an even bigger hit,"" said Hufbauer, alluding to the market volatility that further trade uncertainty could bring.

Hufbauer added that consumers could experience significant price rises for a variety of products, while some US businesses could suffer.

""On the US import side, a wide range of consumer goods sold in stores like Walmart and Target will become more expensive,"" he said. ""On the US export side, agricultural sales will stay depressed. Major business service firms like JPMorgan Chase will suffer, and US exports of hi-tech products like aeroplanes and turbines will fall.""

Face-saving deal

As talks continue following the tariff increase, some analysts believe the Trump administration will step back from the brink.

""I still think they'll get a deal,"" Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera.

The US stock market just wants to see signs of nearing a deal, Alden added, emphasising that investors may not be concerned with the fine print.

Nevertheless, the draft agreement remains on the rocks, pending work by sizable teams on both sides.

""The Chinese are hurting more [now], but that doesn't mean they couldn't sustain a long trade war,"" Alden said.",www.aljazeera.com,left,GsP1njJdkWI5NiPm

Freeman","After President Barack Obama ’ s own party slammed the brakes on the centerpiece of his trade agenda — also a top priority for the GOP — there were early signs Democrats were considering concessions to revive the fast-track bill .
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) , who rallied his caucus to reject the fast-track measure on a procedural vote , has already floated a plan to find a way out of the impasse by offering to drop anti-currency manipulation language in a customs bill from his party ’ s list of demands .
While his initial overture likely won ’ t settle the issue , and top Republicans said they were skeptical of Reid ’ s proposal , Democrats ’ willingness to return to the bargaining table suggests the trade measure may not be dead . And pro-trade Democrats huddled with the White House on Tuesday evening , as the administration looked for a way forward .
After demanding that Republicans bundle four separate trade bills — in part to accommodate Democratic demands for more worker protections — Reid is privately saying that he ’ d be willing to drop the currency manipulation provisions , according to people familiar with the situation .
Led by Reid , the liberal , anti-trade wing of the Democratic Party joined with pro-trade moderates to block fast-track legislation , 52-45 , in an effort to force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) to take up the larger trade package . Democrats had wanted the Senate to pass new worker protections , child labor restrictions and the customs bill all together , in addition to the fast-track trade bill McConnell and Obama are pushing .
McConnell , just five months into his role as majority leader , refused to bow to Democratic wishes , partially out of concern over ceding too much authority to the minority to dictate the chamber ’ s agenda . And the Republican leader suggested Democrats need to sort out their intraparty differences .
“ What we just saw here is pretty shocking , ” McConnell said immediately following the vote . “ What we just witnessed here is Democratic senators shutting down debate on the top economic priority of the Democratic president of the United States . ”
But under Democrats ’ latest strategy , the customs bill would be pulled out of the bigger package for a standalone vote , something Sens . Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) and John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) were discussing on Tuesday , after Schumer first suggested the move .
Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden , the lead Democratic negotiator on trade , had suggested a similar move last week , only to be rebuffed by Reid .
On Tuesday evening , senior Republicans said they were skeptical of Reid ’ s overture , but acknowledged talks were ongoing . And they noted there were problems with the customs bill beyond just the currency language .
Still , the currency manipulation provision is considered a poison pill by Republicans and is not supported by the administration , so removing it from the larger package could help the Senate overcome Tuesday ’ s partisan deadlock . The provision could force the White House to designate China as a currency manipulator , which the administration fears would spark a trade war with Beijing .
The Democrats ’ internal dispute puts the president in an awkward position , caught between Republicans who want to work with him on the multination Trans-Pacific Partnership pact and Senate Democratic leaders who are using their procedural leverage to get as much as they can out of McConnell .
Trade proponents in both parties vowed on Tuesday to try to put the pieces back together and the fracas doesn ’ t mean the fast-track is dead , especially if Reid is committed to finding a way out . The GOP and White House officials argue that enacting fast-track Trade Promotion Authority is critical for Obama ’ s ability to strike a landmark trade deal with Pacific Rim countries , and the roadblock in the Senate threatens progress on that pact .
After the vote , Reid , an anti-trade Democrat who devised the strategy to slow the bill on Tuesday , hinted at a way out of the Senate ’ s latest jam .
“ I suggest the way we move forward is to have a program where we have all of these bills discussed at the same time , ” Reid said . “ Everybody should just take a deep breath . I think there ’ s probably a way we can move forward with this . ”
But with little more than a week before the Memorial Day recess and several expiring laws still to be addressed , the immediate future of Obama ’ s trade agenda is uncertain .
Though Republicans believed they had a deal to move so-called Trade Promotion Authority alongside Trade Adjustment Assistance , Democrats are seeking greater assurances that the African Growth and Opportunity Act and a customs enforcement bill , which includes the currency manipulation provisions , will all be passed as part of a deal to open debate on the trade bill .
“ We hope the White House will join us in the effort to get currency stronger — and pressure McConnell to make sure these bills move concurrently , not just take two on his own whim and leave two behind , ” Schumer said .
The GOP is flabbergasted at these demands , insisting that the currency provision , in particular , is veto bait for the White House , potentially complicating the trade package ’ s future if it is approved .
Moreover , McConnell and other Republicans blasted Wyden for changing an “ understanding ” that pro-trade Democrats and Republicans had to move forward on the bill .
And as Senate Democrats prodded Obama to join their quest for procedural victory over recalcitrant Republicans , the GOP was urging the president to take a more critical tone not just with anti-trade Democrats like Elizabeth Warren , but also pro-trade Democrats who they believe are making a trade agreement increasingly difficult .
“ Really , it ’ s a question of whether the president of the United States has enough clout with members of his political party , ” said Cornyn , the majority whip . The failed vote “ is a failure of the president ’ s ability to convince members of his own party . ”
While Reid and Schumer hold considerable clout within the caucus , it is actually a group of 14 Democrats that Republicans and Obama are trying to woo . Those Democrats who are supportive of Obama ’ s trade efforts huddled on Tuesday afternoon to plot their strategy . After nearly an hour , led by Senate Finance Committee ranking member Wyden , the bloc of Democrats announced they would vote down the bill .
“ The group is concerned about the lack of commitment to trade enforcement , which is specifically the customs bill , ” Wyden told reporters after the meeting . “ Until there is a path to get all four bills passed … we will , certainly most of us , will have to vote no . ”
Asked why McConnell ’ s offer to hold amendment votes on their preferred legislation wasn ’ t enough , Sen. Bill Nelson ( D-Fla. ) replied that it “ doesn ’ t guarantee the reforms pass. ” He said he personally asked McConnell to assuage his party ’ s concerns on Monday evening , but “ he wouldn ’ t . ”
“ Most of us want trade to pass and we don ’ t want any hindrances . But we don ’ t want people to dictate to us that some of these reforms can ’ t be done , ” Nelson said .
In the weeks leading up to the high-stakes vote , Republicans have worked in conjunction with Obama to pass fast-track , which would pave the way for a landmark trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership . The White House views the trade agreement as the cornerstone of the president ’ s economic agenda , and McConnell views it as the one big deal ripe for an agreement with the Democratic president .
McConnell insisted on Tuesday that the Senate can decide whether it wants the companion bills during the amendment process . The chamber , he said , should be allowed to “ work its will . ”
“ They ’ re demanding we guarantee an outcome , ” McConnell said of Democrats . “ We don ’ t operate that way anymore here . What I ’ ve said is the bill will be open for amendment . ”
Wyden , who co-authored the trade bill with Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) said just four hours before the vote that he sees “ potential ” for an agreement with McConnell after the leader ’ s remarks , which were conciliatory , but also sent a message that McConnell won ’ t bow to Democrats ’ every demand .
Ultimately , that wasn ’ t enough . Aides said McConnell and Wyden ’ s staff had been speaking , but the two men had yet to confer privately .
Hatch , though , sounded pessimistic about another round of dealmaking with Wyden . A visibly agitated Hatch told reporters that the bill had become a “ mess , ” adding that he was “ through talking . ”
“ I ’ ll always be open , but we ’ ve just been jerked around here too much , ” Hatch said . “ I expect people to live their word just like I do . ”","After President Barack Obama’s own party slammed the brakes on the centerpiece of his trade agenda — also a top priority for the GOP — there were early signs Democrats were considering concessions to revive the fast-track bill.

After the vote, Reid, an anti-trade Democrat who devised the strategy to slow the bill on Tuesday, hinted at a way out of the Senate’s latest jam.

“I suggest the way we move forward is to have a program where we have all of these bills discussed at the same time,” Reid said. “Everybody should just take a deep breath. I think there’s probably a way we can move forward with this.”

But with little more than a week before the Memorial Day recess and several expiring laws still to be addressed, the immediate future of Obama’s trade agenda is uncertain.

Though Republicans believed they had a deal to move so-called Trade Promotion Authority alongside Trade Adjustment Assistance, Democrats are seeking greater assurances that the African Growth and Opportunity Act and a customs enforcement bill, which includes the currency manipulation provisions, will all be passed as part of a deal to open debate on the trade bill.

“We hope the White House will join us in the effort to get currency stronger — and pressure McConnell to make sure these bills move concurrently, not just take two on his own whim and leave two behind,” Schumer said.

The GOP is flabbergasted at these demands, insisting that the currency provision, in particular, is veto bait for the White House, potentially complicating the trade package’s future if it is approved.

Moreover, McConnell and other Republicans blasted Wyden for changing an “understanding” that pro-trade Democrats and Republicans had to move forward on the bill.

And as Senate Democrats prodded Obama to join their quest for procedural victory over recalcitrant Republicans, the GOP was urging the president to take a more critical tone not just with anti-trade Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, but also pro-trade Democrats who they believe are making a trade agreement increasingly difficult.

“Really, it’s a question of whether the president of the United States has enough clout with members of his political party,” said Cornyn, the majority whip. The failed vote “is a failure of the president’s ability to convince members of his own party.”

While Reid and Schumer hold considerable clout within the caucus, it is actually a group of 14 Democrats that Republicans and Obama are trying to woo. Those Democrats who are supportive of Obama’s trade efforts huddled on Tuesday afternoon to plot their strategy. After nearly an hour, led by Senate Finance Committee ranking member Wyden, the bloc of Democrats announced they would vote down the bill.

“The group is concerned about the lack of commitment to trade enforcement, which is specifically the customs bill,” Wyden told reporters after the meeting. “Until there is a path to get all four bills passed … we will, certainly most of us, will have to vote no.”

Asked why McConnell’s offer to hold amendment votes on their preferred legislation wasn’t enough, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) replied that it “doesn’t guarantee the reforms pass.” He said he personally asked McConnell to assuage his party’s concerns on Monday evening, but “he wouldn’t.”

“Most of us want trade to pass and we don’t want any hindrances. But we don’t want people to dictate to us that some of these reforms can’t be done,” Nelson said.

In the weeks leading up to the high-stakes vote, Republicans have worked in conjunction with Obama to pass fast-track, which would pave the way for a landmark trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The White House views the trade agreement as the cornerstone of the president’s economic agenda, and McConnell views it as the one big deal ripe for an agreement with the Democratic president.

McConnell insisted on Tuesday that the Senate can decide whether it wants the companion bills during the amendment process. The chamber, he said, should be allowed to “work its will.”

“They’re demanding we guarantee an outcome,” McConnell said of Democrats. “We don’t operate that way anymore here. What I’ve said is the bill will be open for amendment.”

Wyden, who co-authored the trade bill with Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said just four hours before the vote that he sees “potential” for an agreement with McConnell after the leader’s remarks, which were conciliatory, but also sent a message that McConnell won’t bow to Democrats’ every demand.

Ultimately, that wasn’t enough. Aides said McConnell and Wyden’s staff had been speaking, but the two men had yet to confer privately.

Hatch, though, sounded pessimistic about another round of dealmaking with Wyden. A visibly agitated Hatch told reporters that the bill had become a “mess,” adding that he was “through talking.”

“I’ll always be open, but we’ve just been jerked around here too much,” Hatch said. “I expect people to live their word just like I do.”

The Trump administration on Monday detailed how it will dole out $ 6.3 billion in aid to assist farmers stung by retaliatory tariffs — and it ’ s already sparking backlash from some sectors where industry leaders say growers won ’ t get their fair share .
The announcement represents the first round of payments — USDA officials said Monday they will monitor how ongoing trade disputes affect farmers and that a second installment of cash could be provided to address any further losses . USDA has budgeted up to $ 12 billion for potential distribution .
The plan unveiled by the Agriculture Department includes $ 4.7 billion in direct payments to row crop growers , including corn , wheat and cotton , as well as to pork and dairy producers . The vast majority of the direct payments — some $ 3.6 billion — will go to growers of soybeans , America ’ s top agricultural export .
Soybeans now fetch $ 2 less per bushel than they did in March , when President Donald Trump began to slap new tariffs on Chinese exports , setting off a tit-for-tat trade battle that has resulted in billions of dollars of lost value for a crop that earlier this year surpassed corn as America 's most widely grown commodity .
The overwhelming share of direct payments that are slated for soy has incensed other agricultural sectors , prompting industry groups to point out that their slice of the pie is not even close to covering losses that their growers have suffered from retaliation brought on by Trump ’ s aggressive trade tactics .
“ Unfortunately , this plan provides virtually no relief to corn farmers , ” said North Dakota farmer Kevin Skunes , president of the National Corn Growers Association . Skunes acknowledged that corn growers knew the aid package would not cover all of their losses , but added that the sector is still disappointed because the plan “ does not consider the extent of the damage done to corn farmers . ”

Wheat growers , dairy producers and some other agricultural sectors fired off statements on Monday that expressed similar frustration .
“ Farm income is down , and rural America is enduring a prolonged economic downturn , ” said wheat farmer Jimmie Musick , president of the National Association of Wheat Growers . “ This relief package shows that the administration isn ’ t grasping the tough conditions being faced by farmers . The long-term solution is to end the trade war . ”
The prominence of soybeans to American agricultural exports — the oilseed makes up about 60 percent of the $ 20 billion in American farm goods sent to China each year — has led to expectations for months that the crop would factor heavily into the aid package . But the way USDA structured the plan means that farmers in Midwestern states like Indiana and Iowa , which backed Trump in 2016 , are on track to receive huge sums of cash ahead of the midterm elections in November , while major produce and nut-growing states , like the Democratic stronghold of California , aren ’ t in line to receive big checks from the government .
“ This is strong evidence of [ Trump ’ s ] sensitivity to losing support in the Midwest , ” Scott Irwin , an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois , said last month when USDA first announced broad outlines of the aid package .
The likelihood that Western states are not expected to benefit as much from the aid package , even though they export great quantities of produce , fruits and nuts to China and also have been hammered by retaliatory tariffs , has fueled criticism that the administration is looking to take care of its heartland political base ahead of the election and blunt potential political fallout from its trade policies .
John Block , who served as Agriculture secretary during the Reagan administration and has helped rally support for Trump within the agricultural community , disagreed that politics is at the root of the plan .
“ It ’ s an effort to send a message to rural America and agriculture that we do care , ” he said . “ We know you ’ re suffering . ”
USDA spokesman Tim Murtaugh argued last week that the rollout was connected to farmers ’ harvest times and not to any political calendar . For most row crops , farmers harvest in the fall .
Controversy surrounding the aid package does not fall squarely along partisan lines . Many farmers , who tend to vote Republican , have argued that they want the Trump administration to broker new deals to expand overseas markets for agricultural goods , not pay producers for getting walloped in the ongoing trade disputes with China , Canada , Mexico and the European Union .
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue , in a statement on Monday , noted that the assistance is intended to stop the bleeding in agriculture and give Trump time to land new trade deals .
“ It ’ s important to note all of this could go away tomorrow , if China and the other nations simply correct their behavior , ” he said . “ But in the meantime , the programs we are announcing today buy time for the president to strike long-lasting trade deals to benefit our entire economy . ''
Farmers can begin to apply for trade assistance starting on Sept. 4 . Perdue went public with that detail shortly after the administration first announced , in late July , that aid would be made available to farmers , but producers now face a quick turnaround before the application window opens .
Joseph Glauber , who served as USDA 's chief economist during the Obama administration , said it seems clear that the administration is racing against the political clock with the midterms coming up . “ If you ’ re going to get money out , you want to do it as quickly as possible for political purposes , ” he said .
Perdue , who was tasked by Trump earlier this year with devising the trade aid program , spent most of the early part of the summer saying publicly that more information on the effects of retaliatory tariffs was needed before the department could determine how rates of assistance would be calculated .
Doling out billions of dollars in aid to farmers in a matter of months is a complicated task , Glauber and other economists said , particularly because it ’ s difficult to isolate price changes that are directly related to tariffs , as opposed to other factors like weather conditions and supply and demand . But because the payments are also slated to be paid out before most crops are done being harvested , questions have been raised about USDA 's method for divvying up funds between growers , given that payments are being based on actual production .
“ These things always sound easier than they turn out to be , ” Glauber added .
By and large , however , frustration among commodity groups outside of the soy universe stems from the fact that USDA 's assistance will cover only a fraction of anticipated losses .
The National Corn Growers Association , during a meeting with USDA and White House officials earlier this month , presented an economic analysis showing that prices have dropped by 44 cents a bushel , amounting to an overall hit of more than $ 6 billion . Under the plan , corn growers will receive payments at a rate of a penny per bushel , amounting to $ 96 million — the smallest amount of all planned direct payments .
The National Association of Wheat Growers and U.S . Wheat Associates also gave officials a rough estimate of losses , showing that prices could fall by 75 cents a bushel , resulting in nearly $ 2.5 billion in losses . Wheat growers will get just over $ 119 million in direct payments .
Under the plan , in addition to the direct payments , USDA outlined $ 1.2 billion in purchases of commodities like apples and almonds , to help boost prices . Goods will be redistributed to food banks and other nutrition programs . USDA will also devote $ 200 million to developing foreign markets for U.S. crops , through efforts such as advertising , participation in trade fairs and market research .
Pork is slated to be the largest beneficiary of the buy-ups , with a planned purchase of $ 558 million . Pork , which has been hit by retaliatory tariffs on multiple fronts , also will get the second-highest amount of direct payments , at $ 290 million .
Traditionally , USDA 's efforts to buy up commodities to take supply off the market have been unpopular with many growers because the purchases have less of a direct effect on their bottom lines . A long list of other commodities , including apples , dairy , oranges , pistachios and potatoes would also be purchased under the plan .
Almond growers are a prime example of a sector outside of traditional commodities like corn and wheat where growers were feeling shortchanged . USDA said it will likely buy $ 63 million worth of almonds . California almond farmers — who grow the state ’ s top agricultural export — had requested additional funding for the industry ’ s promotion activities overseas and to have the government cover 100 percent of their crop insurance premiums .
California and Washington lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had already complained about the bailout shortchanging growers in their states — almond growers included . Last month , a group of California lawmakers wrote to USDA expressing concern about “ solely relying ” on commodity purchases to help farmers who grow tree nuts , like almonds , along with citrus , leafy greens , berries , tree fruit and potatoes — a category known as specialty crops .
“ [ A ] ny program that is focused on direct payments should be constructed in a way that can also work for the growers of these types of commodities , ” they wrote .
Earlier this month , House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) held a call with the White House Office of Management and Budget , ostensibly to press for more aid for California interests . The call included fellow California GOP Reps. Jeff Denham and David Valadao , and a number of USDA officials , according to a public meeting calendar .

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump informed Democratic leaders Wednesday that he would n't work with them on shared priorities such as infrastructure and bringing down the cost of prescription drugs unless they abandoned investigations into his presidency .
In an unusual and unexpected appearance in the Rose Garden , Trump said he told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer at a White House meetingthat it would be impossible to go forward on discussions while `` phony '' congressional investigations hang over his administration .
Trump spoke specifically about infrastructure , but it was difficult to see how the White House could work with the Democratic-controlled House on other issues , including prescription drugs or a pending trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that the president wants approved .
`` You probably can ’ t go down two tracks , '' he said after wrapping up a meeting with the two Democratic leaders at the White House . `` You can go down the investigation track , or you can go down the investment track . ''
Trump said he walked into the meeting with Pelosi , Schumer and other Democrats and told them , `` I want to do infrastructure . But you know what , you can ’ t do it under these circumstances . ''
Trump spent about three minutes talking to the Democratic leaders who gathered in the Cabinet Room to discuss infrastructure , repeating many of the same points he later made in Rose Garden , according to a source familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the closed-door session . The president did not shake hands with the lawmakers or sit down , and he left before any of the Democrats spoke , the source said .
A White House spokesman did not respond to questions about that account of the meeting .
The stagecraft surrounding the president 's statement was unusual . Reporters were rushed into the Rose Garden , where a single lectern had been set up in front of the Oval Office . It was not clear how far in advance Trump planned the move , but the president said he was angry that hours earlier , Pelosi accused him of engaging in a `` cover-up . ''
Trump aides placed a sign on the lectern that included a favorite talking point : `` no collusion , '' referring to special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election . The president took two questions , then walked back into the West Wing .
Pelosi meets with Dems : Speaker tries to rein in calls for a Trump impeachment as Democrat outrage grows
Back on Capitol Hill , Pelosi said she was disappointed Trump backed out of talks .
“ For some reason , maybe it was a lack of confidence on his part , but he couldn ’ t come back for the greatness of the challenge we have , ” Pelosi said . “ I pray for the president of the United States , and I pray for the United States of America . ”
Trump 's meeting with the Democrats came three weeks after an unusual moment of bipartisanship , when they agreed to spend $ 2 trillion on the nation ’ s crumbling highways , bridges and airports . Still missing was a plan to pay for that investment .
Hours before Pelosi and Schumer were expected at the White House , Trump took to Twitter and accused congressional Democrats of being so focused on investigating him they were n't getting other things done .

In an unusual and unexpected appearance in the Rose Garden, Trump said he told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer at a White House meetingthat it would be impossible to go forward on discussions while ""phony"" congressional investigations hang over his administration.

Trump spoke specifically about infrastructure, but it was difficult to see how the White House could work with the Democratic-controlled House on other issues, including prescription drugs or a pending trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that the president wants approved.

""You probably can’t go down two tracks,"" he said after wrapping up a meeting with the two Democratic leaders at the White House. ""You can go down the investigation track, or you can go down the investment track.""

Trump said he walked into the meeting with Pelosi, Schumer and other Democrats and told them, ""I want to do infrastructure. But you know what, you can’t do it under these circumstances.""

Trump spent about three minutes talking to the Democratic leaders who gathered in the Cabinet Room to discuss infrastructure, repeating many of the same points he later made in Rose Garden, according to a source familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the closed-door session. The president did not shake hands with the lawmakers or sit down, and he left before any of the Democrats spoke, the source said.

A White House spokesman did not respond to questions about that account of the meeting.

The stagecraft surrounding the president's statement was unusual. Reporters were rushed into the Rose Garden, where a single lectern had been set up in front of the Oval Office. It was not clear how far in advance Trump planned the move, but the president said he was angry that hours earlier, Pelosi accused him of engaging in a ""cover-up.""

Trump aides placed a sign on the lectern that included a favorite talking point: ""no collusion,"" referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election. The president took two questions, then walked back into the West Wing.

Back on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said she was disappointed Trump backed out of talks.

“For some reason, maybe it was a lack of confidence on his part, but he couldn’t come back for the greatness of the challenge we have,” Pelosi said. “I pray for the president of the United States, and I pray for the United States of America.”

Trump's meeting with the Democrats came three weeks after an unusual moment of bipartisanship, when they agreed to spend $2 trillion on the nation’s crumbling highways, bridges and airports. Still missing was a plan to pay for that investment.

Hours before Pelosi and Schumer were expected at the White House, Trump took to Twitter and accused congressional Democrats of being so focused on investigating him they weren't getting other things done.

A president who talks and acts tough on trade has been a long time coming. Donald Trump made getting fair dealing on trade a major plank in his campaign platform and has followed through. China can’t say it wasn’t warned about the imposition this week of additional tariffs on selected goods coming into the United States.

Bad trade deals have cost the United States billions of dollars and cost millions of American workers their jobs over the last several decades. Supporters of free trade find tariffs against China, Europe, Mexico and Canada hard to take. Tariffs are taxes hiding under another name and lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. The stock market dropped 500 points after the new China tariffs were announced. Tariffs provide a safe harbor for inefficiencies, and protect markets and manufacturers from the need to innovate and increase productivity. But as a short-term strategy to get the Chinese to the table to make agreements to protect American intellectual property, for example, it might be that rare occasion on which to do something bad so that good may come. A tariff strategy worked with the Europeans, and for Japan, Mexico and Canada, and now they’re talking about new trade deals that critics of the president said would never happen.

Mr. Trump must remember that a deal on paper and signed is only the beginning. Other signatories to a deal will be tempted to cheat if they think they can get away with it. This is what’s happening now with Qatar, which by being too clever by half found a workaround to an agreement it concluded with the United States regarding the operation of the heavily subsidized Qatar Airways.

Under a deal cut a year-and-a-half ago under Open Skies, an international regulatory regime meant to enable open entry into a nation’s airspace, an airline must not use government subsidies to establish lower fares in competition with U.S. carriers.

Qatar, a nominal U.S. ally and host to the largest American military base in the Gulf, agreed to terms in January 2018 it is now subverting through its purchase of a 49 % share in an Italian carrier it renamed Air Italy. Soon afterward, Air Italy said it would offer bargain-rate flights from Milan to New York, Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Qatar is using Air Italy to get access to gates at U.S. airports it said it would not pursue under its own name. The word for that is cheating. Qatar Airways is not being shy about it. Air Italy is operating flights with Qatar Airways aircraft, with financing provided by the Qatar government. Its financial statements show Qatar Airways covers Air Italy’s operating losses. Air Italy’s chief operating officer and ranking executives are former Qatar Airways senior executives. Air Italy crew uniforms that are just like those worn by Qatar Airways crews.

This hasn’t escaped the notice of U.S. carriers, which are rightly angry about it. American advocates on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a conservative Republican, and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, a liberal Democrat, are trying to do something about it. They’re asking the Trump administration what it intends to do. Unless pushed, probably nothing.

Qatar must be called to account, and not just for its own mischief but for the message that would send to the Chinese and other major U.S. trading partners. If Qatar Airways continues to use Air Italy as its proxy, and gets by with it, that would tell China, Japan, Mexico, Canada and Europe they can agree to trade deals and if they’re caught cheating the United States will look the other way. Someone could write a book, and call it “The Art of the Steal.”

Associated Press

TORONTO – Canadian authorities said Wednesday that they have arrested the chief financial officer of China’s Huawei Technologies for possible extradition to the United States.

China demanded her immediate release, and a former Canadian envoy to China warned the case might lead to retaliation by the Chinese against American and Canadian executives.

Justice Department spokesman Ian McLeod said Meng Wanzhou was detained in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Saturday. Meng is a prominent member of Chinese society as deputy chairman of the board and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei.

McLeod said a publication ban had been imposed in the case and he could not provide further details. The ban was sought by Meng, who has a bail hearing Friday, he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that U.S. authorities are investigating whether Chinese tech giant Huawei violated sanctions on Iran.

Huawei issued a statement saying Meng was changing flights in Canada when she was detained “on behalf of the United States of America” to face “unspecified charges” in New York.

“The company has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng,” the statement said.

Huawei said it complies with all laws and rules where it operates, including export controls and sanctions of the United Nations, the U.S. and European Union.

The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa said her human rights were violated and demanded she be freed.

“The Chinese side firmly opposes and strongly protests over such kind of actions which seriously harmed the human rights of the victim,” the statement said.

A U.S. Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.

In April, China appealed to Washington to avoid damaging business confidence following the Wall Street Journal report that U.S. authorities were investigating whether Huawei violated sanctions on Iran amid spiraling technology tensions.

A foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said then that China hoped the U.S. would refrain from taking actions that could further undermine investor confidence in the U.S. business environment and harm its domestic economy.

Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods in response to complaints that Beijing improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. That is widely seen as part of a broader effort by Washington to respond to intensifying competition with Chinese technology industries that Trump says benefit from improper subsidies and market barriers.

David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said U.S. and Canadian business executives could face reprisals in China.

“That’s something we should be watching out for. It’s a possibility. China’s plays rough,” Mulroney said. “It’s a prominent member of their society and it’s a company that really embodies China’s quest for global recognition as a technology power.”

Mulroney said Canada should be prepared for “sustained fury” from the Chinese and said it will be portrayed in China as Canada kowtowing to Trump. He also said the Iran allegations are very damaging to Huawei and said China will push back hard.

U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Armed Services and Banking committees, said Huawei is an agent of China’s communist party and applauded Canada for the arrest.

Saunders, Geoff Shepard, Stuart Schwartz, Dov Fischer","As the director of several movies about American history , including Gettysburg , it has been a privilege to bring these stories — full of bravery , resilience , ingenuity , conflict and sacrifice — to the big screen for audiences around the world . The stories that creatives tell — some true , some pure imagination — are among the greatest of American exports . Not only do they inspire audiences in this country , they also tell America ’ s story to the rest of the world . To my knowledge , there is no more powerful American export .
Right now , the U.S. is engaged in a trade negotiation with Canada and Mexico that will define the protections for creative people for decades to come . The North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , originally signed in 1994 , is up for renegotiation and President Trump has made no secret of his dislike for it . He rightfully criticized previous administrations ’ trade agreements , most recently the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) . Thankfully , that agreement was never ratified , and will hopefully end up in the dustbin of history . Even Trump ’ s detractors admit he has an unerring instinct for what harms the American worker and what helps .
One of the reasons TPP was such a bad deal for America was its watered-down intellectual property and copyright protections . It was an agreement with 12 countries that was negotiated over seven years , and many of those countries had little to no existing copyright framework to begin with . But TPP wasn ’ t a bad deal by accident . Silicon Valley ’ s most powerful and unregulated companies did all they could to weaken protections for the people in my industry , which as we all know , is also a form of art . Some very bad art . Some very good art . But art nonetheless — which is central to any people ’ s culture .
Before we go further , let ’ s pause to talk about the people who create this art form — the men and women who are the life-blood of the Entertainment Industry . I ’ ve spent decades on the sets of various films , and have seen firsthand the amazing work done by those behind the camera in the film and television industry . These hardworking individuals live all over this country . I ’ ve shot films in California , Florida , Georgia , Maryland , Pennsylvania , Arizona , Alaska , Tennessee , Virginia , New York , New Jersey , Illinois , Rhode Island and West Virginia . Audiences see only the movie stars . What is unseen are just the sort of Americans Donald Trump championed during the election . They are the reason I ’ m able to get up and go to work every morning ; their decency , grit , knowhow and work ethic are second to none .
Filmmaking is a team effort , a truly collaborative endeavor , requiring a synthesis of highly skilled crafts . Even though we take advantage of cutting-edge technologies , the process itself isn ’ t far removed from how movies were made at the dawn of cinema , more than a century ago . It ’ s hands on . It ’ s precision piece-work . We actually make things . We create property as surely as someone else makes a car or builds a house . We don ’ t allow other people to steal cars or move into houses without buying them or paying rent .
So not to put too fine a point on it : the more our industry grows , the more high-quality , middle-class jobs will be created around the country . We ’ ve spent a good deal of time talking about the loss of jobs in manufacturing , coal , and retail in America . Many of those jobs are never coming back . But the American film and television industry is thriving , and the better we protect this industry , the more jobs it will create . These jobs are well-paying — and include health benefits and reasonable protections given the manual labor they require .
NAFTA must protect the rights of these hard-working Americans — and copyright laws support millions of them . Eighty-four percent of entertainment businesses are small companies with fewer than 10 employees . These family-owned businesses employ truck drivers , editors , production assistants , writers , caterers , make-up artists — all relying on copyright to keep their doors open .
So why , you might be asking , are we not protecting these workers ? And why would Silicon Valley be fighting to weaken protections here and abroad ?
Until President Trump was elected , we had an administration that was truly intoxicated by the allure and excitement of Silicon Valley — which , on its face , was understandable , given that it ’ s another American industry that has truly transformed the world . But there are several ways in which they have changed our lives that have not been ideal , and our previous President seemed unaware or unconcerned with those problems .
Almost since the dawn of the internet , and certainly with the adoption of widespread residential broadband internet , anything that creative people make could be digitized and monetized on the internet . Everything from journalism , to photography , to music , to film and television , to gaming , and beyond . But what made this change so dramatic was that suddenly the internet platforms were making money off this content rather than the people who created it .
YouTube is now the largest music and video streaming site in the world , but most of the content on which its size , strength , and market capitalization was built was created by someone else . Facebook has become the primary way through which people get their news , but the billions in advertising that it makes from those news posts will never be returned to the journalists and publishers who invested the time and money into that reporting .
These platforms are fighting to preserve this status quo , which has allowed them to become the largest monopolies in the world , in their wake leaving creative people struggling more and more to survive . This is why their armies of lobbyists are descending on Mexico for the next round of NAFTA talks this week .
Silicon Valley is laser-focused on diluting the copyright language in the treaty and is arguing for broad and unchecked “ safe harbors ” — from copyright infringement as well as all other illegal activity perpetrated on their platforms . Why in the world do they deserve immunity from the same responsibilities everyone else must shoulder ? If someone gets hurt on one of my movie sets , the producers are legally responsible . We are liable . What makes these platforms so different ?
They have argued for their own brand of exceptionalism for the past 20 years . The argument is that they are still a nascent industry that mustn ’ t be burdened with the same rules that govern civil society in the U.S . They further argue that they are a force for good in the world , and that technology and innovation are somehow inherently good .
In the late nineties , there were two pieces of legislation that passed Congress — essentially giving Silicon Valley exactly what they wanted . Those Bills , the Communications Decency Act ( CDA ) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , passed in 1996 and 1998 respectively , before much of the commercial internet existed .
The two laws collectively provided these young companies “ safe harbor ” — provisions that indemnified them from their users ’ actions . The DMCA specifically indemnified internet companies when their platforms host copyright infringing material , creating what is known as the notice and takedown system . This puts the onus on the copyright holder to notify the platforms for every instance of copyright infringement . Without it , the platforms would have faced countless lawsuits given their central role in facilitating the infringement .
What started out as a helping hand to a new industry turned into one the largest transfers of corporate wealth in U.S. history — from content creators to platform owners . It was like a slow-moving bank heist , and it was enormously successful . Under this policy structure , piracy has skyrocketed and everyone from individual filmmakers and songwriters to large corporations have no way to keep up with it . Google alone receives 900,000,000 takedown notices every year from our industry .
Now , Google and its allies are demanding that a watered-down version of the DMCA , a system that barely works in our country , make its way into NAFTA . Further , they are seeking to broaden their safe harbor on copyright into every other sector of illegal activity — language that would mirror that from the 1996 CDA .
At the same time , Google and its lobbyists are opposing efforts to ensure NAFTA provides for “ secondary liability ” for platforms that enable piracy . This is a settled part of U.S. law — and is the reason that websites like Napster and Grokster no longer exist . Without this being included in the treaty , there is no check on the enormous safe harbor provisions that they ’ re fighting to include . It would mean that creatives have no legal way to stop a site like Napster from springing up in Mexico and delivering pirate videos to the entire world . It would further mean that we ’ re a signatory to a treaty that would actually erode U.S. copyright protections further . Why would we do that ?
As a director , I know how many people work on just one movie . How they are up early every morning , returning home late every night . They do the job because they love it , because it ’ s inspiring , and because they can be fairly compensated . As soon as a movie is illegally sold or placed online to attract eyeballs for something else , every dollar lost to piracy is a dollar that does not go back to the people who worked on it or to the entrepreneurs who risked their capital to finance it . It ’ s a moral outrage — and I don ’ t believe we should sit by and stand for it any longer . The platforms that are stealing the proceeds from our creative work are not exceptional because they ’ re new and innovative . Sadly , they ’ re exceptional because they enjoy blanket protections that allow them to steal with impunity from our fellow citizens who rely for their livelihoods on the Entertainment Industry .
No industry should be above the law , especially when the industry is comprised of the largest monopolies in the world . They rose to their stature and size largely off the backs of content they neither created nor paid for . It ’ s time for that to change , and a good start would be with NAFTA .
I humbly urge our representatives currently negotiating NAFTA to defend strong copyright protections and include secondary liability for these platforms . Do it for the millions of middle-class Americans whose livelihoods depend upon it . Do it so that American filmmakers can continue the long , great tradition of telling the stories of our people , our history , our country .","As the director of several movies about American history, including Gettysburg, it has been a privilege to bring these stories — full of bravery, resilience, ingenuity, conflict and sacrifice — to the big screen for audiences around the world.

At the same time, Google and its lobbyists are opposing efforts to ensure NAFTA provides for “secondary liability” for platforms that enable piracy. This is a settled part of U.S. law — and is the reason that websites like Napster and Grokster no longer exist. Without this being included in the treaty, there is no check on the enormous safe harbor provisions that they’re fighting to include. It would mean that creatives have no legal way to stop a site like Napster from springing up in Mexico and delivering pirate videos to the entire world. It would further mean that we’re a signatory to a treaty that would actually erode U.S. copyright protections further. Why would we do that?

As a director, I know how many people work on just one movie. How they are up early every morning, returning home late every night. They do the job because they love it, because it’s inspiring, and because they can be fairly compensated. As soon as a movie is illegally sold or placed online to attract eyeballs for something else, every dollar lost to piracy is a dollar that does not go back to the people who worked on it or to the entrepreneurs who risked their capital to finance it. It’s a moral outrage — and I don’t believe we should sit by and stand for it any longer. The platforms that are stealing the proceeds from our creative work are not exceptional because they’re new and innovative. Sadly, they’re exceptional because they enjoy blanket protections that allow them to steal with impunity from our fellow citizens who rely for their livelihoods on the Entertainment Industry.

No industry should be above the law, especially when the industry is comprised of the largest monopolies in the world. They rose to their stature and size largely off the backs of content they neither created nor paid for. It’s time for that to change, and a good start would be with NAFTA.

I humbly urge our representatives currently negotiating NAFTA to defend strong copyright protections and include secondary liability for these platforms. Do it for the millions of middle-class Americans whose livelihoods depend upon it. Do it so that American filmmakers can continue the long, great tradition of telling the stories of our people, our history, our country.",www.spectator.org,right,sFZdJHbYsjWURHwi

“ The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America , ” he said . `` There has never been a better time to hire , to build , to invest and to grow in the United States . America is open for business and we are competitive once again . ''
Trump said the United States ’ growth will impact the world .
`` American prosperity has created countless jobs around the globe and the drive for excellence , creativity and innovation in the United States has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and healthier lives , ” he continued . `` America is roaring back and now is the time to invest in America . ”
He highlighted the U.S. ’ s desire for free and open trade but stressed that those policies must be fair and reciprocal .
`` We support free trade , but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal ... in the end , unfair trade undermines us all , '' the president said .
Speaking of his America First approach to foreign policy , Trump said it does not mean “ America alone . ”
`` Like all nations represented at this forum , America hopes for a future in which everyone can prosper , and every child can grow up free form violence , poverty and fear , '' he told the audience .
It ’ s a privilege to be here at this forum an business and science diplomacy and people from world affairs gathered for many , many years to discuss how we can to advance prosperity and peace . I 'm here to represent the interests of the America people and affirm America 's friendship and partnership in building a better world .
Like all nations represented at this great forum , America hopes for a future which everyone can prosper and every child can grow up free from violence , poverty , and fear . Over the past year , we have made extraordinary strides in the U.S. We 're lifting up forgotten communities , creating exciting new opportunities , and helping every American find their path to the American dream . The dream of a great job , a safe home and a better life for their children .
After years stagnation the nights is once again experiencing strong economic growth . The stock market is smashing one record after another , and has added more than $ 7 trillion in new wealth since my election . Consumer confidence , business confidence , and manufacturing confidence are the highest that they have been in many decades .
Since my election we 've created 2.4 million jobs and that number is going up very , very substantially . Small business optimism is at an all-time high . New unemployment claims are near the lowest we 've seen in almost half a century . African-American unemployment reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States and so has unemployment among Hispanic-Americans .
The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America . I 'm here to deliver a simple message . There has never been a better time to hire , to build , to invest and to grow in the united States . America is open for business and we are competitive once again . The American economy is by far the largest in the world and we 've just enacted the most significant tax cuts and reform in American history . We 've massively cut taxes for the middle class , and small businesses to let working families keep more of their hard earned money .
We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent . As a result , millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $ 3,000 . The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average American 's household income by more than $ 4,000 . The world 's largest company , apple , announced it plans to bring $ 245 billion in overseas profits home to America . Their total investment into the United States economy will be more than $ 350 billion over the next five years . Now is the perfect time to bring your business , your jobs , and your investments to the United States .
This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensively regulatory reduction ever conceived . Regulation is stealth taxation . The U.S. Like many other countries unelected bureaucrats , we have , believe me , we have them all over the place , and they have imposed crushing and anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote , no legislative debate , and no real accountability . In America those days are over . I pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for everyone new regulation . We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations . Instead of two for one , we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for everyone new rule . We are freeing our businesses and workers so they can thrive and flourish as never before . We are creating an environment that attracts capital , invites investment , and rewards production . America is the place to do business , so come to America where you can innovate , create and build .
I believe in America . As president of the United States I will always put America first just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also . But America first does not mean America alone . When the United States grows , so does the world . American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe and the drive for excellence , creativity , and innovation in the U.S. Has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives .
As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth , we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly-shared prosperity and rewards to those who pray -- play by the rules . We can not have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others . We support free trade but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal because in the end unfair trade undermines us all . The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual property theft , industrial subsidies , and pervasive state-led economic planning .
These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers not just in the U.S . But around the globe . Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests , as president of the United States , I will always protect the interests of our country , our companies , and our workers . We will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to our trading system . Only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the U.S. , but for all nations .
As I have said , the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial , bilateral trade agreements with all countries . This will include the countries within TPP , which are very important . We have agreements with several of them already . We would consider negotiating with the rest either individually or perhaps as a group if it is in the interests of all . My administration is also taking swift action in other ways to restore American confidence and independent . We are lifting self-imposed restrictions on energy production to provide affordable power to our citizens and businesses and to promote energy security for our friend all around the world . No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy . America is roaring back and now is the time to invest in the future of America .
We have dramatically cut taxes it make America competitive . We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace . We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean , responsive and accountable and we are insuring our laws are enforced fairly . We have the best colleges and universities in the world and we have the best workers in the world . Energy is an abundant and affordable . There is never been a better time to do business in America . We are also making historic investments in the American military because we can not have prosperity without security . To make the world safer from rogue regimes , terrorism and revisionist powers , we 're asking our friend and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations . Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share .
My administration is proud to have led historic efforts at the united nations security council and all around the world to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean peninsula . We continue to call on partners to confront Iran 's support for terrorists and block Iran 's path to a nuclear weapon . We 're also working with allies and partners to destroy jihad it terrorist organizations such as ISIS and very successfully so . The nights is leading a very , very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations , to cut off their funding and to discredit their wicked ideology . I am pleased to the support that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100 % of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria . There is still more fighting and worked to be done . And to consolidate our gains . We are committed to insuring that Afghanistan never again become as safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations .
I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts . You are not just securing your own citizens but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people . When it comes to terrorism we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation . We will defend our citizens and our borders . We are also securing our immigration system as a matter of both national and economic security . America is a cutting-edge economy but our immigration system is stuck in the past .
We must replace our current system of extended family chain migration with a merit-based system of admissions that selects new arrivals based on their ability to contribute to our economy , to support themselves financially , and to strengthen our country .
In rebuilding America we are also fully committed to developing our workforce . We are lifting people from dependence to Independence because we know the single-best anti-poverty program is a very simple and very beautiful paycheck . To be successful it is not enough to invest in our economy .
We must invest in our people . When people are forgotten the world becomes fractured . Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all . The nation 's greatness is more than the sum of its production and a nation 's greatness is the sum of its citizens , the values , pride , love , devotion and character of the people who call that nation home .
From my first international G-7 summit to the g20 , to the U.N. General assembly , to APEC , to the world trade organization and today at the world economic forum my administration has not only been present but has driven our message that we are all stronger when free , sovereign nations cooperate towards shared goals and they cooperate toward shared dreams .

If you ’ re a member who wants to read the text , you ’ ve got to go to a room in the basement of the Capitol Visitor Center and be handed it one section at a time , watched over as you read , and forced to hand over any notes you make before leaving .
And no matter what , you can ’ t discuss the details of what you ’ ve read .
“ It ’ s like being in kindergarten , ” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D-Conn. ) , who ’ s become the leader of the opposition to President Barack Obama ’ s trade agenda . “ You give back the toys at the end . ”
For those out to sink Obama ’ s free trade push , highlighting the lack of public information is becoming central to their opposition strategy : The White House isn ’ t even telling Congress what it ’ s asking for , they say , or what it ’ s already promised foreign governments .
The White House has been coordinating an administration-wide lobbying effort that ’ s included phone calls and briefings from Secretary of State John Kerry , Labor Secretary Tom Perez , Treasury Secretary Jack Lew , Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and others . Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz has been working members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro has been talking to members of his home state Texas delegation .
Officials from the White House and the United States trade representative ’ s office say they ’ ve gone farther than ever before to provide Congress the information it needs and that the transparency complaints are just the latest excuse for people who were never going to vote for a new trade deal anyway .
“ We ’ ve worked closely with congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to balance unprecedented access to classified documents with the appropriate level of discretion that ’ s needed to ensure Americans get the best deal possible in an ongoing , high-stakes international negotiation , ” said USTR spokesman Matt McAlvanah .
Obama ’ s seeking a renewal of fast-track authority , which would empower him to negotiate trade deals that then go to Congress for up-or-down votes but not amendments . He says he needs that authority to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a 12-country free trade agreement that he calls essential to stopping China from setting trade , labor and environmental standards in the Asia-Pacific region .
Administration aides say they can ’ t make the details public because the negotiations are still going on with multiple countries at once ; if for example , Vietnam knew what the American bottom line was with Japan , that might drive them to change their own terms . Trade might not seem like a national security issue , they say , but it is ( and foreign governments regularly try to hack their way in to American trade deliberations ) .
Moreover , many of the leaders of the opposition , administration aides argue , are people who aren ’ t used to dealing with classified information and don ’ t realize how standard this secrecy is . And by the way , they note , neither congressional conference committees nor labor contract talks allow even this level of access to negotiations while in process .
But those arguments aren ’ t making much headway among trade skeptics , who feel they are being treated with disrespect and condescension . And they increasingly are pinning the blame directly on United States Trade Representative Mike Froman , who ’ s been headlining the classified briefings , in addition to smaller meetings with members .
“ The access to information is totally at the whim of Ambassador Froman , ” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D-Texas ) , who ’ s a hard no on fast track but says he ’ d like to see other ways of promoting international trade . “ He likes to make available information that he thinks helps his case , and if it conflicts , then he doesn ’ t make the information available , ” Doggett said .
Doggett , like other critics , pointed out that the cover sheets of the trade documents in that basement room are marked only “ confidential document ” and note they ’ re able to be transmitted over unsecured email and fax — but for some reason are still restricted to members of Congress .
“ My chief of staff who has a top secret security clearance can learn more about ISIS or Yemen than about this trade agreement , ” Doggett said .
“ He ’ s incredibly condescending . It ’ s like , ‘ You ’ d be all for this if only you hadn ’ t gotten an F in economics , ’ ” said Rep. Brad Sherman ( D-Calif. ) , who said he ’ s opposed to what he ’ s seen because it lacks labor standards and measures to address currency manipulation .
“ We know when we ’ re being suckered , ” said Rep. Alan Grayson ( D-Fla. ) , who said he believes that the USTR quotes percentages instead of absolute values on trade statistics that give an overly positive impression . “ It ’ s not only condescending , it ’ s misleading . ”
Asked about those criticisms , Froman responded by praising his adversaries .
“ I have great respect for the critics , many of whom have shown great leadership on progressive causes , and I look forward to a continued dialogue with members of Congress based on facts and substance , ” Froman told ███ .
Rep. Ron Kind ( D-Wis. ) , who supports giving Obama fast-track authority , says the division among Democrats is between members who are looking for a reason to say no and those that are actually trying to work on the deal .
“ They ’ ve been very engaging with Congress and to members who want to be in the room and engaging them on the text … so we can ask questions but , more importantly , so we can provide input , ” Kind said .
As for Froman , Kind said , “ he ’ s very cordial , he ’ s very respectful and listening to other people ’ s opinion . … I don ’ t get a sense of condescension and arrogance . ”
Kind says he expects several more Democrats to announce their support for the president ’ s efforts in the coming days , some of them because of what they ’ ve heard from Froman .
Doggett insisted that the outreach is costing the White House support .
“ The more people hear Ambassador Froman but feel they get less than candid and accurate answers , I think it loses votes for them , ” Doggett said .
Administration officials point to other members who ’ ve publicly praised Froman for his responsiveness and his accessibility . Those include House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) , who at a late April news conference called Froman a “ remarkable , remarkable trade rep ” who ’ s “ just fabulous , and he ’ s been just boundless in his willingness to spend time with members to go through this . ”
Pelosi herself remains undecided on the trade pact , though she says she ’ s trying to find a path to yes . She ’ s telling members what she ’ s told them from the start : They ’ re going to be able to influence the deal only if they actually engage with Froman and the White House .
In February , it was Pelosi who urged the administration to begin the briefings , warning that Democratic support was nowhere near what the White House would need for fast-track to pass the House .
Obama has started to get more personally engaged trying to shore up support for the deal . The president hosted a White House meeting Thursday with members of the New Democrat Coalition , who are generally inclined to support him on trade but still pressed him to make more information available .
“ He emphasized that under the trade promotion bills , this is going to be the most transparent bill ever , ” said Kind , who attended .
Two days earlier , speaking at the news conference he held in the Rose Garden with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , Obama dismissed “ this whole notion that it ’ s all secret . ”
“ They ’ re going to have 60 days before I even sign it to look at the text , and then a number of months after that before they have to take a final vote , ” Obama said forcefully .
“ He ’ s indignant when we say it ’ s secret , ” said Rep. Keith Ellison ( D-Minn. ) . “ Maybe there ’ s some definition of secrecy he knows that I don ’ t know . ”","If you want to hear the details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the Obama administration is hoping to pass, you’ve got to be a member of Congress, and you’ve got to go to classified briefings and leave your staff and cellphone at the door.

The White House has been coordinating an administration-wide lobbying effort that’s included phone calls and briefings from Secretary of State John Kerry, Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and others. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz has been working members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro has been talking to members of his home state Texas delegation.

Officials from the White House and the United States trade representative’s office say they’ve gone farther than ever before to provide Congress the information it needs and that the transparency complaints are just the latest excuse for people who were never going to vote for a new trade deal anyway.

“We’ve worked closely with congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to balance unprecedented access to classified documents with the appropriate level of discretion that’s needed to ensure Americans get the best deal possible in an ongoing, high-stakes international negotiation,” said USTR spokesman Matt McAlvanah.

Obama’s seeking a renewal of fast-track authority, which would empower him to negotiate trade deals that then go to Congress for up-or-down votes but not amendments. He says he needs that authority to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country free trade agreement that he calls essential to stopping China from setting trade, labor and environmental standards in the Asia-Pacific region.

Administration aides say they can’t make the details public because the negotiations are still going on with multiple countries at once; if for example, Vietnam knew what the American bottom line was with Japan, that might drive them to change their own terms. Trade might not seem like a national security issue, they say, but it is (and foreign governments regularly try to hack their way in to American trade deliberations).

Moreover, many of the leaders of the opposition, administration aides argue, are people who aren’t used to dealing with classified information and don’t realize how standard this secrecy is. And by the way, they note, neither congressional conference committees nor labor contract talks allow even this level of access to negotiations while in process.

But those arguments aren’t making much headway among trade skeptics, who feel they are being treated with disrespect and condescension. And they increasingly are pinning the blame directly on United States Trade Representative Mike Froman, who’s been headlining the classified briefings, in addition to smaller meetings with members.

“The access to information is totally at the whim of Ambassador Froman,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who’s a hard no on fast track but says he’d like to see other ways of promoting international trade. “He likes to make available information that he thinks helps his case, and if it conflicts, then he doesn’t make the information available,” Doggett said.

Doggett, like other critics, pointed out that the cover sheets of the trade documents in that basement room are marked only “confidential document” and note they’re able to be transmitted over unsecured email and fax — but for some reason are still restricted to members of Congress.

“My chief of staff who has a top secret security clearance can learn more about ISIS or Yemen than about this trade agreement,” Doggett said.

“He’s incredibly condescending. It’s like, ‘You’d be all for this if only you hadn’t gotten an F in economics,’” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who said he’s opposed to what he’s seen because it lacks labor standards and measures to address currency manipulation.

“We know when we’re being suckered,” said Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), who said he believes that the USTR quotes percentages instead of absolute values on trade statistics that give an overly positive impression. “It’s not only condescending, it’s misleading.”

Asked about those criticisms, Froman responded by praising his adversaries.

“I have great respect for the critics, many of whom have shown great leadership on progressive causes, and I look forward to a continued dialogue with members of Congress based on facts and substance,” Froman told POLITICO.

Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), who supports giving Obama fast-track authority, says the division among Democrats is between members who are looking for a reason to say no and those that are actually trying to work on the deal.

“They’ve been very engaging with Congress and to members who want to be in the room and engaging them on the text … so we can ask questions but, more importantly, so we can provide input,” Kind said.

As for Froman, Kind said, “he’s very cordial, he’s very respectful and listening to other people’s opinion. … I don’t get a sense of condescension and arrogance.”

Kind says he expects several more Democrats to announce their support for the president’s efforts in the coming days, some of them because of what they’ve heard from Froman.

Doggett insisted that the outreach is costing the White House support.

“The more people hear Ambassador Froman but feel they get less than candid and accurate answers, I think it loses votes for them,” Doggett said.

Administration officials point to other members who’ve publicly praised Froman for his responsiveness and his accessibility. Those include House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who at a late April news conference called Froman a “remarkable, remarkable trade rep” who’s “just fabulous, and he’s been just boundless in his willingness to spend time with members to go through this.”

Pelosi herself remains undecided on the trade pact, though she says she’s trying to find a path to yes. She’s telling members what she’s told them from the start: They’re going to be able to influence the deal only if they actually engage with Froman and the White House.

In February, it was Pelosi who urged the administration to begin the briefings, warning that Democratic support was nowhere near what the White House would need for fast-track to pass the House.

Obama has started to get more personally engaged trying to shore up support for the deal. The president hosted a White House meeting Thursday with members of the New Democrat Coalition, who are generally inclined to support him on trade but still pressed him to make more information available.

“He emphasized that under the trade promotion bills, this is going to be the most transparent bill ever,” said Kind, who attended.

Two days earlier, speaking at the news conference he held in the Rose Garden with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama dismissed “this whole notion that it’s all secret.”

“They’re going to have 60 days before I even sign it to look at the text, and then a number of months after that before they have to take a final vote,” Obama said forcefully.

“He’s indignant when we say it’s secret,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). “Maybe there’s some definition of secrecy he knows that I don’t know.”

“You’ve got the energy of the Elizabeth Warren faction kind of driving the agenda,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in an interview this week. He added, “She’s a very effective spokesman for a very far-left position.”

Ms. Warren was wooed to run for the Massachusetts Senate seat against the Republican incumbent, Scott Brown, after Mr. Obama determined that she faced too much Republican opposition for confirmation as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Board that she had helped establish. She cruised to victory in 2012 on a campaign of middle-class advocacy and fiery criticism of banks and corporations.

Now, she can often be seen racing through the halls of the Senate, waving off reporters and talking nonstop as she jogs alongside a frantic-looking aide.",www.nytimes.com,left,lnuiBuHEZt9O10oa

White House officials opposed to the auto tariffs have high hopes that Juncker ’ s visit could head off a bruising automotive trade war , which even some of Trump ’ s top advisers think could be potentially disastrous , raising car prices and destabilizing a thriving industry on the eve of the midterm elections .
“ There is not a lot of support for the auto tariffs internally , ” one senior administration official said . “ There are many people who don ’ t want to see it go through. ” This person said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , who generally supports the president ’ s aggressive trade policy , is among those skeptical of the auto tariffs . The official , who was n't authorized to speak publicly on the issue , declined to be identified by name .
The White House did not respond to a request for comment .
Two other senior administration officials , who also declined to be identified by name , described a similar dynamic on the auto tariff probe being conducted by the Commerce Department , with only Trump and hawkish senior trade adviser Peter Navarro supporting the idea of actually going through with the penalties .
Lighthizer , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow all generally oppose the auto tariff idea while holding out hope that Trump ’ s position is just a negotiating tactic that will eventually pay off , these people said .
“ On the auto issue , it ’ s pretty lopsided inside the administration against doing this , ” one of the two other senior administration officials close to the process said . “ It ’ s pretty much just the president and Navarro who are in favor . ”
Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap tariffs as high as 25 percent on all imported cars and auto parts in the next few months . The Commerce investigation could conclude within weeks with recommendations going to the president shortly after .
The auto industry , Republicans in Congress , U.S. trading partners and even some of Trump ’ s top advisers argue that the tariffs could be major political and economic negatives . Trump takes the opposite view , arguing that auto tariffs would be a political winner in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan in the midterms .
Juncker visits the White House on Wednesday , and administration officials and European diplomats all have different ideas on what he might offer . Some inside the White House are hopeful that Juncker will agree to lift E.U . tariffs on American automobiles for two or three years in return for Trump dropping the investigation into whether auto imports into the U.S. present a national security threat .
Juncker may have other demands of his own , including a reduction in U.S. tariffs on European automobiles , especially a 25 percent levy on trucks .
For the moment , it remains unclear how much time Juncker — who is not technically a head of state — will get with the president . Some White House officials say the face time could be severely limited , especially since Trump tweeted angrily at the E.U . last week after it slapped a $ 5 billion fine on Google for allegedly abusing its dominant position in mobile .
“ I told you so ! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies , Google . They truly have taken advantage of the U.S. , but not for long ! ” Trump tweeted on Thursday .
The first senior official who described opposition to the auto tariffs within the White House said Juncker ’ s face time with the president will depend on what kind of offer he brings with him . “ He ’ ll get all the time he needs , but only if he has something interesting to say , ” this person said .
Ahead of the Juncker visit , E.U . officials are preparing for the worst by assembling a list of American exports to slap with tariffs if the U.S. goes through with the auto levies .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday expressed guarded hope for Juncker ’ s visit .
“ He will be making suggestions there about how we can enter into a discussion process to avoid this , ” Merkel said at her annual summer news conference . Juncker will “ present possibilities for discussion ” to Trump , Merkel said . But she added a note of caution . “ I ’ m not filling myself with expectations or predictions , ” she said .
The Juncker visit will come after the administration endured blistering criticism of the proposed tariffs at a Commerce Department hearing last Thursday in which 44 of 45 witnesses , including representatives of major American car and auto parts manufacturers , argued against the levies , saying they would drive up car prices by thousands of dollars and cause the loss of potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs .
“ By increasing the cost to manufacture a car , the tariffs will lead to higher vehicle prices for all automakers — foreign and domestic , ” Matt Blunt , president of he American Automotive Policy Council , which represents Ford , GM and Fiat Chrysler , said at the hearing Thursday . “ These higher costs will , in turn , lead to lower demand and lower U.S. auto sales and production . Ultimately , this will lead to fewer jobs in the auto industry . ”
A new study from the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Michigan , estimated import restrictions would increase new car prices by $ 455 to $ 6,875 , depending on the approach Trump takes . Those higher prices would reduce consumer demand by 493,600 to 2 million vehicles per year , causing industry job losses ranging from 82,000 to nearly 750,000 , CAR said . Those estimates do not include the impact of foreign retaliation , which could be significant .
Officials from Canada and the E.U . also threatened strong retaliation against U.S. exports if Trump goes through with the auto tariffs . “ Import restrictions resulting from the present investigation could result in countermeasures on a significantly higher volume of U.S. exports , which we estimate at $ 294 billion , around a fifth of total U.S. exports in 2017 , ” European Union Ambassador David O ’ Sullivan said at the Commerce Department hearing .
Much of Trump ’ s fury is directed at the EU ’ s 9.8 percent tariff on passenger car imports , compared to the 2.5 percent duty charged by the United States . Last year , the United States exported $ 52 billion worth of cars to countries such as Canada , China and Germany . But it imported $ 176 billion , leading to a trade deficit in autos of around $ 124 billion . When parts and other vehicles such as buses and heavy-duty trucks are included , the entire automotive trade deficit was about $ 200 billion .
Germany , the biggest European auto producer , exported $ 20.5 billion worth of cars to the United States in 2017 , and imported just $ 6 billion from the U.S. — a difference that Europeans attribute to consumer preferences at least as much as the tariffs .
The United States and the EU were expected to eliminate tariffs on each other ’ s autos as part of the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership . However , efforts to finish the deal before the end of the Obama administration failed , and there has been no work on the initiative since Trump took office in January 2017 .
Meanwhile , the United States has a 25 percent tariff on light pickup trucks as a result of a trade dispute over chickens with the EU back in the 1960s . The duty , which has strong support from the United Automobile Workers union , has been phased out on imports from Canada and Mexico under NAFTA , but most other countries still face it .
In addition to senior officials inside the White House , Republicans and many Democrats on Capitol Hill are also highly skeptical of the proposed auto tariffs , believing they would cost U.S. jobs both from foreign automakers operating in the U.S. and domestic carmakers that rely on imported parts during the assembly process .
Sens . Doug Jones ( D-Ala. ) and Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) said recently they would introduce legislation to at least temporarily block Trump from unilaterally imposing automotive tariffs . Both of their states have large auto manufacturing plants .

Mike Elrod voted for Donald Trump in 2016 , hoping for a break from tight government oversight that his business had endured for years , which he often found unreasonable .
“ There was a time when every day I dreaded opening the mail , ” said Elrod , who founded a small firm in South Carolina called Eccotemp that makes energy-efficient , tankless water heaters . “ The Department of Energy would put in an arbitrary rule and then come back the next day and say , ‘ You ’ re not in compliance. ’ We had no input into what was changing and when the change was taking place . ”
Elrod also thought that big businesses had long been able to buy their way out of problems , either by spending lots of money on compliance or on lobbyists to look for loopholes and apply political pressure . Trump , of course , had promised to address that — to “ drain the swamp . ”

Elrod is in his mid-60s , tall with a white beard and deliberative drawl . He trusted the president even as Trump started a trade war with China , where Elrod manufactures his heaters . The administration said U.S. companies that could prove they had no other source for their imports and whose business would be gravely injured could be spared the punishing tariffs that Trump was imposing . They would simply have to file for an exemption .
“ I had every reason to believe they were talking about us , ” Elrod said . Eccotemp had spent 15 years developing different models of tankless heaters with manufacturers in China . Simply finding new factories in other countries seemed impossible .
So in the summer of 2018 , Elrod settled in at his desk , strewn with brass valves , a pressure tester and a smiling jade Buddha from a Chinese supplier , and began typing . He and his dozen U.S. employees — designers , engineers , salespeople and customer service representatives — operate out of a squat cinder block building in a woodsy suburb of Charleston that used to be a film studio and now doubles as a distribution warehouse .
In letters to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative , Elrod asked that gas-powered water heaters be exempted from the administration ’ s 25 % tariffs , writing that the cost would be “ devastating ” for the company ’ s balance sheet . “ We had all the boxes checked , ” Elrod said . “ Or so I thought . ”
The process didn ’ t go as he expected . It ’ s the stuff that libertarians like Elrod dread : Low-level staffers with limited industry knowledge issuing seemingly arbitrary decisions that can save or smash a company ’ s bottom line .
Every few weeks , a list comes out with a new batch of lucky winners , and losers . “ Non-electrical wall candelabras , of wood , each with 3 wrought iron candle holders ” received a pass , for example , but none with one or two candles .
“ Devastating to Our Company ” In a letter beginning “ Dear Sirs , ” Eccotemp founder Mike Elrod requests tariff exclusions , making the case that Asian multinational companies with overseas relationships and production hubs win from tariffs while small businesses and American consumers lose . Read the entire letter .
Overall , Trump ’ s tariffs have not had the effect that the self-described “ Tariff Man ” promised . Companies have moved manufacturing out of China — and it has mostly gone to Vietnam , Taiwan and Mexico . Tariffs are chiefly behind a months-long decline in domestic manufacturing , Federal Reserve researchers have found . The total loss of jobs across the economy may be as high as 300,000 .
But constantly up-in-the-air trade agreements and the byzantine , opaque exclusion process has been a blessing for one set of players : Washington ’ s influence industry , including the firms of former Trump officials and allies like inauguration committee chief Brian Ballard , former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trump fundraiser Marc Lampkin .
Ballard was once Trump ’ s lobbyist in Florida . He ’ s since been dubbed “ the most powerful lobbyist in Trump ’ s Washington. ” A cancer therapy firm , Varian Medical Systems , paid Ballard and a colleague $ 540,000 to lobby the White House , the trade office and Vice President Mike Pence on trade issues , filings show . The outreach included a meeting with Trump ’ s director of trade and manufacturing policy , Peter Navarro .
Since then , four of Varian ’ s five exclusion requests have been approved — which , the company said in an SEC filing , boosted revenues by $ 23 million . ( Navarro said he doesn ’ t intervene in the exclusion process . )
Priebus ’ firm , Michael Best Strategies , was hired by a Wisconsin company , Primex , to handle exemptions for its timekeeping and temperature measurement devices . “ You ’ re not gon na do it on your own , ” Primex CEO Paul Shekoski said in an interview . “ It ’ s suicide actually . ”
Shekoski said he wanted help understanding the process and making sure all the requests were filed correctly . With Michael Best ’ s guidance , he personally wrote letters to and met with his representatives in Washington .
The collective effort may have made it all the way to the Oval Office . Shekoski said in an email last fall that he heard from his lobbyist at Michael Best , Denise Bode , that Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wis. cited Primex as an example of a Wisconsin company suffering from tariffs when the senator took the issue to the president . “ He not only called USTR , he was able to bring our specific case up to Trump directly , ” Shekoski said . Bode did not respond to a request for comment , and a Johnson spokesman did not respond to questions about the Trump contact , saying only that Johnson had advocated for many Wisconsin companies .
Days before this story was published , Shekoski denied knowing whether Johnson brought up the issue with Trump . He said he was just trying to give his elected representatives concrete stories about small businesses struggling with tariffs that they could use to advocate for tariff relief .
Lobbying records show that Primex paid Priebus ’ firm , Michael Best Strategies , $ 85,000 in 2018 and 2019 for its services . “ I ’ m not selling access , ” Priebus once told Politico . “ I ’ m merely providing strategic advice and helping them handle their problems. ” ( Neither Priebus nor the White House responded to requests for comment . )
Primex got mixed results , with about half of its 205 exclusion requests granted and half denied .
Disclosure rules don ’ t require companies to say how much money they ’ ve spent lobbying on exclusions specifically . But records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show that the number of clients lobbying on tariffs and other trade issues are higher than any year on record . In 2018 , the number jumped by 28 % to 1,372 , and 2019 will significantly exceed that once final figures are in .
Number of Clients Lobbying on Tariffs and Trade Nearly Highest on Record Loading ...
There is also no comprehensive picture yet of how companies that have hired lobbyists have fared compared with those that haven ’ t . But there is evidence that agencies have bent the rules . In October , a government watchdog found that Commerce Department officials had secretly changed the rules for one exclusion category after “ off-the-record ” discussions with a favored company , creating a “ perception of undue influence . ”
Companies with enough resources and savvy can not only push their own cases , they can work to undermine those of competitors . Elrod began to understand that in early August . He had been on the trade office ’ s website , waiting to see if he would get his exclusion and watching for requests from competitors , when he noticed that an industry giant had formally objected to his application .
Rheem Manufacturing Company is a Japanese-owned conglomerate and one of the world ’ s largest producers of water heaters , including in the United States . It challenged Elrod and a handful of other companies that had claimed they couldn ’ t find alternative sources for their products outside of China , arguing that Elrod could find suppliers in Japan , Germany and South Korea — or buy from Rheem itself .
“ The Allegation Is Unsupported ” Rheem ’ s response objecting to Eccotemp ’ s request is written in formal language , complete with citations , and addressed directly to “ the Honorable Robert E. Lighthizer , ” the U.S. trade representative . Rheem , a Japanese-owned conglomerate , lists several international manufacturers Eccotemp could do business with outside of China , noting Rheem itself also has spare capacity . Read the entire letter .
Elrod quickly fired back with another letter , laying out how difficult and expensive it would be in practice to move production to another country . Amid a rush out of China , factories in Vietnam are holding out for enormous orders and shunning the relatively small quantities that Eccotemp imports . Plus , after developing his heaters over more than a decade with a handful of suppliers , finding one that could meet his exacting standards would require months of tests and new certifications .
That did not sway the government ’ s trade office , the USTR , which in late September posted a one-page form letter saying that Elrod had failed to demonstrate his products weren ’ t available outside of China . Thinking that his original ask for exclusions might have been too broad , Elrod then filed individual requests for several of his models , hoping the government might exempt at least a few of them .
“ My Company Must Compete With Multinationals ” Elrod fights back , saying that mimicking the supply chain of a company like Rheem is “ financially impossible ” for Eccotemp . Read the entire letter .
But Rheem had reinforcements . New comments in opposition arrived on the letterhead of King & Spalding , a law firm with sleek offices across the street from the White House and a complement of former government officials . Stephen Vaughn had left the firm in 2017 to serve on the administration ’ s “ beachhead team ” at USTR , served as the agency ’ s general counsel — where he oversaw the exclusion process — and then rejoined the firm in 2019 .
Fees paid for legal services aren ’ t public , but records show that Rheem spent $ 610,000 on lobbying on all federal issues in 2018 . Neither Rheem nor Vaughn responded to requests for comment .
“ I don ’ t have anyone on Pennsylvania Avenue , ” Elrod said . “ That letter probably cost them more than we ’ ve spent on legal expenses in the last five years . ”
“ Therefore , Should Be Denied ” Attorneys from King & Spalding , a law firm with offices across the street from the White House , argue to Lighthizer that Eccotemp ’ s individual requests contain no new evidence that it can ’ t source its products outside of China . Read the entire letter .
His concern growing , Elrod met a staffer in the district office of Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , and asked for a letter of support . He inquired with USTR about testifying at one of the agency ’ s multiday hearings on its sweeping tariff action .
Nothing worked . He didn ’ t make the witness list for USTR ’ s hearings , but the head of Rheem ’ s air conditioning division did . South Carolina ’ s Department of Commerce wrote letters on behalf of large employers like the fiberglass manufacturer China Jushi , but for the first few rounds of tariffs , no letters for small companies appear in the public record . ( A spokeswoman said the state had written letters for “ companies of various sizes and with varying numbers of employees . ” )
Graham , who had filed seven letters supporting companies with a presence in South Carolina — several of them multinational or foreign-owned — also didn ’ t help .

Because they ’ re so sweeping , the Commerce Department and USTR have been flooded with clemency pleas . As of mid-December , steel and aluminum users had requested exclusions on about 152,000 specific products . With two-thirds of the requests decided , about 79 % had been approved .

Many of those affected simply submitted no requests , figuring they had slim chances of success . A handful of businesses submitted thousands , especially industrial suppliers that globally source tools and parts and distribute them to U.S. manufacturers , since a separate application was needed for every possible product variation .

“ It ’ s nearly costless for these guys to file objections , but the objection can prevent a company from getting its steel , ” McDaniel said .
Capitol Hill has noticed . In early 2018 , after receiving complaints from steel importers , Rep. Jackie Walorski , R-Ind. , sent letters to the Commerce Department detailing problems with evaluations . The process had been a “ masterclass in government inefficiency and plagued by maddening inconsistency , ” she wrote in April . After receiving no formal responses , on Oct. 17 she wrote in exasperation , “ It is difficult not to believe that there is a finger on the scale favoring objectors . ”
In one letter , Walorski cited the case of National Tool & Manufacturing Company , a 45-person firm based in East Dundee , Illinois , that found itself in a fight with a multinational metals titan .
National Tool requested an exemption on a specialty grade of steel it buys in Italy and distributes to companies that make injection molds . EDRO Specialty Steels , which is owned by the Austrian conglomerate Voestalpine AG , objected on the grounds that it could produce the steel National Tool needed in the U.S. National Tool ’ s request was denied , so it had to keep eating the 25 % tariff .
Then , EDRO itself requested exclusions for the raw material it imports from Slovenia to produce its proposed substitute — showing that the product it said it could supply wasn ’ t entirely American-made after all . ( EDRO said this summary was “ incomplete , ” but declined to comment further . )
National Tool President Eric Sandberg suspects his exclusion request never had a chance .
“ It truly is one of these big vs. small battles , ” Sandberg said . “ Because one of those big three companies wrote a letter , done . Without investigation , it was just done . It really feels like the government is working against you . ”
In late October , the Commerce Department wrote back to Rep. Walorski , tersely rejecting her complaint . But Walorski ’ s concern was merited . On Oct. 28 , the agency ’ s inspector general issued an alert finding that steel producers had back channel communications with Commerce Department staff that swayed their decisions . For example , the inspector general found that criteria for evaluating exclusions had been changed at an objector ’ s request , before decisions were posted publicly .
That apparent bias has percolated out to some Washington insiders , who see the steel and aluminum exclusion process as so slanted toward U.S. producers that it ’ s not worth the trouble . “ I wouldn ’ t take anybody ’ s money against the U.S. steel industry , ” said one prominent D.C. lobbyist who spoke on the condition of anonymity . “ We say no a lot . ”
Throughout his career , Mike Elrod has tried to follow the incentives that American trade policy has created for U.S. businesses .
In the 1990s , he owned a factory that made industrial rainwear . After China ’ s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 , which locked in low tariff rates , Elrod ’ s biggest client decided to relocate production there . “ It killed the company , ” Elrod said . “ There was nowhere else to go . ”
After that , Elrod decided to start importing from China himself , setting up a business that manufactured precision metal components before finding a type of water heater that he thought would sell well in the U.S .. Founded in 2006 , Eccotemp grew steadily , adding people , new models and distribution centers overseas , to the point where Elrod started thinking about setting up assembly operations in the U.S . Even if labor is more expensive , not having to wait four months for new orders to ship across the world would allow him to more closely control inventory levels and turn around design changes faster .
Instead of accelerating that plan , however , Trump ’ s tariffs on Chinese imports took it off the drawing board . If the only place to get components is China , the duties would make bringing them into the U.S. for final assembly cost-prohibitive .
Elrod in Eccotemp ’ s lobby . He has spent 15 years developing the company ’ s products . ( Leslie McKellar for ███ )
As the trade war began , Elrod had been looking forward to retirement . As soon as the tariffs were announced , Elrod and his successor as CEO , Joe Bolognue , had to formulate a new business strategy based on a 25 % hike in the cost of goods : More higher-margin products , more non-U.S. sales , leaner operations .
They don ’ t want to walk away from the brand they ’ ve built , or put their employees out of work . “ We don ’ t have the luxury to say , ‘ We ’ re going out of business , ’ ” Bolognue said . “ We just don ’ t make as much money as we used to . ”
The tariffs have also created other problems , like Chinese manufacturers selling directly into the U.S. on Amazon or Alibaba rather than going through companies like Eccotemp . They still have to pay tariffs , but they can undercut prices by avoiding one layer of markups .
Since the tariff decisions came down , Elrod has moved to Georgia and isn ’ t as involved in day-to-day operations . But he ’ s still heavily invested in the company , financially and emotionally . That ’ s why it was particularly devastating when the tariffs killed a potential deal to sell Eccotemp to a private equity firm , which would have allowed it to keep growing while ensuring his retirement .
“ That ’ s usually what people see as the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , ” Elrod said . “ My net worth , you ’ re sitting in it . I don ’ t have a 401 ( k ) . Everything that I ’ ve ever done has flown back into this business . I don ’ t have enough runway to do it again . ”
Elrod says that despite it all , he still plans to vote for Trump in November , citing the administration ’ s friendlier stance to his company on regulations . As for draining the swamp , Elrod doesn ’ t blame the president .
“ Maybe if Trump moved the capital to Dallas and put everyone with a DC address on the Do Not Fly List , maybe , ” Elrod said . “ You get all the justice you can afford . ”","ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

Mike Elrod voted for Donald Trump in 2016, hoping for a break from tight government oversight that his business had endured for years, which he often found unreasonable.

“There was a time when every day I dreaded opening the mail,” said Elrod, who founded a small firm in South Carolina called Eccotemp that makes energy-efficient, tankless water heaters. “The Department of Energy would put in an arbitrary rule and then come back the next day and say, ‘You’re not in compliance.’ We had no input into what was changing and when the change was taking place.”

Elrod also thought that big businesses had long been able to buy their way out of problems, either by spending lots of money on compliance or on lobbyists to look for loopholes and apply political pressure. Trump, of course, had promised to address that — to “drain the swamp.”

Elrod is in his mid-60s, tall with a white beard and deliberative drawl. He trusted the president even as Trump started a trade war with China, where Elrod manufactures his heaters. The administration said U.S. companies that could prove they had no other source for their imports and whose business would be gravely injured could be spared the punishing tariffs that Trump was imposing. They would simply have to file for an exemption.

“I had every reason to believe they were talking about us,” Elrod said. Eccotemp had spent 15 years developing different models of tankless heaters with manufacturers in China. Simply finding new factories in other countries seemed impossible.

So in the summer of 2018, Elrod settled in at his desk, strewn with brass valves, a pressure tester and a smiling jade Buddha from a Chinese supplier, and began typing. He and his dozen U.S. employees — designers, engineers, salespeople and customer service representatives — operate out of a squat cinder block building in a woodsy suburb of Charleston that used to be a film studio and now doubles as a distribution warehouse.

In letters to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Elrod asked that gas-powered water heaters be exempted from the administration’s 25% tariffs, writing that the cost would be “devastating” for the company’s balance sheet. “We had all the boxes checked,” Elrod said. “Or so I thought.”

The process didn’t go as he expected. It’s the stuff that libertarians like Elrod dread: Low-level staffers with limited industry knowledge issuing seemingly arbitrary decisions that can save or smash a company’s bottom line.

Every few weeks, a list comes out with a new batch of lucky winners, and losers. “Non-electrical wall candelabras, of wood, each with 3 wrought iron candle holders” received a pass, for example, but none with one or two candles.

There is no mechanism for appeals.

“Devastating to Our Company” In a letter beginning “Dear Sirs,” Eccotemp founder Mike Elrod requests tariff exclusions, making the case that Asian multinational companies with overseas relationships and production hubs win from tariffs while small businesses and American consumers lose. Read the entire letter.

Overall, Trump’s tariffs have not had the effect that the self-described “Tariff Man” promised. Companies have moved manufacturing out of China — and it has mostly gone to Vietnam, Taiwan and Mexico. Tariffs are chiefly behind a months-long decline in domestic manufacturing, Federal Reserve researchers have found. The total loss of jobs across the economy may be as high as 300,000.

But constantly up-in-the-air trade agreements and the byzantine, opaque exclusion process has been a blessing for one set of players: Washington’s influence industry, including the firms of former Trump officials and allies like inauguration committee chief Brian Ballard, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trump fundraiser Marc Lampkin.

Ballard was once Trump’s lobbyist in Florida. He’s since been dubbed “the most powerful lobbyist in Trump’s Washington.” A cancer therapy firm, Varian Medical Systems, paid Ballard and a colleague $540,000 to lobby the White House, the trade office and Vice President Mike Pence on trade issues, filings show. The outreach included a meeting with Trump’s director of trade and manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro.

Since then, four of Varian’s five exclusion requests have been approved — which, the company said in an SEC filing, boosted revenues by $23 million. (Navarro said he doesn’t intervene in the exclusion process.)

Priebus’ firm, Michael Best Strategies, was hired by a Wisconsin company, Primex, to handle exemptions for its timekeeping and temperature measurement devices. “You’re not gonna do it on your own,” Primex CEO Paul Shekoski said in an interview. “It’s suicide actually.”

Shekoski said he wanted help understanding the process and making sure all the requests were filed correctly. With Michael Best’s guidance, he personally wrote letters to and met with his representatives in Washington.

The collective effort may have made it all the way to the Oval Office. Shekoski said in an email last fall that he heard from his lobbyist at Michael Best, Denise Bode, that Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. cited Primex as an example of a Wisconsin company suffering from tariffs when the senator took the issue to the president. “He not only called USTR, he was able to bring our specific case up to Trump directly,” Shekoski said. Bode did not respond to a request for comment, and a Johnson spokesman did not respond to questions about the Trump contact, saying only that Johnson had advocated for many Wisconsin companies.

Days before this story was published, Shekoski denied knowing whether Johnson brought up the issue with Trump. He said he was just trying to give his elected representatives concrete stories about small businesses struggling with tariffs that they could use to advocate for tariff relief.

Lobbying records show that Primex paid Priebus’ firm, Michael Best Strategies, $85,000 in 2018 and 2019 for its services. “I’m not selling access,” Priebus once told Politico. “I’m merely providing strategic advice and helping them handle their problems.” (Neither Priebus nor the White House responded to requests for comment.)

Primex got mixed results, with about half of its 205 exclusion requests granted and half denied.

Disclosure rules don’t require companies to say how much money they’ve spent lobbying on exclusions specifically. But records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show that the number of clients lobbying on tariffs and other trade issues are higher than any year on record. In 2018, the number jumped by 28% to 1,372, and 2019 will significantly exceed that once final figures are in.

Number of Clients Lobbying on Tariffs and Trade Nearly Highest on Record Loading...

There is also no comprehensive picture yet of how companies that have hired lobbyists have fared compared with those that haven’t. But there is evidence that agencies have bent the rules. In October, a government watchdog found that Commerce Department officials had secretly changed the rules for one exclusion category after “off-the-record” discussions with a favored company, creating a “perception of undue influence.”

Companies with enough resources and savvy can not only push their own cases, they can work to undermine those of competitors. Elrod began to understand that in early August. He had been on the trade office’s website, waiting to see if he would get his exclusion and watching for requests from competitors, when he noticed that an industry giant had formally objected to his application.

Rheem Manufacturing Company is a Japanese-owned conglomerate and one of the world’s largest producers of water heaters, including in the United States. It challenged Elrod and a handful of other companies that had claimed they couldn’t find alternative sources for their products outside of China, arguing that Elrod could find suppliers in Japan, Germany and South Korea — or buy from Rheem itself.

“The Allegation Is Unsupported” Rheem’s response objecting to Eccotemp’s request is written in formal language, complete with citations, and addressed directly to “the Honorable Robert E. Lighthizer,” the U.S. trade representative. Rheem, a Japanese-owned conglomerate, lists several international manufacturers Eccotemp could do business with outside of China, noting Rheem itself also has spare capacity. Read the entire letter.

Elrod quickly fired back with another letter, laying out how difficult and expensive it would be in practice to move production to another country. Amid a rush out of China, factories in Vietnam are holding out for enormous orders and shunning the relatively small quantities that Eccotemp imports. Plus, after developing his heaters over more than a decade with a handful of suppliers, finding one that could meet his exacting standards would require months of tests and new certifications.

That did not sway the government’s trade office, the USTR, which in late September posted a one-page form letter saying that Elrod had failed to demonstrate his products weren’t available outside of China. Thinking that his original ask for exclusions might have been too broad, Elrod then filed individual requests for several of his models, hoping the government might exempt at least a few of them.

“My Company Must Compete With Multinationals” Elrod fights back, saying that mimicking the supply chain of a company like Rheem is “financially impossible” for Eccotemp. Read the entire letter.

But Rheem had reinforcements. New comments in opposition arrived on the letterhead of King & Spalding, a law firm with sleek offices across the street from the White House and a complement of former government officials. Stephen Vaughn had left the firm in 2017 to serve on the administration’s “beachhead team” at USTR, served as the agency’s general counsel — where he oversaw the exclusion process — and then rejoined the firm in 2019.

Fees paid for legal services aren’t public, but records show that Rheem spent $610,000 on lobbying on all federal issues in 2018. Neither Rheem nor Vaughn responded to requests for comment.

“I don’t have anyone on Pennsylvania Avenue,” Elrod said. “That letter probably cost them more than we’ve spent on legal expenses in the last five years.”

“Therefore, Should Be Denied” Attorneys from King & Spalding, a law firm with offices across the street from the White House, argue to Lighthizer that Eccotemp’s individual requests contain no new evidence that it can’t source its products outside of China. Read the entire letter.

His concern growing, Elrod met a staffer in the district office of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and asked for a letter of support. He inquired with USTR about testifying at one of the agency’s multiday hearings on its sweeping tariff action.

Nothing worked. He didn’t make the witness list for USTR’s hearings, but the head of Rheem’s air conditioning division did. South Carolina’s Department of Commerce wrote letters on behalf of large employers like the fiberglass manufacturer China Jushi, but for the first few rounds of tariffs, no letters for small companies appear in the public record. (A spokeswoman said the state had written letters for “companies of various sizes and with varying numbers of employees.”)

Graham, who had filed seven letters supporting companies with a presence in South Carolina — several of them multinational or foreign-owned — also didn’t help.

“Lindsey Graham really did kick it to the curb,” Elrod said. (A spokesman for Graham did not respond to a request for further explanation.)

Finally, in November, the trade office rejected all of Elrod’s requests for relief in the same terse fashion it had the first. “After careful consideration, your request was denied because the request failed to show that this particular product is available only from China,” the letter read.

As a result, Eccotemp would get back none of the hundreds of thousands of dollars in duties that it had already paid out, and the bleeding would continue. Its profit margins vaporized and its employee head count sank by about 30%, as the company opted not to replace departing staff.

For a while after receiving the denials, Elrod carefully watched the steady stream of response letters posted on the federal regulations portal, in case another company received an exclusion that would also cover his products. But no relevant approvals appeared.

Elrod has appreciated how under Trump, other regulators have been more business friendly. The government pesters him much less these days about energy and environmental rules. “Then you’ve got the USTR and the whole tariff thing that’s just a crusher,” he said.

“People our size, that don’t have K Street lawyers,” said Elrod, referring to the center of Washington’s lobbying industry. “We’re the ones that bear the brunt, we’re the ones that have the least tools in the box to work with.”

It’s not often that K Street gets handed the type of business development opportunity that Trump’s volatile trade policy offers.

EDRO Specialty Steels, which is owned by the Austrian conglomerate Voestalpine AG, objected on the grounds that it could produce the steel National Tool needed in the U.S. National Tool’s request was denied, so it had to keep eating the 25% tariff.

Then, EDRO itself requested exclusions for the raw material it imports from Slovenia to produce its proposed substitute — showing that the product it said it could supply wasn’t entirely American-made after all. (EDRO said this summary was “incomplete,” but declined to comment further.)

National Tool President Eric Sandberg suspects his exclusion request never had a chance.

“It truly is one of these big vs. small battles,” Sandberg said. “Because one of those big three companies wrote a letter, done. Without investigation, it was just done. It really feels like the government is working against you.”

In late October, the Commerce Department wrote back to Rep. Walorski, tersely rejecting her complaint. But Walorski’s concern was merited. On Oct. 28, the agency’s inspector general issued an alert finding that steel producers had back channel communications with Commerce Department staff that swayed their decisions. For example, the inspector general found that criteria for evaluating exclusions had been changed at an objector’s request, before decisions were posted publicly.

That apparent bias has percolated out to some Washington insiders, who see the steel and aluminum exclusion process as so slanted toward U.S. producers that it’s not worth the trouble. “I wouldn’t take anybody’s money against the U.S. steel industry,” said one prominent D.C. lobbyist who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We say no a lot.”

Throughout his career, Mike Elrod has tried to follow the incentives that American trade policy has created for U.S. businesses.

In the 1990s, he owned a factory that made industrial rainwear. After China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, which locked in low tariff rates, Elrod’s biggest client decided to relocate production there. “It killed the company,” Elrod said. “There was nowhere else to go.”

After that, Elrod decided to start importing from China himself, setting up a business that manufactured precision metal components before finding a type of water heater that he thought would sell well in the U.S.. Founded in 2006, Eccotemp grew steadily, adding people, new models and distribution centers overseas, to the point where Elrod started thinking about setting up assembly operations in the U.S. Even if labor is more expensive, not having to wait four months for new orders to ship across the world would allow him to more closely control inventory levels and turn around design changes faster.

Instead of accelerating that plan, however, Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports took it off the drawing board. If the only place to get components is China, the duties would make bringing them into the U.S. for final assembly cost-prohibitive.

As the trade war began, Elrod had been looking forward to retirement. As soon as the tariffs were announced, Elrod and his successor as CEO, Joe Bolognue, had to formulate a new business strategy based on a 25% hike in the cost of goods: More higher-margin products, more non-U.S. sales, leaner operations.

They don’t want to walk away from the brand they’ve built, or put their employees out of work. “We don’t have the luxury to say, ‘We’re going out of business,’” Bolognue said. “We just don’t make as much money as we used to.”

The tariffs have also created other problems, like Chinese manufacturers selling directly into the U.S. on Amazon or Alibaba rather than going through companies like Eccotemp. They still have to pay tariffs, but they can undercut prices by avoiding one layer of markups.

Since the tariff decisions came down, Elrod has moved to Georgia and isn’t as involved in day-to-day operations. But he’s still heavily invested in the company, financially and emotionally. That’s why it was particularly devastating when the tariffs killed a potential deal to sell Eccotemp to a private equity firm, which would have allowed it to keep growing while ensuring his retirement.

“That’s usually what people see as the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,” Elrod said. “My net worth, you’re sitting in it. I don’t have a 401(k). Everything that I’ve ever done has flown back into this business. I don’t have enough runway to do it again.”

Elrod says that despite it all, he still plans to vote for Trump in November, citing the administration’s friendlier stance to his company on regulations. As for draining the swamp, Elrod doesn’t blame the president.

“Maybe if Trump moved the capital to Dallas and put everyone with a DC address on the Do Not Fly List, maybe,” Elrod said. “You get all the justice you can afford.”",www.propublica.org,center,t3qjwfdYet2HjayC

Margin for error on decisive trade vote : 2 But backers believe they still have the upper hand ahead of Tuesday morning vote .
Trade proponents appear to have the momentum heading into Tuesday ’ s decisive Senate vote on President Barack Obama ’ s bid for expanded powers to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact . But the suspense rose Tuesday morning when Sen. Ted Cruz announced he is switching his vote against the trade legislation , giving backers an even smaller margin for error on what ’ s already expected to be a very close vote .
As of Monday evening , pro-trade Democrats were keeping their positions tightly held , but sources in both parties said the trade measure is likely to win the 60 votes needed to clear a filibuster by liberals . That would put the bill on course for Obama ’ s desk , after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner devised a complex procedural scheme to sidestep Democratic opposition in the House .
The Cruz switch means McConnell ( R-Ky. ) can now afford to lose only two of the 14 pro-trade Democrats who last month backed a package granting Obama “ fast-track ” trade authority and a companion measure to help workers who lose their jobs to free trade .
“ TPA has become enmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom deal-making , along with serious concerns that it would open up the potential for sweeping changes in our laws that trade agreements typically do not include , ” Cruz wrote in a column posted Tuesday on the conservative site Breitbart .
The Senate on Tuesday is voting only on so-called Trade Promotion Authority , not the workers aid program known as Trade Adjustment Assistance . That has some Democrats nervous about whether a separate effort to approve worker assistance will succeed , given that Republicans strongly oppose the program .
Organized by Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D-Wash. ) , who is threatening to vote no , a group of pro-trade Democrats huddled for a strategy session in the Capitol on Monday evening . Most emerged tight-lipped , but several Democrats said that the vote is likely to succeed on Tuesday morning .
“ It ’ s probably going to get over the hump , ” said Sen. Tim Kaine ( D-Va. ) .
Still , inside the private session , several senators raised the possibility that they might want something in return for their support . Some said they would press for a vote on the Export-Import Bank , which will expire at the end of the month unless Congress takes action .
A key Democratic architect of the trade legislation said he has work to do overnight to convince his colleagues to stay on board .
“ I ’ ve got a lot to do tonight . I ’ ve been listening to my colleagues and I always get a lot out of it , ” said Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , who plans to vote yes on Tuesday . “ There are number of areas that struck me as reasonable that they want to have pursued . ”
McConnell is seeking to placate Democrats by locking in a vote on the worker-assistance bill to immediately follow the fast-track bill , tying TAA to a proposal intended to boost the economies of African nations . That goes beyond a verbal commitment that many Democrats said is not enough for them and assures that both pieces of legislation can clear the Senate if Democrats stand behind them .
So far , only a handful of Democrats have said explicitly that they will back the fast-track bill without the worker protections being directly attached : Sens . Bill Nelson of Florida , Dianne Feinstein of California , Wyden and Tom Carper of Delaware . Kaine is also leaning in favor . That ’ s an uptick from last week , when only Carper and Nelson were publicly committed to voting “ yes . ”
A spokeswoman for another pro-trade Democrat , Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland , would say only that Cardin preferred that the fast-track legislation and worker aid be tied together . Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) said four times on Monday evening : “ I ’ m not going to talk about it. ” And pro-trade Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D-N.H. ) said until she is satisfied that all pieces of the trade package will pass , “ I ’ m a ‘ no ’ vote . ”
“ It ’ s the same issue . We want reassurance that TAA … as well as the enforcement packages are gon na go as they were passed out of the Senate originally , ” Shaheen said .
And then there ’ s Cantwell , who said in an interview last week that she would vote no on the package as currently constructed without stronger commitments from GOP leaders on TAA ’ s future . She declined to say what her position on was on Monday night , but a colleague described her as “ very upset ” with McConnell for not holding a binding vote on the Export-Import Bank before it expires at the end of the month . McConnell held a mostly symbolic vote on renewing the bank after he pledged to give it a vote during the Senate ’ s last go-round on trade .
“ McConnell made a commitment also on another issue , Export-Import Bank , to Maria Cantwell , and did not keep it . But I can not imagine McConnell would go back on a commitment on TAA that he made to the president , ” Nelson said . “ She is very upset , still . And I don ’ t blame her . ”
On Monday afternoon , McConnell made a personal pledge to shepherd the worker aid bill through the Senate . And despite the uncertainty , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) vowed Monday that he was “ absolutely confident ” that Republicans will help pass the worker-assistance program and follow through on their promise .
“ There ’ s no question in my mind we ’ ll pass TAA , ” Hatch said . “ We ’ ve got to do that . We know that , even though we don ’ t like TAA . We know that ’ s the price of getting TPA through . ”
McConnell ’ s chief vote counter , Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas , said he is “ optimistic ” that Congress can finish work on fast track this week .
“ We did it before and as long as everybody votes the way they did last time , we ’ ll do it again , ” Cornyn said in an interview Monday .
Pro-trade Democrats , clearly in the minority of their party on trade , have mostly dodged the issue publicly , seeking to avoid the tension between the business and liberal wings of the Democratic coalition . Labor and liberal groups are pressing the undeclared Democrats to rebuff the latest deal , arguing it ’ s worse than the package they voted for earlier . A coalition of dozens of trade opponents , including the Communications Workers of America , wrote senators on Monday , calling the trade legislation “ destructive policy . ”
Actor Mark Ruffalo joined the fray , too , saying Monday that the 12-nation trade deal would put “ corporate profits above our climate , clean air and water protections. ” And liberal senators such as Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) are privately lobbying their colleagues to vote “ no . ”
“ I hope my colleagues vote against the legislation . I think the evidence is quite overwhelming that our past trade agreements have been a disaster for the American worker , ” said Sanders , who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president .
Asked whether his side can win , Sanders was noncommittal : “ We ’ re doing our best . I can ’ t predict . I ’ m not too good at that . ”
Senate Democrats derailed the trade package in May as they sought to force votes on a customs-enforcement bill . A day later it was revived , winning passage before running into a roadblock in the House that required McConnell and Boehner to separate the key bills . TPA passed the House last week and could be sent to Obama for his signature as early as Wednesday if pro-trade Democrats remain on board .
Republican leaders said it made no sense for Senate Democrats to bring down TPA again , “ unless they just want to cut the president off at the knees like Nancy Pelosi did , ” Cornyn said . “ That would be the only reason I could think of . ”
If the Senate passes TPA , it will move swiftly to approve the worker ’ s-assistance bill as well as renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act and clear a new provision to help the domestic steel industry compete with overseas rivals . That latter provision is aimed at senators from the Rust Belt such as Republican Rob Portman of Ohio .
McConnell gave further assurances Monday to wavering Democrats , declaring that he wants to go to a conference committee with the House to resolve differing customs enforcement bills that have cleared both chambers .
Though the TPA vote is difficult for Democrats because of opposition from the party ’ s liberal wing , the drama surrounding trade assistance will shift to Republicans later this week . The GOP historically has opposed the TAA program , which means that GOP leaders may have to help muscle through the trade assistance package later this week if it is difficult to get 14 Republicans on board with the chamber ’ s 46 Democrats .
Uncertainty also hangs over the House , where Democrats voted against TAA two weeks ago in an effort to sink the entire trade package . Republicans are banking on them not doing so again , because fast-track will have already passed both chambers separately . But there is no guarantee .","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can afford to lose only three of the 14 pro-trade Democrats.

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said four times on Monday evening: “I’m not going to talk about it.” And pro-trade Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said until she is satisfied that all pieces of the trade package will pass, “I’m a ‘no’ vote.”

“It’s the same issue. We want reassurance that TAA … as well as the enforcement packages are gonna go as they were passed out of the Senate originally,” Shaheen said.

And then there’s Cantwell, who said in an interview last week that she would vote no on the package as currently constructed without stronger commitments from GOP leaders on TAA’s future. She declined to say what her position on was on Monday night, but a colleague described her as “very upset” with McConnell for not holding a binding vote on the Export-Import Bank before it expires at the end of the month. McConnell held a mostly symbolic vote on renewing the bank after he pledged to give it a vote during the Senate’s last go-round on trade.

“McConnell made a commitment also on another issue, Export-Import Bank, to Maria Cantwell, and did not keep it. But I cannot imagine McConnell would go back on a commitment on TAA that he made to the president,” Nelson said. “She is very upset, still. And I don’t blame her.”

On Monday afternoon, McConnell made a personal pledge to shepherd the worker aid bill through the Senate. And despite the uncertainty, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) vowed Monday that he was “absolutely confident” that Republicans will help pass the worker-assistance program and follow through on their promise.

“There’s no question in my mind we’ll pass TAA,” Hatch said. “We’ve got to do that. We know that, even though we don’t like TAA. We know that’s the price of getting TPA through.”

McConnell’s chief vote counter, Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, said he is “optimistic” that Congress can finish work on fast track this week.

“We did it before and as long as everybody votes the way they did last time, we’ll do it again,” Cornyn said in an interview Monday.

Pro-trade Democrats, clearly in the minority of their party on trade, have mostly dodged the issue publicly, seeking to avoid the tension between the business and liberal wings of the Democratic coalition. Labor and liberal groups are pressing the undeclared Democrats to rebuff the latest deal, arguing it’s worse than the package they voted for earlier. A coalition of dozens of trade opponents, including the Communications Workers of America, wrote senators on Monday, calling the trade legislation “destructive policy.”

Actor Mark Ruffalo joined the fray, too, saying Monday that the 12-nation trade deal would put “corporate profits above our climate, clean air and water protections.” And liberal senators such as Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are privately lobbying their colleagues to vote “no.”

“I hope my colleagues vote against the legislation. I think the evidence is quite overwhelming that our past trade agreements have been a disaster for the American worker,” said Sanders, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president.

Asked whether his side can win, Sanders was noncommittal: “We’re doing our best. I can’t predict. I’m not too good at that.”

Senate Democrats derailed the trade package in May as they sought to force votes on a customs-enforcement bill. A day later it was revived, winning passage before running into a roadblock in the House that required McConnell and Boehner to separate the key bills. TPA passed the House last week and could be sent to Obama for his signature as early as Wednesday if pro-trade Democrats remain on board.

Republican leaders said it made no sense for Senate Democrats to bring down TPA again, “unless they just want to cut the president off at the knees like Nancy Pelosi did,” Cornyn said. “That would be the only reason I could think of.”

If the Senate passes TPA, it will move swiftly to approve the worker’s-assistance bill as well as renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act and clear a new provision to help the domestic steel industry compete with overseas rivals. That latter provision is aimed at senators from the Rust Belt such as Republican Rob Portman of Ohio.

McConnell gave further assurances Monday to wavering Democrats, declaring that he wants to go to a conference committee with the House to resolve differing customs enforcement bills that have cleared both chambers.

Though the TPA vote is difficult for Democrats because of opposition from the party’s liberal wing, the drama surrounding trade assistance will shift to Republicans later this week. The GOP historically has opposed the TAA program, which means that GOP leaders may have to help muscle through the trade assistance package later this week if it is difficult to get 14 Republicans on board with the chamber’s 46 Democrats.

Uncertainty also hangs over the House, where Democrats voted against TAA two weeks ago in an effort to sink the entire trade package. Republicans are banking on them not doing so again, because fast-track will have already passed both chambers separately. But there is no guarantee.

""Getting China to open its market to more U.S. exports is significant, but the far more important issues revolve around forced technology transfers, cyber theft and the protection of our innovation,"" Lighthizer said.

“As this process continues, the United States may use all of its legal tools to protect our technology through tariffs, investment restrictions and export regulations. Real structural change is necessary. Nothing less than the future of tens of millions of American jobs is at stake,"" he said.

The tech industry welcomes the trade war cease-fire as a good step that will shield consumers from higher costs, said Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, a lobby group for Amazon, Google and others. But China still needs to make changes to level the playing field for American firms, he said.

Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday that it is up to Trump's team not to ""blow it"" with China.

“There is nothing wrong with these talks but the proof of the pudding is in the eating,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""If President Xi is going to escape meaningful punishment for ZTE and fail to take strong actions on intellectual property, cyber theft, and American companies having free access to sell goods in China, and instead simply provide a promise to buy goods for the next few years, we will have lost.""

Schumer was referring to the Chinese technology company ZTE, which faces stiff penalties for violating U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran. Trump said last week that he would look into helping the company escape some of its harshest penalties. After talking with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump wrote on Twitter that he and Xi were working together to get ZTE back in business ""fast.""

On Sunday, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said ZTE would not get off ""scot-free.""

Kudlow also said Sunday that Trump has not completely abandoned the possibility of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing doesn’t address U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.

“Look, I don’t think we’re at that stage yet. … The details will be down the road. These things are not so precise. Macroeconomics plays a big role. But our view is China must open up. They must become fair traders,” Kudlow said.

BEIJING — China needs more pork imports than ever as the country grapples with an outbreak of a swine disease — and that could become a business opportunity for U.S. farmers if the two countries can reach an agreement on trade.

China to buy US farm products

The phased aspect of the deal is encouraging to the Chinese side, said He Weiwen, executive council member of the China Association of International Trade. According to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks, He said the Chinese will show their sincerity by increasing purchases of American agricultural products. However, there's a catch.

Republicans rip Trump over NATO plan One GOP lawmaker tells ███ , 'Comments like this are not only ill-informed , they ’ re dangerous . '
Donald Trump 's latest broadside against NATO , the military alliance that has long served as a pillar of Western unity , has further aggravated the disunity in the Republican Party as he prepares to accept its nomination for president .
In an interview with The New York Times , Trump said the United States should n't automatically come to the defense of fellow NATO members if they are attacked unless those countries have paid their bills to the alliance . That approach flies in the face of one of NATO 's bedrock principles , Article 5 , which requires NATO states to come to the aid of a fellow member under assault .
The comments drew scorn not only from American allies but also from several top Republicans , undermining the party 's efforts to project unity during its national convention this week in Cleveland . They were published less than a day before Trump is due to deliver a major speech at the convention , and they further fueled the perception that Trump is a lackey for Russian President Vladimir Putin .
`` I disagree with that , '' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who was in Cleveland , said of Trump 's comments . `` NATO is the most important military alliance in world history . I want to reassure our NATO allies that if any of them get attacked , we 'll be there to defend them . ''
Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois , speaking during a ███ panel event at the convention , said Trump 's remarks made it harder for him to vote for the real estate mogul come November .
`` You have allies right now , I mean I have friends that , you know , serve in parliament in places like Estonia , that every day worry about the Russians deciding that this is the time to re-annex and take them back , ” said Kinzinger , a former Air Force pilot . “ And comments like this are not only ill-informed , they ’ re dangerous . ”
Trump has long offered a radically different view of U.S. engagement with the world than many in his own party hold — one that is defined primarily in economic terms and which does not hold treaties sacrosanct .
In the Times interview , Trump also said he would not chide authoritarian leaders for cracking down on civil liberties or their political rivals ; that he 'd pull the U.S. out of the North American Free Trade Agreement if Canada and Mexico did n't agree to better terms ; and that he might withdraw U.S. troops deployed around the world , even from sensitive areas such as the Korean peninsula .
But the Manhattan billionaire 's comments on NATO were unusually striking . Trump , who has often questioned whether other NATO states are carrying their share of the financial and military burdens that come with the alliance , said that if he became president the U.S. would come to the assistance of a member state under attack only if it “ has fulfilled their obligations to us . ”
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization , established in 1949 , has 28 members . The first time NATO invoked Article 5 was after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States , and America 's NATO allies have since helped fight the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan . Many NATO members also are involved in the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State terrorist network , and a number of their representatives were in Washington on Thursday for a meeting of the coalition , making the timing of Trump 's comments all the more sensitive .
`` Solidarity among allies is a key value for NATO , '' the military alliance 's secretary general , Jens Stoltenberg , said in a statement as word spread of Trump 's remarks . `` We defend one another . ... Two world wars have shown that peace in Europe is also important for the security of the United States . ''
Trump 's comments were especially unnerving to smaller NATO countries , such as the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , who in recent years have begun to fear Russia 's military aims . ( Trump was specifically asked about the threat to the Baltic states in the Times interview . )
Toomas Hendrik Ilves , the president of Estonia , tweeted his dismay early Thursday , saying , `` Estonia is 1 of 5 NATO allies in Europe to meet its 2 % def expenditures commitment . Fought , with no caveats , in NATO 's sole Art 5 op . in Afg . '' He added : `` We are equally committed to all our NATO allies , regardless of who they may be . That 's what makes them allies . ''
Latvia 's foreign minister , Edgars Rinkevics , meanwhile , stressed to ███ in a phone interview that his country has aided the U.S. in Afghanistan and has been steadily increasing its defense spending to align with its NATO commitments .
`` I am a politician myself and I always make a distinction when it comes to a campaign and when it comes to the trappings of the office , '' Rinkevics said while declining to comment directly on Trump . He added , however , `` We take those commitments that have been made by the U.S. government seriously . ''
Trump aides on Thursday tried to contain the fallout from his remarks . His campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , insisted that Trump simply wants NATO to adjust to new security realities , where threats are often from nonstate actors .
`` What Mr. Trump has said consistently is that he thinks NATO needs to be modernized and brought into the world of the 21st century where terrorism and [ the Islamic State ] , which did n't exist when NATO was created , are taken into account in the way they deal with things , '' he said .
Trump is hardly alone in his concern that some NATO members do not devote enough resources to the alliance and that the U.S. carries more than its share of the burden . Even President Barack Obama has gently reproached some NATO states for not living up to their commitment of devoting 2 percent of their GDP to defense , saying in a speech in April that `` sometimes Europe has been complacent '' about its security .
Trump adviser Sam Clovis told ███ that the candidate was in effect putting NATO members on notice — `` We 're putting a marker out there . '' He added , however , that the Trump 's comments were about the exploring the opportunity to `` reinvest in NATO '' and not a `` hostile confrontation . ''
Still , Article 5 is not meant to apply only to members who have paid all their dues . And even if Trump were to never actually follow through on his pay-for-protection philosophy , the simple fact that he would hint at it publicly , observers said , could rattle allies and fray diplomatic relations .
`` I don ’ t think he ’ s given any serious thought to the substance of the issue , '' said Kurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO . `` It ’ s one thing to complain that they ’ re not doing enough and they need to pull their share , which they do . But another is to question the U.S. commitment . The reason that ’ s so important is certainty — how we would behave and others behave is what provides stability . It ’ s what provides deterrent . It ’ s what guarantees that we ’ ll never have to fight . ''
Trump 's NATO comments were a gift to Democrats seeking to portray him as a threat to the world order .
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 's campaign put out a statement invoking Republican darling Ronald Reagan to blast Trump — the latest sign of how the Democrat is trying to take advantage of the divisions Trump has sowed within the GOP .
`` Ronald Reagan would be ashamed . Harry Truman would be ashamed . Republicans , Democrats and Independents who help build NATO into the most successful military alliance in history would all come to the same conclusion : Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit and fundamentally ill-prepared to be our commander in chief , '' Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in the statement .
Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine , a potential vice presidential pick for Clinton , said he was `` stunned '' to learn of Trump 's comments . `` Is the new rule that your word is n't your bond ? '' he asked at an immigration-related event in his home state .
White House spokesman Josh Earnest , meanwhile , tried to reassure America 's partners . `` There should be no mistake or miscalculation made about this country ’ s commitment to our trans-Atlantic alliance , '' he said .
A number of Trump 's critics said Trump 's statements appear to be exactly what Putin would want to hear . Putin has long felt somewhat threatened by NATO 's presence , especially as former Soviet states have sought to join the alliance .
Trump has been complimentary toward Putin ; he told the Times that he and Putin `` will get along very well . '' The Republican 's team was reported to have pressured the party 's platform-writing committee to remove references about the U.S. coming to the aid of Ukraine , a former Soviet country that Russia invaded in 2014 and has been locked in a battle over territory with since .
`` I ’ m 100 percent certain how Russian President Putin feels — he ’ s a very happy man , '' Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , a prominent Republican critic of Trump , said of the GOP nominee 's remarks .
Trump 's vice presidential pick , Indiana Gov . Mike Pence , also sought to defend him Thursday as word spread of his NATO remarks .
“ I have every confidence that Donald Trump will see to it that the United States of America stands by our allies and lives up to our treaty obligations , '' Pence told `` Fox & Friends . '' `` That being said , I think he makes an enormously important point that I think resonates with millions of Americans that at a time where we have $ 19 trillion in national debt , that we need to begin to look to our allies around the world to step up and pay their fair share . ”
But the Clinton team was all too happy to point out the daylight between Trump and Pence , as the former secretary of state gears up to announce her own choice of running mate . Sullivan 's statement noted that Pence also had spoken of the importance of America 's allies in his speech at the convention on Wednesday .

Trump facing new legal action after his bid to save Chinese jobs is linked to a development project in Indonesia that will profit his family business,2018-05-15,Francesca Chambers,"Donald Trump 's newfound desire to help save Chinese jobs has critics of the former real estate mogul alleging that the president is acting in the interests of his family business .
The revelation that the Chinese government extended a $ 500 million loan to a state-owned company pursuing a major development project in Indonesia that will benefit the Trump Organization has ethics experts warning that Trump is likely in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution .
'See you in court Mr. Trump , ' tweeted Norm Eisen , the chief ethics officer under Barack Obama .
Donald Trump 's newfound desire to help save Chinese jobs has critics of the former real estate mogul alleging that the president is acting in the interests of his family business
Eisen and others rained criticism down on Trump for dictating that his Commerce Department look at alternatives to a supplier ban for a Chinese telecommunications company that the U.S. punished for doing business with North Korea and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions on the rogue nations .
Trump says he ordered the review because of a personal pitch from Chinese President Xi Jinping . Easing penalties on the firm , ZTE , would help to grease the skids for a trade agreement with China , Trump tweeted .
He this morning tweeted , 'Trade negotiations are continuing with China . They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S. , for many years . Stay tuned ! '
Eisen suggested in a tweet that Trump appeared to be pursuing a deal with China to boost his own business interests after the South China Morning Post reported Beijing 's loan to aid in the development of MNC Lido City .
Trump 's company has hotels bearing the president 's name and a golf course wrapped up in the project .
'This is a violation of the Emoluments Clause . A big one . See you in court Mr. Trump , ' he tweeted .
Rep. Adam Schiff , a California Democrat and constant thorn in the side of the president , said Tuesday on CNN 's New Day that the president 's desire to help ZTE 'could be related to China doing him this huge business favor , ' although he allowed that it could be that Trump is desperate for a nuclear deal with North Korea now that he 's left the Iran accord .
'The president now needs a deal with North Korea more than Kim Jong-un , ' Schiff asserted .
The lawmaker said that Trump may recognize that if he 's too tough on trade with China that Xi wo n't be as helpful with Kim , 'and then he 'll end up with two nuclear problems . '
' I certainly view this as a violation of the Emoluments Clause , yes , and many others , as well , ' he added of Trump 's company 's overseas dealings .
Schiff specified that he was talking about other ethical issues he 's observed such as 'the constant milking of the federal government , when the federal government when Trump requires the government to patronize Trump-related businesses . '
He brought up the $ 150,000 spent by Secret Service on golf carts at Trump properties to protect the president while he 's playing with friends at his courses the Trump Organization owns .
'That 's obscene ! That should never be permitted , ' he said . 'It should never be permitted that there 's even a question about whether this foreign transaction is driving U.S. policy . And this is exactly what the Emoluments clause is designed to prevent . '
Schiff claimed that when Trump nearly abandoned the one-China policy , Beijing gave Ivanka Trump 's brand the trademarks it had been long been fighting to obtain .
' I can guarantee you China would not have given those brands if Donald Trump had followed through on his campaign commitment to not recognize one China , ' Schiff charged . 'Similarly here , I ca n't imagine China going forward with this transaction helping a Trump-branded property in Indonesia to the tune of half a billion if the president continued the sanctions on ZTE .

The revelation that the Chinese government extended a $500 million loan to a state-owned company pursuing a major development project in Indonesia that will benefit the Trump Organization has ethics experts warning that Trump is likely in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

'See you in court Mr. Trump,' tweeted Norm Eisen, the chief ethics officer under Barack Obama.

Donald Trump's newfound desire to help save Chinese jobs has critics of the former real estate mogul alleging that the president is acting in the interests of his family business

Eisen and others rained criticism down on Trump for dictating that his Commerce Department look at alternatives to a supplier ban for a Chinese telecommunications company that the U.S. punished for doing business with North Korea and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions on the rogue nations.

Trump says he ordered the review because of a personal pitch from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Easing penalties on the firm, ZTE, would help to grease the skids for a trade agreement with China, Trump tweeted.

He this morning tweeted, 'Trade negotiations are continuing with China. They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S., for many years. Stay tuned!'

Eisen suggested in a tweet that Trump appeared to be pursuing a deal with China to boost his own business interests after the South China Morning Post reported Beijing's loan to aid in the development of MNC Lido City.

Trump's company has hotels bearing the president's name and a golf course wrapped up in the project.

'This is a violation of the Emoluments Clause. A big one. See you in court Mr. Trump,' he tweeted.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and constant thorn in the side of the president, said Tuesday on CNN's New Day that the president's desire to help ZTE 'could be related to China doing him this huge business favor,' although he allowed that it could be that Trump is desperate for a nuclear deal with North Korea now that he's left the Iran accord.

'The president now needs a deal with North Korea more than Kim Jong-un,' Schiff asserted.

The lawmaker said that Trump may recognize that if he's too tough on trade with China that Xi won't be as helpful with Kim, 'and then he'll end up with two nuclear problems.'

'I certainly view this as a violation of the Emoluments Clause, yes, and many others, as well,' he added of Trump's company's overseas dealings.

Schiff specified that he was talking about other ethical issues he's observed such as 'the constant milking of the federal government, when the federal government when Trump requires the government to patronize Trump-related businesses.'

He brought up the $150,000 spent by Secret Service on golf carts at Trump properties to protect the president while he's playing with friends at his courses the Trump Organization owns.

'That's obscene! That should never be permitted,' he said. 'It should never be permitted that there's even a question about whether this foreign transaction is driving U.S. policy. And this is exactly what the Emoluments clause is designed to prevent.'

Schiff claimed that when Trump nearly abandoned the one-China policy, Beijing gave Ivanka Trump's brand the trademarks it had been long been fighting to obtain.

'I can guarantee you China would not have given those brands if Donald Trump had followed through on his campaign commitment to not recognize one China,' Schiff charged. 'Similarly here, I can't imagine China going forward with this transaction helping a Trump-branded property in Indonesia to the tune of half a billion if the president continued the sanctions on ZTE. Just hard to imagine.'

Trump said yesterday that he was asking Commerce to review the penalties on ZTE after it announced that it would shudder U.S operations entirely. Commerce had said that ZTE would be shunned for seven years in the U.S.

'ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi,' Trump said on Monday.

The aid package needed to pass in order to enact companion legislation that would give Obama fast-track trade authority to complete the sweeping, 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact.

The vote on the TAA bill was 126-302.

“Whatever the deal is with other countries,” Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said before the vote, breaking her longtime silence on the issue, “we want a better deal for America’s workers.”

The vote came after President Barack Obama, in a last-ditch effort, made a rare visit to the Capitol to lobby for legislation. He implored Democrats to “play it straight” on the decisive vote.

Obama spent roughly 40 minutes with Democratic lawmakers, taking no questions but telling his party to “vote your values,” according to a source in the room.

But Democratic lawmakers rebuffed him hours later, voting overwhelmingly to scuttle the trade package that was a centerpiece of the president’s second-term agenda. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who had remained silent for weeks on the trade issue, went to the House floor shortly before the vote to speak against the trade deal.

Afterward, Pelosi linked trade to her party’s uphill effort to enact a long-term highway funding bill. “The prospects for passage of” the trade bill, she wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats, “will greatly increase with the passage of a robust highway bill.”

After TAA failed, the House approved fast-track legislation, known as Trade Promotion Authority, in a 219-211 vote. But that vote was largely for show, because enactment of TPA is contingent on approval of TAA.

The House could vote again on TAA next week. If enough votes flipped to pass it, it would mean that TPA prevailed as well, because the two bills are interconnected.

House Republican leaders say they have 100 votes for TAA, and Democrats would need to provide 118 if another vote happens. On Friday, Democrats provided 40 votes for TAA, while 86 Republicans supported it. In other words, Democrats would need to essentially triple their vote total to pass the measure.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest downplayed the defeat as a “procedural snafu,” comparing it to the Senate’s initial rejection of the legislation before it was later adopted.

“To the surprise of very few, another procedural snafu has emerged,’’ Earnest told reporters. “These kinds of entanglements are endemic to the House of Representatives.’’

With his trade push on the ropes, Obama headed to Capitol Hill Friday morning to plead with his party to bail him out. The president needed to convince Democrats to back TAA, which would provide aid and retraining to workers who lose their jobs to trade agreements. The TAA bill was intertwined with legislation to give Obama Trade Promotion Authority.

House Democrats — most of whom have been firmly entrenched in their position for weeks — emerged from the meeting with the president still divided. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, a pro-trade Democrat from Oregon, said Obama “hit it out of the park.”

“It was a powerful presentation,” Blumeuaer said. But another supporter, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said afterward it would be an “uphill climb to get to 217,” referring to the number of votes needed to pass a bill.

That turned out to be an understatement.

“TAA has always been an absolute admission to me that there is going to be lots of lost jobs,” Rep. Louise Slaughter, a top House Democrat from New York, said before the vote. Multiple Democrats echoed that sentiment on the House floor.

There was also palpable anger at the president leading up to the vote. Rep. Peter DeFazio said he thought Obama “tried to guilt people and impugn their integrity.”

“There was a number of us who were insulted,” DeFazio (D-Ore.) said in an interview after the meeting with Obama.

Obama acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the Friday vote, which turned out to be much more lopsided than anyone expected.

“I don’t think you ever nail anything down around here, it’s always moving,” the president told reporters after he spoke with lawmakers.

Republicans and Democrats were predicting ahead of the vote that TAA was headed for defeat — bringing fast track down with it — unless the dynamic dramatically shifted this morning. Obama’s visit to Capitol Hill, a rare round of personal lobbying by a president not known for his relationships with lawmakers, was designed to do just that.

Obama arrived at Pelosi’s second-floor Capitol office suite at 9:41 a.m., waving to a small group of reporters gathered in the hallway. He walked into the House Democratic Caucus meeting with Pelosi and Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the assistant minority leader.

Obama also made an appearance at the congressional baseball game on Thursday night, and top administration officials — including Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough — have been meeting with Democrats for the past several days.

Some Democrats were clearly unmoved by the direct appeal from the commander-in-chief.

“We’re going to win today,” Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, declared before the meeting with Obama. “No on both.”

The eleventh hour drama came as top lawmakers and aides said they had no idea going in how Friday’s momentous vote would play out.

Pelosi (D-Calif.) had been mum on both bills bill, which created an opening for liberal opposition to TAA to swell. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said he planned to vote for TAA, but didn’t signal his position on the larger fast-track bill. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the assistant Democratic leader, was undecided.

House Republican leaders needed a large number of Democrats to vote for TAA in order for it to pass.

“I think Republicans are going to provide a share of their votes based upon what Republicans have done in the past, and it’s up to the Democrat leadership and the president to get Democrats on board,” Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) said on Thursday. He, along with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), led the pro-trade whip operation.

Democrats have traditionally backed TAA, with its focus on helping struggling unemployed workers. But Democrats complained to White House officials this week that the TAA package was too small, and argued the president should be leaning on Republicans to enlarge it.

But many Democrats came to view the jobs assistance bill as a way to sink the entire trade package.

Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Sandy Levin (Mich.), the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, led the push for Democrats to vote against TAA. And they were joined, in the end, by Pelosi.

Defeating the jobs aid bill, the Democratic leader said minutes before the vote, “is the only way we will be able to slow down fast track.”",www.politico.com,left,o3uOmk5vIDyooMFK

The trade war between the U.S. and China will hit Apple Inc. this weekend, dragging the largest U.S. technology company into a fracas that threatens to raise prices on popular consumer gadgets and undermine a giant but delicate global supply chain.

President Donald Trump’s 15% China tariffs were entered into the Federal Register on Friday, making the move official. At 12.01 a.m. local time on Sunday in Washington, the levies will kick in for hundreds of products entering the U.S. or being withdrawn from warehouses for consumption in the U.S., according to the order.

One veteran analyst was holding out hope for a last-minute reprieve.

“The U.S. adding tariffs to any Apple product without some type of corresponding offset to mitigate the negative effects crosses the Rubicon on many dimensions,” Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, wrote in a note on Friday. “We believe the U.S. does not want to be the first to add tariffs to Apple, given Apple is arguably the leading U.S. company and the face of American business in China. The optics of a U.S. protectionist first approach penalizing a U.S. global leading company while China doesn’t penalize Apple would seem to surrender the moral high ground.”

Any reprieve for Apple looked unlikely on Friday as Trump showed little sign of backing down and blamed U.S. companies for their inability to deal with a trade policy he said was aimed at reining in “unfair players.” Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Here’s a list of Apple products that will be hit by 15% tariffs starting this weekend:

Apple Watch and Watch bands

AirPods

HomePod

Some Beats headphones

IMac computers

Repair parts for iPhones may also be hit

Nand flash, a key storage component for iPhones, could also be affected

The iPhone, which contributes more than half of Apple’s revenue, won’t face this 15% tariff until Dec. 15. But the other hardware products made up at least 10% of sales in the company’s 2018 fiscal year, and many of these will have to absorb the 15% import levy that kicks in on Sunday.

It’s unclear if Apple will raise product prices or assume the cost of the tariffs. The company, one of the world’s most profitable, maintains higher margins than most other consumer hardware makers.

A 15% tariff on Apple wearable gadgets sold in the U.S. would likely reduce earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents a share per year, Munster estimated on Friday. Analysts, on average, estimate Apple’s adjusted profit will be $11.63 a share in the 2019 fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Biden’s change in position is just his latest concession to the special interests and unions that dominate the Democratic primaries. He once voted for normal trade relations in China, NAFTA, and pushed for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but no longer.

Nor is it just the TPP that Democrats oppose. Like Trump, most of the major Democrats oppose NAFTA. But, with the exception of Beto O’Rourke, they also oppose Trump’s renegotiation of NAFTA (renamed the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, or USMCA).

Earlier Thursday , Trump tweeted that he expected a deal soon between Saudis and Russians to sharply reduce their exports . That sent Brent crude prices surging as much as 45 percent , though the rally soon weakened . U.S. prices were trading up more than 25 percent near $ 25 a barrel by mid-afternoon .
“ Just spoke to my friend MBS ( Crown Prince ) of Saudi Arabia , who spoke with President Putin of Russia , & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels , and maybe substantially more which , if it happens , will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry ! “ Trump tweeted . `` ..... Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels . Good ( GREAT ) news for everyone ! '' he tweeted minutes later .
But it quickly became clear that Trump ’ s tweet may have been aspirational . Saudi Arabia in its own statement was more circumspect , only saying it sought a meeting of OPEC and other oil producing countries to discuss “ a desired balance to the oil market . ”
Other sources said despite Trump 's statement , they hadn ’ t yet heard much about how the administration intended to press the two countries to reduce their oil output .
“ The conversations are not aggressive , ” said one industry official who was recently briefed by administration officials . “ We don ’ t have a plan to force their hand in any way . This is serious enough that they want to have an agreement with the Saudis , but don ’ t expect them to hammer out a deal . ”
Industry sources said they did not expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to put aside their differences right away , however . Even if the two countries agree to cut their output , oil prices , brought low by the coronavirus pandemic ’ s throttling of travel and fuel demand are n't likely to rise enough to save U.S. shale producers , said Andy Lipow , head of oil consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates .
“ Even if oil prices rally $ 5 to $ 10 a barrel from this morning , it ’ s not enough to put most shale oil producers back in the black , ” Lipow said . “ And one has to wonder what Trump promised in order to cut production . What ’ s the trade ? ”
Multiple sources said they thought the White House might offer some concessions on Venezuelan policy to bring Russia to the table . The administration has levied sanctions against companies trading in Venezuelan crude , which had included subsidiaries of Russia ’ s state-owned oil firm Rosneft . The Treasury Department also has sanctions against companies financing Venezuela ’ s state-owned oil producer Petróleos de Venezuela , S.A .
Rosneft recently sold its share of oil operations in Venezuela to the Russian government . Industry analysts viewed that as as step toward distancing itself from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , whom the White House has been pressuring to give up power .
“ It 's probable Venezuela comes up in the conversation [ with OPEC and Russia ] , now that Rosneft has been protected , ” said one industry official . “ God knows what the policy result will be . [ It would be ] Trump 's jihad against Maduro versus his alliance of convenience with the independent shale producers. “
Trump 's tweet came as the Department of Energy and Interior Department prepared to send him a menu of options the administration could take to provide relief to the domestic oil industry ahead of a Friday meeting with energy CEOs , according to industry officials briefed on the issue .
The list of options for Trump are expected to contain measures that Republican lawmakers recommended to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt this week , including suspending royalty payments for oil produced on federal lands and the extension of federal lease terms . It may also include suspending the Jones Act , which prevents ships that are foreign-owned , -flagged or -crewed from transporting products between U.S. ports .
A group of small and mid-sized companies have been asking the Interior Department to present those options to Trump , one energy industry executive said .
The White House meeting on Friday will include Harold Hamm , a Trump donor and the founder of oil producer Continental Resources , who has accused the Saudis of `` dumping '' oil on the market and has called for import restrictions . But also attending the meeting are the chief executives from Exxon Mobil , Chevron and other large multinational companies that have been arguing that no direct relief to the oil industry is needed .
A White House spokesperson declined to comment . An Interior Department spokesperson did not reply to questions .
One industry official described the options being considered as “ minor odds and ends ” that did not solve the main problems leading to the current market woes .
Data released by the federal Energy Information Administration this week showed gasoline demand in the U.S. plummeting and oil inventories surging , evidence that the measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic had sharply hit energy consumption .
On Monday , Whiting Petroleum became the first major U.S. casualty of the price drop , when the company , which is a major producer in the Bakken shale in North Dakota , filed for bankruptcy protection .
While most of the U.S. shale oil production is on private land and would not be affected by any royalty relief or lease extension , nearly two million barrels per day of U.S. oil comes from offshore fields that are leased from the federal government . Those offshore producers , particularly the smaller and medium-sized firms , are especially vulnerable during the market downturn , said one of the industry officials , who feared the large oil companies attending Friday 's White House meeting may not take their issues into account .
“ It is likely that the one thing that can save the offshore independent companies is royalty relief and it will likely not be raised by the current participants , ” the person said . “ Our concern is the president makes a decision based on this meeting and thinks he saved the oil and gas industry and moves on to dealing with the coronavirus and the myriad of other crises he is dealing with . ”
Meanwhile , Republican senators from energy states have continued to pressure the administration to aid the industry . Senate Energy Chairman Lisa Murkowski ( R-Alaska ) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking to ensure federal assistance is available to U.S. oil and gas companies during implementation of coronavirus relief legislation .
“ It is important that the CARES Act be implemented in a way that provides critically needed liquidity and financing to American businesses , including the oil and gas producing companies that form the backbone of our national and energy security , ” Murkowski wrote .
Three senior House Republicans — Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , Mac Thornberry of Texas and Greg Walden of Oregon — urged Pompeo in a letter to exert “ appropriate diplomatic pressure to prevent the actions of these foreign nations from inflicting unnecessary damage on economies around the world . ”","A White House spokesperson referred questions to the National Security Council, which declined to comment.

Earlier Thursday, Trump tweeted that he expected a deal soon between Saudis and Russians to sharply reduce their exports. That sent Brent crude prices surging as much as 45 percent, though the rally soon weakened. U.S. prices were trading up more than 25 percent near $25 a barrel by mid-afternoon.

“Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!“ Trump tweeted. "".....Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels. Good (GREAT) news for everyone!"" he tweeted minutes later.

But it quickly became clear that Trump’s tweet may have been aspirational. Saudi Arabia in its own statement was more circumspect, only saying it sought a meeting of OPEC and other oil producing countries to discuss “a desired balance to the oil market.”

Other sources said despite Trump's statement, they hadn’t yet heard much about how the administration intended to press the two countries to reduce their oil output.

“The conversations are not aggressive,” said one industry official who was recently briefed by administration officials. “We don’t have a plan to force their hand in any way. This is serious enough that they want to have an agreement with the Saudis, but don’t expect them to hammer out a deal.”

Industry sources said they did not expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to put aside their differences right away, however. Even if the two countries agree to cut their output, oil prices, brought low by the coronavirus pandemic’s throttling of travel and fuel demand aren't likely to rise enough to save U.S. shale producers, said Andy Lipow, head of oil consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.

“Even if oil prices rally $5 to $10 a barrel from this morning, it’s not enough to put most shale oil producers back in the black,” Lipow said. “And one has to wonder what Trump promised in order to cut production. What’s the trade?”

Multiple sources said they thought the White House might offer some concessions on Venezuelan policy to bring Russia to the table. The administration has levied sanctions against companies trading in Venezuelan crude, which had included subsidiaries of Russia’s state-owned oil firm Rosneft. The Treasury Department also has sanctions against companies financing Venezuela’s state-owned oil producer Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.

Rosneft recently sold its share of oil operations in Venezuela to the Russian government. Industry analysts viewed that as as step toward distancing itself from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the White House has been pressuring to give up power.

“It's probable Venezuela comes up in the conversation [with OPEC and Russia], now that Rosneft has been protected,” said one industry official. “God knows what the policy result will be.

Tom Cotton said Friday that he voted to give President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate foreign trade deals because it would increase exports from both the United States and his home state and would `` ensure that the president 's trade negotiations occur in a transparent manner . `` `` Trade promotion authority is a valuable economic tool , but it is important for Congress to retain oversight of the administration 's negotiations , '' the first-term Republican said . `` This legislation allows for both . `` Most importantly , it ensures that products produced or grown in Arkansas have increased access to world markets , '' Cotton said.But Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions slammed the bill because it would further destroy U.S. jobs and lacks strong provisions to hold foreign companies accountable for violating international trade law . `` Stubbornly , our political elites have treated trade as a matter of religion , '' Sessions said . `` To them , there is no such thing as a bad deal . They know American workers lose jobs when we allow trading partners to cheat . But they insist it is all for the greater good . `` We have allowed state-dominated and mercantilist trading partners to maintain their varied and elaborate non-tariff barriers , exporting their unemployment to our shores . `` This is why the American worker keeps ending up on the losing end , '' Sessions said.These differences among the two Republican senators illustrate the tense debate over two weeks surrounding the trade authority legislation that the Senate passed 62-37 late Friday as the chamber neared the start of its Memorial Day recess.The vote cleared the way for a highly unpredictable summer showdown in the House . The lower chamber has not yet debated the bill.The legislation would allow President Barack Obama to complete trade deals that Congress could approve or reject but not change . The White House would have to publish details of any agreement at least 60 days before any congressional vote.Obama is seeking to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) agreement with Japan and 10 other Pacific nations — and the legislation , known as Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) , was considered critical to his second-term agenda . Forty-eight Republicans joined Cotton in supporting the legislation . They included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sens . Orrin Hatch of Utah , John McCain of Arizona , Chuck Grassley of Iowa , and Tim Scott of South Carolina . `` This has been a long time coming , '' Hatch said as the bill headed to a final vote . The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , he co-sponsored the bill with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon . `` I 've been working on this bill for the past four years . `` This is an important bill , '' Hatch added . `` It shows that when the president 's right , we will support him . `` Two announced GOP presidential candidates supported the bill : Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio . Another declared candidate , Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , opposed the legislation.Other Republicans siding against the bill were Sens . Susan Collins of Maine , Mike Lee of Utah , and Richard Shelby of Alabama . GOP Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming did not vote.Only 14 of 44 Democrats backed the bill — and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led the charge , openly warring with the White House and exposing raw wounds between her and Obama.They also argued that the bill would send jobs overseas and does not address minimum-wage issues or guard against foreign sweatshops.To mollify Democrats , however , the legislation included $ 1.8 billion in retraining funds for U.S. workers who lose their jobs because of exports . Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake argued that the funds duplicated other federal efforts , but his attempt to strip out the funds was defeated , 53-35.In addition , an amendment that would have punished countries for manipulating their currency failed narrowly , 51-48 , several hours before the bill cleared.Republican Sen . Rob Portman of Ohio , who backed the trade bill , and Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow , who opposed it , had proposed the amendment.They sought to make allegations of currency manipulation subject to the same `` dispute settlement procedures '' as other obligations under any trade deal.Before leaving for the holiday recess , the Senate was also expected to vote early Saturday on whether to renew the Patriot Act , which was signed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and authorized the National Security Agency 's controversial metadata collection programs.The Senate trade bill must be debated by the House , where many conservative Republicans and Democrats are expected to oppose it for many of the same reasons as those in the upper chamber.Still , House Speaker John Boehner praised the Senate for its work . `` Trade helps create good-paying American jobs , so it 's good news that the Senate has put us one step closer to eliminating trade barriers , '' he said . `` These reforms have the support of farmers , manufacturers , small-business owners , and Americans from all walks of life , and it ’ s not hard to figure out why .

''","Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Friday that he voted to give President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate foreign trade deals because it would increase exports from both the United States and his home state and would ""ensure that the president's trade negotiations occur in a transparent manner.""""Trade promotion authority is a valuable economic tool, but it is important for Congress to retain oversight of the administration's negotiations,"" the first-term Republican said. ""This legislation allows for both.""Most importantly, it ensures that products produced or grown in Arkansas have increased access to world markets,"" Cotton said.But Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions slammed the bill because it would further destroy U.S. jobs and lacks strong provisions to hold foreign companies accountable for violating international trade law.""Stubbornly, our political elites have treated trade as a matter of religion,"" Sessions said. ""To them, there is no such thing as a bad deal. They know American workers lose jobs when we allow trading partners to cheat. But they insist it is all for the greater good.""We have allowed state-dominated and mercantilist trading partners to maintain their varied and elaborate non-tariff barriers, exporting their unemployment to our shores.""This is why the American worker keeps ending up on the losing end,"" Sessions said.These differences among the two Republican senators illustrate the tense debate over two weeks surrounding the trade authority legislation that the Senate passed 62-37 late Friday as the chamber neared the start of its Memorial Day recess.The vote cleared the way for a highly unpredictable summer showdown in the House. The lower chamber has not yet debated the bill.The legislation would allow President Barack Obama to complete trade deals that Congress could approve or reject but not change. The White House would have to publish details of any agreement at least 60 days before any congressional vote.Obama is seeking to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with Japan and 10 other Pacific nations — and the legislation, known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), was considered critical to his second-term agenda. Forty-eight Republicans joined Cotton in supporting the legislation. They included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, John McCain of Arizona, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and Tim Scott of South Carolina.""This has been a long time coming,"" Hatch said as the bill headed to a final vote. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he co-sponsored the bill with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. ""I've been working on this bill for the past four years.""This is an important bill,"" Hatch added. ""It shows that when the president's right, we will support him.""Two announced GOP presidential candidates supported the bill: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Another declared candidate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, opposed the legislation.Other Republicans siding against the bill were Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mike Lee of Utah, and Richard Shelby of Alabama. GOP Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming did not vote.Only 14 of 44 Democrats backed the bill — and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led the charge, openly warring with the White House and exposing raw wounds between her and Obama.They also argued that the bill would send jobs overseas and does not address minimum-wage issues or guard against foreign sweatshops.To mollify Democrats, however, the legislation included $1.8 billion in retraining funds for U.S. workers who lose their jobs because of exports. Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake argued that the funds duplicated other federal efforts, but his attempt to strip out the funds was defeated, 53-35.In addition, an amendment that would have punished countries for manipulating their currency failed narrowly, 51-48, several hours before the bill cleared.Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who backed the trade bill, and Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who opposed it, had proposed the amendment.They sought to make allegations of currency manipulation subject to the same ""dispute settlement procedures"" as other obligations under any trade deal.Before leaving for the holiday recess, the Senate was also expected to vote early Saturday on whether to renew the Patriot Act, which was signed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and authorized the National Security Agency's controversial metadata collection programs.The Senate trade bill must be debated by the House, where many conservative Republicans and Democrats are expected to oppose it for many of the same reasons as those in the upper chamber.Still, House Speaker John Boehner praised the Senate for its work.""Trade helps create good-paying American jobs, so it's good news that the Senate has put us one step closer to eliminating trade barriers,"" he said. ""These reforms have the support of farmers, manufacturers, small-business owners, and Americans from all walks of life, and it’s not hard to figure out why. It is a no-brainer.""The House will take up this measure, and Republicans will do our part, but ultimately success will require Democrats putting politics aside and doing what's best for the country,"" Boehner said. ""Let's seize this opportunity to open new doors for the things Americans make and the people who make them.""McConnell said the vote proved that ""Republicans and Democrats can stand strong, together, for the middle class.

trade,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2015/05/12/the_10_biggest_lies_youve_been_told_about_the_trans_pacific_partnership/,The 10 biggest lies you've been told about the Trans-Pacific Partnership,2015-05-12,,"Today , the Senate makes a critical test vote on the Obama Administration ’ s trade agenda , kicking off a process that the White House hopes to end with the signing of an agreement between 12 nations called the Trans-Pacific Partnership . In preparation for this vote , President Obama has been deliberately antagonizing his critics , mostly liberal Democrats . Senator Elizabeth Warren is “ a politician , like everybody else , ” Obama said Friday to Yahoo News , who has `` got a voice that she wants to get out there , ” framing her concerns as insincere self-aggrandizement . Those concerns , Obama added , are “ absolutely wrong . ''
This is not the first time that Obama and his aides have depicted opposition on trade as deliberate misinformation designed to stir up a left-leaning political base , or generate campaign contributions ; my favorite is the claim that Warren is merely trying to energize a non-existent Presidential campaign .
It ’ s beneath the dignity of the Presidency to so aggressively paint opponents as not just wrong on the facts , but hiding the truth on purpose . Warren has responded without using the same indecorous tactics . Unfortunately , I don ’ t have the same self-control . So by way of response , here are ten moments where the President or his subordinates have lied – call it `` misled '' or `` offered half-truths '' or whatever ; but I ’ m in an ornery mood so let ’ s just say lied – about his trade agenda :
1 . 40 PERCENT : The President and his team have repeatedly described TPP as a deal involving nearly 40 percent of global GDP . This tells only part of the story . First of all , the U.S. by itself represents 22 percent of global GDP ; a bill naming a post office would involve that much . Second , we already have free trade agreements with six TPP partners – Canada , Mexico , Australia , Singapore , Chile and Peru – and between them and us , that ’ s 80 percent of the total GDP in this deal . The vast majority of the rest is represented by Japan , where the average applied tariff is a skinny 1.2 percent , per the World Bank .
You can see this paragraph in graphic form here . The point is that saying TPP is about “ 40 percent of GDP ” intimates that it would massively change the ability to export without tariffs . In reality it would have virtually no significance in opening new markets . To the extent that there ’ s a barrier in global trade today , it comes from currency manipulation by countries wanting to keep their exports cheap . The TPP has no currency provisions .
2 . JOB CREATION : Saying , as the White House has , that the deal would support “ an additional 650,000 jobs ” is not true . This figure came from a hypothetical calculation of a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics , which the Institute itself said was an incorrect way to use their data . “ We don ’ t believe that trade agreements change the labor force in the long run , ” said Peter Petri , author of the report , in a fact check of the claim .
The deal is actually more about building up barriers than taking them down . Much of TPP is devoted to increasing copyright and patent protections for prescription drugs and Hollywood media content . As economist Dean Baker notes , this is protectionist , and will raise prices for drugs , movies and music here and abroad .
3 . EXPORTS ONLY : The Administration constantly discusses trade as solely a question of U.S. exports . A recent Council of Economic Advisors report touts : Exporters pay higher wages , and export industry growth translates into higher average earnings . But the Economic Policy Institute points out that this ignores imports , and therefore the ballooning trade deficit , which weighs down economic growth and wages . Talking about trade without discussing both imports and exports is like relaying the score of a ballgame by saying “ Dodgers 4. ” It is literally a half-truth . Recent trade deals have in fact increased the trade deficit , such as the agreement with South Korea . Senator Sherrod Brown notes that the deal has only increased exports by $ 1 billion since 2011 , while increasing imports by $ 12 billion , costing America 75,000 jobs .
4 . MOST PROGRESSIVE : Obama has called TPP “ the most progressive trade deal in history. ” First of all , so did Bill Clinton and Al Gore , when talking about NAFTA in 1993 . Second , there ’ s reason to believe TPP doesn ’ t even clear a low bar for progressive trade deals . The Sierra Club , based on a leaked TPP environmental chapter , said that the deal is weaker than the landmark “ May 10 agreement ” for deals with Peru , Panama and Colombia , struck in 2007 . Key Democrats who devised labor and environmental standards for those agreements , like Rep. Sander Levin , believe that TPP falls short . Even if the chapters were up to par , consistent lack of enforcement of the rules makes them ineffective . The U.S. Trade Representative has actually claimed the Colombia free trade agreement is positive because only one trade unionist in the country is being murdered every other week . Labor groups can only ask the White House to enforce labor rights violations , and for the past several years , the Administration simply hasn ’ t . So when Obama says violators of TPP will face “ meaningful consequences , ” based on the Administration ’ s prior enforcement , he ’ s lying .
5 . CHANGING LAWS : On the controversial topic of Investor-State Dispute Settlement ( ISDS ) , where corporations can sue sovereign governments for monetary damages for violating trade agreements that hurt the company ’ s “ expected future profits , ” the White House has engaged in a shell game . They say , “ No trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws. ” But the point of a corporation suing the United States or any trade partner is to put enough financial pressure on a government to force them to alter the law themselves . So ISDS doesn ’ t “ cause ” a change in law only in the narrowest sense . Even third-party countries have curtailed regulations in reaction to ISDS rulings , as New Zealand did with their cigarette packaging law , awaiting the outcome of a dispute between the tobacco industry and Australia ( a suit that continues despite an initial victory for Australia ) .
6 . NEVER LOST : The White House assumes that the only thing America cares about with ISDS is the upsetting of our own laws . So they ’ ve stressed that the U.S. has never lost an ISDS case . This is irrelevant . What ISDS does is offer bailout insurance policy to multinational corporations . If they run into discrimination or regulatory squeezing by a foreign government , they can use an extra-judicial process to recoup their investment . Workers screwed over by trade agreements have no ability to sue governments ; only corporations get this privilege .
The United States attracts businesses through our relative rule of law . When that insurance is granted to countries like Vietnam and Malaysia , it weakens our competitive advantage , and makes it simple for countries to outsource their operations . Their investment is protected , as is their ability to exploit cheap labor . This makes it impossible for America to compete .
7 . WEAKENING DODD-FRANK : Obama reacted strongly to Senator Warren ’ s charge that a future President could overturn financial regulations or other rules through trade deals . “ I ’ d have to be pretty stupid , ” Obama told Yahoo News , to “ sign a provision that would unravel ” signature achievements like Dodd-Frank . I suppose he is , then , because modern trade agreements often seek to “ harmonize ” regulations , effectively setting a regulatory ceiling . This harmonization could , as Warren says , “ punch holes in Dodd-Frank without directly repealing it , ” by forcing regulators to roll back capital or leverage requirements .
European negotiators want a trade agreement with the U.S. called the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) to include a chapter “ harmonizing ” financial regulations . So far the Obama Administration has rejected this , while admitting the potential for regulatory harm . Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told Congress in December 2013 , “ Normally in a trade agreement , the pressure is to lower standards ” on regulations , “ and that ’ s something that we just think is not acceptable. ” A future President might find it acceptable , and today ’ s vote on “ fast-track ” authority would give trade deals an expedited process , with no amendments or filibusters by Congress , for six years , outlasting the current Administration . Scott Walker or Jeb Bush may decide it ’ s perfectly appropriate to undermine regulations in trade deals .
8 . STOPPING CHINA : President Obama frequently casts TPP as a way to “ contain ” China . “ If we don ’ t write the rules for trade around the world , guess what , China will , ” he said on Friday . This is so facile as to be totally meaningless . China is a major Pacific Rim economy , and will have a presence regardless of our actions . As former Clinton Defense Department official Chas Freeman writes , “ China has been and will remain an inseparable part of China ’ s success story. ” Plus , as I ’ ve written in ███ , weak “ rule of origin ” guidelines could allow China to import goods into TPP member countries without any tariffs , while freed from following any TPP regulations .
9 . SECRET DEAL : Obama has angrily dismissed the notion that TPP is a “ secret ” deal , saying that everyone will have public access to the TPP text for at least 60 days before a final vote . This is not the point opponents are making . The vote on fast track would severely limit Congressional input into the deal . And right now , members of Congress can only see the text in a secure room , without being able to bring staffers or take notes , or even talk about specifics in public . That makes the deal effectively secret during the fast track vote . “ The president has only committed to letting the public see this deal after Congress votes to authorize fast track , ” Warren told Greg Sargent . The President wants to filibuster-proof the bill in secret , then employ pretend transparency on TPP after that .
10 . JUST A POLITICIAN : This idea from Obama that everybody opposing fast-track is acting like a mere “ politician , ” aside from demonizing the concept of representing constituents , neglects the fact that he ’ s a politician too . His interest in building a legacy , when practically nothing else has the potential to pass Congress the next two years , is a political interest . His possible interest in rewarding campaign contributors who would benefit from TPP is also political , or his desire to earn the respect of the Very Serious People who always support trade deals . Since Obama has a large platform and will not publicly debate any opponent on trade , he can float above it all , acting like a principled soul only wanting to better the country rather than a transactional ward heeler . This may be the biggest lie , that Obama ’ s somehow superior to everyone else in this debate .","Today, the Senate makes a critical test vote on the Obama Administration’s trade agenda, kicking off a process that the White House hopes to end with the signing of an agreement between 12 nations called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

More from the U.S. on the scheduled January talks

The newly announced measures are a response to the “appropriate U.S. concerns,” he said, using the term in the Chinese truce statement which referred to some of the issues the U.S. has raised.

China’s flurry of policy announcements since the Argentina meeting between Trump and Xi happened despite Canada’s arrest of a top Huawei Technologies executive at the U.S.’s request, and despite Xi delivering a defiant speech declaring China wouldn’t be dictated to by anybody. China underscored its determination to implement the agreement by including it as a key goal in an important annual policy statement published last week.

Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish will lead the Trump administration’s team heading to Beijing in the week of Jan. 7, people familiar told Bloomberg News on Wednesday. The group will also include Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs David Malpass, the people said.

Talks Confirmed

Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng confirmed in a regular briefing Thursday in Beijing that the two sides planned to sit down for talks next month. Gao provided no date and said both countries continue to maintain close communication.

News of the talks was followed by a potential source of renewed strain: a Reuters report saying Trump might declare a national emergency next month that would ban U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by Huawei and ZTE Corp. Asked about the report Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said a “certain country” needed to address cybersecurity concerns with facts and stop politicizing national security issues.

China is eager to seal a deal while at the same time is intent on preserving its economic system, said Jonathan Fenby, chairman of China research at TS Lombard in London. It aims to give Trump enough to be able to claim victory by March, enabling it to get on with the business of modernizing its economy, he said.

Tariffs on Hold

Trump has agreed to put on hold a scheduled increase in tariffs on $200 billion in annual imports from China while the negotiations take place. He is pushing the Asian nation to reduce trade barriers and stop the alleged theft of intellectual property. The delay in tariffs is through the start of March. In response, China temporarily lowered tariffs on U.S. car imports for the same period.

China’s significant recent efforts to unveil policies that address Trump’s concerns have been underappreciated in the U.S., said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to the State Council, or cabinet. China has shown it wants to make a deal, but it can’t meet all the U.S.’s demands, he said.

After the recent U.S. stock market’s plunge, the U.S. should quit the trade row “while it’s still ahead,” said Wang, founder of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank.

But there’s still skepticism about the prospects for an agreement. China thought it had a deal in May, only for Trump to back out, and some in Beijing warn the same could happen again.

If there is an agreement, it would just be a framework deal, according to Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation affiliated with the Ministry of Commerce.

Obama’s comments came during his visit to Nike headquarters in Portland where he is promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership being negotiated between 12 countries.

Warren has argued that a bill giving Obama “fast-track” authority to approve the trade pact would “give Republicans the very tool they need to dismantle Dodd-Frank,” the 2010 law passed in the wake of the financial crisis and a signature accomplishment of the Obama administration.

The president didn’t hide his irritation at Warren’s comments, stating, “the notion that I had this massive fight with Wall Street to make sure we don’t have what happened in 2007 and 2008, and then I sign a provision to unravel it? I’d have to be pretty stupid.”

Obama said Warren’s arguments were not based on substantive evidence. “This is pure speculation,” he said. The bill has drawn ire from both congressional Republicans and Democrats.

In a further jab at Warren, Obama suggested she was playing politics with the issue. Warren is being urged to run for president in 2016 by many in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. So far, she has declined.

Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, hasn’t taken a concrete position on the trade negotiations. Asked her stance by an MSNBC reporter, she replied, “Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security, and we have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive.”

The White House is under the impression that Clinton supports the trade deal.

Warren, meanwhile, has staked out firmer ground on the trade negotiations that would allow her to attack Clinton from the left, should she choose to run.

In Portland, Obama also acknowledged criticism from within the party’s progressives, but said some of his closest friends are “wrong.”

“I’ve run my last election, and the only reason I do something is because I think it’s good for the American workers and the American people and the American economy,” Obama said.",www.politico.com,left,Si99vBD5kNa32Wl2

trade,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/steve-hilton-trump-proves-that-tariffs-work-here-are-the-lessons-we-should-learn,OPINION: Steve Hilton: Trump proves that tariffs work. Here are the lessons we should learn,,Steve Hilton,"Last week we saw proof that tariffs work . President Trump threatened tariffs on Mexico . Their leaders came to negoitiate , and we got concrete results .
Even the Wall Street Journal , whose generally indispensable and brilliant editorial pages regularly rail against tariffs , recognized the president 's achievement , writing the following :
`` In the course of a week , Mr. Trump managed to get Mexico to agree to two things that months ago would have seemed unlikely : Militarizing Mexico ’ s crackdown on migrants by deploying National Guard troops and expanding the ‘ remain in Mexico ’ plan for asylum seekers . ''
The anatomy of this latest tariff dispute tells us a lot about policy , our politics and government . We should learn the lessons . Everyone agrees we have a crisis at the southern border . Two weeks ago , 1,000 illegal immigrants literally just walked into the country , in El Paso , Texas . Our immigration system is not just broken ; for all practical purposes , it does n't exist .
But there is one person , it seems , who is actually trying to fix it : President Trump . That 's why he resorted to his tariff threat . It was a new approach , so of course , the establishment lost their minds . And the Republican establishment hated it , too .
The response was knee-jerk , ideological … dogmatic . So here 's the first lesson : The establishment politicians and media should be more open-minded . Give new ideas and new approaches a chance .
Instead , the way they were talking , tariffs on Mexico would be the end of our economy . They let ideology get in the way of the facts . Even though Mexico is our biggest trading partner , it 's still a tiny part of our economy . Imports from Mexico make up just 1.8 percent of our economy . And exports to Mexico are only 1.4 percent .
It 's like the critics did n't even look at it as a practical policy question . For them it was an article of faith -- tariffs are bad . It was the same thing with all the nodding dogs on TV , spouting the same line about American consumers . “ Tariffs are a tax. ” “ It will overwhelm the consumer . ”
But hang on a second . President Trump has been introducing tariffs for over two years now , going back to April 2017 when tariffs on lumber imports from Canada went up to 24 percent . We 've had tariffs on China and Canada on products , ranging from steel and aluminum to toothbrushes and washing machines .
And what 's happened to prices in that time ? We do n't have to guess , we have an actual measure . It 's called inflation .
The average inflation rate for 2016 was 2.1 percent . 2017 was 2.1 percent ; 2018 2.4 percent ; and 2019 so far , 1.75 percent . It 's actually going down .
Companies do n't just sit there and take it when tariffs are imposed , they respond . One person at least seems to get this :
“ The people are n't going to have to worry about paying the tax because the companies are going to move back into the United States . There wo n't be any tariff , ” Trump said .
He 's right . Companies are moving away from countries hit by the Trump tariffs . Especially China – and in a big way . A recent survey by Bain & Company showed that 25 percent of corporate executives who do business in China will be redirecting their investments out of the area , and 42 percent of them are expecting to source their raw materials from someplace else .
Some of the companies leaving China include Varex Imaging , Universal Electronics , and GoPro . And the CEO of ControlTek , a company that used to have a lot of business in China , recently said , “ We 'll design China out . ''
Just think about that for a moment . There is a massive policy lesson here . For decades the establishment looked on impotently as American manufacturing went to China . President trump comes in , imposes tariffs , and you see an immediate private sector response : “ We 'll design China out . ''
Trump 's tariffs , derided by the snooty know-alls in the establishment , are turning out to be the most consequential - and positive - economic policy mechanism we 've seen in decades . And it 's not just companies moving out of China . We 're seeing them move back to America , just as the president said . Toy giant Hasbro is the latest example .
Another thing establishment geniuses say is you should n't muddle up trade policy with immigration policy . Sen. Chuck Grassley said , “ Trade policy and border security are separate issues . This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent . ''
Another Republican , Sen. James Lankford , was reported as saying that the administration `` is trying to use tariffs to solve every problem but HIV and climate change . ''
But why not ? As Deng Xiaoping said , “ Who cares if the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice ? ” And as we 've seen with the Mexico tariffs , it did . Very quickly .
President Trump 's use of tariffs is an example of creative , entrepreneurial and above all , successful policy making . This was the whole point of Trump -- to do things differently . To stand up to all the useless bureaucrats and naysayers bogged down in the status quo .
I can imagine the meetings on this that the president has had the last few months . I 've been in those policy meetings . Oh , you ca n't do that , Mr. President , you 'll upset the Chinese . They hate losing face . Oh , Mr. President , if you do that we 'll get pushback . Let 's just give the officials a bit more time to work something out , Mr. President .
Talk about Nervous Nancy Pelosi . The entire government machine is stuffed full of Nervous Nancys . Usually , the politicians give in . I 've seen it , over and over again . That 's why nothing happens .
But Trump is different . Imagine him in those meetings . I 've had enough of all your negative crap . I want action . I want accountability . I want results . Yes ! That 's what Americans voted for .
The establishment idiots who condemn him for it care about style , not substance . As long as you behave the right way , say the right things , do it the way it 's always been done , they think you 're great , regardless of your actual results . That 's why they all loved Obama . He went along with it . He behaved the way the establishment expects .
Trump does n't . That does n't make him bad ; it makes him good . It 's the status quo that 's bad . The establishment is obsessed with Trump and his tweets , but he 's obsessed with you and your life .
The final big lesson of this week is , of course , what 's not happening . The president should n't be having to pressure Mexico the way he did . It should be our own government , not a foreign government , that fixes our immigration crisis .
President Trump 's use of tariffs is an example of creative , entrepreneurial and above all , successful policy making . This was the whole point of Trump -- to do things differently . To stand up to all the useless bureaucrats and naysayers bogged down in the status quo .
And here we turn to the Democrats . Is n't it sickening to see them on their high horse about the moral stain of Trump 's border policy ? Nancy Pelosi has said , “ A wall is an immorality . It 's not who we are as a nation . ”
Not who we are ? Well , who are you then , Nancy ? You 're actually the one standing in the way of the changes that would help prevent the exact things you complain about .
Let border officials detain families for over 20 days . Let children claim asylum in their home country and then be reunited with their families if they 're already here . Change the asylum threshold from a credible fear to the likelihood of actually getting asylum . None of this even has anything to do with the wall that you say you hate - though of course , we need that , too .
The Democrats are blocking common-sense immigration reform purely to score political points . It 's you , Nancy Pelosi , who 's exploiting desperate migrants for political gain . The young girls assaulted on their dangerous journey . The families that are separated because of our broken system .
It 's on you , Nancy , not the evil Trump , but you . You are the person who is actually standing in the way of solving this problem .

President Trump's use of tariffs is an example of creative, entrepreneurial and above all, successful policy making. This was the whole point of Trump -- to do things differently. To stand up to all the useless bureaucrats and naysayers bogged down in the status quo.

I can imagine the meetings on this that the president has had the last few months. I've been in those policy meetings. Oh, you can't do that, Mr. President, you'll upset the Chinese. They hate losing face. Oh, Mr. President, if you do that we'll get pushback. Let's just give the officials a bit more time to work something out, Mr. President.

He went along with it. He behaved the way the establishment expects.

Trump doesn't. That doesn't make him bad; it makes him good. It's the status quo that's bad. The establishment is obsessed with Trump and his tweets, but he's obsessed with you and your life.

The final big lesson of this week is, of course, what's not happening. The president shouldn't be having to pressure Mexico the way he did. It should be our own government, not a foreign government, that fixes our immigration crisis.

President Trump's use of tariffs is an example of creative, entrepreneurial and above all, successful policy making. This was the whole point of Trump -- to do things differently. To stand up to all the useless bureaucrats and naysayers bogged down in the status quo.

Trump himself has begun to lower expectations , saying he ’ s in no rush , and his top allies are warning the next phase might not conclude until after November ’ s presidential election .

The US said a 25 % tax on steel and 10 % tax on aluminium from the EU , Mexico and Canada will start at midnight .
The move immediately triggered vows of retaliation from Mexico , Canada and the EU , which called the tariffs `` protectionism , pure and simple '' .
The UK said it was `` deeply disappointed '' by the US decision , which followed weeks of negotiations .
The tariffs will hit products such as plated steel , slabs , coil , rolls of aluminium , and tubes , raw materials which are used extensively across US manufacturing , construction , and the oil industry .
EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said it was a `` bad day for world trade '' , while European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the move was `` totally unacceptable '' .
The EU has `` no choice '' but to bring a case before the World Trade Organization and impose duties on US imports , he added .
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the tariffs were an `` affront '' to the longstanding relationship between Canada and the US , especially to the `` thousands of Canadian soldiers who fought and died alongside their American comrades-in-arms '' in Afghanistan .
He said Canada plans to levy tariffs on American products worth about $ 13bn starting 1 July . It is also planning a challenge at the World Trade Organization .
He said : `` We have to believe that at some point common sense will prevail but we see no sign of that in this [ US ] action today . ''
Canada said it would put 25 % tariffs on certain types of American steel , as well as a 10 % tax on other items , including yoghurt , whiskey and roasted coffee .
Mexico 's Economy Ministry said it is planning new duties for steel , pork legs and shoulders , apples , grapes , blueberries and cheese .
Europe had previously outlined a list of items , including US bourbon , cranberries and jeans , as targets for retaliation .
US President Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium in March , justifying them on national security grounds .
He has argued that global oversupply of steel and aluminium , driven by China , threatens American steel and aluminium producers , which are vital to the US .
Since the announcement , South Korea , Argentina , Australia and Brazil have agreed to put limits on the volume of metals they can ship to the US in lieu of tariffs .
The US granted temporary exemptions to the EU , Canada and Mexico amid negotiations over limits . That deadline was due to expire on 1 June , having already been extended by a month .
US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the sanctions from Paris , where he had been negotiating with EU leaders who were trying to avert the tariffs .
Mr Ross said talks had not made enough progress to warrant a further reprieve either for Europe or for Canada and Mexico , which are in negotiations with the US over North America 's free trade agreement .
Mr Trump has the authority to lift the tariffs or alter them at any time , he added .
`` We continue to be quite willing and indeed eager to have discussions with all those parties , '' Mr Ross said .
The Trump administration is determined to wring concessions from its trading partners around the world - and it 's prepared to do so in belligerent style .
The President believes cheap imports harm US industry and cost US workers their jobs . On the campaign trail , he promised them a fairer deal - and it seems he 's happy to risk a trade war to get what he wants . In fact , he has previously suggested that trade wars are `` good , and easy to win '' .
So will it go that far ? Certainly , the EU and Mexico seem prepared to retaliate - and Canada has hinted it in the past might take action as well . So it 's not looking good . But if you look at Washington 's dealings with China - its key target on trade - things seem less clear cut .
On several occasions the rhetoric between the two sides has been ramped up , threats have been made , then positions have softened . So far , an all-out trade war has been avoided . And China has made some concessions .
So perhaps this is simply how negotiations take place in the Trump era . Loudly - and in a blaze of publicity .
Canada , Mexico and the EU combined exported $ 23bn worth of steel and aluminium to the US last year - nearly half of the $ 48bn total steel and aluminium imports in 2017 .
Since Mr Trump 's announcement in March , companies in the US that buy metals have already reported higher steel prices and and complained that US producers do not have the ability to meet demand .
Economists and US companies have warned that higher metal costs will disrupt supply chains and eventually get passed on to US households . They said the tariffs are likely to lead to job losses at firms that rely on the materials .
Goldman Sachs in March estimated that the tariffs would boost inflation by less than half a percentage point .
Mr Ross has dismissed the concerns about higher costs , arguing that the effects will be minimal .
Shares of US steel producers gained in trading on Thursday , while companies that rely on the metals , such as Caterpillar and Boeing , declined .
UK producers , like those in mainland Europe , are worried the tariffs will cause a decline in US demand , while prompting a surge in steel imports diverted from the US .
The disruption would hit the industry hard , said Gareth Stace , director of trade association UK Steel .
The UK steel industry employs about 31,000 people and sends about 7 % of its exports to the US , according to the organisation .
The tariffs have faced sharp criticism in the US from businesses and lawmakers , including Republicans typically allied with the president .
Republican Kevin Brady , who shepherded last year 's tax cut through Congress and chairs the House Ways and Means Committee , called on the administration to reinstate the exemptions .
He said : `` The administration will need to come to Capitol Hill to provide answers about the indiscriminate harm these tariffs are causing our local businesses . ''
The US Aluminum Association , which represents major producers , also criticised the US decision , saying tariffs would alienate allies and fail to address oversupply .
France 's junior trade minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said he expects EU counter-measures to be completed by mid-June .
Canada 's tariffs - which target about $ 13bn worth of US products - are expected to start on 1 July .
China has already imposed duties on $ 3bn worth of US goods , including wine and nuts , in retaliation for the steel and aluminium tariffs .
Europe , Canada and Mexico say that as close allies of the US they should receive exemptions from the measures .
Mr Trudeau said : `` It is simply ridiculous to view any trade with Canada as a national security threat to the US . ''
The UK said : `` We will continue to work closely with the EU and US Administration to achieve a permanent exemption , and to ensure that UK workers are protected and safeguarded . ''","Image copyright Reuters Image caption The EU has threatened ""all necessary measures"" in response

The US is to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from key allies in Europe and North America.

The US said a 25% tax on steel and 10% tax on aluminium from the EU, Mexico and Canada will start at midnight.

The move immediately triggered vows of retaliation from Mexico, Canada and the EU, which called the tariffs ""protectionism, pure and simple"".

The UK said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by the US decision, which followed weeks of negotiations.

Canada said it would put 25% tariffs on certain types of American steel, as well as a 10% tax on other items, including yoghurt, whiskey and roasted coffee.

Mexico's Economy Ministry said it is planning new duties for steel, pork legs and shoulders, apples, grapes, blueberries and cheese.

Europe had previously outlined a list of items, including US bourbon, cranberries and jeans, as targets for retaliation.

How did this start?

US President Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium in March, justifying them on national security grounds.

He has argued that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatens American steel and aluminium producers, which are vital to the US.

Since the announcement, South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil have agreed to put limits on the volume of metals they can ship to the US in lieu of tariffs.

The US granted temporary exemptions to the EU, Canada and Mexico amid negotiations over limits. That deadline was due to expire on 1 June, having already been extended by a month.

What did the US announce?

US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the sanctions from Paris, where he had been negotiating with EU leaders who were trying to avert the tariffs.

Mr Ross said talks had not made enough progress to warrant a further reprieve either for Europe or for Canada and Mexico, which are in negotiations with the US over North America's free trade agreement.

Mr Trump has the authority to lift the tariffs or alter them at any time, he added.

""We continue to be quite willing and indeed eager to have discussions with all those parties,"" Mr Ross said.

Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent

The Trump administration is determined to wring concessions from its trading partners around the world - and it's prepared to do so in belligerent style.

The President believes cheap imports harm US industry and cost US workers their jobs. On the campaign trail, he promised them a fairer deal - and it seems he's happy to risk a trade war to get what he wants. In fact, he has previously suggested that trade wars are ""good, and easy to win"".

So will it go that far? Certainly, the EU and Mexico seem prepared to retaliate - and Canada has hinted it in the past might take action as well. So it's not looking good. But if you look at Washington's dealings with China - its key target on trade - things seem less clear cut.

On several occasions the rhetoric between the two sides has been ramped up, threats have been made, then positions have softened. So far, an all-out trade war has been avoided. And China has made some concessions.

So perhaps this is simply how negotiations take place in the Trump era. Loudly - and in a blaze of publicity.

What does this do to the market?

Canada, Mexico and the EU combined exported $23bn worth of steel and aluminium to the US last year - nearly half of the $48bn total steel and aluminium imports in 2017.

Since Mr Trump's announcement in March, companies in the US that buy metals have already reported higher steel prices and and complained that US producers do not have the ability to meet demand.

Economists and US companies have warned that higher metal costs will disrupt supply chains and eventually get passed on to US households. They said the tariffs are likely to lead to job losses at firms that rely on the materials.

Goldman Sachs in March estimated that the tariffs would boost inflation by less than half a percentage point.

Mr Ross has dismissed the concerns about higher costs, arguing that the effects will be minimal.

Shares of US steel producers gained in trading on Thursday, while companies that rely on the metals, such as Caterpillar and Boeing, declined.

UK producers, like those in mainland Europe, are worried the tariffs will cause a decline in US demand, while prompting a surge in steel imports diverted from the US.

The disruption would hit the industry hard, said Gareth Stace, director of trade association UK Steel.

The UK steel industry employs about 31,000 people and sends about 7% of its exports to the US, according to the organisation.

What is the reaction in the US?

The tariffs have faced sharp criticism in the US from businesses and lawmakers, including Republicans typically allied with the president.

Republican Kevin Brady, who shepherded last year's tax cut through Congress and chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, called on the administration to reinstate the exemptions.

He said: ""The administration will need to come to Capitol Hill to provide answers about the indiscriminate harm these tariffs are causing our local businesses.""

The US Aluminum Association, which represents major producers, also criticised the US decision, saying tariffs would alienate allies and fail to address oversupply.

What happens next?

France's junior trade minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said he expects EU counter-measures to be completed by mid-June.

Canada's tariffs - which target about $13bn worth of US products - are expected to start on 1 July.

China has already imposed duties on $3bn worth of US goods, including wine and nuts, in retaliation for the steel and aluminium tariffs.

Europe, Canada and Mexico say that as close allies of the US they should receive exemptions from the measures.

Mr Trudeau said: ""It is simply ridiculous to view any trade with Canada as a national security threat to the US.""

The UK said: ""We will continue to work closely with the EU and US Administration to achieve a permanent exemption, and to ensure that UK workers are protected and safeguarded.""",www.bbc.com,center,8KAYLEvNvBC62eKc

But Trump and his party could soon begin to face consequences as companies in the coming months start reporting lower earnings , reassessing their supply chains and holding back on investment , all of which will begin to ripple throughout the economy and could lead to a slowdown or full-blown recession , experts say .
If all of the tariffs that have been proposed take effect , they would bring down long-run U.S. GDP by 0.47 percent — about $ 118 billion — in the long term and cost more than 364,000 jobs , a new analysis from the Tax Foundation shows . The International Monetary Fund also warned this week that trade tensions could cut global output by some $ 400 billion by 2020 , and that the U.S. is `` especially vulnerable '' to effects of an international slowdown .
Price increases would vary by product , ranging anywhere from a few cents on a can of beer or soup to around $ 6,000 on a family car , if the administration moves forward with auto-specific tariffs it has threatened .
Even if Trump does n't move forward with any additional duties , the uncertainty caused by his policies and rhetoric is leading some companies to begin pulling back investments in research and development . They 're afraid that if they develop products for foreign markets , those markets might no longer be accessible to them in six months or a year .
The agricultural industry has been particularly vulnerable : Countries like Mexico have begun to diversify their import markets by buying more corn and soybeans from Brazil instead of the United States , in an attempt to reduce their dependence on a country that could erect new trade barriers at any time based on the president ’ s whims .
And while the administration has so far taken pains to avoid hitting consumers directly , leaving products like flat-screen televisions and cellphones off the list of products facing tariffs , they will be unable to continue to do so as the list of goods caught in the crossfire begins to expand .
“ If this escalates into a full-blown trade war , the innocent victims are going to be American consumers , ” said Matthew Shay , president and CEO of the National Retail Federation . “ That ’ s what we ’ d like to avoid . ”
As midterm campaigns heat up , vulnerable Democrats and Democratic super PACs are already using the president ’ s trade war — and the Republican Party ’ s reluctance so far to challenge him on it — to frame their opponents as complicit in an escalating trade battle with no end in sight .

Claire McCaskill , for saying that he supports Trump ’ s goals on trade and feels that the president is doing the right thing .
“ Hawley welcomed this trade war , ” it reads at the end of a minute-long spot featuring clips of local farmers and manufacturers complaining about the harmful effects of Trump ’ s tariffs . “ Now Missouri families are paying the price . ”
The president has so far ignored increasing calls from Republicans in Congress to back down on trade , or at least to begin pursuing dialogue with Chinese President Xi Jinping . The White House insisted this week that trade talks with Beijing are ongoing , but there are no formal discussions on the books and the two sides have not met at the ministerial level since Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross traveled to China early last month . Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will have informal opportunities to talk with his Chinese counterparts at the G-20 finance ministers ’ meeting in Buenos Aires this weekend , but no formal bilateral meetings are expected .
Instead , Trump has sought ways to expand his tariff crusade : Beyond ratcheting up duties against China , he has directed the Commerce Department to conduct investigations examining whether to impose penalties on imports of cars and car parts , as well as uranium . And he has continued to frustrate Canada and Mexico by refusing to back down from what they see as unreasonable demands in the ongoing renegotiation of NAFTA .
Moving forward with either car tariffs or a NAFTA withdrawal before November elections would be an “ enormous political mistake , ” said Bill Reinsch , a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . “ If he does that , you ’ ll see an immediate sharp consumer impact , which I think will translate into a political reaction . Everything else will be like sand leaking out of the bag . ”
But even the slow accumulation of economic effects could build up enough by November that consumers will be feeling the pain . It might be difficult for everyday Americans to recognize at this point how the tariffs will affect them , given that many of those proposed are not yet in effect , so in the meantime , the retail industry is working to educate consumers that “ there are greater consequences , and price increases and real impacts ” that could be coming in the near future , Shay said .
“ That ’ s going to create a lot more attention around the things that right now sound a lot more hypothetical , ” he added .
So far , at least , polls show that Trump appears to still have the support of the bulk of Republican voters when it comes to tariffs . Nearly three-fourths , or 73 percent , of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who responded to a Pew Research survey out this week said they felt increased tariffs would benefit the country . Roughly the same percentage — or 77 percent — of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents felt the opposite .
But reaction overall is trending increasingly negative : Nearly half , or 49 percent , of all respondents to the Pew poll said they feel tariffs are a bad thing for the country , up 4 percentage points from a similar survey done in May .
The partisan split bodes well for Trump , who has so far shown little willingness to heed anyone ’ s advice over trade policy beyond his own and who will likely barge into the midterms with the same protectionist messages that helped him win over laid-off factory workers and struggling farmers in 2016 .
Democrats might try to point to a worsening economy to say that Trump ’ s policies are wreaking havoc across middle America , but the White House has already begun to fire back that the long-term payoff will be worth it .

The politically sensitive surplus hit $31.05 billion in August, up from $28.09 billion in July, customs data showed on Saturday, surpassing the previous record set in June.

Over the first eight months of the year, China’s surplus with its largest export market has risen nearly 15 percent, adding to tensions in the trade relationship between the world’s two largest economies.

China’s annual export growth in August moderated slightly to 9.8 percent, the data showed, the weakest rate since March but only slightly below recent trends.

The number missed analysts’ forecasts that shipments from the world’s largest exporter would rise 10.1 percent, slowing only slightly from 12.2 percent in July.

Even with U.S. tariffs targeting $50 billion of Chinese exports in effect for their first full month in August, China’s exports to the United States still accelerated, growing 13.2 percent from a year earlier from 11.2 percent in July.

“There is still an impact from front-loading of exports, but the main reason (for still-solid export growth) is strong growth in the U.S. economy,” said Zhang Yi, an economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management.

Zhang said the impact from U.S. tariffs on China’s exports would likely be limited over the next few months.

China’s imports from the United States grew only 2.7 percent in August, a slowdown from 11.1 percent in July.

The world’s largest trading nation got off to a strong start this year, but its economic outlook is being clouded by the rapidly escalating U.S. trade dispute and cooling domestic demand.

Trump upped the ante on Friday, warning he was ready to slap tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports to the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days.

Washington has long criticized China’s huge trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing reduce it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over limits on U.S. firms’ access to Chinese markets, intellectual property protection, technology transfers and investment.

Imports, a key gauge of the strength of China’s domestic demand, grew 20 percent, beating forecasts. Analysts had expected growth of 18.7 percent, slowing from July’s surprisingly high 27.3 percent.

That resulted in China posting a smaller overall trade surplus of $27.91 billion for the month. Analysts had expected the surplus would rise to $31.79 billion from $28.05 billion in July.

The surplus with the United States was larger than China’s net surplus for the month, indicating China would be running a deficit if trade with the world’s largest economy was excluded.

While no one predicted a sudden, sharp blow from U.S. tariffs, China’s official export data has been surprisingly resilient so far, with growth exceeding analysts’ expectations for five months in a row.

Chinese officials acknowledged Chinese exporters have been rushing out shipments to beat new U.S. tariffs, buoying the headline growth readings, while some companies such as steel mills are diversifying and selling more products to other countries.

Economists have noted that disruptions in supply chains are likely to be more company specific, and will take time to be reflected in broad economic data and corporate earnings reports.

However, anecdotal evidence of mounting trade damage on both sides of the Pacific is on the rise.

Official and private manufacturing surveys for China show global demand for Chinese goods is clearly on the wane, with export orders shrinking for months in a row.

“Risks have increased due to the negative impacts of China-U.S. trade friction. The impact on exports may gradually start to show up, with future export growth possible declining,” said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications.

Policymakers have shifted their focus in recent months to improving credit conditions and shoring up business confidence.

Beijing is ramping up spending on infrastructure projects to spur domestic demand and the central bank is tamping down borrowing costs and leaning on commercial banks to continue lending to struggling firms hit by trade troubles.

But such steps will take time to arrest the economy’s slide, and analysts expect the government to unveil more stimulus measures if business conditions continue to deteriorate.",www.reuters.com,center,jY5S2QvjkuXsPP0s

The trade debate is a combination of both factual information about what ’ s actually in the legislation and of emotions about job loss , says Gary Chaison , a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester , Ma .
“ Trade agreements are always difficult because they are very emotional things , ” he says . They invariably benefit some people and negatively affect others . “ For the winners we look at the facts , and for the losers we look at emotions . ”
On Wednesday , the Senate passed `` fast track , '' which prevents Congress from amending trade bills negotiated by President Obama , by a 60-to-38 vote . That now goes to Mr. Obama 's desk for a signature . It also approved assistance for workers displaced by global trade . That goes back to the House for final approval .
With all that in mind , here are five common misconceptions about free trade agreements and the president ’ s trade agenda .
Figuring job losses and gains from trade is not an exact science .
Opponents argue vigorously that trade deals such as the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) are job killers and wage suppressors , while proponents argue they lead to economic growth .
But in April , the independent Congressional Research Service reported that “ the overall economic impact of NAFTA is difficult to measure ” because trade and investment are influenced by many variables . “ NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters , ” it concluded .
Predicting losses or gains from the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership – the historic trade deal that the US is negotiating with 11 other Pacific Rim nations – is even harder because it involves so many countries , says Steve Bell , senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank in Washington .
It ’ s “ virtually impossible to estimate with any reliability the job impact or the cost impact or the [ economic ] impact . People who say that are pretty much making that stuff up , ” he says .
For that reason , he and others argue , trade deals should be judged on whether they expand America ’ s positive influence in the world , whether they break down export barriers to US goods , and whether they improve labor , environmental , and human rights standards abroad .
Professor Chaison argues they must be accompanied by assistance for displaced American workers , because “ we don ’ t fully appreciate ” the radical way in which real people ’ s lives can be harmed by trade .
China is not part of the Pacific trade agreement , or any US trade deal .
Lawmakers and labor often point to jobs lost to a China trade deal . For example , Rep. Barbara Lee ( D ) of California recently said that communities of color have disproportionately suffered because of a “ US-China trade deal . ”
Yes , minorities have disproportionately suffered job losses over the years , but the way it 's described makes it sound like the losses come from America 's trade agreement with China . There is no US-China trade deal .
Representative Lee is getting her data – 35 percent of minority jobs lost to China along with a 30 percent drop in wages – from the Communications Workers of America . The union cites “ the China deal , ” but what it ’ s really referring to is China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 .
Being in the WTO is not the same as entering into a negotiated free trade agreement , which could be potentially stricter , between two countries or even a dozen countries . Some argue that China should be part of the Pacific Rim deal or some future US free trade agreement because it ’ s too big to ignore .
But for now , the Obama administration is arguing that the Pacific agreement is needed as a geostrategic counterweight to China .
Globalization and free trade deals are not the same thing .
When opponents of free trade agreements cite job losses , lower wages , or outsourcing , they often lump in the phenomenon of “ globalization ” with free trade agreements .
Globalization is what ’ s happening with the world economy and culture – the spread of interconnectedness hastened by the digital age . Its downside can mean Americans losing business to international retailers over the Internet , losing call centers to India ( with which the US has no trade agreement ) , or being undercut by Chinese currency manipulation .
Free trade agreements try to bring structure to this free-wheeling world by setting up common standards . They , too , have downsides that result in job losses in some sectors , but the deals are an attempt to bring order to globalization .
“ Globalization is an economic evolution . A trade agreement is just the opposite . It ’ s a construct , ” says Bell .
The secrecy surrounding the Pacific trade deal is not so unusual .
It ’ s true that members of Congress have to go to a special room to read the draft Pacific trade agreement ; that they must surrender their cell phones before going in ; that they can take notes – but not with them when they leave ; that they may not divulge its contents to outsiders , even experts who might help them better understand the contents .
Why the secrecy ? The administration says it ’ s to protect its negotiating power . How can it negotiate sensitive points with 11 countries while 535 members of Congress and the general public weigh in ? Besides , any member of Congress will be able to go to the trade negotiations or consult with the administration . And the final deal will be available to the public for 60 days before it ’ s voted on in Congress .
Deal-making in secret is not an unusual negotiating strategy , supporters say .
“ This is really not substantially different than how labor unions themselves negotiate their contracts , ” says Rep. Gregory Meeks ( D ) of New York , one of the president ’ s few Democratic trade supporters in the House . For example , top union officials negotiate contracts , and then take the results back to the members for ratification .
On Wednesday , the Senate approved fast track trading authority for the president .
But this was a vote about process , not a vote on a trade agreement . Fast track allows the president to negotiate a trade deal with the assurance that Congress can ’ t change it once he ’ s sealed the deal ; it can only approve or disapprove it . The actual vote on a trade deal would come only after it ’ s finalized .

Some argue that China should be part of the Pacific Rim deal or some future US free trade agreement because it’s too big to ignore.

But for now, the Obama administration is arguing that the Pacific agreement is needed as a geostrategic counterweight to China.

Globalization and free trade deals are not the same thing.

When opponents of free trade agreements cite job losses, lower wages, or outsourcing, they often lump in the phenomenon of “globalization” with free trade agreements.

But they’re opposites.

Globalization is what’s happening with the world economy and culture – the spread of interconnectedness hastened by the digital age. Its downside can mean Americans losing business to international retailers over the Internet, losing call centers to India (with which the US has no trade agreement), or being undercut by Chinese currency manipulation.

Free trade agreements try to bring structure to this free-wheeling world by setting up common standards. They, too, have downsides that result in job losses in some sectors, but the deals are an attempt to bring order to globalization.

“Globalization is an economic evolution. A trade agreement is just the opposite. It’s a construct,” says Bell.

The secrecy surrounding the Pacific trade deal is not so unusual.

It’s true that members of Congress have to go to a special room to read the draft Pacific trade agreement; that they must surrender their cell phones before going in; that they can take notes – but not with them when they leave; that they may not divulge its contents to outsiders, even experts who might help them better understand the contents.

Why the secrecy? The administration says it’s to protect its negotiating power. How can it negotiate sensitive points with 11 countries while 535 members of Congress and the general public weigh in? Besides, any member of Congress will be able to go to the trade negotiations or consult with the administration. And the final deal will be available to the public for 60 days before it’s voted on in Congress.

Deal-making in secret is not an unusual negotiating strategy, supporters say.

“This is really not substantially different than how labor unions themselves negotiate their contracts,” says Rep. Gregory Meeks (D) of New York, one of the president’s few Democratic trade supporters in the House. For example, top union officials negotiate contracts, and then take the results back to the members for ratification.

This week’s votes are not on a trade deal.

On Wednesday, the Senate approved fast track trading authority for the president.

But this was a vote about process, not a vote on a trade agreement. Fast track allows the president to negotiate a trade deal with the assurance that Congress can’t change it once he’s sealed the deal; it can only approve or disapprove it. The actual vote on a trade deal would come only after it’s finalized.

Analysis:

Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent

The head of the World Trade Organization, Roberto Azevedo, has said the post-war multilateral trading system is facing its worst crisis.

He sounded the alarm in a BBC interview, where he did not name names, but it's pretty clear that President Trump's combative approach to trade policy is at the centre of his concerns.

The signing of the deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement - even though it still needs to be ratified by all three countries legislators - does perhaps tick off one item on the list that Mr Azevedo is worrying about.

But there are plenty more. The big one must be the continuing tensions between the US and China. The two countries have already imposed new tariffs on one another's goods and the US plans to raise them further in the New Year.

Perhaps President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will defuse the situation when they meet at the G20 summit this weekend. But expectations are not very high.

While most analysts expect the deal to win easy approval in Canada and Mexico, it has received a lukewarm response in the US.

Democrats say the new pact does not do enough to protect the environment or dissuade companies from locating jobs in lower-cost Mexico.

Meanwhile, many business groups and some free-trade Republicans still want to see the White House lift the steel and aluminium tariffs.

Despite the criticism, Mr Trump said he expected Congress to ultimately back the deal.

trade,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/22/senate-passes-free-trade-bill-house-bigger-hurdle/,"Senate passes free trade bill, House remains bigger hurdle",2015-05-22,Stephen Dinan,"The first major free trade bill in years is headed for the House , where passage of a bill to grant President Obama powers to conclude a Pacific trade deal faces a stiffer challenge than the one just overcome in the Senate .
Although more than a dozen pro-trade Democratic senators linked arms with most Republicans to grant Mr. Obama a major legislative victory in the upper chamber on a 62-37 vote , Democrats in the House are less inclined toward free trade and Republicans in the chamber are even more suspicious of granting Mr. Obama any broad powers .
But Friday ’ s vote was a substantial victory for Mr. Obama , who staked his personal prestige on winning a legacy-enhancing trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership . The vote was on fast-track negotiating powers , known as Trade Promotion Authority , that will allow Mr. Obama to complete negotiations on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership .
“ It ’ s been a long time coming , ” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch , the Utah Republican who led the fight for Trade Promotion Authority , said just ahead of the vote on what he called “ likely the most important bill we ’ ll pass this year . ”
Trade Promotion Authority lays out the conditions for Mr. Obama to complete negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and any other trade deals . It sets environmental and labor standards and sets a period for Congress to consider and vote on whatever final agreement the president submits .
The Senate vote was anticlimactic . The big test was a few hours earlier on an amendment that would have injected language into the fast-track powers requiring the administration to punish other countries deemed guilty of keeping their currency artificially low versus the dollar in order to gain an export advantage .
A lower-value currency makes a country ’ s exports more attractive to others and makes imports less attractive to its own consumers .
If the provision was approved , Mr. Obama said , he would have been forced to veto the fast-track trade bill he is desperately seeking from Congress because it would scuttle chances for a Pacific free trade pact .
But senators granted his wish in a 51-48 vote by defeating an effort to add the language and preserving the core of the fast-track trade deal .
Sen. Ron Wyden , the Oregon Democrat who organized the pro-trade members of his party during debate , said this deal is better than previous fast-track bills and insists on better terms for the U.S. than previous agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement , or NAFTA .
He said too much secrecy has been surrounding negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership but that the fast-track bill would require nearly four months for the public and Congress to review it or any other final trade deal before it is put up for a vote .
Opponents said they aren ’ t convinced that this version would produce any better outcome than NAFTA or other previous deals .
“ Tonight ’ s vote is a massive blow to workers and businesses across the country , ” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow , Michigan Democrat .
The trade fight is as much a test of Mr. Obama ’ s legislative powers as it is of support for trade . The president has made the fight personal by taking on major liberal figures such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Massachusetts Democrat . Mr. Obama also has pleaded with his liberal base to trust that he can pursue free trade the right way .
“ If done right , these agreements are vital to expanding opportunities for the middle class , leveling the playing field for American workers , and establishing rules for the global economy that help our businesses grow and hire by selling goods Made in America to the rest of the world , ” he said after Friday ’ s vote .","The first major free trade bill in years is headed for the House, where passage of a bill to grant President Obama powers to conclude a Pacific trade deal faces a stiffer challenge than the one just overcome in the Senate.

Although more than a dozen pro-trade Democratic senators linked arms with most Republicans to grant Mr. Obama a major legislative victory in the upper chamber on a 62-37 vote, Democrats in the House are less inclined toward free trade and Republicans in the chamber are even more suspicious of granting Mr. Obama any broad powers.

But Friday’s vote was a substantial victory for Mr. Obama, who staked his personal prestige on winning a legacy-enhancing trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The vote was on fast-track negotiating powers, known as Trade Promotion Authority, that will allow Mr. Obama to complete negotiations on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.

“It’s been a long time coming,” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who led the fight for Trade Promotion Authority, said just ahead of the vote on what he called “likely the most important bill we’ll pass this year.”

Trade Promotion Authority lays out the conditions for Mr. Obama to complete negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and any other trade deals. It sets environmental and labor standards and sets a period for Congress to consider and vote on whatever final agreement the president submits.

The Senate vote was anticlimactic. The big test was a few hours earlier on an amendment that would have injected language into the fast-track powers requiring the administration to punish other countries deemed guilty of keeping their currency artificially low versus the dollar in order to gain an export advantage.

A lower-value currency makes a country’s exports more attractive to others and makes imports less attractive to its own consumers.

If the provision was approved, Mr. Obama said, he would have been forced to veto the fast-track trade bill he is desperately seeking from Congress because it would scuttle chances for a Pacific free trade pact.

But senators granted his wish in a 51-48 vote by defeating an effort to add the language and preserving the core of the fast-track trade deal.

Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who organized the pro-trade members of his party during debate, said this deal is better than previous fast-track bills and insists on better terms for the U.S. than previous agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.

He said too much secrecy has been surrounding negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership but that the fast-track bill would require nearly four months for the public and Congress to review it or any other final trade deal before it is put up for a vote.

Opponents said they aren’t convinced that this version would produce any better outcome than NAFTA or other previous deals.

“Tonight’s vote is a massive blow to workers and businesses across the country,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, Michigan Democrat.

The trade fight is as much a test of Mr. Obama’s legislative powers as it is of support for trade. The president has made the fight personal by taking on major liberal figures such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat. Mr. Obama also has pleaded with his liberal base to trust that he can pursue free trade the right way.

“If done right, these agreements are vital to expanding opportunities for the middle class, leveling the playing field for American workers, and establishing rules for the global economy that help our businesses grow and hire by selling goods Made in America to the rest of the world,” he said after Friday’s vote.

Talks in Beijing earlier this month aimed at dialing down the tensions failed to produce any major breakthroughs. But Chinese President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser is heading to Washington this week for more negotiations.

American companies will also have a chance to publicly tell the Trump administration what they think about its planned tariffs on Chinese goods.

Here's what to keep an eye on this week.

1. What will happen to ZTE?

The fate of Chinese technology company ZTE (ZTCOF) has become a major flashpoint in the US-China trade tensions.

Last month, the US Commerce Department blocked American firms from selling parts or providing services to ZTE, which makes smartphones and other telecommunications equipment. The ban was put in place after Washington said ZTE violated a deal in which the Chinese company agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine for evading US sanctions on Iran and North Korea.

ZTE, which employs around 75,000 people worldwide, has disputed the decision and is appealing it. The company upped the stakes last week by saying it had halted most of its operations because of the ban.

Trump appeared to throw ZTE a lifeline with his tweet Sunday in which he said ""too many"" Chinese jobs were at risk. The Commerce Department has been ""instructed"" to get ZTE back into business, he added.

Trump's announcement -- welcomed Monday by Beijing -- should create a more positive backdrop for trade talks.

""The Trump administration is softening its stance and stepping back from using the most destructive weapon in the negotiation,"" said Ken Cheung, a currency strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. ""The second round of negotiation should be more constructive.""

2. Round 2 of trade talks

That second round of talks is happening this week.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will lead a Chinese delegation visiting Washington from Tuesday through Saturday, China's Foreign Ministry said Monday.

""I suspect Liu will try to engage with his Treasury counterpart, Steven Mnuchin, whom the Chinese see as the most willing to make a deal,"" said Richard McGregor, senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Sydney.

It included cutting the US trade deficit with China by $200 billion by the end of 2020 and halting Chinese subsidies for advanced technology industries.

McGregor, an expert on Chinese politics and international relations, said he doesn't think Liu will offer any big concessions on the trade deficit, but will rather focus on measures to open up China's markets to more American investment.

3. US businesses have their say

While Liu is in Washington, American companies will be airing their views on the Trump administration's plan to slap tariffs on around $50 billion worth of Chinese goods as punishment for alleged intellectual property theft.

Among the big US companies that have asked to testify at the hearings are Best Buy (BBY), HP (HPQ) and US Steel (X). Lobbying groups seeking to take part include the National Retail Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers.

The hearings start Tuesday and are scheduled to last three days.

The US government has published a list of 1,300 Chinese exports that it plans to target with tariffs of 25%, many of them in advanced manufacturing industries such as aerospace.

Related: Who likes tariffs? Generally, it's not the same people who like Trump

US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has expressed particular concern about Beijing's high-tech ambitions, as outlined in a Chinese government plan known as ""Made in China 2025.""

A number of big US businesses and industry associations have opposed the planned tariffs, fearing higher costs for American consumers and retaliation from China.

China has already hit back by proposing its own tariffs on American goods worth a similar amount.

Chinese firms have bought U.S. agricultural products including 20 million tons of soybeans and 700,000 tons of pork so far this year and will accelerate its purchases, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Tuesday.

In a series of tweets and in comments to reporters on Tuesday , Trump said national security concerns , which had been cited as reasoning for the plans , should not be used as an excuse to make it difficult for foreign countries to buy U.S. products .
The president ’ s comments came after weekend reports by ███ and other news media that the government was considering whether to stop General Electric Co ( GE.N ) from further supplying engines for a new Chinese passenger jet .
The president ’ s intervention illustrated that , at least in this case , he would prioritize economic benefits over potential competitive pitfalls and national security concerns .
His views on the issue contrasted with the sharp restrictions his administration has placed on U.S. companies trading with Huawei Technologies , the world ’ s largest telecommunications equipment maker , also for national security reasons .
“ We ’ re not going to be sacrificing our companies ... by using a fake term of national security . It ’ s got to be real national security . And I think people were getting carried away with it , ” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before departing for a trip to California .
“ I want our companies to be allowed to do business . I mean , things are put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security , including with chipmakers and various others . So we ’ re going to give it up , and what will happen ? They ’ ll make those chips in a different country or they ’ ll make them in China or someplace else , ” he said .
The United States has supported American companies ’ business with China ’ s aviation sector for years .
“ I want China to buy our jet engines , the best in the World , ” Trump wrote on Twitter . “ I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States , not difficult . Everyone in my Administration is being so instructed , with no excuses ... ”
Trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said limitations on jet engines and chip makers would hurt U.S. companies .
“ This is ultimately akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face because ultimately you ’ re hurting U.S. manufacturing companies but you ’ re not having a material impact on your target , ” he said .
The United States and China , the world ’ s two largest economies , have a complicated and competitive relationship . Trump signed a first-phase trade deal with China earlier this year after a long trade war in which the countries levied significant tariffs on each others ’ products , many of which remain in place .
Washington is also eyeing limits on other components for Chinese commercial aircraft such as flight control systems made by Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) .
Central to the possible crackdown is whether shipments of U.S. parts to China ’ s aircraft industry could fuel the rise of a serious competitor to U.S.-based Boeing Co ( BA.N ) or boost China ’ s military capabilities .
The Semiconductor Industry Association ( SIA ) said it welcomed Trump ’ s comments .
“ We applaud President Trump ’ s tweets supporting U.S. companies being able to sell products to China and opposing proposed regulations that would unduly curtail that ability , ” John Neuffer , the group ’ s president , said in a statement . “ As we have discussed with the administration , sales of non-sensitive , commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation , which is critical to America ’ s economic strength and national security . ”
Huawei is at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China . Washington placed Huawei on a blacklist in May last year , citing national security concerns . The United States has also been trying to persuade allies to exclude its gear from next generation 5G networks on grounds its equipment could be used by China for spying . Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim .
“ So , national security is very important . I ’ ve been very tough on Huawei , but that doesn ’ t mean we have to be tough on everybody that does something , ” Trump said .","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump objected on Tuesday to U.S. proposals that would prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China’s aviation industry and suggested he had instructed his administration not to implement them.

In a series of tweets and in comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said national security concerns, which had been cited as reasoning for the plans, should not be used as an excuse to make it difficult for foreign countries to buy U.S. products.

The president’s comments came after weekend reports by Reuters and other news media that the government was considering whether to stop General Electric Co (GE.N) from further supplying engines for a new Chinese passenger jet.

The president’s intervention illustrated that, at least in this case, he would prioritize economic benefits over potential competitive pitfalls and national security concerns.

His views on the issue contrasted with the sharp restrictions his administration has placed on U.S. companies trading with Huawei Technologies, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, also for national security reasons.

“We’re not going to be sacrificing our companies ... by using a fake term of national security. It’s got to be real national security. And I think people were getting carried away with it,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before departing for a trip to California.

“I want our companies to be allowed to do business. I mean, things are put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security, including with chipmakers and various others. So we’re going to give it up, and what will happen? They’ll make those chips in a different country or they’ll make them in China or someplace else,” he said.

The United States has supported American companies’ business with China’s aviation sector for years.

“I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult. Everyone in my Administration is being so instructed, with no excuses...”

Trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said limitations on jet engines and chip makers would hurt U.S. companies.

“This is ultimately akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face because ultimately you’re hurting U.S. manufacturing companies but you’re not having a material impact on your target,” he said.

The United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, have a complicated and competitive relationship. Trump signed a first-phase trade deal with China earlier this year after a long trade war in which the countries levied significant tariffs on each others’ products, many of which remain in place.

Washington is also eyeing limits on other components for Chinese commercial aircraft such as flight control systems made by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N).

Central to the possible crackdown is whether shipments of U.S. parts to China’s aircraft industry could fuel the rise of a serious competitor to U.S.-based Boeing Co (BA.N) or boost China’s military capabilities.

The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said it welcomed Trump’s comments.

“We applaud President Trump’s tweets supporting U.S. companies being able to sell products to China and opposing proposed regulations that would unduly curtail that ability,” John Neuffer, the group’s president, said in a statement. “As we have discussed with the administration, sales of non-sensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation, which is critical to America’s economic strength and national security.”

Huawei is at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China. Washington placed Huawei on a blacklist in May last year, citing national security concerns. The United States has also been trying to persuade allies to exclude its gear from next generation 5G networks on grounds its equipment could be used by China for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim.

“So, national security is very important. I’ve been very tough on Huawei, but that doesn’t mean we have to be tough on everybody that does something,” Trump said.",www.reuters.com,center,uXWtz24aGa0Q1kQv

Are you thrilled by cheap gas prices when you travel through the deep South or stunned by how pricey they are when you visit New York?

Just remember those extremes aren't as easy, or hard, on your wallet as they seem.

According to conventional wisdom, the Southeast is usually the cheapest region of the country for gasoline, while the Northeast is among the most expensive.

And that's true, based purely on price per gallon.

But when you factor in average gasoline usage and local wages, the yearly cost of filling up looks a lot different.

With the Labor Day travel weekend approaching, a new study by GasBuddy reveals that the average amount of local labor needed to fill up your car is lowest in several states in the Northeast. Meanwhile, several states in the southeast are comparably more expensive.

“There are some surprises here,” said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at fuel-savings app GasBuddy. “You tend to see areas that are more rural that have challenged incomes or lower median hourly wages where the true cost of filling up is more hard work than other areas.”

He also said the US and UK were `` joined at the hip '' on military matters , while Mrs May said they stood `` shoulder to shoulder '' in facing shared threats .
In a series of warm exchanges in Davos , Switzerland , President Trump also told the UK PM : `` We love your country . ''
He also rejected `` false rumours '' of differences , saying that the two leaders `` like each other a lot '' .
And Downing Street said later that they had asked officials to work on `` finalising the details of a visit by the president to the UK later this year '' .
It was their first meeting since clashing over the US president 's retweets of far-right videos in November .
And earlier this month Mr Trump cancelled a visit to the UK , criticising the location of the new US embassy in London .
But after their meeting , Mr Trump told Mrs May at their news conference : `` I have great respect for everything you are doing , we love your country , I think it 's really great . ''
The two leaders met in Davos , at the World Economic Forum , with post-Brexit trade relations between the two countries high on the agenda .
Mr Trump said : `` One thing that will be taking place over a number of years will be trade . Trade is going to increase many times .
`` I look forward to that ... the discussions ... that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increases in trade between our two countries which is great for both in terms of jobs . We look forward to that and we are starting that process , pretty much as we speak . ''
He added the US would be `` there to fight for you - you know that '' and the two were `` joined at the hip when it comes to the military '' .

President Donald Trump has predicted a ""tremendous increase"" in UK-US trade, after talks with Theresa May.

He also said the US and UK were ""joined at the hip"" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" in facing shared threats.

In a series of warm exchanges in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump also told the UK PM: ""We love your country.""

He also rejected ""false rumours"" of differences, saying that the two leaders ""like each other a lot"".

And Downing Street said later that they had asked officials to work on ""finalising the details of a visit by the president to the UK later this year"".

It was their first meeting since clashing over the US president's retweets of far-right videos in November.

And earlier this month Mr Trump cancelled a visit to the UK, criticising the location of the new US embassy in London.

But after their meeting, Mr Trump told Mrs May at their news conference: ""I have great respect for everything you are doing, we love your country, I think it's really great.""

The two leaders met in Davos, at the World Economic Forum, with post-Brexit trade relations between the two countries high on the agenda.

Mr Trump said: ""One thing that will be taking place over a number of years will be trade. Trade is going to increase many times.

""I look forward to that... the discussions... that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increases in trade between our two countries which is great for both in terms of jobs. We look forward to that and we are starting that process, pretty much as we speak.""

He added the US would be ""there to fight for you - you know that"" and the two were ""joined at the hip when it comes to the military"".

Mrs May replied that the ""really special relationship"" between the UK and US continued and they stood ""shoulder to shoulder because we are facing the same challenges across the world"".

""Alongside that working for a good trade relationship for the future which will be for both our benefits, so the UK and the US both do well out of this - and it's been great to see you today.""

State visit?

In response to reporters' questions, both leaders said they would ""talk about"" his state visit to the UK - offered by Mrs May when she visited him in Washington shortly after he became US president. No date has been set.

Downing Street later confirmed that the visit officials were discussing this year would be a working, not a state, visit.

But BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the British would be pleased with the press call. The mood music had been good and the Americans were talking positively about a trade deal.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — A series of government reports Wednesday cast a picture of a steadily growing U.S. economy , fueled by solid consumer spending and defying threats — at least for now — from a U.S.-China trade war and a global slowdown .
The Commerce Department estimated that the economy grew at a moderate 2.1 % annual rate over the summer , slightly better than it had previously estimated . Other reports showed stronger consumer spending and a rebound in orders for big-ticket manufactured goods .
For the July-September quarter , the rise in the gross domestic product , the economy ’ s total output of goods and services , exceeded the government ’ s initial estimate a month ago of a 1.9 % annual rate . A key reason is that businesses didn ’ t cut back on investment spending as much as first estimated .
The economy had begun the year with a sizzling 3.1 % GDP rate , fueled largely by the now-faded effects of tax cuts and increased government spending .
Many analysts worry that GDP growth is slipping in the current October-December quarter to a 1.4 % annual rate or less as business investment weakens further . But most say the slowdown won ’ t likely be as severe as it might have been because consumers , who drive about 70 percent of the economy , are signaling that they will likely keep spending through the holiday shopping season and into next year . That spending is being supported by rising incomes and an unemployment rate that is near the lowest levels in a half century .
Consumer spending gained some momentum entering the final three months of the year , with spending rising by a 0.3 % annual rate in October , the fastest monthly pace in three months .
And in the U.S. manufacturing sector , which has been struggling with global economic weakness and damage from the Trump administration ’ s trade conflicts , orders for high-cost items rebounded in October by a 0.6 % annual rate after having declined in September .
Economists said the flurry of reports depict an economy that is regaining its footing after absorbing threats this year , from the global slowdown to the intensifying trade war with China , which has perpetuated uncertainties for businesses . Many companies have suspended plans to expand and invest .
Still , the stock market has set record highs on optimism that at least a preliminary U.S.-China trade agreement can be reached soon .
“ We still expect GDP growth to slow a little further over the coming months , but the latest data suggest that the slowdown in the fourth quarter won ’ t be quite as bad as we had previously feared , ” analysts at Capital Economics said in a note Wednesday .
The GDP report showed that business investment fell at a 2.7 % annual rate in the July-September period , the second consecutive decline . Yet that drop was offset by a solid 2.9 % gain in consumer spending .
Residential investment did rebound to an annual growth rate of 5.1 % after six consecutive quarters of falling home investment . Analysts attribute that rebound in part to falling mortgage rates .
For the full year , economists think GDP will expand 2.3 % , down sharply from a 2.9 % GDP gain in 2018 . Last year ’ s increase had been fueled by the $ 1.5 trillion tax cut that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress and billions in additional spending for the military and domestic programs .
For 2020 as a whole , many economists envision growth of around 2 % . That would be roughly the annual average that has prevailed since the Great Recession ended in 2009 . But it is well below the 3 % -plus economic growth rates that Trump pledged to achieve with his program of tax cuts , deregulation and America-first trade policies .
As recently as several months ago , as U.S.-China trade tensions were escalating , global growth was slowing and financial markets were suffering losses , many analysts worried that the economy might be on the verge of recession .
But the Federal Reserve , which had raised rates four times in 2018 , began cutting rates in July , giving a boost to interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy . This month , after its third rate cut of the year , the Fed signaled that it would likely keep rates unchanged in coming months unless it saw signs of significant economic weakness .
In a speech Monday , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed an optimistic view about the economy , saying with unemployment near a 50-year low of 3.6 % , there ’ s still “ plenty of room ” for wages to rise and for more Americans to join the workforce .

Nikki Haley , the US ambassador to the United Nations , announced Sunday that the Trump administration would hit Russia with new sanctions on Monday over its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ’ s chemical weapons program in the wake of the April 7 chemical attack in Douma , Syria , that killed dozens of people . The sanctions were explicitly focused on Russian companies that deal in equipment linked to Assad ’ s chemical weapons program .

According to the Washington Post , after Haley announced the sanctions on CBS ’ s Face the Nation Sunday morning , Trump told national security advisers he was “ upset the sanctions were being officially rolled out because he was not yet comfortable executing them . ”

This isn ’ t the first time Trump has seemed to be at odds with or out of touch with the way the rest of his administration is handling Russia policy . Trump was reportedly furious that his administration ended up expelling 60 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal on British soil on March 4 .

More ways China doesn't play fair

Theft is just one headache. The Chinese government has developed a reputation for changing rules on a whim and heavily favoring domestic companies.

China has made no secret of its intentions to dominate certain industries. For example, it has regularly been accused of ""dumping"" really cheap steel on world markets. China denies those claims, but U.S. and European steel makers say the intent is to drive them out of business.

China's cheap currency

Then there are the frustrations over China's currency. Many countries believe China purposefully kept its currency, the yuan, at a very cheap level. That makes Chinese goods inexpensive for customers in the U.S., Europe, Japan and elsewhere. Trump and Clinton both want to formally label China a ""currency manipulator.""

This is one area where China has been showing some signs of shaping up. It has actually lifted the value of its currency in the past two years. The International Monetary Fund even says the yuan is ""no longer undervalued."" Still, the issue could easily come back. China just devalued its currency after Brexit.

A sweeping tariff would also make a lot of stuff more expensive for poor and middle class Americans when they shop. A typical American family would pay between $800 to $2,200 more a year if Trump's policies went into place, according to economists.

Instead of a big tariff, Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, says the next president should start with some level-playing tactics:

Stop letting China invest in the U.S. unless it makes it easier for U.S. companies to set up in China

Deny China access to the U.S. banking system and/or U.S. stock market

Put sanctions on companies that have stolen U.S. technology

Refuse to give Chinese patents protection in the U.S. until China honors American patents there

Cut off scientific and other cooperation with China

Bring more World Trade Organization cases against China

Form a coalition with Europe and Japan to push back

""Imagine if the Chinese were shooting down our airplanes in their airspace. Would we just sit there and go, 'meh?'"" asks Atkinson. He's one, of many, hoping the next president will get a lot tougher.",www.money.cnn.com,left,0kw9XWUPVPPmlsHm

“ Our action today helps to create jobs in America for Americans , ” Mr. Trump said . “ When we do this , a lot of manufacturers will be coming to the United States to build washing machines and also solar . Our companies will not be taken advantage of anymore . ”
He also said the administration is looking at possible trade restrictions on steel and aluminum .
The president ’ s action adds a 20-percent duty on the first 1.2 million imported residential washing machines , and a tax of 50 percent beyond that number in the first year . Mr. Trump said his decision was “ based on the recommendation of the independent , bipartisan U.S. International Trade Commission , ” which ruled late last year that a “ surge ” of washing machines from Samsung and LG have “ seriously injured ” domestic manufacturers .
It was the first major trade restriction of his presidency , and the reaction overseas was swift . South Korea said Tuesday it will complain to the World Trade Organization about Mr. Trump ’ s decision , calling the move “ excessive . ”
“ It is clear that the latest safeguard measures would violate the WTO rules , ” South Korea ’ s trade minister Kim Hyun-chong said in a meeting with industry officials . “ We will actively respond to protectionist measures . ”
A Chinese government spokesman also expressed “ strong dissatisfaction ” with the new U.S. tariffs and hinted at a WTO complaint .
“ Together with other WTO members , China will resolutely defend its legitimate interests , ” said spokesman Way Hejun .
Mr. Trump said his order will “ provide a strong incentive for LG and Samsung to follow through on their recent promises to build major manufacturing plants for washing machines right here in the United States . ”
But John Taylor , a top official of washing-machine manufacturer LG Electronics , said Tuesday the administration ’ s “ pretty dire import restrictions ” will hurt the U.S. economy . He noted that the company is building a 1-million-square-foot plant in Clarksville , Tennessee , to manufacture washing machines , plans that were announced in February 2017 .
“ It will hinder … the ramp-up of our factory in Tennessee and threaten the 600 jobs , ” Mr. Taylor said at a forum hosted by the Heritage Foundation in Washington . “ We just won ’ t perhaps need to hire 600 people initially . We ’ re very concerned about the impact on our retailers , particularly iconic dealers like Sears and J.C. Penney , who depend a lot on the sale of LG washers . ”
Mr. Taylor said LG has not engaged in unfair trade . He said Whirlpool , which complained about the imports , did not “ keep up with innovation . ”
“ It ’ s a textbook case of how certain companies really can game the process and use the trade laws to try to accomplish what they can ’ t do in the marketplace , ” he said .
Rather than flooding the market with “ cheap ” imports , Mr. Taylor said , LG washers are high-end machines that typically cost about 20 percent more than Whirlpool washers .
Paul Nathanson , senior principal at the law firm Bracewell LLP , said Mr. Trump will learn the same lesson that President George W. Bush did after imposing tariffs on imported steel in 2002 — that it was “ a losing political proposition . ”
“ The administration thought this was an easy way to show that they were going to be tough on imports , ” Mr. Nathan said of Mr. Trump . “ Unfortunately for the solar guys and the washer guys , they were the first up . I think they ’ re going to find out just as George W. found out that there ’ s real consequences in the negative blowback , both by our trading partners and by consumers and by the manufacturing sector . ”
The president will depart on Wednesday for a global economic forum in Davos , Switzerland , where some of his counterparts might sympathize with his actions on tariffs . Last fall , the European Union imposed minimum import duties for Chinese solar modules and cells that raised their prices up to 30 percent above market levels — a tariff level about the same as Mr. Trump imposed .
At the conference , Mr. Trump will act as America ’ s salesman in meetings with various European corporate CEOs “ to remind the world we ’ re open for business , ” said White House economic council Director Gary Cohn . Chief among Mr. Trump ’ s selling points will be the new , lower U.S. corporate tax rate of 21 percent .

trade,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/10/donald-trump-threat-kill-nafta-boosts-usmca/,Trump corners Democrats with threat to kill NAFTA: 'It is going to force Congress to act',2018-12-10,S.A. Miller,"Democratic congressional leaders are loath to acknowledge it , but President Trump has them cornered with his threat to terminate NAFTA if his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada isn ’ t approved .
Scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement without a replacement would deliver a heavy blow to the U.S. economy . In the short term , it would reduce real U.S. gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — by as much as $ 231 billion , more than 1 percent during the first five years , according to an analysis commissioned by the Business Roundtable .
“ Terminating NAFTA would have negative impacts on jobs , exports and output even after new supply chains are formed . In this longer run , we estimate that U.S. GDP would remain depressed by over 0.2 percent , permanently , ” said the report for the Business Roundtable , an association of chief executive officers from major U.S. corporations .
The impact on the U.S. GDP , about $ 19.3 trillion in 2017 , would depend on the reactions of Mexico and Canada . Alternative scenarios in the analysis pegged the reduced annual GDP at $ 119 billion to $ 231 billion , with job losses from 1.8 million to 3.6 million in the five-year window .
Sen. Charles E. Grassley , the Iowa Republican who next year will take charge of the Senate Finance Committee , which oversees trade agreements , said the president has Congress over a barrel .
“ It seems to me it is going to force Congress to act — even if you disagree with parts of it , ” he said in an interview on the “ Adams on Agriculture ” program on the American Ag Radio Network .
“ Now that is a hard-nosed approach , but sometimes a president has to use that if he wants to get things accomplished , ” Mr. Grassley said .
Capitol Hill Democrats shrugged off Mr. Trump ’ s threat and vowed to tinker with the proposed U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement ( USMCA ) , potentially derailing a deal that legislatures in all three countries must approve .
Mr. Trump and his counterparts in Mexico and Canada signed the agreement on Nov. 30 , capping a year of intense negotiations that produced a trade deal that many said would be impossible to make .
Two days after signing the accord in Buenos Aires while the three leaders were attending the Group of 20 summit , Mr. Trump put Congress on notice .
“ I will be formally terminating NAFTA shortly , ” he told reporters on the Air Force One flight back to Washington . “ Then Congress will have a choice of approving the USMCA , which is a phenomenal deal . Much , much better than NAFTA . A great deal . ”

Scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement without a replacement would deliver a heavy blow to the U.S. economy. In the short term, it would reduce real U.S. gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — by as much as $231 billion, more than 1 percent during the first five years, according to an analysis commissioned by the Business Roundtable.

“Terminating NAFTA would have negative impacts on jobs, exports and output even after new supply chains are formed. In this longer run, we estimate that U.S. GDP would remain depressed by over 0.2 percent, permanently,” said the report for the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers from major U.S. corporations.

The impact on the U.S. GDP, about $19.3 trillion in 2017, would depend on the reactions of Mexico and Canada. Alternative scenarios in the analysis pegged the reduced annual GDP at $119 billion to $231 billion, with job losses from 1.8 million to 3.6 million in the five-year window.

Sen. Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who next year will take charge of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade agreements, said the president has Congress over a barrel.

“It seems to me it is going to force Congress to act — even if you disagree with parts of it,” he said in an interview on the “Adams on Agriculture” program on the American Ag Radio Network.

“Now that is a hard-nosed approach, but sometimes a president has to use that if he wants to get things accomplished,” Mr. Grassley said.

Capitol Hill Democrats shrugged off Mr. Trump’s threat and vowed to tinker with the proposed U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), potentially derailing a deal that legislatures in all three countries must approve.

Mr. Trump and his counterparts in Mexico and Canada signed the agreement on Nov. 30, capping a year of intense negotiations that produced a trade deal that many said would be impossible to make.

Two days after signing the accord in Buenos Aires while the three leaders were attending the Group of 20 summit, Mr. Trump put Congress on notice.

“I will be formally terminating NAFTA shortly,” he told reporters on the Air Force One flight back to Washington. “Then Congress will have a choice of approving the USMCA, which is a phenomenal deal. Much, much better than NAFTA. A great deal.”

The president threatened to rip up NAFTA, which he called the “worst trade deal ever made.” The threat helped force Mexico and Canada to the negotiating table.

Mr. Trump has found more agreement with Democrats than his fellow Republicans in criticizing the 24-year-old NAFTA, which is blamed for shipping jobs to Mexico and hastening the demise of U.S. manufacturing.

Mrs. Pelosi said Democrats will fight for measures to accompany USMCA that enforce labor and environmental requirements, as well as legislation in Mexico to address wages and working conditions.

I have more confidence in Congress continuing to work with [U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer] than it would seem Trump does.”

Mr. Pascrell also called the agreement an “ongoing process.”

“Continuing the status quo of NAFTA is not an option. Too many jobs have been outsourced and wages lost to let the old agreement stand,” he said. “But simply withdrawing won’t do anything to raise wages here or in Mexico or reverse NAFTA’s destruction.”

Mr. Trump has the authority to terminate the deal under NAFTA’s Article 2205, which is the exit clause for member countries. Invoking it would begin a six-month waiting period before Mr. Trump could quit the deal.

Pat Toomey said . | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Trade Toomey : 'Absolutely painful ' China tariffs may be 'worth the price '
Sen. Pat Toomey on Sunday defended President Donald Trump amid the administration ’ s trade war with China , arguing that an eventual agreement with Beijing may be “ worth the price ” of the “ absolutely painful ” tariffs hammering American farmers .
“ I actually think the president is right to challenge China , ” the Pennsylvania Republican told host Chris Wallace on “ Fox News Sunday , ” adding that he classifies the Asian power “ in a distinct category separate from ” other U.S. competitors and adversaries .
“ China is the world ’ s second biggest economy . It ’ s a revisionist power . It ’ s now , for the first time , attempting to be able to project force . It ’ s intimidating neighbors . It ’ s disrupting American institutions . And it has engaged in some egregious economic behavior — the theft of intellectual property in various ways , ” Toomey said .
Tariffs are designed to get another country to change its approach to trade , but they also have an effect on consumers , raising prices on the imported goods they purchase .

Sen. Pat Toomey on Sunday defended President Donald Trump amid the administration’s trade war with China, arguing that an eventual agreement with Beijing may be “worth the price” of the “absolutely painful” tariffs hammering American farmers.

“I actually think the president is right to challenge China,” the Pennsylvania Republican told host Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” adding that he classifies the Asian power “in a distinct category separate from” other U.S. competitors and adversaries.

“China is the world’s second biggest economy. It’s a revisionist power. It’s now, for the first time, attempting to be able to project force. It’s intimidating neighbors. It’s disrupting American institutions. And it has engaged in some egregious economic behavior — the theft of intellectual property in various ways,” Toomey said.

Tariffs are designed to get another country to change its approach to trade, but they also have an effect on consumers, raising prices on the imported goods they purchase.

The US and China have finally - after almost two years of hostilities - signed a ""phase one"" deal. But it only covers the easier aspects of their difficult relationship, and only removes some of the tariffs.

The biggest hurdles are still to come, and could stand in the way of a second phase agreement - one that would in theory remove all of the tariffs, bringing some much needed relief for the global economy, which is in the interests of all of us.

What's not in the phase one deal tells us where the flashpoints are in the US-China relationship - and what could derail the second round of negotiations.

So what didn't make it into the agreement?

1. Industrial subsidies and 'Made in China 2025'

The deal doesn't address Beijing's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' programme, which is designed to help Chinese companies excel and become world-class leaders in emerging technologies. It also doesn't address the subsidies that China gives its state-owned enterprises, says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group.

Washington sees ""Made in China 2025"" as a direct threat to its supremacy in tech, saying that Chinese companies have only caught up with American ones - at times outpacing them - because they get unfair and outsized assistance from the Chinese government in the form of subsidies.

These were amongst the thorniest issues the Trump administration had with China, but they've been pushed to the phase two process Mr Triolo says, along with ""market access in sectors such as cloud services, cyber security and data governance issues"".

Beijing maintains it doesn't unfairly subsidise these industries or companies, but the reality is China isn't going to give up dominance in these sectors so easily.

2. Huawei

The trade deal won't reduce US pressure on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, with the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the company isn't a ""chess piece"" in the negotiations.

That will disappoint both Huawei and the Chinese government which have been furious over how Washington has linked the company's fate to the relationship between the US and China.

The Chinese firm became a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry and Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei's 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be used by Beijing to spy on customers. Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too.

Analysts tell me that's unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there's a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad.

3. Access for foreign financial services firms

While the agreement does talk about opening up market access for financial services firms, some analysts have said it doesn't go far enough to ensure they have equal market access.

China had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms. But Beijing isn't giving up much by doing that, because China's financial services sector is now dominated by domestic digital payment players.

Even if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it's hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed.

4. Enforcement and interpretation

The deal has a dispute resolution mechanism in place, which basically requires China - once a complaint has been made - to begin consultations with the US, with the onus on Beijing to resolve it.

But what the deal leaves out is ""how the US is going to monitor enforcement,"" says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute.

""American firms don't like to report intellectual property theft,"" he told me.""So in the first instance what mechanism is the US using to gather information on this. All that is in the document is consultations.""

The deal also leaves out how the two sides will interpret these key aspects of the agreement. Already, there are signs of differences. Chinese state media has suggested the dispute resolution mechanism isn't dictated by the US - not entirely in keeping with Washington's messaging.

This could indicate that even though there is an agreement in place, Beijing might ignore it, as Dan Harris of the China Law blog points out.

""The problem isn't the law,"" he says. ""It's that when something is important to China - some cutting edge technology that it wants - then those laws don't have any use at all.""

5. Further reductions in tariffs

The deal doesn't include a definitive timeline on when the tariffs that are still in place will go down.

According to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average tariffs on both sides are still up about 20% from pre-trade war levels - six times higher than when the dispute began. That means companies and consumers are still paying more.

Thornier issues pushed back

China's imports of American soybeans and other goods tumbled more than 26% in the first nine months of this year following tariff hikes and orders to importers to find other suppliers.

The Oct. 12 agreement helped to ease financial market jitters, but the two sides have yet to report progress on major disagreements over technology and other irritants following 13 rounds of talks.

Second, Trump appears—as has been alleged—to be engaging in a quid pro quo, asking Zelensky to assist him in pursuing those conspiracy theories, in exchange for help to Ukraine. Trump never puts it in plain terms—he’s too smart, and too experienced in shady business, to do that—but it requires willful blindness to miss what Trump is asking… Third, the call shows how Trump enlists the might of the U.S. government in his weird, personal, political schemes.”

David A. Graham, The Atlantic

“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… ‍ “In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”

China has hit back at President Donald Trump by announcing new trade tariffs on $60bn of US goods.

It comes after the US slapped duties on $200bn of Chinese imports to take effect from next Monday, escalating its trade war with Beijing.

China will target goods such as liquefied natural gas, produced in states loyal to the US president.

However, in a tweet, Mr Trump warned Beijing against seeking to influence the upcoming US midterm elections.

""There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!"" he said.

Aircraft, computers and textiles

Earlier he had suggested that this would mean further US tariffs on another $267bn worth of Chinese products. Such a move would mean roughly all of China's exports to the US would be subject to new duties.

The Chinese commerce ministry said it would impose its tariffs from 24 September - the date the US duties come into effect - but at lower rates than previously expected.

It will place an additional 5% in duty on US products including smaller aircraft, computers and textiles, and an extra 10% on goods such as chemicals, meat, wheat and wine.

By contrast, the US duties will apply to almost 6,000 items, making them the biggest round of trade tariffs yet from Washington.

They will affect handbags, rice and textiles, although some items such as smart watches and high chairs have been exempted.

They will start at 10% and increase to 25% from the start of next year unless the two countries agree a deal.

On Monday Mr Trump said the latest round of tariffs was in response to China's ""unfair trade practices"".

""We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices,"" he said.

Hasn't the US already imposed tariffs on China?

Yes. In fact, the latest round of US duties marks the third set of tariffs put into motion so far this year.

In July, the White House increased charges on $34bn worth of Chinese products. Then last month, the escalating trade war moved up a gear when the US brought in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn.

This latest round means that about half of all Chinese imports to the US are now subject to the new duties.

US companies have already said they are worried about the effect of higher costs on their businesses and warned of the risk of job cuts.

What items have been targeted?

Many everyday items such as suitcases, handbags, toilet paper and wool are included in this latest round of tariffs.

The list also includes food items from frozen cuts of meat, to almost all types of fish, soybeans, various types of fruit and cereal and rice.

Why are smart watches and high chairs exempt?

Why is the US doing this?

The White House says its tariffs are a response to China's ""unfair"" trade policies.

The import charges will make Chinese-made products more expensive - a move intended to convince US businesses and consumers to buy elsewhere.

US officials hope the risk to the Chinese economy will convince Beijing to change its policies.

But many US businesses are critical of the tariffs with farmers, manufacturers, retailers and other industry groups calling them taxes on American families.

How has China responded?

Before its latest round of tariffs, China had previously imposed duties on $50bn of US products in retaliation, targeting key parts of the president's political base, such as farmers.

The aim is to put pressure on businesses in states that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election.

The European Union has also used the tactic in its trade skirmishes with the US.

Are the two sides talking?

Not really. Talks between high-level officials ended in May without resolving the matter and efforts to restart discussions have failed.

US and China officials had discussed a new round of talks over the past week, but Mr Trump's latest move is likely to sour relations further.

Analysis:

Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent

The immediate objective of President Trump's action against China is to address what he calls the theft of American companies' technology, but it also plays into his wider concern about the US trade deficit.

He sees it as something that needs to be corrected and as the result of bad trade agreements and unfair trading by other countries.

The trouble is that a trade deficit is generally regarded as being the result of savings and investment decisions rather than trade policy. A country that spends more than it earns has a trade deficit.

President Trump's other policies include tax cuts that could increase government borrowing, which is equivalent to cutting national saving and could create a bigger trade deficit.

An editorial by epidemiologists in the New York Times estimated that 90 percent of coronavirus deaths in the United States could have been prevented if Trump issued social distancing policies two weeks earlier . If he instituted those policies even one week earlier , on March 9 , the 67,000 deaths so far could have been reduced by up to 60 percent .

If it was known that China was doing this in January, it’s unclear why the president still maintained throughout the month of February that nothing was wrong and the coronavirus was nothing more than the flu. Trump’s own CDC was warning in February that the virus was dangerous. Trump didn’t issue a social distancing recommendation until March 16.

The president has attempted to blame China for the COVID-19 outbreak but had Trump acted sooner, and it is estimated he could have saved thousands of lives.

An editorial by epidemiologists in the New York Times estimated that 90 percent of coronavirus deaths in the United States could have been prevented if Trump issued social distancing policies two weeks earlier. If he instituted those policies even one week earlier, on March 9, the 67,000 deaths so far could have been reduced by up to 60 percent.

As Conservative Max Boot explained, even if China behaved badly and did something wrong, the COVID-19 outbreak was revealed at the end of January. Why Trump downplayed the virus in February and refused to lock down the country until mid-March remains an unanswered question.

Suddenly, Washington is getting things done in bipartisan fashion. And that’s in spite of – or perhaps because of – the thoroughly partisan effort to impeach President Donald Trump.

Democrats and Republicans, in Congress and the White House, are under pressure to show accomplishments as a politically tumultuous year draws to a close and the 2020 election cycle ramps up.

Now, as the dust settles following a day of big news, there seems to be something for almost everybody: House Democrats have unveiled two articles of impeachment against President Trump, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his dealings with Ukraine. And bipartisan agreement has been reached on two major pieces of legislation, a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and the largest defense funding bill in American history.

If nothing else, the two major bipartisan agreements could help alleviate Americans’ growing sense that national institutions, including the federal government, are failing them.

The trade deal, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, hands President Trump bragging rights on one of his signature campaign issues – an issue that speaks directly to blue-collar workers, many of whom abandoned the Democratic Party in 2016 and voted for Mr. Trump.

But to some political analysts, it’s a risk Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to take. And, they add, in the process she won concessions on matters dear to the labor movement.

trade,CBS News,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-on-china-us-consumers-and-businesses-feel-impact-of-trade-war/,U.S. consumers and businesses -- not China -- bear the brunt of Trump's tariffs,,Rachel Layne,"U.S. tariffs imposed on China and other countries have resulted in higher prices and costs for American consumers and businesses , studies show .
Republican-leaning counties around the country have taken a bigger hit than other areas .
Overall , the U.S. economy lost an estimated $ 7.8 billion because of the tariffs imposed on China and other countries last year .
In renewing a threat to sharply raise tariffs this week on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods from China , President Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that the levies have had little impact on U.S. consumers -- it is the Chinese who are bearing the brunt of the trade war between the world 's two biggest economies , he claimed .
Yet research suggests otherwise , showing that American consumers and businesses are taking the biggest hit in the form of higher prices and costs . That 's especially true in areas of the country that typically vote for Republican candidates , like farming communities in the Midwest , according to one recent study by economists from UCLA , University of California , Berkeley , Columbia University and the World Bank .
`` The economic evidence to date on this is exactly the opposite of Trump 's statement , '' Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and host of the podcast TradeTalks tweeted . `` The impact of the 2018 tariffs has been passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices . China is NOT bearing the burden of Trump 's tariffs . ''
Mr. Trump said via Twitter that negotiations with China are progressing `` too slowly , '' and he threatened to jack up tariffs on $ 325 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent -- that would effectively impose a tariff on all Chinese products that enter the U.S .
As a result , American business that import items from China would face potentially higher costs . Tariffs are a tax that companies -- not countries -- pay on imported goods , for raw materials , parts and finished products . Companies facing higher costs for imports often pass those on to consumers in the form of higher prices . At the same time , the cost of goods the U.S. exports overseas may rise .
Take washing machines . Washers imported to U.S. were one of the first products to be subject to higher U.S. tariffs last year under the Trump administration 's protectionist trade stance . Washing machine prices rose 12 percent for U.S. consumers as foreign makers could n't shift production to other countries .

Republican-leaning counties around the country have taken a bigger hit than other areas.

Overall, the U.S. economy lost an estimated $7.8 billion because of the tariffs imposed on China and other countries last year.

In renewing a threat to sharply raise tariffs this week on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods from China, President Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that the levies have had little impact on U.S. consumers -- it is the Chinese who are bearing the brunt of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, he claimed.

Yet research suggests otherwise, showing that American consumers and businesses are taking the biggest hit in the form of higher prices and costs. That's especially true in areas of the country that typically vote for Republican candidates, like farming communities in the Midwest, according to one recent study by economists from UCLA, University of California, Berkeley, Columbia University and the World Bank.

""The economic evidence to date on this is exactly the opposite of Trump's statement,"" Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and host of the podcast TradeTalks tweeted. ""The impact of the 2018 tariffs has been passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices. China is NOT bearing the burden of Trump's tariffs.""

Companies, not countries, pay tariffs

Mr. Trump said via Twitter that negotiations with China are progressing ""too slowly,"" and he threatened to jack up tariffs on $325 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent -- that would effectively impose a tariff on all Chinese products that enter the U.S.

As a result, American business that import items from China would face potentially higher costs. Tariffs are a tax that companies -- not countries -- pay on imported goods, for raw materials, parts and finished products. Companies facing higher costs for imports often pass those on to consumers in the form of higher prices. At the same time, the cost of goods the U.S. exports overseas may rise.

Pricier washers and dryers

Take washing machines. Washers imported to U.S. were one of the first products to be subject to higher U.S. tariffs last year under the Trump administration's protectionist trade stance. Washing machine prices rose 12 percent for U.S. consumers as foreign makers couldn't shift production to other countries.

Retailers also raised the price of dryers by the same amount even though they weren't subject to tariffs, a separate study from economists from the University of Chicago and Federal Reserve found. In total, over the course of a year U.S. consumers ended up forking out an additional $1.5 billion to buy washers and dryers. That came to between $82 and $92 per appliance.

$3 billion in higher costs

Another study released this spring by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University and Princeton University found that the burden of Mr. Trump's tariffs fell entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imported products. By the end of last year, companies were paying $3 billion a month in higher tariffs and absorbing $1.4 billion a month in higher costs. The researchers noted ""that U.S. producers responded to reduced import competition by raising their prices.""

Notably, tariffs have barely grazed the $22 trillion U.S. economy, which continues grow at a steady clip. Without tariffs, though, the expansion would be even bigger, the UCLA-led group of economists suggested.

Tariffs have a lengthy—if not proud—history . Sugar tariffs are probably the most venerable example in this country of the general suckiness of such policies . In fact , they 're as old as this country . One of the first substantive laws Congress passed , in 1789 , included sugar-import tariffs . That may or may not have been a good idea at the time . America had just been won a costly war for independence that , I 've argued many times , was predicated in large part on battles over food taxation and food restrictions imposed on the colonies by Great Britain .
More recently , Pres . Ronald Reagan held his nose and accepted sugar tariffs as part of a budget deal , leading the N.Y. Times to dub Reagan 's capitulation `` a self-fired shot in the foot that seems sure to affect not only American consumers and American sugar growers , but foreign producers as well . ''
I 'm firmly of the belief that all tariffs suck . And rising prices only tells part of the story of why that 's the case . They cost jobs ; hurt domestic and foreign producers , consumers , and taxpayers ; put the petty interests of government over those of the public ; and are prone to spinning out of control . To paraphrase Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman , tariffs are bananas .
Tariffs tend to make almost no one better off and—thanks to the ability of other countries to retaliate—make most everyone worse off . They hurt those who engage in commerce—producers , employers , sellers , consumers , and taxpayers alike—at home and abroad .
Where will these tariffs end ? Maybe at the ballot box come fall . One Tennessee farmer who generally votes for GOP candidates says he 'll cast his vote this November for a Democrat , since `` Trump 's trade wars are hurting his family business—a sizable one with some 400 employees and 30,000 pigs .

Tariffs have a lengthy—if not proud—history. Sugar tariffs are probably the most venerable example in this country of the general suckiness of such policies. In fact, they're as old as this country. One of the first substantive laws Congress passed, in 1789, included sugar-import tariffs. That may or may not have been a good idea at the time. America had just been won a costly war for independence that, I've argued many times, was predicated in large part on battles over food taxation and food restrictions imposed on the colonies by Great Britain.

More recently, Pres. Ronald Reagan held his nose and accepted sugar tariffs as part of a budget deal, leading the N.Y. Times to dub Reagan's capitulation ""a self-fired shot in the foot that seems sure to affect not only American consumers and American sugar growers, but foreign producers as well.""

I'm firmly of the belief that all tariffs suck. And rising prices only tells part of the story of why that's the case. They cost jobs; hurt domestic and foreign producers, consumers, and taxpayers; put the petty interests of government over those of the public; and are prone to spinning out of control. To paraphrase Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, tariffs are bananas.

Tariffs tend to make almost no one better off and—thanks to the ability of other countries to retaliate—make most everyone worse off. They hurt those who engage in commerce—producers, employers, sellers, consumers, and taxpayers alike—at home and abroad.

Where will these tariffs end? Maybe at the ballot box come fall. One Tennessee farmer who generally votes for GOP candidates says he'll cast his vote this November for a Democrat, since ""Trump's trade wars are hurting his family business—a sizable one with some 400 employees and 30,000 pigs.""",www.reason.com,right,N3haoQcohEqZQt8S

The administration ’ s plan , which has yet to be formally released , would reportedly be aimed at stabilizing the agricultural industry through three programs :
Direct financial assistance for farmers . A purchase and distribution program , where the government buys up surplus agricultural products and redistributes them for low-income food assistance . A trade promotion program .

Zero tariffs. Wednesday's breakthrough with the European Union shows that, contrary to what his critics allege, Trump is not a protectionist; rather, he is using tariffs as a tool to advance a radical free-trade agenda.

Mr Trump first announced plans for the tariffs in March, but granted some exemptions while countries negotiated.

On Thursday, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said talks with the EU, Canada and Mexico had not made enough progress to warrant a further reprieve, meaning tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium have now come into effect.

On 18 May, the EU told the WTO it planned to impose counter measures affecting goods worth almost €3bn. If approved by the 28 member states, the sanctions will come into effect in mid-June.

What will the economic effect be?

Canada, Mexico and the EU together exported $23bn (£17bn) worth of steel and aluminium to the US in 2017 - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year.

European firms have said they fear lower US demand for foreign steel will divert shipments to Europe.

Analysts at IHS Markit expect the effects to be distributed across a wide range of markets, limiting the effect on steel prices outside the US.

That leaves America to bear the brunt of the economic impact, which economists say will appear in the form of higher prices and job losses - as many as 470,000 by one estimate.

Steel prices in the US have already risen due to the uncertainty and may increase as the tariffs hit imports.

What is a trade deal?

Trade deals involve two or more countries agreeing a set of terms by which they buy and sell goods and services from each other.

Deals are designed to increase trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers. These barriers might include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas, or differing regulations on things such as safety or labelling.

trade,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/13/8208017/obama-trans-pacific-partnership,Why the Obama administration is fighting for a trade deal its liberal allies hate,2015-03-13,"Ezra Klein, German Lopez, Tara Golshan, Alexia Fernández Campbell, P.R. Lockhart, Ella Nilsen, Nicole Narea","It 's hard to find a voice on the left willing to speak up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal . Unions are freezing donations to Democrats in protest of it . Elizabeth Warren is fighting it . Robert Reich is campaigning against it , as is Joseph Stiglitz . Paul Krugman is a soft no , and he wonders : `` Why , exactly , should the Obama administration spend any political capital — alienating labor , disillusioning progressive activists — over such a deal ? ''
I 'm currently in the undecided camp — until there 's a final text I can run by experts , it 's hard to say anything definitive — but in recent weeks , I 've asked a version of Krugman 's question to a number of Obama administration officials intimately involved in crafting the deal : why are they so committed to this agreement , and why are they having so much trouble selling their usual allies on it ?
1 . The first thing the administration says is that this is a good deal : when the text is finalized and released publicly , people will be surprised by how different from its predecessors this trade deal really is . They note that Obama ran for office promising to renegotiate NAFTA , and while that did n't happen , this deal fully reflects his thinking about what went wrong with NAFTA — particularly in the weak enforceability of its labor and environmental standards .
2 . The need to wait for the text to be finalized has created an asymmetry between critics and supporters : opponents of the agreement can oppose it now , but for the most part potential supporters want to wait for the agreement to be done to back it , as they need to make sure the language they like does n't change . There are some exceptions to this rule — a letter from a gaggle of top economists from past White Houses , for instance — but overall , the administration thinks it 's just in a hard position until there 's a final document to show .
3 . That said , the unions really do know a lot about what 's in this deal . And they still oppose it . Pressed on this , the White House 's answer is one that liberals have heard from the Obama administration before , and that they never fail to find frustrating : TPP may not be perfect , but it 's a lot better than the alternative .
4 . In this case , there really is an alternative . The past major trade deals largely predated the rise of China . But TPP is happening even as China pushes its own trade deal : one with much weaker labor and environmental standards . As Larry Summers writes , `` The TPP should be judged not against the hypothetical past in which U.S. workers did not face foreign competition but in the context of a world in which trade integration in Asia is already happening — with or without the United States . ''
5 . Here 's how the White House sees it : there will either be a trade deal with America at the core of it that forces countries like Vietnam and Malaysia to live up to labor and environmental standards the Obama administration finds acceptable , or there will be a trade deal with China at the core of it that forces countries like Vietnam and Malaysia to live up to labor and environmental standards China finds acceptable .

6 . There 's also a bigger foreign policy objective here . TPP is central to the Obama administration 's long-heralded `` pivot to Asia . '' Trade deals tend to get coded as economic policy rather than foreign policy , but the Obama administration sees that as a function of the Cold War and the post-9/11 era militarizing foreign policy . Americans need to realize that the competition with China , etc. , will be about using economic policy as an effective tool of statecraft .
7 . This is , the Obama administration thinks , a `` put up or shut up '' moment for America . We talk a big game about wanting to be the global leader and fearing that China , with its autocratic government and abysmal labor and environmental standards , will supersede our influence in other developing countries . But if we 're going to stop that , we need our leadership to be more than talk . If America 's trade deal collapses while China 's succeeds , it will convince a lot of these countries that America 's political system does n't work smoothly enough to provide the kind of leadership we once did .
8 . One really important dimension of the debate around TPP is intellectual property protections . This is an area where American businesses feel hugely disadvantaged overseas , and the administration thinks it 's giving them a big win . But there are economists — Krugman is one — who think IP protections have already gone too far , and even if it gives Paramount or Pfizer a bit more protection , the result will be to make the world poorer without obviously making American workers much richer .
For the record , I do n't know yet whether TPP is a good deal . I have n't seen final text , much less had a chance to run it by experts . Both sides are mostly arguing the big picture around trade , intellectual property , and the like , but trade deals are heavily about details . And we just do n't know all the details yet .
On this , I agree with Brad DeLong , who writes , `` It is foolish to debate whether a trade agreement that has not yet been negotiated is a good idea and should be ratified . Such a debate should properly begin only once there is something to analyze . '' That said , DeLong goes on to explain why he supports the basic outlines of the TPP , so I 'll make a few broad points , as well .
I 'm skeptical of the sheer size of modern trade deals and the opaque process that creates them . The negotiation process is n't quite as secretive as some think — the congressional briefings are constant , and the advisory committees are sprawling — but it is insanely complex .
The result is that even where there is transparency , it 's a form of transparency that can only really be navigated by politically sophisticated , highly motivated actors — which is to say it 's a form of transparency that quickly becomes a venue for lobbying . That 's one reason these deals end up including so much ... stuff . The process is constructed in such a way that the negotiators get a lot of special pleading from individual industries and interests . Responding to those requests feels like responding to the public , but it is n't , and it leads to deals jam-packed with individual provisions that look a lot like giveaways .
But I also think the context of a trade deal like TPP is very different from the context of a trade deal like NAFTA . David Autor , an economist who has done some of the seminal work on the way trade has harmed America 's middle class , coauthored a piece in the Washington Post that makes the point well : the costs of trade have come in America 's manufacturing sector , and those jobs are n't coming back . What 's more salient for the American economy is labor and environmental standards elsewhere , IP protections ( which I very much worry will be taken too far ) , customs and border questions , etc . There are real gains to America to getting these rules right .
Another way to put this is the global trade regime is oriented toward physical industries America has lost , rather than information industries where America leads . TPP could , in its best form , help level that playing field a bit ( though only a bit — both the costs and benefits of trade deals tend to be overstated ) . But the only way to know that will be to read the final text .
— The official outline of the deal , as published by the US Trade Representative 's office .","It's hard to find a voice on the left willing to speak up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal. Unions are freezing donations to Democrats in protest of it. Elizabeth Warren is fighting it. Robert Reich is campaigning against it, as is Joseph Stiglitz. Paul Krugman is a soft no, and he wonders: ""Why, exactly, should the Obama administration spend any political capital — alienating labor, disillusioning progressive activists — over such a deal?""

I'm currently in the undecided camp — until there's a final text I can run by experts, it's hard to say anything definitive — but in recent weeks, I've asked a version of Krugman's question to a number of Obama administration officials intimately involved in crafting the deal: why are they so committed to this agreement, and why are they having so much trouble selling their usual allies on it?

1. The first thing the administration says is that this is a good deal: when the text is finalized and released publicly, people will be surprised by how different from its predecessors this trade deal really is. They note that Obama ran for office promising to renegotiate NAFTA, and while that didn't happen, this deal fully reflects his thinking about what went wrong with NAFTA — particularly in the weak enforceability of its labor and environmental standards.

2. The need to wait for the text to be finalized has created an asymmetry between critics and supporters: opponents of the agreement can oppose it now, but for the most part potential supporters want to wait for the agreement to be done to back it, as they need to make sure the language they like doesn't change. There are some exceptions to this rule — a letter from a gaggle of top economists from past White Houses, for instance — but overall, the administration thinks it's just in a hard position until there's a final document to show.

3. That said, the unions really do know a lot about what's in this deal. And they still oppose it. Pressed on this, the White House's answer is one that liberals have heard from the Obama administration before, and that they never fail to find frustrating: TPP may not be perfect, but it's a lot better than the alternative.

4. In this case, there really is an alternative. The past major trade deals largely predated the rise of China. But TPP is happening even as China pushes its own trade deal: one with much weaker labor and environmental standards. As Larry Summers writes, ""The TPP should be judged not against the hypothetical past in which U.S. workers did not face foreign competition but in the context of a world in which trade integration in Asia is already happening — with or without the United States.""

5. Here's how the White House sees it: there will either be a trade deal with America at the core of it that forces countries like Vietnam and Malaysia to live up to labor and environmental standards the Obama administration finds acceptable, or there will be a trade deal with China at the core of it that forces countries like Vietnam and Malaysia to live up to labor and environmental standards China finds acceptable. Which would you prefer?

6. There's also a bigger foreign policy objective here. TPP is central to the Obama administration's long-heralded ""pivot to Asia."" Trade deals tend to get coded as economic policy rather than foreign policy, but the Obama administration sees that as a function of the Cold War and the post-9/11 era militarizing foreign policy. Americans need to realize that the competition with China, etc., will be about using economic policy as an effective tool of statecraft.

7. This is, the Obama administration thinks, a ""put up or shut up"" moment for America. We talk a big game about wanting to be the global leader and fearing that China, with its autocratic government and abysmal labor and environmental standards, will supersede our influence in other developing countries. But if we're going to stop that, we need our leadership to be more than talk. If America's trade deal collapses while China's succeeds, it will convince a lot of these countries that America's political system doesn't work smoothly enough to provide the kind of leadership we once did.

8. One really important dimension of the debate around TPP is intellectual property protections. This is an area where American businesses feel hugely disadvantaged overseas, and the administration thinks it's giving them a big win. But there are economists — Krugman is one — who think IP protections have already gone too far, and even if it gives Paramount or Pfizer a bit more protection, the result will be to make the world poorer without obviously making American workers much richer.

For the record, I don't know yet whether TPP is a good deal. I haven't seen final text, much less had a chance to run it by experts. Both sides are mostly arguing the big picture around trade, intellectual property, and the like, but trade deals are heavily about details. And we just don't know all the details yet.

On this, I agree with Brad DeLong, who writes, ""It is foolish to debate whether a trade agreement that has not yet been negotiated is a good idea and should be ratified. Such a debate should properly begin only once there is something to analyze."" That said, DeLong goes on to explain why he supports the basic outlines of the TPP, so I'll make a few broad points, as well.

I'm skeptical of the sheer size of modern trade deals and the opaque process that creates them. The negotiation process isn't quite as secretive as some think — the congressional briefings are constant, and the advisory committees are sprawling — but it is insanely complex.

The result is that even where there is transparency, it's a form of transparency that can only really be navigated by politically sophisticated, highly motivated actors — which is to say it's a form of transparency that quickly becomes a venue for lobbying. That's one reason these deals end up including so much ... stuff. The process is constructed in such a way that the negotiators get a lot of special pleading from individual industries and interests. Responding to those requests feels like responding to the public, but it isn't, and it leads to deals jam-packed with individual provisions that look a lot like giveaways.

But I also think the context of a trade deal like TPP is very different from the context of a trade deal like NAFTA. David Autor, an economist who has done some of the seminal work on the way trade has harmed America's middle class, coauthored a piece in the Washington Post that makes the point well: the costs of trade have come in America's manufacturing sector, and those jobs aren't coming back.

Another way to put this is the global trade regime is oriented toward physical industries America has lost, rather than information industries where America leads. TPP could, in its best form, help level that playing field a bit (though only a bit — both the costs and benefits of trade deals tend to be overstated). But the only way to know that will be to read the final text.

''
Beijing 's move came after the U.S. raised duties Friday on $ 200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 % , up from 10 % . In doing so , American officials accused China of backtracking on commitments it made in earlier negotiations . The same day , trade talks between the two countries broke up without an agreement .
On Twitter , Trump warned Xi that China `` will be hurt very badly '' if it does n't agree to a trade deal . Trump tweeted that Beijing `` had a great deal , almost completed , & you backed out ! ''
The rising trade hostilities could damage the economies of both countries . The tariff increases already in place have disrupted trade in such American products as soybeans and medical equipment and sent shockwaves through other Asian economies that supply Chinese factories .
Still , the two countries have given themselves something of an escape hatch : The higher Chinese tariffs do n't kick in for 2½ weeks . The U.S. increases apply to Chinese goods shipped since Friday , and those shipments will take about three weeks to arrive at U.S. seaports and become subject to the higher charges .
Also , both countries have indicated more talks are likely . Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday that China has invited U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Beijing . But nothing has been scheduled . And Trump said Monday that he expects to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in late June at the G-20 summit in Osaka , Japan .
The president has repeatedly insisted that increased tariffs on Chinese goods do n't hurt American consumers . But Kudlow , head of the president 's National Economic Council , acknowledged over the weekend that U.S. consumers and businesses will bear some of the costs .
In the U.S. , prices of soybeans , targeted by Chinese tariffs last year , fell Monday to a 10-year low on fears of a protracted trade war .
In a statement , American Soybean Association President Davie Stevens , a soybean farmer from Clinton , Kentucky , expressed frustration that `` the U.S. has been at the table with China 11 times now and still has not closed the deal . What that means for soybean growers is that we 're losing . Losing a valuable market , losing stable pricing , losing an opportunity to support our families and our communities . ''
Trump told reporters Monday that a new program to relieve U.S. farmers ' pain is `` being devised right now '' and predicted that they will be `` very happy . '' The administration last year handed farmers aid worth $ 11 billion to offset losses from trade conflicts .
The president 's allies in Congress scrambled to limit the damage to farm country .
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said it is time for U.S. allies to `` get in the game '' to push China to the negotiating table . `` China needs to get with it , '' he said . `` You ca n't move these goalposts like they 're moving them and expect to be respected . ''
The highest tariffs announced by China will apply to industrial chemicals , electronic equipment , precision machinery and hundreds of food products .
Beijing is running out of U.S. imports to penalize because of the lopsided trade balance between the world 's two largest economies . Chinese regulators have instead targeted American companies in China by slowing down the clearing of shipments through customs and the processing of business licenses .
Oxford Economics calculated that the higher tariffs will reduce the U.S. economy by 0.3 % in 2020 , a loss of $ 490 per American household .
Similarly , forecasters have warned that the U.S. tariff increases could set back a Chinese recovery that had appeared to be gaining traction . Growth in the world 's second-largest economy during the January-through-March period held steady at 6.4 % compared with a year earlier , supported by higher government spending and bank lending .
The tensions `` raise fresh doubts about this recovery path , '' Morgan Stanley economists said .
The latest U.S. duties could knock 0.5 percentage points off annual Chinese economic growth , and that could widen to 1 percentage point if both sides extend penalties to all of each other 's exports , economists say . That would pull annual growth below 6 % , raising the risk of politically dangerous job losses .
China 's state media tried to reassure businesses and consumers that the ruling Communist Party has the means to respond .
`` There is nothing to be afraid of , '' said the party newspaper People 's Daily . `` The U.S.-instigated trade war against China is just a hurdle in China 's development process . It is no big deal . ''
Trump has threatened to extend tariffs to the remaining $ 300 billion or so in Chinese tariffs that have n't been targeted yet , but told reporters Monday : `` I have not made that decision yet . ''
The president started raising tariffs last July over complaints China steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology and unfairly subsidizes Chinese businesses that are striving to become global leaders in robotics and other technology .
A stumbling block has been U.S. insistence on an enforcement mechanism with penalties to ensure Beijing carries out its commitments .
Trump said on Monday that his administration was planning to provide about $ 15 billion in aid to help U.S. farmers whose products may be targeted with tariffs by China amid a deepening trade war .
`` We 're going to take the highest year , the biggest purchase that China has ever made with our farmers , which is about $ 15 billion , and do something reciprocal to our farmers so our farmers can do well , '' Trump told reporters at the White House .
He did not provide any more details on what kind of an aid package it would be .
American farmers , a key constituency of Trump , have been among the hardest hit in the trade war . Soybeans are the most valuable U.S. farm export , and shipments to China dropped to a 16-year low in 2018 , while soybean futures prices last week fell this week to 11-year lows .
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Friday that Trump had asked him to create a plan to help American farmers cope with the heavy impact of the U.S.-China trade war on agriculture .
A new aid program would be the second round of assistance for farmers , after the Department of Agriculture 's $ 12 billion plan last year to compensate for lower prices for farm goods and lost sales stemming from trade disputes with China and other nations .
`` Out of the billions of dollars that we 're taking ( in in tariffs on Chinese imports ) , a small portion of that will be going to our farmers , because China will be retaliating , probably to a certain extent , against our farmers , '' Trump said .
On Monday , China said it would impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. goods , including frozen vegetables and liquefied natural gas , striking back in its trade war with Washington after Trump warned it not to .
Last year Beijing imposed tariffs on imports of U.S. agricultural goods , including soybeans , grain sorghum and pork as retribution for U.S. levies . Soybean exports to China have plummeted over 90 percent and sales of U.S. soybeans elsewhere failed to make up for the loss .
While farmers have largely remained supportive of Trump , many have called for an imminent end to the trade dispute , which propelled farm debt to the highest levels in decades and worsened credit conditions for the rural economy .
Trump also said Monday afternoon that he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 gathering in Japan next month .
Trump said his meeting with Xi could be fruitful as their trade dispute escalated after failing to reach agreement during high-level talks last week .
Trump warned China against “ substantial ” retaliation for new U.S. tariffs after his escalating trade war with Beijing rocked global financial markets .
“ There can be some retaliation but it can ’ t be very substantial , ” Trump told reporters on Monday during a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban .
Earlier Monday , China announced it would impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. goods including frozen vegetables and liquefied natural gas , striking back in its trade war with Washington after Trump warned it not to .
The move , widely expected after the United States last week raised tariffs on $ 200 billion in Chinese imports , heightened fears the world 's two largest economies were spiraling into a no-holds-barred dispute that could derail the global economy .
China 's finance ministry said it plans to set import tariffs ranging from 5 % to 25 % on 5,140 U.S. products on a revised $ 60 billion target list . It said the tariffs will take effect on June 1 .
`` China 's adjustment on additional tariffs is a response to U.S. unilateralism and protectionism , '' the ministry said . `` China hopes the U.S. will get back to the right track of bilateral trade and economic consultations and meet with China halfway . ''
The White House and U.S. Trade Representative 's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
Global equities , which slumped last week on the escalating tensions , fell sharply , with major U.S. indexes down more than 2 percent . Investors sought safety in U.S. bonds while the U.S. dollar slipped against a basket of currencies .
`` It 's clear that there is a lot of nervousness around the U.S.-China trade negotiations and concern that it 's really deteriorating pretty significantly , and that 's impacting all areas of markets , '' said Kristina Hooper , chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York .
Earlier on Monday , Trump told China not to intensify the trade dispute and urged its leaders , including President Xi Jinping , to continue to work to reach a deal . `` China should not retaliate-will only get worse , '' he said on Twitter .
`` I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you do n't make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries , '' Trump wrote .
The U.S. president , who has embraced protectionism as part of an `` America First '' agenda , stepped up his verbal attacks on China on Friday after two days of high-level trade talks in Washington ended with the two sides at an apparent stalemate .
Trump has accused Beijing of reneging on commitments it made during months of trade negotiations , which Beijing has denied .
China tried to delete commitments from a draft agreement that its laws would be changed to enact new policies on issues from intellectual property protection to forced technology transfers . That dealt a major setback to the talks .
In the middle of the talks last week , Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese goods to 25 % from 10 % . Those tariffs affect 5,700 categories of Chinese products including internet modems , routers and similar devices .
In the wake of the failure of the talks , Trump ordered U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to begin the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China , a move that would affect another $ 300 billion worth of goods .
Chinese state media kept up a steady drum beat of strongly worded commentary on Monday , reiterating that China 's door to talks was always open , but vowing to defend the country 's interests and dignity .
In a commentary , state television said the effect on the Chinese economy from the U.S. tariffs was `` totally controllable . ''
`` It 's no big deal . China is bound to turn crisis to opportunity and use this to test its abilities , to make the country even stronger . ''
Trump has defended the U.S. tariff hike and said he was in `` absolutely no rush '' to finalize a deal with China .
Despite Trump 's insistence China will absorb the cost of the tariffs , it is U.S. businesses that will pay them and likely pass them on to consumers . It may take three or four months for that pain to be felt , economists and industry consultants say .
At the same time , the Trump administration has rolled out up to $ 12 billion in aid for U.S. farmers hurt by Chinese tariffs against U.S. soybeans and other agricultural products during the 10-month trade war , and indicated that more could be on the way .
Separately , the U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday six Chinese technology entities were among those it had banned from exporting sensitive U.S. technologies and other goods .
Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday there was a `` strong possibility '' Trump will meet China 's Xi at a G20 summit in Japan in late","Sending Wall Street into a slide, China announced higher tariffs Monday on $60 billion worth of American goods in retaliation for President Donald Trump's latest penalties on Chinese products.

Trump has accused Beijing of reneging on commitments it made during months of trade negotiations, which Beijing has denied.

China tried to delete commitments from a draft agreement that its laws would be changed to enact new policies on issues from intellectual property protection to forced technology transfers. That dealt a major setback to the talks.

In the middle of the talks last week, Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. Those tariffs affect 5,700 categories of Chinese products including internet modems, routers and similar devices.

In the wake of the failure of the talks, Trump ordered U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to begin the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China, a move that would affect another $300 billion worth of goods.

China said it would ""never surrender"" to external pressure.

Chinese state media kept up a steady drum beat of strongly worded commentary on Monday, reiterating that China's door to talks was always open, but vowing to defend the country's interests and dignity.

In a commentary, state television said the effect on the Chinese economy from the U.S. tariffs was ""totally controllable.""

""It's no big deal. China is bound to turn crisis to opportunity and use this to test its abilities, to make the country even stronger.""

Trump has defended the U.S. tariff hike and said he was in ""absolutely no rush"" to finalize a deal with China.

Despite Trump's insistence China will absorb the cost of the tariffs, it is U.S. businesses that will pay them and likely pass them on to consumers. It may take three or four months for that pain to be felt, economists and industry consultants say.

At the same time, the Trump administration has rolled out up to $12 billion in aid for U.S. farmers hurt by Chinese tariffs against U.S. soybeans and other agricultural products during the 10-month trade war, and indicated that more could be on the way.

Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday six Chinese technology entities were among those it had banned from exporting sensitive U.S. technologies and other goods.

Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday there was a ""strong possibility"" Trump will meet China's Xi at a G20 summit in Japan in late

That threatens to create a dangerous reality for supporters of a sweeping trade deal with Pacific Rim nations: that it will become more politically tenable for Republicans to be against trade promotion authority legislation than for it.

The chorus of GOP complaints — striking considering the typically close ties between Republican leadership and Big Business — is coming from all over the Capitol. But it’s loudest on the House side.

David Stewart, a top aide to Speaker John Boehner, voiced the frustration of Boehner’s office during a meeting Friday with officials from business lobby groups, telling them their effort is falling short. During the meeting at the offices of the Business Roundtable, Stewart said unions are outworking the business groups on calls to GOP lawmakers’ offices.

“The lobbying effort on the Hill has been abysmal,” one senior GOP aide said. “Calls and letters into member offices are running 10 to 1 against TPA. This is an uphill fight already given the lack of trust in the president and the general unpopularity of TPA, and the current lobbying effort has not made it any easier. If TPA passes in the House it will be despite the downtown coalition and the president, not because of them.”

Of course, trade politics are tricky — the debate over TPA has triggered concerns ranging from job losses in individual House districts to currency manipulation — and it’s not just the business community that’s struggling. President Barack Obama hasn’t yet been able to build enough Democratic support to get the fast-track bill across the finish line. He faces a big obstacle in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is vehemently opposed to the legislation as it’s currently written.

But the unions’ decades-old network is outfoxing groups like the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, critics say. After a brief setback last week, the bill is expected to clear the Senate late this week or perhaps after the Memorial Day recess. Democrats are looking to stall final passage in the hopes of giving opponents more time to mobilize for the closer fight in the House, where the legislation currently lacks the votes to pass.

Another GOP aide said the ratio of opposing calls to those in favor of the trade agreement is even more worrisome, 25 to 1 or worse.

“No one is happy with what they’re doing on trade,” the staffer complained. “The business community is doing a great job of sending trade association letters to the Hill, but they aren’t doing much out in the country. I think they think they’re killing it, which just shows you how bad they are.”

Quite frankly, they’ve had a 20-year head start.”

Madden said the business community needs to be “unrelenting and keep improving our efforts.”

TPA is a critical component of Obama’s economic agenda. The legislation would empower the president to cut free trade deals that Congress could approve or reject on an up-or-down vote but not amend. Some House Republicans are concerned with the perception that TPA would hand the White House too much additional power. Democrats are mostly concerned about the effects of free trade on American workers.

Trade supporters acknowledge the uphill battle in the House but believe they’re building support. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other lawmakers supportive of trade have been walking through the policy details with lawmakers.

It’s a dangerous development for those hoping for passage of TPA sometime this summer. House Republicans estimate that 170 to 180 of their members will support the legislation. GOP leadership says roughly three dozen Democrats will need to support the bill to ensure passage.

The timing of votes on TPA in the House is up in the air. The Senate is moving toward approving the measure possibly next week. The House is out of session during the last week of May, and there is some hope that TPA could come to the floor sometime in June.

The G-7 gathering was held for finance chiefs in advance of the summit of those countries ’ top leaders . The G-7 , a club of industrialized nations formed around common interests , rarely issues such strong condemnation aimed at one of its members .
More unlikely is the fact that the target of the criticism is the U.S. , which has done more than any other country to establish the free-trade principles upon which the global economy functions today .
“ I do not ever recall an instance where the U.S. was singled out for rebuke , ” said Daniel Price , managing director of Rock Creek Global Advisors , who represented the George W.

Ms. Hills said she thinks the administration has taken the wrong strategy on China by fighting first with allies over steel and aluminum , especially given that U.S. complaints about China mirrored those of Washington ’ s friends .
“ It would have been more effective if we joined with six of our closest allies and acted together , ” she said . “ Instead , we went after our allies and acted unilaterally ” on China .
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , who attended the G-7 finance officials ’ meeting , denied the U.S. was left outside the consensus on all matters and insisted Washington is playing a central role . “ I don ’ t think in any way the U.S. is abandoning its leadership in the global economy , ” Mr. Mnuchin said .

The G-7 gathering was held for finance chiefs in advance of the summit of those countries’ top leaders. The G-7, a club of industrialized nations formed around common interests, rarely issues such strong condemnation aimed at one of its members.

More unlikely is the fact that the target of the criticism is the U.S., which has done more than any other country to establish the free-trade principles upon which the global economy functions today.

“I do not ever recall an instance where the U.S. was singled out for rebuke,” said Daniel Price, managing director of Rock Creek Global Advisors, who represented the George W. Bush administration for G-7, G-20 and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summits. “Traditionally, the U.S. has been a driver of G-7 unity, and typically leads efforts to reach consensus. On trade, the U.S. has quite dramatically become a source of discord and division.”

As the source of the consternation, Mr. Trump now must face G-7 leaders in five days’ time. As he does, other countries are adopting a wary stance even if they have so far been spared by Mr. Trump.

“Trump is trying to get rid of bilateral trade deficits,” said former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, a Republican critic of the Trump administration’s trade strategy. “He’s lining up [trade disputes] one by one.”

Ms. Hills said she thinks the administration has taken the wrong strategy on China by fighting first with allies over steel and aluminum, especially given that U.S. complaints about China mirrored those of Washington’s friends.

“It would have been more effective if we joined with six of our closest allies and acted together,” she said. “Instead, we went after our allies and acted unilaterally” on China.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who attended the G-7 finance officials’ meeting, denied the U.S. was left outside the consensus on all matters and insisted Washington is playing a central role. “I don’t think in any way the U.S. is abandoning its leadership in the global economy,” Mr. Mnuchin said.

“These are our most important allies,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We’ve had longstanding relationships with all these countries that are very important across all different aspects.”

The US trade gap with the rest of the world jumped to a 10-year high of $621bn (£472.5bn) last year, dealing a blow to President Donald Trump's deficit reduction plan.

The trade deficit is the difference between how much goods and services the US imports from other countries and how much it exports.

Reducing the gap is a key plank of Mr Trump's policies.

But in 2018, the US exported fewer goods compared with how much it bought.

Mr Trump claims that the US is being ""ripped off"" by other nations and wants countries to lower their tariffs on US goods and buy more of them.

However, official data shows that while exports of US goods and services rose by $148.9bn last year, imports jumped by $217.7bn.

It means that the gap is the widest since 2008, when the global financial crisis hit and the US fell into recession.

'Tariff man'

The US is currently locked in a trade battle with China over what it claims are unfair trade practices, resulting in tit-for-tat tariff increases on each others' goods.

Both nations are in discussions and there is speculation they could reach an agreement by the end of March.

New data shows that the trade gap between the US and China widened last year by $43.6bn to $419.2bn as exports of American products and services fell, but imports from China rose.

Analysis: Michelle Fleury, BBC North America business correspondent

It was one of Donald Trump's signature campaign promises.

Back in June 2016, he stood before a large crowd in Monessen, Pennsylvania and said that as President, he would reduce America's ballooning trade deficit.

He called it ""a political and politician-made disaster"" and said ""it can be corrected"".

Only it hasn't exactly turned out that way.

Last year, Mr Trump introduced tariffs on steel and aluminium from around the globe and on a range of imports from China.

The idea was that the tariffs would make imports more expensive, thereby discouraging Americans from buying foreign goods and services and shrinking the trade deficit.

But the opposite has happened.

Instead, Donald Trump goes into the presidential re-election race having failed to deliver on his campaign promise to close the US trade deficit.

Part of the problem is Mr Trump's own tax policies. They boosted US consumption and a lot of that spending went abroad.

This happened as growth was slowing in other parts of the world, contributing to a rising dollar. That made US exports more expensive and less competitive.

Of course, an economic downturn would help reduce the trade deficit.

But who wants that?

Mr Trump warned in December that if the two countries failed to reach an agreement on trade, he would take action, dubbing himself ""a Tariff Man"".

'National security'

The deficit between the US and the European Union also increased in 2018, up by $17.9bn to $169.3bn.

Following the same trend as with China, US export growth to the EU was eclipsed by imports of European goods and services to America, which last year rose to $487.9bn.

What’s next?,2018-12-04,"Jen Kirby, German Lopez, Tara Golshan, Alexia Fernández Campbell, P.R. Lockhart, Ella Nilsen, Nicole Narea","President Donald Trump says he ’ s finally going to do what he ’ s long threatened : tear up NAFTA .
Trump ’ s warning came as he left the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires , Argentina , this weekend . There , Trump , along with former Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , signed the replacement for NAFTA — called the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement , or USMCA , as Trump has rebranded it stateside .
“ I ’ ll be terminating it within a relatively short period of time , ” Trump said Saturday of the original NAFTA . “ We get rid of NAFTA . It ’ s been a disaster for the United States . ”
Trump ’ s threat is intended for Congress — especially Democrats , who have objected to elements of the renegotiated trilateral trade pact with Mexico and Canada . The House of Representatives and the Senate must approve the USMCA , and both parties have voiced reservations . Democrats don ’ t think it does enough to protect American jobs and workers , and some Republicans see the new deal as too protectionist .
The withdrawal threat is a Trumpian ultimatum : Take my trade deal , or there ’ s no deal at all .
Trump loathes NAFTA . He has called it the “ worst trade deal ever signed. ” He has threatened to tear up the trade pact in the past , but was ultimately persuaded to renegotiate the agreement , leading to the USMCA .
Trump has touted the USMCA as a historic trade deal , even though it ’ s really an updated and revised version of NAFTA — which itself is a nearly 25-year-old agreement negotiated by George H.W . Bush .
So Trump got a new deal and declared victory . And now he ’ s wielding NAFTA as a political cudgel .
The president ’ s threat is serious , but it faces a few potential pitfalls . Trump can likely unilaterally pull out of NAFTA , but Congress has a lot more power on trade than on other international agreements , and experts say lawmakers could find ways to protect NAFTA or limit Trump on trade in other ways .
Even if Trump invokes Article 2205 of NAFTA — the mechanism a country can use to leave the pact — the process is not immediate : It requires a six-month of withdrawal , after which Trump can decide to leave .
That six-month timeline matters . Congress could certainly take up and vote on USMCA before then , in 2019 . US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , the administration ’ s chief trade negotiator , told reporters last week he wants the USMCA to pass with strong bipartisan support , which might not happen if the administration tries to strong-arm Congress .
The administration has threatened NAFTA withdrawal before to pressure Congress , most notably in the spring of this year . It never pulled the trigger , though , and there are good reasons why .
Congress does have a degree of leverage , and even if Trump succeeds , ripping apart the original NAFTA would generate incredible economic uncertainty , potentially dealing a tremendous blow to business and manufacturing and putting jobs at risk . Trump could blame Congress all he wants , but the chaos would lead back to him .
Trump might not risk it in the end . Then again , in trade as in everything else , Trump has embraced unorthodox — and rarely predicable — tactics .
Trump can likely unilaterally pull out of NAFTA by invoking Article 2205 , which gives Canada and Mexico a six-month notice of the president ’ s intent to terminate the agreement . This doesn ’ t end NAFTA outright ( Mexico and Canada can still stay in ) , and , in theory , Trump could change his mind in the six-month time window .
But after that it all becomes murky . Experts say that Congress likely has some ability to protect NAFTA , or can use its powers to curtail Trump on trade elsewhere .
“ The very simplest reason is that the Constitution gives Congress the power to set terms of trade , not the executive branch , ” Todd Tucker , a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute , a liberal think tank based in New York , told me .
Congress — just as it needs to do for the USMCA — had to approve NAFTA . It did so through the 1993 NAFTA Implementation Act , which is how Congress implements the provisions of NAFTA under US law .
There ’ s nothing in that law that says a president needs permission from Congress to terminate NAFTA , Gary Clyde Hufbauer , a trade policy expert at the Peterson Institute of International Economics , told me . Which means Trump is probably free to do what he wants . But the president can ’ t singlehandedly scrap that implementation law , which means some of the provisions would remain in force .
The end result , Tucker said , could be a kind of “ zombie NAFTA ” where the US isn ’ t formally part of NAFTA , but still trades much like it is .
This is by no means a promising scenario , and it wouldn ’ t cushion the US from the economic uncertainty that would come from terminating a trillion-dollar trade agreement .
Exactly how all of this would play out is untested and up for debate — which means that if Trump does attempt to withdraw from NAFTA , he ’ s almost definitely going to be challenged in court .
Congress does have some remedies . It could potentially pass legislation to preempt actions by the administration and that prevents unilateral withdrawal from NAFTA . Or lawmakers could give themselves more power over trade and take some away from the president .
The self-declared Tariff Man isn ’ t going to be keen on giving up authority , so these options of would likely require enough bipartisan support in Congress to withstand a presidential veto , or be attached to must-pass legislation like , say , an upcoming spending bill .
Trump hasn ’ t formally sent a notice of withdrawal to Canada or Mexico yet . Larry Kudlow , the National Economic Council director , told reporters Monday that he thinks Trump “ is trying to light a fire under Congress , ” though he added he hadn ’ t talked about it in much detail with the president .
The lame-duck Congress — which will be spending most of its last days in office trying to avert a government shutdown — likely won ’ t take up USMCA this session , which means it falls to the new , divided Congress in 2019 .
And Congress is apparently still undecided , though Trump has said USMCA has gotten “ great reviews ” that are “ sooo much better than NAFTA. ” Both Republicans and Democrats have found something to dislike in USMCA .
Great reviews on the USMCA - sooo much better than NAFTA ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 30 , 2018
Democrats largely support new labor provisions in the trade deal , but have worried they won ’ t go far enough to protect American workers , and that labor and environmental standards lack sufficient enforcement mechanisms .
“ Whatever they ’ re calling it now , it has some kind of gobbledygook name — the trade agreement formerly known as Prince , no , I mean , formerly known as NAFTA — is a work in progress , ” soon-to-be Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) said last week , adding that there aren ’ t yet “ enough enforcement reassurances regarding provisions that relate to workers and to the environment . ”
Republicans have also offered lukewarm reviews , and have objected to some of the more restrictive provisions on the auto industry as well as the scaling back of a NAFTA provision that let corporations sue governments . There are also more local concerns , including a complaint from Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) that the deal would hurt some Florida farmers .
Republicans , however , are unlikely to buck the president on a signature trade accomplishment — especially since the USMCA alleviated fears among pro-free trade Republicans that Trump would abandon NAFTA altogether before a new deal could be negotiated .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) , who will chair the Senate Finance Committee that will usher the USMCA through the chamber in 2019 , even gave a sort-of endorsement of the president ’ s hardball strategy . “ That ’ s a hard-nosed approach , but sometimes the president has to use that if he wants to get things accomplished , ” Grassley said on a Monday radio show , according to the Washington Post .
Congress also is limited in how much it can tweak USMCA , though there is some wiggle room . The USMCA has been signed , but there are still a few more steps in the process before implementing legislation — which makes sure the USMCA matches up with and is adopted as US law — is introduced in the House and the Senate .
Once it is , the legislation will be “ fast-tracked , ” and lawmakers will have 90 days to approve it with an up or down vote , meaning they can ’ t make changes or add any amendments .
Trade Representative Lighthizer has said there ’ s no chance that the administration will reopen negotiations with Mexico and Canada . But the administration drafts the implementing legislation , typically with the consultation of Congress , which means some bipartisan concerns could be addressed about the enforcement of some provisions , which might ease its passage . ( Lobbyists will certainly be weighing in as well . )
Lighthizer said at the G20 meeting that he ’ s open to addressing lawmakers ’ issues in this process . He also told reporters last week he wants the USMCA to pass with strong bipartisan support . “ We ’ ll get the support of a lot of Democrats , a very high number of Democrats , ” Lighthizer said . “ Absolutely , just no doubt about it . ”
The problem , of course , is that bipartisan displeasure with USMCA doesn ’ t mean consensus . If the administration accedes to any demands from one side , it ’ ll shore up opposition on the other side .
Which might be the purpose of the NAFTA withdrawal threat : to prevent either Democrats or Republicans from asking too much , and forcing them to accept the the USMCA in more or less its current form .
But Trump might need to be wary of pushing it too far . In 2008 , House Democrats , then in the majority , accused President George W. Bush of trying to jam through a free trade agreement with Colombia , saying the administration didn ’ t do enough to address protections for US workers and human-rights abuses in Colombia .
Then-Speaker Pelosi responded by blocking the agreement from “ fast track ” consideration altogether , taking it off the accelerated timeline and putting the deal in jeopardy . ( President Barack Obama ended up taking up a version of the Colombia agreement in his first term . )
A Colombia trade deal isn ’ t as massive or as critical as the USMCA , and the US relationship with both Canada and Mexico is far more strategically and economically important . But Pelosi could threaten to un-fast-track the USMCA if the Trump administration pushes Democrats too far .
“ It ’ s completely discretionary — as long as she has the majority of support for it , she could do it for whatever reason she wants , ” Tucker said . “ [ It ] doesn ’ t have to be a certain legal reasoning , it could just be , ‘ I don ’ t like Trump today . ’ ”
There are political risks for Pelosi and the Democrats if they do this , though , particularly if Trump terminates NAFTA and blames Democrats for the mess .
But Trump unilateral move on NAFTA — which could have an immediate impact , particularly on financial markets — might unite both Republicans and Democrats who ’ ve hesitated to stand up to Trump ’ s bullying on trade so far . If Trump decides to kill NAFTA without another deal in place , Tucker told me , “ whatever political goodwill there is at the margins from Senate Republicans or House Democrats will go away pretty quickly . ”","President Donald Trump says he’s finally going to do what he’s long threatened: tear up NAFTA.

“I’ll be terminating it within a relatively short period of time,” Trump said Saturday of the original NAFTA. “We get rid of NAFTA. It’s been a disaster for the United States.”

Trump’s threat is intended for Congress — especially Democrats, who have objected to elements of the renegotiated trilateral trade pact with Mexico and Canada. The House of Representatives and the Senate must approve the USMCA, and both parties have voiced reservations. Democrats don’t think it does enough to protect American jobs and workers, and some Republicans see the new deal as too protectionist.

The withdrawal threat is a Trumpian ultimatum: Take my trade deal, or there’s no deal at all.

Trump loathes NAFTA. He has called it the “worst trade deal ever signed.” He has threatened to tear up the trade pact in the past, but was ultimately persuaded to renegotiate the agreement, leading to the USMCA.

Trump has touted the USMCA as a historic trade deal, even though it’s really an updated and revised version of NAFTA — which itself is a nearly 25-year-old agreement negotiated by George H.W. Bush.

So Trump got a new deal and declared victory. And now he’s wielding NAFTA as a political cudgel.

The president’s threat is serious, but it faces a few potential pitfalls. Trump can likely unilaterally pull out of NAFTA, but Congress has a lot more power on trade than on other international agreements, and experts say lawmakers could find ways to protect NAFTA or limit Trump on trade in other ways.

Even if Trump invokes Article 2205 of NAFTA — the mechanism a country can use to leave the pact — the process is not immediate: It requires a six-month of withdrawal, after which Trump can decide to leave.

That six-month timeline matters. Congress could certainly take up and vote on USMCA before then, in 2019. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the administration’s chief trade negotiator, told reporters last week he wants the USMCA to pass with strong bipartisan support, which might not happen if the administration tries to strong-arm Congress.

The administration has threatened NAFTA withdrawal before to pressure Congress, most notably in the spring of this year. It never pulled the trigger, though, and there are good reasons why.

Congress does have a degree of leverage, and even if Trump succeeds, ripping apart the original NAFTA would generate incredible economic uncertainty, potentially dealing a tremendous blow to business and manufacturing and putting jobs at risk. Trump could blame Congress all he wants, but the chaos would lead back to him.

Trump might not risk it in the end. Then again, in trade as in everything else, Trump has embraced unorthodox — and rarely predicable — tactics.

So can Trump really do this?

Trump wants to withdraw from NAFTA. But it’s complicated.

Trump can likely unilaterally pull out of NAFTA by invoking Article 2205, which gives Canada and Mexico a six-month notice of the president’s intent to terminate the agreement. This doesn’t end NAFTA outright (Mexico and Canada can still stay in), and, in theory, Trump could change his mind in the six-month time window.

But after that it all becomes murky. Experts say that Congress likely has some ability to protect NAFTA, or can use its powers to curtail Trump on trade elsewhere.

“The very simplest reason is that the Constitution gives Congress the power to set terms of trade, not the executive branch,” Todd Tucker, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank based in New York, told me.

Congress — just as it needs to do for the USMCA — had to approve NAFTA. It did so through the 1993 NAFTA Implementation Act, which is how Congress implements the provisions of NAFTA under US law.

There’s nothing in that law that says a president needs permission from Congress to terminate NAFTA, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a trade policy expert at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, told me. Which means Trump is probably free to do what he wants. But the president can’t singlehandedly scrap that implementation law, which means some of the provisions would remain in force.

The end result, Tucker said, could be a kind of “zombie NAFTA” where the US isn’t formally part of NAFTA, but still trades much like it is.

This is by no means a promising scenario, and it wouldn’t cushion the US from the economic uncertainty that would come from terminating a trillion-dollar trade agreement.

Exactly how all of this would play out is untested and up for debate — which means that if Trump does attempt to withdraw from NAFTA, he’s almost definitely going to be challenged in court.

Congress does have some remedies. It could potentially pass legislation to preempt actions by the administration and that prevents unilateral withdrawal from NAFTA. Or lawmakers could give themselves more power over trade and take some away from the president.

The self-declared Tariff Man isn’t going to be keen on giving up authority, so these options of would likely require enough bipartisan support in Congress to withstand a presidential veto, or be attached to must-pass legislation like, say, an upcoming spending bill.

Congress (and Nancy Pelosi) has some leverage

Trump hasn’t formally sent a notice of withdrawal to Canada or Mexico yet. Larry Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, told reporters Monday that he thinks Trump “is trying to light a fire under Congress,” though he added he hadn’t talked about it in much detail with the president.

The lame-duck Congress — which will be spending most of its last days in office trying to avert a government shutdown — likely won’t take up USMCA this session, which means it falls to the new, divided Congress in 2019.

And Congress is apparently still undecided, though Trump has said USMCA has gotten “great reviews” that are “sooo much better than NAFTA.” Both Republicans and Democrats have found something to dislike in USMCA.

Great reviews on the USMCA - sooo much better than NAFTA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2018

Democrats largely support new labor provisions in the trade deal, but have worried they won’t go far enough to protect American workers, and that labor and environmental standards lack sufficient enforcement mechanisms.

“Whatever they’re calling it now, it has some kind of gobbledygook name — the trade agreement formerly known as Prince, no, I mean, formerly known as NAFTA — is a work in progress,” soon-to-be Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said last week, adding that there aren’t yet “enough enforcement reassurances regarding provisions that relate to workers and to the environment.”

Republicans have also offered lukewarm reviews, and have objected to some of the more restrictive provisions on the auto industry as well as the scaling back of a NAFTA provision that let corporations sue governments. There are also more local concerns, including a complaint from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) that the deal would hurt some Florida farmers.

Republicans, however, are unlikely to buck the president on a signature trade accomplishment — especially since the USMCA alleviated fears among pro-free trade Republicans that Trump would abandon NAFTA altogether before a new deal could be negotiated.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who will chair the Senate Finance Committee that will usher the USMCA through the chamber in 2019, even gave a sort-of endorsement of the president’s hardball strategy. “That’s a hard-nosed approach, but sometimes the president has to use that if he wants to get things accomplished,” Grassley said on a Monday radio show, according to the Washington Post.

Congress also is limited in how much it can tweak USMCA, though there is some wiggle room. The USMCA has been signed, but there are still a few more steps in the process before implementing legislation — which makes sure the USMCA matches up with and is adopted as US law — is introduced in the House and the Senate.

Once it is, the legislation will be “fast-tracked,” and lawmakers will have 90 days to approve it with an up or down vote, meaning they can’t make changes or add any amendments.

Trade Representative Lighthizer has said there’s no chance that the administration will reopen negotiations with Mexico and Canada. But the administration drafts the implementing legislation, typically with the consultation of Congress, which means some bipartisan concerns could be addressed about the enforcement of some provisions, which might ease its passage. (Lobbyists will certainly be weighing in as well.)

Lighthizer said at the G20 meeting that he’s open to addressing lawmakers’ issues in this process. He also told reporters last week he wants the USMCA to pass with strong bipartisan support. “We’ll get the support of a lot of Democrats, a very high number of Democrats,” Lighthizer said. “Absolutely, just no doubt about it.”

The problem, of course, is that bipartisan displeasure with USMCA doesn’t mean consensus. If the administration accedes to any demands from one side, it’ll shore up opposition on the other side.

Which might be the purpose of the NAFTA withdrawal threat: to prevent either Democrats or Republicans from asking too much, and forcing them to accept the the USMCA in more or less its current form.

But Trump might need to be wary of pushing it too far. In 2008, House Democrats, then in the majority, accused President George W. Bush of trying to jam through a free trade agreement with Colombia, saying the administration didn’t do enough to address protections for US workers and human-rights abuses in Colombia.

Then-Speaker Pelosi responded by blocking the agreement from “fast track” consideration altogether, taking it off the accelerated timeline and putting the deal in jeopardy. (President Barack Obama ended up taking up a version of the Colombia agreement in his first term.)

A Colombia trade deal isn’t as massive or as critical as the USMCA, and the US relationship with both Canada and Mexico is far more strategically and economically important. But Pelosi could threaten to un-fast-track the USMCA if the Trump administration pushes Democrats too far.

“It’s completely discretionary — as long as she has the majority of support for it, she could do it for whatever reason she wants,” Tucker said. “[It] doesn’t have to be a certain legal reasoning, it could just be, ‘I don’t like Trump today.’”

There are political risks for Pelosi and the Democrats if they do this, though, particularly if Trump terminates NAFTA and blames Democrats for the mess.

But Trump unilateral move on NAFTA — which could have an immediate impact, particularly on financial markets — might unite both Republicans and Democrats who’ve hesitated to stand up to Trump’s bullying on trade so far. If Trump decides to kill NAFTA without another deal in place, Tucker told me, “whatever political goodwill there is at the margins from Senate Republicans or House Democrats will go away pretty quickly.”",www.vox.com,left,AtsgsKFw7MPvvisk

As an ex-politician, Frank has a certain freedom that his colleagues still in Congress lack to advance a politically sophisticated argument that gets away from talking points.

Frank's basic argument:

Trade deals tend to increase income inequality, even if they also increase GDP. Combined with a strong welfare state, trade deals can lead to prosperity for all. Barack Obama and congressional Democrats stand for a strong welfare state. Business lobby groups and congressional Republicans do not. Business lobby groups and congressional Republicans are really eager to pass TPP.

If the White House read complaints about TPP in light of this syllogism, I think it would make a lot more sense to them. It's true that a lot of the concerns are pretty hypothetical and may not come to pass. But the critics are highlighting possible downside risk to things they care about. In exchange for that risk, there's a lot of upside for a number of US companies.

But there isn't the kind of upside that Frank is talking about. You have a Democratic White House pushing a huge priority for elements of the business community and not asking for anything in exchange.

'Counter-productive'

The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market.

Analysis: Tariffs, the forgotten people and Trump

Trump talked about the forgotten people, white working-class folks, at his inauguration.

But the plans to impose tariffs will hurt individuals in the farm belt, an important part of his base. Recently, I visited Missouri, driving past soybean fields, and heard people talk about the way China would retaliate, imposing tariffs on soybeans.

White House aides have warned Trump about implications of his policies. One official told me they'd haul in maps to show him rural states and how they'd be affected.

Under pressure from retailers to prevent a move that would likely have caused prices of popular consumer goods to spike , the President 's team came to him during a meeting last week with a warning . Applying new tariffs on all Chinese imports , they cautioned , could effectively `` ruin Christmas , '' according to people familiar with the matter .
It was a tactic that worked : Trump announced the tariffs would be delayed until December 15 .
It was one back-down amid a grueling trade war that Trump insists will eventually benefit Americans -- and will demonstrate his toughness on China . And while it caused markets to soar on Tuesday , the gains were erased a day later amid new fears of an impending recession .
As signals mount of a global slowdown -- spurred partly by the trade war -- Trump and his advisers are increasingly looking for ways to prevent economic anxieties from reaching Americans before next year 's presidential election
He 's relying on a team that is often at odds with one another and which has undergone multiple changes over the past several months . Trump now finds himself surrounded less and less by those who guided his administration 's economic policy for its first two-and-a-half years as concerns about a recession grow inside the West Wing .
Trump and his campaign are counting on a robust economy to get him reelected . The voters who approve of Trump 's performance in office say the No . 1 reason why is because of the economy .
With reelection on his mind , Trump boasted about the recent performance of the stock market during a campaign rally in New Hampshire Thursday night , where he asserted that even Americans who do n't like him have `` no choice but to vote '' for him , or else the economy will collapse .
`` You have no choice but to vote for me because your 401 ( k ) , everything is going to be down the tubes , '' he told the crowd . `` Whether you love me or hate me , you 've got to vote for me . ''
JUST WATCHED While stocks tumble , Trump tweets Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH While stocks tumble , Trump tweets 02:58
The importance of the economy to his political future has long been an underlying theme of Trump 's discussions with his team , people familiar with the conversations said , even as the make-up of that team changes over time .
His chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow , who is approaching two years on the job , is expected to leave in the coming months . His top economist Kevin Hassett exited with a promise to be `` a resource ... from the outside . '' He is fielding complaints from aides about Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , according to officials .
Trump has even lashed out at one of his most loyal Cabinet secretaries , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , over stalled trade talks with China , the officials said . Mnuchin is dealing with an exodus of his own at the Treasury Department , with multiple top aides leaving in recent months .

A statement from the Ministry of Finance did n't mention the delay .","(CNN) As President Donald Trump's trade advisers were searching last week for a strategy to forestall his threatened tariffs on China , they struck upon a novel approach: appeal to his Christmas cheer.

Under pressure from retailers to prevent a move that would likely have caused prices of popular consumer goods to spike, the President's team came to him during a meeting last week with a warning. Applying new tariffs on all Chinese imports , they cautioned, could effectively ""ruin Christmas,"" according to people familiar with the matter.

It was a tactic that worked: Trump announced the tariffs would be delayed until December 15.

It was one back-down amid a grueling trade war that Trump insists will eventually benefit Americans -- and will demonstrate his toughness on China. And while it caused markets to soar on Tuesday, the gains were erased a day later amid new fears of an impending recession.

As signals mount of a global slowdown -- spurred partly by the trade war -- Trump and his advisers are increasingly looking for ways to prevent economic anxieties from reaching Americans before next year's presidential election

He's relying on a team that is often at odds with one another and which has undergone multiple changes over the past several months. Trump now finds himself surrounded less and less by those who guided his administration's economic policy for its first two-and-a-half years as concerns about a recession grow inside the West Wing.

Trump and his campaign are counting on a robust economy to get him reelected. The voters who approve of Trump's performance in office say the No. 1 reason why is because of the economy.

With reelection on his mind, Trump boasted about the recent performance of the stock market during a campaign rally in New Hampshire Thursday night, where he asserted that even Americans who don't like him have ""no choice but to vote"" for him, or else the economy will collapse.

""You have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes,"" he told the crowd. ""Whether you love me or hate me, you've got to vote for me.""

Evolving economic team

The importance of the economy to his political future has long been an underlying theme of Trump's discussions with his team, people familiar with the conversations said, even as the make-up of that team changes over time.

His chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who is approaching two years on the job, is expected to leave in the coming months. His top economist Kevin Hassett exited with a promise to be ""a resource ... from the outside."" He is fielding complaints from aides about Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, according to officials.

Trump has even lashed out at one of his most loyal Cabinet secretaries, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, over stalled trade talks with China, the officials said. Mnuchin is dealing with an exodus of his own at the Treasury Department, with multiple top aides leaving in recent months.

Trump has since turned to more hardline aides such as Peter Navarro, the hardline trade and manufacturing adviser, who defend his tough moves on China and assure him there will be an economic rebound.

Trump has shown an affinity for aides with an eye toward the political implications of economic decisions rather than in-depth knowledge of economic policy, the people said. He's also grown annoyed in briefings when the discussion becomes overly technical or in the weeds.

Mnuchin, who headed the finance operation for Trump's campaign, remains the President's closest adviser on economic issues, according to people familiar with the team's dynamics, even as Trump complains about the lack of progress on trade talks which Mnuchin oversees.

That's partly due to his longevity in the administration, the people said. But Trump also views his success in the private sector as an implicit testament to his economic advice.

trade,Wall Street Journal - News,1,http://www.wsj.com/articles/obamas-trade-agenda-faces-crucial-votes-in-house-1434101402,Obama to Make Capitol Hill Plea to Democrats on Trade Agenda,,"Kristina Peterson, Kristina.Peterson Wsj.Com","WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Friday to House Democrats in an 11th-hour bid to shore up support for his trade agenda ahead of a series of crucial votes .
In a rare visit to Capitol Hill , Mr. Obama delivered his closing argument to a Democratic caucus sharply divided over whether to support legislation that would grant the president fast-track authority for a Pacific trade deal—and extend aid to U.S. workers who lose their jobs because of foreign trade .
The House was expected to begin voting midday Friday on two contentious measures , with both expected to face razor-thin margins as a week of last-minute negotiations wound down .
Mr. Obama grounded his message in personal experience , telling lawmakers that his actions were aimed at lifting up American workers . But many Democrats remained opposed to the fast-track bill Friday morning , and some said Mr. Obama ’ s argument relied on simply trusting him .
“ The president said , ‘ I know steelworkers in the South Side of Chicago who lost their jobs and everything I do is for them. ’ Well , I was born and raised in Detroit and I represent Minneapolis , so I don ’ t really think his emotional tie to displaced workers is greater than mine or anybody else ’ s , ” said Rep. Keith Ellison ( D. , Minn. ) , co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus , who plans to oppose both key trade measures Friday . “ I really disagree with him on this more and more . ”
Lawmakers said Mr. Obama boiled down his argument to “ play it straight ” and not use legislative gambits to bring down a complicated package of trade bills
“ He made a very powerful statement . It was about Democrats voting according to their own conscience and doing the right thing , ” said Rep. Michael Honda ( D. , Calif. ) , who opposes the trade package .
Passage of the trade legislation would deliver a rare , second-term political gift from a GOP-controlled Congress to Mr. Obama—who squared off against labor groups in a bruising Democratic battle—as well as to business groups and Republican leaders who put aside their suspicion of the White House to advocate for the trade legislation .
The president ’ s excursion to Capitol Hill comes after a surprise appearance Thursday night at the congressional baseball game . There , he made a personal pitch to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif . )
Approval of fast track would give Mr. Obama the power to submit trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote , without amendments , as previous presidents have done . Such power would ease passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a near-final deal between the U.S. and 11 other nations around the Pacific Ocean that would cover nearly 40 % of the world economy .
The Senate approved trade legislation late last month , but its fate remained in jeopardy in the House as Democrats Thursday night raised late concerns over the bill , which many in the party oppose .
In the latest twist , many Democrats were expected to oppose a measure extending a workers ’ assistance program long championed by their party . Democrats had balked at a provision in the Senate bill that pays for the program with cuts to Medicare providers .
In a deal painstakingly negotiated and refined this week by Mrs. Pelosi and Speaker John Boehner ( R. , Ohio ) , the program , known as Trade Adjustment Assistance , or TAA , would be funded by a different source . But some Democrats still had qualms because the fix would be made through a separate piece of legislation , and they worried the structure of the deal could open them up to political attacks over the Medicare cuts .
The House will hold two fast-track votes Friday , one on the portion of the Senate bill that deals with worker aid legislation and—if that passes—one on the part of the bill providing fast-track powers to Mr. Obama . The two issues were split up in a procedural maneuver known as “ dividing the question ” to allow conservatives opposed to the workers aid to vote against it . The chamber will also vote on altering and passing a customs and enforcement bill already passed by the Senate .
Lawmakers said Mr. Obama entreated them not to sink the workers ’ aid program just to derail the fast-track provisions . The workers ’ assistance program expires at the end of September and many Democrats worried that this is their best opportunity to extend it .
“ For us as a party to threaten to bring [ TAA ] down and face the risk that we will lose it in its entirety in the future because the other side won ’ t bring it up again , we would own that then as a party , ” said Rep. Ron Kind ( D. , Wis. ) , chairman of the New Democrat Coalition , a group of more centrist , business-friendly Democrats . “ We would have to go home and look into the faces of those workers who aren ’ t caught up in all the political squabbles of Washington and wondering why we ’ re not there to help them get back on their feet again . ”
But Democrats who vote for the trade legislation could face political repercussions heading into next year ’ s elections .
Jim Dean , chairman of Democracy for America , a progressive political-action committee , warned Democrats against supporting either the workers ’ aid program or the fast-track measure .
“ We will not lift a finger or raise a penny to protect you when you ’ re attacked in 2016 , we will encourage our progressive allies to join us in leaving you to rot , and we will actively search for opportunities to primary you with a real Democrat , ” Mr. Dean said in a statement Friday .
The notion of fast-tracking a trade bill has also met with resistance from conservative Republicans , many of them hesitant to help a president they have clashed with over health care , immigration and other issues .
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan ( R. Wis. ) , an influential conservative , has put much of his own political capital on the line as he has sought to build support for the trade legislation .
“ A yes vote would be a huge win for conservatives , free-market principles and American leadership , ” Mr. Ryan wrote in an editorial published late Thursday in the Washington Examiner . “ Many of the president ’ s critics are rightly concerned that he too often keeps Congress in the dark . But [ the fast-track measure ] will turn on the lights . ”
Passage of both measures would send fast-track legislation straight to Mr. Obama ’ s desk , ending the uncertain congressional support that is seen as crucial to completing the Pacific trade deal .
If fast track becomes law , the trading partners—including Japan and Vietnam—could wrap up the TPP in coming weeks . Still , complicated bureaucratic requirements mean the TPP is unlikely to come to a final up-or-down vote in Congress before the end of the year , and could come well into next year .
Even if fast track passes , the later fight on the Pacific trade deal could turn out to be longer and more politically divisive if it occurs in the spotlight of the 2016 election cycle , officials and trade experts say . Besides the TPP , the fast-track legislation could expedite potential trade deals with the European Union and other trading partners for the next six years .
Failure of the trade legislation Friday would mark a decisive victory for unions , who launched an aggressive campaign to defeat the legislation in final weeks , including releasing ads attacking individual lawmakers and threatening to take revenge in future elections .
To counter that , Mr. Obama has indicated he will lend his support to lawmakers who backed him on trade .
Rep. Scott Peters ( D. , Calif. ) , who Thursday hadn ’ t decided yet how he would vote , said Mr. Obama had called him two or three times to discuss the topic .
“ He ’ s generally said that he ’ ll have the back of people who support him on this so I ’ ll find out what that means if I vote yes , ” said Mr. Peters . “ It ’ s a tough vote for me because my district ’ s very trade-dependent , but there ’ s a lot of fear about what happens if we vote for TPA . ”

The House will hold two fast-track votes Friday, one on the portion of the Senate bill that deals with worker aid legislation and—if that passes—one on the part of the bill providing fast-track powers to Mr. Obama.

Six tough questions answered.,2015-05-12,Francine Kiefer,"The Obama administration has a tough sell convincing Congress to grant it “ fast track ” trade negotiating authority so it can complete negotiations on the biggest regional trade deal in United States history – the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement , involving a total of 12 nations ( though not China ) .
The administration sees this as a tremendous opportunity for economic growth . It wants fast track – which would require Congress only an up-or-down vote on a final agreement – to help it secure the best deal it can . Opponents , mostly Democrats but some Republicans , too , say fast track and TPP will cost America jobs . But supporters say their approach is “ new and improved . ”
Below are some of the critics ’ chief concerns , and how fast track and TPP supporters respond :
Critics say free trade kills jobs . Business says it creates them . However , it ’ s not that simple .
Most economists agree that broadening trade results in economic growth , but benefits are shared unevenly .
“ Trade liberalization promotes overall economic growth among trading partners but … there are both winners and losers , ” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in an April 2015 report . It ’ s also extremely difficult to calculate how a trade deal affects job creation and loss “ due to a lack of data and important theoretical and practical matters , ” CRS said .
In reviewing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement , CRS found that `` NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters . ''
The Obama White House admits that while the overall benefits of trade expansion “ may be large ” they may also be “ unevenly distributed. ” Trade , therefore , “ can also have adverse effects for some workers ” the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) said in “ The Economic Benefits of US Trade , ” a report issued earlier this month .
So the White House is arguing to members of Congress that policies the administration supports , such as investment in infrastructure , worker training , and education , can offset jobs lost as a result of trade deals .
Trade adjustment assistance ( TAA ) programs provide help beyond traditional jobless benefits for workers displaced by trade . Displaced workers get help to train for a new career . Without such extra help , the thinking goes , these workers might find new jobs but have to take a big cut in pay – or they might drop out of the job market entirely .
The programs are also designed to boost chances of passing trade legislation , drawing in some Democrats who might otherwise be in the `` no '' camp . In a separate bill , TAA has been beefed up to raise benefits and to include service sector workers for the first time .
Whether TAA works , however , is a matter of debate . One 2012 Labor Department study found that , after four years , participants had earnings comparable to a group of non-TAA job losers .
That can be viewed as bad news ( even with the help , they are n't doing any better than other people recovering from joblessness ) . Or as good news ( this is a particularly hard-hit group of workers , who might have fared worse without the training ) .
Politically , “ If TAA made even a relatively modest contribution to the ease of enacting free-trade policies , the program ’ s benefits would outweigh its costs , '' said the report .
When countries such as China and Japan artificially lower the value of their currencies , it costs Americans jobs because foreign imports become cheaper and US exports more expensive . So critics want language in the fast-track bill against currency manipulation .
The bill ’ s supporters don ’ t dispute the dangers . That ’ s why , for the first time , fast-track legislation makes the issue a “ negotiating objective ” for the administration .
But an enforcement mechanism is too strong a remedy to include in the bill , the administration says , claiming that it would derail trade negotiations . It could also endanger America ’ s ability to manage its own currency , and lead to retaliation and trade wars , US officials say . They point to modest success in recent years in pressuring China to increase the value of its currency .
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D ) of New York , who calls currency manipulation the “ most significant trade challenge this country faces , ” succeeded in getting a currency amendment in a related customs bill . It ’ s not yet clear what will happen to this measure or other attempts to address the issue .
Don ’ t know what ’ s in the TPP ? That ’ s because it ’ s “ top secret , ” criticizes Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D ) of Massachusetts , a vocal opponent of fast track .
That was a complaint that her colleague , Sen. Ron Wyden ( D ) of Oregon heard a lot at town halls . As a result , “ I really went to the mat on these secrecy issues , ” Senator Wyden said at a recent Monitor breakfast .
Senator Wyden , who is the administration ’ s point man on trade in the Senate , points out that with the fast-track bill , the full text of the TPP and any other trade agreements will be public for the first time – 60 days before Congress starts voting on it . Under fast track , any member of Congress can have access to classified negotiating texts . Members can attend negotiating rounds or be briefed by the administration on request .
That ’ s not good enough for Senator Warren . She ’ s pushing a petition that tells US trade officials : “ No vote on a fast-track for trade agreements until the American people can see what ’ s in this TPP deal. ” Members of Congress also complain about restricted access for their staffs , on whom they heavily rely .

By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy","The Obama administration has a tough sell convincing Congress to grant it “fast track” trade negotiating authority so it can complete negotiations on the biggest regional trade deal in United States history – the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, involving a total of 12 nations (though not China).

The administration sees this as a tremendous opportunity for economic growth. It wants fast track – which would require Congress only an up-or-down vote on a final agreement – to help it secure the best deal it can. Opponents, mostly Democrats but some Republicans, too, say fast track and TPP will cost America jobs. But supporters say their approach is “new and improved.”

Below are some of the critics’ chief concerns, and how fast track and TPP supporters respond:

No. 1 concern: job loss

Critics say free trade kills jobs. Business says it creates them. However, it’s not that simple.

Most economists agree that broadening trade results in economic growth, but benefits are shared unevenly.

“Trade liberalization promotes overall economic growth among trading partners but … there are both winners and losers,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in an April 2015 report. It’s also extremely difficult to calculate how a trade deal affects job creation and loss “due to a lack of data and important theoretical and practical matters,” CRS said.

In reviewing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, CRS found that ""NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.""

The Obama White House admits that while the overall benefits of trade expansion “may be large” they may also be “unevenly distributed.” Trade, therefore, “can also have adverse effects for some workers” the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) said in “The Economic Benefits of US Trade,” a report issued earlier this month.

So the White House is arguing to members of Congress that policies the administration supports, such as investment in infrastructure, worker training, and education, can offset jobs lost as a result of trade deals.

Assistance for the displaced: Is it enough?



Trade adjustment assistance (TAA) programs provide help beyond traditional jobless benefits for workers displaced by trade. Displaced workers get help to train for a new career. Without such extra help, the thinking goes, these workers might find new jobs but have to take a big cut in pay – or they might drop out of the job market entirely.

The programs are also designed to boost chances of passing trade legislation, drawing in some Democrats who might otherwise be in the ""no"" camp. In a separate bill, TAA has been beefed up to raise benefits and to include service sector workers for the first time.

Whether TAA works, however, is a matter of debate. One 2012 Labor Department study found that, after four years, participants had earnings comparable to a group of non-TAA job losers.

That can be viewed as bad news (even with the help, they aren't doing any better than other people recovering from joblessness). Or as good news (this is a particularly hard-hit group of workers, who might have fared worse without the training).

Politically, “If TAA made even a relatively modest contribution to the ease of enacting free-trade policies, the program’s benefits would outweigh its costs,"" said the report.

Weak on “currency manipulation”

When countries such as China and Japan artificially lower the value of their currencies, it costs Americans jobs because foreign imports become cheaper and US exports more expensive. So critics want language in the fast-track bill against currency manipulation.

The bill’s supporters don’t dispute the dangers. That’s why, for the first time, fast-track legislation makes the issue a “negotiating objective” for the administration.

But an enforcement mechanism is too strong a remedy to include in the bill, the administration says, claiming that it would derail trade negotiations. It could also endanger America’s ability to manage its own currency, and lead to retaliation and trade wars, US officials say. They point to modest success in recent years in pressuring China to increase the value of its currency.

Sen. Charles Schumer (D) of New York, who calls currency manipulation the “most significant trade challenge this country faces,” succeeded in getting a currency amendment in a related customs bill. It’s not yet clear what will happen to this measure or other attempts to address the issue.

Secret deal? No deal.

Don’t know what’s in the TPP? That’s because it’s “top secret,” criticizes Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D) of Massachusetts, a vocal opponent of fast track.

That was a complaint that her colleague, Sen. Ron Wyden (D) of Oregon heard a lot at town halls. As a result, “I really went to the mat on these secrecy issues,” Senator Wyden said at a recent Monitor breakfast.

Senator Wyden, who is the administration’s point man on trade in the Senate, points out that with the fast-track bill, the full text of the TPP and any other trade agreements will be public for the first time – 60 days before Congress starts voting on it. Under fast track, any member of Congress can have access to classified negotiating texts. Members can attend negotiating rounds or be briefed by the administration on request.

That’s not good enough for Senator Warren. She’s pushing a petition that tells US trade officials: “No vote on a fast-track for trade agreements until the American people can see what’s in this TPP deal.” Members of Congress also complain about restricted access for their staffs, on whom they heavily rely.

A dispute over resolving disputes

Critics are up in arms over the way corporations settle disputes over alleged violations of free-trade agreements. The investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, lets foreign countries sue governments in special tribunals, rather than going through the country’s court system.

The problem with this, they argue, is that the tribunals grant huge payments to corporations for the violations – such big payments that countries are then incentivized to change their regulations. Not only do supporters of labor object, they worry that foreign companies will use the tribunals to force changes in US regulations and laws.

The administration says it is writing safeguards into the TPP that will prevent this from happening.

President Obama also told Yahoo Politics: ""There is no chance, zero chance, that the US would be sued on something like our financial regulations, and on food safety, and on the various environmental regulations that we have in place, mainly because we treat everybody the same."" He added, ""We treat our own companies the same way we treat somebody else's companies.""

Vietnam, a contentious subject

For the first time, a non-free-market economy such as Vietnam will be included in a broad trade deal involving the US, and that’s a problem, say critics. “Americans should not be forced to compete against desperately poor workers like those in Vietnam who make as little as 56 cents an hour,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont, wrote in a letter to to US Trade Representative Michael Froman last month.

In 2013, the US trade deficit with Vietnam was $19.6 billion.

But supporters argue that fast track and the TPP are precisely intended to protect against this problem. The fast-track bill raises the bar for labor, environment, and human rights standards, says Wyden. “Trading partners must adopt and maintain core international labor and environmental standards, with trade sanctions if they do not comply,” he said in a statement last month.

President Donald Trump has said that the US and China are ""very very close"" to signing a trade agreement, potentially ending the long-running feud between the two countries.

Mr Trump told US governors on Monday that both nations ""are going to have a signing summit"".

""Hopefully, we can get that completed. But we're getting very, very close,"" he said.

It follows a decision to delay imposing further trade tariffs on Chinese goods.

At the weekend, Mr Trump said both sides had made ""substantial progress"" in trade talks following a summit in Washington last week.

The rise in import duties on Chinese goods from 10% to 25% was due to come into effect on 1 March.

Instead, Mr Trump said the US is now planning a summit with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping at the US President's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

""However, we don't foresee a significant rollback of existing tariffs, and see underlying tensions regarding China's strategic ambitions, its industrial policy, technological transfers and 'verification and enforcement' mechanisms remaining in place.""

What has happened in the trade war so far?

Mr Trump initiated the trade war over complaints of unfair Chinese trading practices.

That included accusing China of stealing intellectual property from American firms, forcing them to transfer technology to China.

The US has imposed tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products.

Mr Trump has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $267bn worth of Chinese products - which would see virtually all of Chinese imports into the US become subject to duties.

The trade dispute has unnerved financial markets, risks raising costs for American companies and is adding pressure to a Chinese economy that is already showing signs of strain.

It has also stoked fears about the impact on the global economy.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., minority leader in the Senate, said he sympathizes with Trump's criticism of trade rules, but the main culprit is China. Trump's plan doesn't address the Chinese, he said, because other countries supply more steel and aluminum to the U.S.

""Instead of getting right at China, the president’s across-the-board tariffs will cause more damage to key allies and other domestic industries,"" Schumer said. He also hit ""the haphazard way these tariffs were put together,"" and that Trump ""makes up his mind one day and changes it the next.""

Trump cast the tariffs at a first step in a series of trade changes. During the signing ceremony, he outlined a ""reciprocal tax"" to combat duties that China and other countries place on U.S. products.

Like other business groups, the National Retail Federation called the tariffs ""a self-inflicted wound"" that will lead to ""higher prices for products ranging from canned goods to cars to electronics.""

Some economists defended Trump's plan, saying trade has sucked the life out of American manufacturing.

Peter Morici, a business professor at the University of Maryland, tweeted that Trump ""is not starting a trade war"" because ""we are already in one,"" especially with China.

""The other side has bazookas & we have been using water pistols,"" Morici said. ""China has targeted one U.S. industry after another, thrown millions of Americans out of work. Time to fight back.""

US President Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on the central bank, the Federal Reserve, calling it ""out of control"" and ""far too stringent"".

Mr Trump said he was not going to fire Fed chairman Jay Powell, but was just ""disappointed"" in the bank's policies.

His criticisms came during remarks at the White House. Earlier, he told Fox News the Fed was being ""too aggressive"" by raising interest rates this year and getting ""a little bit too cute"".

He said it was ""making a big mistake"".

""I'm paying interest at a high rate because of our Fed,"" he added, referring to the cost of servicing the US deficit.

Mr Trump's comments follow several days of declines in US stock markets.

On Thursday, the Dow and S&P 500 share indexes closed more than 2% lower, while the Nasdaq slipped 1.25%.

What happens when the world's two biggest economies go to war?

Ok, so it's not a real war - but the US and China are at the beginning of a trade war - and no-one knows just how bad it could get.

So here's how a US-China trade war could hurt us.

Tit-for-tat

A list of Chinese products will be hit with a 25% tariff from Friday - effectively making them 25% more expensive for US consumers.

Technology goods like semiconductor chips assembled in China. They're found in consumer products used in everyday life such as televisions, personal computers, smartphones, and cars

A wide variety of products ranging from plastics, nuclear reactors and dairy-making equipment

According to the Petersen Institute of International Economics more than 90% of the products on the US tariffs list are made up of intermediate inputs or capital equipment. That means stuff that you need as raw material to make other products - so it could have a knock-on effect on many other goods too.

What the US really wants to target though are things produced under China's Made in China 2025 policy.

In retaliation to the US moves, China has hit these sectors:

American agriculture - hitting at American farmers and ranchers, a political vote bank that US President Trump relies on. Some 91% of the 545 products China is placing a tariff on are from the agriculture sector

The car sector - companies such as Tesla and Chrysler manufacture in the US and their products going into China would be affected

Medical products; coal; petroleum (but only marginally).

'Getting scary'

And while Beijing is really good at the chest-thumping, fist-wagging rhetoric, the reality on the ground is much more serious.

""Our industry contacts in China have said things like 'seems pretty serious,' or 'this is getting scary', even 'I think there's a chance of things getting worse',"" says Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research.

He's recently returned from a trip to the mainland, and as part of his research routinely talks to China-based firms to gauge business sentiment there.

These worries, he says, can translate into ""increased caution and lower confidence"" for businesses as they try to navigate the uncertainty ahead.

Which means: expansion plans could be put on ice. And if Chinese expansion is on hold that has a direct impact on the rest of us in Asia.

Shift manufacturing?

Obviously the US and China's economies are most at risk, although they're not the only ones.

According to DBS's chief economist Taimur Baig, an all-out trade war could shave 0.25% off the GDP of both economies this year. It gets much worse next year - with both countries seeing a reduction in growth of about 0.5% or more.

Mr Baig adds that ""considering China grows at 6-7% and the US at 2-3%, we believe the damage would be greater to the US than on China"".

But countries like South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan could all be affected too because of disruption to supply chains.

China sources a lot of components that go into its finished goods from these other countries. As Nick Marro of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out, ""any dent in China's export flows will inevitably affect"" these other countries.

The case could be made for manufacturing to shift to these other countries - and for them to take advantage of selling to the US - but that shift would take time, and it's hard to see who could match China's scale.

Ultimately, the US consumer will end up paying more for these products.

China backlash

US firms operating in China could also face a ""China backlash"".

Elon Musk's electric car firm Tesla, for instance, has already highlighted just how important the Chinese market is to it.

But it imports all of its products to China and so would see a 25% tariff placed on its cars sold in China - on top of the 15% tax imported vehicles already face there.

This would inevitably push up prices for Tesla in China, making its vehicles less competitive than they already are, relative to others.

Sino-US tensions could also end up ""delaying or preventing"" Tesla's ability to release its full potential in China, according to Silk Road Research.

How bad can it get?

It's the question I ask every business person I meet, and the answer is typically always the same: nobody knows.

""You start with protectionism and isolationism,"" says Victor Mills, chief executive of Singapore's International Chamber of Commerce. ""And then you don't just beggar your neighbour, you beggar yourself.""

What many business people are hoping of course, is that this sound and fury is just the start of another series of negotiations.

But the worry is that if it's not - it will escalate, and everybody will be the poorer. And that includes you and me.",www.bbc.com,center,HEfmUXel8UG2pxFR

TARIFFS IN HAND

Trump, however, is still dangling the prospect of higher tariffs on Chinese goods.

As negotiations toward resolving the U.S.-China trade war stalled last week, the United States raised the pressure by increasing tariffs to 25% from 10% on a previous, $200 billion list of Chinese imports.

China retaliated on Monday with higher tariffs on a revised list of $60 billion worth of U.S. products

Trump could launch 25% tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods when he meets Xi next month. The list includes a wide range of consumer goods, from cellphones and computers to clothing and footwear, but it excludes pharmaceuticals, some specialty compounds and rare-earth minerals.

At the same time, China is vowing not to succumb to such pressure. China’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it hoped the United States did not “underestimate China’s determination and will to safeguard its interests.”

There was a little optimism late Friday , after Reuters reported that Mexico and the US decided to hold off publishing the text of its United States-Mexico bilateral trade deal on Friday — a signal that both weren ’ t quite ready to move ahead without Canada .
But the prospects of a last-minute agreement with Canada remain grim after weeks of a negotiating impasse over a revised NAFTA , the trilateral trade agreement between the US , Canada , and Mexico .
President Donald Trump vented his frustration with Canada during a press conference in New York this week in which he bashed their negotiators and claimed he rejected a one-on-one meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of the United Nations . ( Canada says it never asked for such a meeting . )
“ We ’ re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada , ” Trump said . “ We don ’ t like their representative very much . They have taken advantage . ”
“ The deal is done , ” he added . “ Now it has to go through Congress and a lot of things have to happen . ”
The deal Trump is referring to is the United States-Mexico bilateral agreement the two countries struck in August , which the president now wants to submit to Congress as a NAFTA replacement . But it ’ s unclear if Congress will accept a deal without Canada . Though Republican leaders have also chastised Canada in recent weeks , there ’ s fairly strong bipartisan support for keeping Canada part of the trade pact .
Canada knows this , which has bolstered the country ’ s negotiating position . Even as the Trump administration prepared to forge ahead , it ’ s not altogether rejecting a future deal with Canada .
“ We ’ re going to go ahead with Mexico , ” US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , who ’ s leading the negotiations , said this week . “ If Canada comes along , that would be best . If Canada comes along later , then that ’ s what will happen . We certainly want to have an agreement with Canada . ”
Which means the Trump administration might find a way to make the September 30 deadline flexible , and continue talks with Canada . How that will work practically is still unclear , but as the NAFTA deadline nears , here ’ s a look at how the two countries got here , and what might happen if there ’ s no agreement this weekend .
Trump hates NAFTA . “ I don ’ t like NAFTA , ” he said Wednesday . “ I never liked it . ”
Trump ’ s loathing of the trade agreement carried from his campaign to his presidency , and in August 2017 , all three countries began talks to renegotiate the trilateral trade deal .
About a year later , the US and Mexico reached a preliminary bilateral pact that dealt with some issues between the two countries — but wasn ’ t exactly a NAFTA replacement . Canada then rejoined negotiations with the goal of reaching a revised agreement — NAFTA 2.0 , if you will — to submit to Congress .
The Trump administration had initially pushed to reach a deal by the end of August . It was a manufactured deadline — the United States wants to sign a deal with Mexico before December 1 , when the country ’ s new leftist president , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , takes power . ( Obrador has said he wants a trilateral deal . )
The US and Canada , of course , did not reach a deal by the end of August .
But the Trump administration went ahead and notified Congress that Trump intended to sign a new trade agreement with Mexico — “ and Canada , if it is willing ” — within 90 days . This is required under the Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) , which gives the president the power to negotiate trade deals and Congress to approve them with an up-or-down vote .
The TPA , however , demands that text for any trade agreement be delivered no later than 60 days before signing , which is how the September 30 deadline came to be . The plan was for Canada and the US to negotiate for another month , then submit the text for a trilateral deal .
Now the US and Canada are speeding toward that date without a deal . The text of any trade deal the Trump administration wants to submit to Congress will likely be published by Sunday . What it might look like is anyone ’ s guess .
The language of the text will likely provide clues as to whether the US is really forging ahead with a United States-Mexico bilateral deal , or still leaving an avenue open for Canada .
According to the Canadian news outlet CBC , the agreement may include at least a dozen chapters that have been agreed to by all three NAFTA partners — Canada , the US , and Mexico — which would hint that this is a trilateral agreement in-progress .
The administration already took a creative approach to TPA with their notification to Congress , and adding Canada later now would be even more unorthodox . Democrats have already challenged the administration on their bait-and-switch , saying that they can ’ t just replace NAFTA with an entirely new bilateral trade deal .
Ultimately , it will be up to Congress whether they ’ ll accept the administration ’ s machinations on TPA . They might , because lawmakers have little appetite for a bilateral deal . They want Canada included . “ Congress seems to be making it very clear on both sides of the aisle , ” Marc Busch , an international trade expert at Georgetown University , said .
Some lawmakers have adopted the administration ’ s posture on Canada , pressuring them to get in line or else . Rep.

But this is likely bluster — and Canada can see right through it . “ Steve Scalise can say whatever he likes , ” Busch said . “ Canada does have the upper hand right now . ”
Canada is betting that a trilateral deal really is the only practical way forward . Canada is the US ’ s closest trading partner and the supply chains are so intricately intertwined . Certain provisions in the US-Mexico bilateral pact were also negotiated with the understanding that Canada would eventually be included — such as the percentages of each car that must be made in each country to avoid tariffs .
“ The [ US-Mexico ] agreement was calibrated around the idea that Canada was going to be a part of this deal and these are really detailed calculations , ” said Chad Bown , of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , said . If Canada is out , Bown added , those numbers will likely need to be recalculated .
Add to that Congress ’ s reluctance . Even if Trump moves ahead and signs a bilateral deal with Mexico , Congress likely won ’ t vote on it until next year . If Democrats retake one or both chambers , a deal without Canada is likely dead on arrival .
Which is why Canada doesn ’ t feel all that rushed by the TPA deadlines . Canada wants to make “ a deal that works for Canada , ” Busch said . “ That ’ s exactly what Canada is doing . ”

What to expect if Sunday ends without a deal

The language of the text will likely provide clues as to whether the US is really forging ahead with a United States-Mexico bilateral deal, or still leaving an avenue open for Canada.

What’s the holdup?

Both the US and Canada may agree that a NAFTA 2.0 is going to happen eventually — but for now, each side seems entrenched.

The US wants greater access to Canada’s dairy market, but it’s a politically charged issue in Canada, particularly in Quebec, which has inconveniently timed provincial elections on October 1.

trade,National Review,2,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444612/donald-trump-china-trade-deals-should-foster-reciprocity,How Trump Can Make Trade with China Work for America  ,2017-02-08,"Derek Scissors, Jim Geraghty, Kyle Smith, Zachary Evans, Luke Thompson, David French, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Tobias Hoonhout, Kevin D. Williamson","Our economic policy with regard to China has been wrong for almost 20 years . We were wrong in the late 1990s to believe that the Chinese Communist Party was committed to pro-market reform for the long term . We were wrong in the mid 2000s to discourage the U.S. government from retaliating against discriminatory Chinese regulations . We were wrong as recently as two years ago when we , Democrats and Republicans alike , failed to see how much trade with China had contributed to populist anger .
There is , one could say , huge room for improvement in economic relations with the People ’ s Republic of China ( PRC ) . This does not mean that all the ideas President Trump and his key aides have floated will make things better . We can not turn back the clock , and the American manufacturing sector can not simply return to where it was before China joined the World Trade Organization in late 2001 .
The challenge for the incoming administration is to consider what China has done in the past but choose responses that work now and in the future . Currency manipulation , for example , is now less of a problem than theft of intellectual property . Trade remains paramount at the same time that investment is increasingly important . Mere words will not make China change . Yet while disruptive action is necessary , it will help only if dictated by current facts rather than outdated rhetoric .
Trump strained credulity in some of his campaign comments , such as calling the North American Free Trade Agreement the “ single worst trade deal , ” even though manufacturing employment rose in the four years after its enactment . Nonetheless , he repeatedly and correctly tapped into a key element of the U.S.–China economic relationship that many veteran observers continue to get wrong : America does have much greater leverage than it has so far used to bring about Chinese reforms .
Trump ’ s critics and those who are worried about a U.S.–PRC trade conflict often make sweeping statements that both sides would lose in such a clash , or even that China would come off better . Usually they are incorrectly imagining a simple tariff duel . It is true that limiting voluntary trade and investment transactions would make both countries lose , but one country has far more at stake . Rather than anticipating some sort of strategic victory from a serious trade conflict , the PRC will fear correctly that it would lose , in absolute terms and also relative to the U.S. , and will work to contain conflict .
The United States sells a good amount of aircraft , auto parts , soybeans , and a few other products and services to the PRC . American consumers would be hurt if goods produced or assembled over there became costlier because of import duties . The poor would be hurt the most , since our main imports from China are cell phones , personal computers , and clothing made more affordable because trans-Pacific supply chains allow production lines to tap cheap labor and technical know-how at the same time . If production lines lacked these , prices would rise . Even with higher prices , the middle class could afford new phones , computers , and clothes , but the poor would more frequently go without .
A fading concern is Beijing ’ s holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds . These holdings , both direct and indirect through countries such as Belgium and offshore centers such as the Caymans , have dropped by at least $ 350 billion in the past three years and will continue to fall , both through a drop in sales and simply from Beijing ’ s not buying new bonds as existing holdings come to term . The decline has had no significant impact because the PRC ’ s holdings are trivial compared with our internal financial conditions — specifically the sustained , historically low U.S. interest rates and the Fed ’ s unwillingness or inability to lift them .
Much more interesting is the reason that China ’ s bond holdings are falling : Beijing has less money to spend on everything , including American bonds . In July 2014 , the total amount of foreign exchange held in the Chinese banking system — including but not limited to official reserves — peaked at more than $ 4.8 trillion . By November 2016 , that number had dropped by roughly $ 1.2 trillion . ( This number is difficult to calculate because the PRC changed the statistics it publishes , probably to obscure the amount of money leaving the country . )
It hardly seems like a problem that “ only ” $ 3.5 trillion or so is left . Yet throughout 2016 , the steepness of the decline in foreign exchange led to episodes of international financial instability over fears that China , out of choice or necessity , might either give in to the pressure and let the yuan fall sharply or fight it by forbidding capital to leave China . Moreover , the $ 1.3 trillion drop in less than 30 months occurred even while the PRC gained approximately $ 750 billion in hard currency from its goods-and-services trade with the United States . Without that huge sum of money , China ’ s balance-of-payments position — the net of hard currency coming into the country minus the currency leaving it — would be perilous .
For his part , Trump during the campaign repeatedly made the protectionist claim that the trade deficit causes job loss . There are crippling flaws in this view ( see below ) , but if the president really holds it , he may see even radical steps to zero out the trade deficit as worthwhile for the United States . Ultimately in play is $ 300 billion heading from the U.S. to China each year , money Beijing now needs to insure against a balance-of-payments crisis .
America faces no risk of that magnitude — the PRC ’ s greater vulnerability should be obvious . So should the considerable damage that the U.S. has suffered from its bilateral economic relationship with China . We know from labor-market statistics that manufacturing employment and wages suffered after the U.S. affirmed permanent normal trading relations for China 16 years ago . This was not entirely due to China , of course , but a widely accepted series of academic papers by David Autor , David Dorn , and Gordon Hanson have isolated the impact of China . Rising exposure to Chinese imports by itself , apart from all other factors , caused lower American manufacturing employment , lower labor-force participation , and lower wages .
The Trump campaign correctly indicted Chinese subsidies , and the most powerful subsidy is a guarantee that a firm will not fail .
While tough competition for American manufacturers was expected , economists thought that there would eventually be equivalent opportunities to sell to Chinese buyers . This has not happened , essentially because the Communist Party likes competition only in other economies . The biggest problem is that the U.S. , the world ’ s most competitive services producer , faces state-owned Chinese enterprises that are guaranteed by the Communist Party to retain a controlling share of their sectors . The Trump campaign correctly indicted Chinese subsidies , and the most powerful subsidy is a guarantee that a firm will not fail .
A second harm deliberately inflicted on the U.S. by China was minor in 2001 but has grown enormously since : theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property , also correctly criticized by the Trump campaign . Documenting the amount of theft is difficult , but it ’ s probably tens of billions of dollars annually over the past decade . It ’ s not just American technology companies that are being robbed ; it ’ s American innovators of all shapes and sizes and the many millions of people whose jobs are connected to intellectual property .
President Trump , as he noted while campaigning , will have a big economic stick and good reasons to use it . But the Trump campaign ’ s rhetoric about China did not include an explanation of how to bring about better results for the United States . The first step is to avoid harmful mistakes that would make future improvements impossible . The incoming administration may find these don ’ ts particularly disagreeable .
Trump and his staff have repeatedly vowed to be tougher negotiators than past administrations have been . It might not matter . The United States has conducted formal economic talks with the PRC since the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade was formed in 1983 . Negotiated outcomes have depended less on who was running the American team than on who was running the Communist Party . If current leader Xi Jinping wants to limit foreign participation in the Chinese economy simply because it is foreign , as it appears he does from Chinese actions against foreign companies since he assumed power , it will be impossible to make China a good economic partner . The Trump administration will have to act unilaterally , which will make the diplomatic community nervous .
In that case , the next point would be crucial : The trade deficit should not be the focus of American policy , because it does not signify lost American jobs . Organized labor insists that the trade deficit represents production that could have been located in the United States . If imports are cut , the theory goes , American production will rise to replace them . But facts and logic say otherwise . In 2006 , the highest annual trade deficit in history coincided with the lowest U.S. unemployment and highest labor-force participation in the past 15 years . In 2009 , our trade deficit fell by more than $ 300 billion , yet unemployment and labor-force participation worsened sharply .
Protectionists make several mistakes , but their key error is confusing accounting with causation . They claim that the trade deficit causes job loss because it reduces gross domestic product . But GDP is just an accounting tool ; it can not cause anything . What actually causes jobs and trade to change is household income . When we are wealthier , we buy more of everything , including imports . The opposite occurs in down years . Sound economic policy can therefore boost the trade deficit , while poor policy can yield a trade surplus , as occurred during the Great Depression .
This misunderstanding of the trade deficit matters in two ways . First , our largest bilateral deficit is with the PRC , so attacking the deficit implies restricting imports from China first and foremost . Yet in the age of supply chains , emphasizing a bilateral deficit makes less sense than emphasizing the overall deficit . For instance , when China conducts the final assembly of cell phones , its exports to the U.S. are credited with the phones ’ full value even though components made in Japan , Korea , and elsewhere account for most of that value . Our true deficit with China is smaller than reported ; our deficits with some countries are larger .
The second , more hotly discussed area in which misunderstandings of the deficit need correction is currency manipulation . Currency manipulation seems esoteric until someone insists that it costs hundreds of thousands of American jobs . This claim relies on the underlying beliefs that currency manipulation increases the trade deficit ( true ) and reduces GDP ( only in an accounting sense ) . That lower GDP means fewer jobs is assumed . But a direct comparison of the value of the Chinese yuan with U.S. employment and labor-force participation shows no relationship over time . The PRC ’ s currency policy has not mattered to American jobs .
It might matter in the future . It is fashionable to criticize Trump by saying that Beijing now manipulates the yuan to keep it from falling against the dollar . This is true but superficial . The deeper question is why the yuan is falling against the dollar when the Communist Party insists that the Chinese economy is strong and its financial system healthy . This traces back to the PRC ’ s financial vulnerability , which shines through its propaganda . It is possible that the yuan will drop sharply at some point because of foolish Chinese policy . If so , the U.S. should then consider retaliating . The U.S. can allow the PRC to try to right the ship by using exchange rates , but it has no obligation to be tolerant if China ’ s correction hurts the American economy .
In general , we should make policy not to try to restore the past but to help Americans in 2017 and beyond .
Any action , however , should not include across-the-board tariffs . Across-the-board tariffs are appealing , given the extent of the problems in the U.S.–PRC economic relationship . But no matter how high the tariffs are , they can not set back the clock to a time when America had a total of 19 million globally competitive manufacturing workers , compared with barely 12 million now . This is a false hope . Moreover , across-the-board tariffs ( i.e. , import duties ) hurt the poor most , as mentioned above . In general , we should make policy not to try to restore the past but to help Americans in 2017 and beyond .
There are various options the Trump administration can pursue to improve the economic relationship with the PRC without relying on the Party ’ s goodwill or good sense . Most , but not all , feature punishment of bad Chinese behavior . Campaign statements and the backgrounds of incoming officials , such as Commerce Secretary–designate Wilbur Ross , make tariffs on auto parts , steel , and textiles , for example , very likely . But without a strategy guiding such steps , they would be mainly symbolic .
A foundation for a sound strategy , one that has been invoked by Trump and his staff , is the principle of reciprocity . There are perhaps two dozen sectors , such as insurance , that are effectively closed to American goods and services because the Chinese government protects its state-owned enterprises through regulatory and financial subsidies . In this context , the U.S. has justification to restrict Chinese trade and investment to parts of the American market , selected by the incoming administration to fit its larger economic strategy .
Simple reciprocity — closing to China all the sectors that China closes to the U.S. — would be a mistake , however . Closing off parts of the economy to competition should always be the last resort , because it hurts us as well as them . The Communist Party clings to the hope that closed markets and suppressed competition are compatible with prosperity . With disposable income in China less than one-tenth that in the U.S. , state-led development has not brought prosperity yet . And with the PRC in the process of recording arguably the biggest debt splurge in world history , the future does not look bright , either . The U.S. should also exercise caution by not breaking commitments on specific sectors made to other economic partners and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
Instead , the Trump administration should adopt narrow responses that make better sense than China ’ s more sweeping anti-competitive policies . A WTO that permits the PRC ’ s anti-competitive practices should not object to documenting the benefits granted to state-owned enterprises ; nor should it object to invoking reciprocity to restrict Chinese participation in a few American industries . The documentation of how the PRC blocks U.S. competition and of the retaliatory restrictions placed on Chinese goods and services in target sectors should include a pledge to restore Chinese access to U.S. markets when Beijing improves its policies .
There will be objections of various sorts to closing even one or two major sectors of the American economy to Chinese participation . These objections will have merit , but the only realistic alternative is the status quo . The Communist Party is intensely committed to its “ national champions , ” its ever-larger state-controlled companies , and mere talk will not open the PRC further . The record on this is especially clear .
The second major area of action , also mentioned by the Trump campaign , is intellectual property . American leaders have talked incessantly about how unacceptable intellectual-property theft is but have done basically nothing to stop it . A grand jury in Pennsylvania issued unenforceable warrants in 2014 for a few Chinese hackers , and Congress signed the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 , but no American administration has drafted meaningful sanctions . If intellectual-property theft does amount to tens of billions annually , the equivalent of strongly worded letters hardly constitutes an effective response .
Who steals the intellectual property is not the main commercial issue . Instead , it is who receives the stolen property and thereby benefits from an unfair advantage at the expense of American companies and workers . U.S. Steel Corporation has accused Chinese rival Baosteel of accepting intellectual property stolen from U.S. Steel and using it to create new , competing products . U.S. Steel has asked for compensatory American sanctions . While it can be hard to uncover the identity of the thieves , independent researchers can , to some extent , document the sudden appearance at one firm of technology developed by another . The American government could certainly use evidence provided by the intelligence community and targeted American companies to maintain a list of Chinese firms that are benefiting from intellectual-property theft .
With the exception of banned firms and a few sensitive technologies , America should welcome Chinese investment and the participation of globally experienced firms .
Perhaps the biggest obstacle is the American companies themselves , which may not want to provoke Beijing or admit to stockholders that their intellectual property is vulnerable to theft . To the extent that corporate fear can be overcome by government protection , the policy choice is simple . Foreign firms that use stolen intellectual property should be banned from our market in terms of trade , investment , and any activity through third parties , and the length of the ban should depend on the extent of the theft . This will give Chinese companies a substantial reason — not merely words — to stay clear of stolen intellectual property .
There are also carrots to offer the PRC that are consistent with President Trump ’ s economic agenda and may spur job creation . With the exception of banned firms and a few sensitive technologies , America should welcome Chinese investment and the participation of globally experienced firms such as China National Machinery ( Sinomach ) and its many subsidiaries in infrastructure-building projects . Discriminatory practices such as the requirement to “ buy American ” when federal or local governments are purchasing products or undertaking construction should be waived for PRC companies that have not broken American laws .
The chief area of government-to-government economic cooperation with China under President Obama has been the negotiation of a bilateral investment treaty . The Obama administration believed that the rules laid out in a successful treaty would cause the PRC to treat American companies operating in China much better than previously , and that they might even set an example for how to improve other aspects of the economic relationship . But the same China that knowingly steals enormous amounts of intellectual property and refuses to allow competition with state-owned enterprises is not going to change its behavior because of a new piece of paper . Only an America that retains the ability to punish theft and invoke reciprocity can craft a valuable agreement with China .
Next year will probably be difficult for Sino–American economic relations . It should be . The United States has for many years avoided coming to grips with problems that will be painful to solve . The incoming administration will have to adopt and , crucially , hold to a strategy that makes sense for 2017 , not 2007 or 1997 . If it does , Beijing can be pushed away from some of its anti-competitive practices , and President Trump can fulfill a key promise to make trade and investment with China work better for America .","(Illustration: Thom Reis)

A strategy for the new administration.

Our economic policy with regard to China has been wrong for almost 20 years. We were wrong in the late 1990s to believe that the Chinese Communist Party was committed to pro-market reform for the long term. We were wrong in the mid 2000s to discourage the U.S. government from retaliating against discriminatory Chinese regulations. We were wrong as recently as two years ago when we, Democrats and Republicans alike, failed to see how much trade with China had contributed to populist anger.

There is, one could say, huge room for improvement in economic relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This does not mean that all the ideas President Trump and his key aides have floated will make things better. We cannot turn back the clock, and the American manufacturing sector cannot simply return to where it was before China joined the World Trade Organization in late 2001.

The challenge for the incoming administration is to consider what China has done in the past but choose responses that work now and in the future. Currency manipulation, for example, is now less of a problem than theft of intellectual property. Trade remains paramount at the same time that investment is increasingly important. Mere words will not make China change. Yet while disruptive action is necessary, it will help only if dictated by current facts rather than outdated rhetoric.

Trump strained credulity in some of his campaign comments, such as calling the North American Free Trade Agreement the “single worst trade deal,” even though manufacturing employment rose in the four years after its enactment. Nonetheless, he repeatedly and correctly tapped into a key element of the U.S.–China economic relationship that many veteran observers continue to get wrong: America does have much greater leverage than it has so far used to bring about Chinese reforms.

Trump’s critics and those who are worried about a U.S.–PRC trade conflict often make sweeping statements that both sides would lose in such a clash, or even that China would come off better. Usually they are incorrectly imagining a simple tariff duel. It is true that limiting voluntary trade and investment transactions would make both countries lose, but one country has far more at stake. Rather than anticipating some sort of strategic victory from a serious trade conflict, the PRC will fear correctly that it would lose, in absolute terms and also relative to the U.S., and will work to contain conflict.

The United States sells a good amount of aircraft, auto parts, soybeans, and a few other products and services to the PRC. American consumers would be hurt if goods produced or assembled over there became costlier because of import duties. The poor would be hurt the most, since our main imports from China are cell phones, personal computers, and clothing made more affordable because trans-Pacific supply chains allow production lines to tap cheap labor and technical know-how at the same time. If production lines lacked these, prices would rise. Even with higher prices, the middle class could afford new phones, computers, and clothes, but the poor would more frequently go without.

A fading concern is Beijing’s holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds. These holdings, both direct and indirect through countries such as Belgium and offshore centers such as the Caymans, have dropped by at least $350 billion in the past three years and will continue to fall, both through a drop in sales and simply from Beijing’s not buying new bonds as existing holdings come to term. The decline has had no significant impact because the PRC’s holdings are trivial compared with our internal financial conditions — specifically the sustained, historically low U.S. interest rates and the Fed’s unwillingness or inability to lift them.

Much more interesting is the reason that China’s bond holdings are falling: Beijing has less money to spend on everything, including American bonds. In July 2014, the total amount of foreign exchange held in the Chinese banking system — including but not limited to official reserves — peaked at more than $4.8 trillion. By November 2016, that number had dropped by roughly $1.2 trillion. (This number is difficult to calculate because the PRC changed the statistics it publishes, probably to obscure the amount of money leaving the country.)

It hardly seems like a problem that “only” $3.5 trillion or so is left. Yet throughout 2016, the steepness of the decline in foreign exchange led to episodes of international financial instability over fears that China, out of choice or necessity, might either give in to the pressure and let the yuan fall sharply or fight it by forbidding capital to leave China. Moreover, the $1.3 trillion drop in less than 30 months occurred even while the PRC gained approximately $750 billion in hard currency from its goods-and-services trade with the United States. Without that huge sum of money, China’s balance-of-payments position — the net of hard currency coming into the country minus the currency leaving it — would be perilous.

For his part, Trump during the campaign repeatedly made the protectionist claim that the trade deficit causes job loss. There are crippling flaws in this view (see below), but if the president really holds it, he may see even radical steps to zero out the trade deficit as worthwhile for the United States. Ultimately in play is $300 billion heading from the U.S. to China each year, money Beijing now needs to insure against a balance-of-payments crisis.

America faces no risk of that magnitude — the PRC’s greater vulnerability should be obvious. So should the considerable damage that the U.S. has suffered from its bilateral economic relationship with China. We know from labor-market statistics that manufacturing employment and wages suffered after the U.S. affirmed permanent normal trading relations for China 16 years ago. This was not entirely due to China, of course, but a widely accepted series of academic papers by David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson have isolated the impact of China. Rising exposure to Chinese imports by itself, apart from all other factors, caused lower American manufacturing employment, lower labor-force participation, and lower wages.

The Trump campaign correctly indicted Chinese subsidies, and the most powerful subsidy is a guarantee that a firm will not fail.

While tough competition for American manufacturers was expected, economists thought that there would eventually be equivalent opportunities to sell to Chinese buyers. This has not happened, essentially because the Communist Party likes competition only in other economies. The biggest problem is that the U.S., the world’s most competitive services producer, faces state-owned Chinese enterprises that are guaranteed by the Communist Party to retain a controlling share of their sectors. The Trump campaign correctly indicted Chinese subsidies, and the most powerful subsidy is a guarantee that a firm will not fail.

Documenting the amount of theft is difficult, but it’s probably tens of billions of dollars annually over the past decade.

Trump ’ s move would subject about $ 300 billion worth of Chinese imports to punitive tariffs , U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement .
Lighthizer said a final decision has not been made on the new duties , which would come on top of an early Friday tariff rate increase to 25 % from 10 % on $ 200 billion worth of Chinese imports .
Despite the escalation in tariffs , Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said they would press on with more talks , avoiding the worst-case scenario of a complete breakdown of negotiations between the world ’ s two largest economies .
“ Over the course of the past two days , the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries , ” Trump said on Twitter .
“ In the meantime , the United States has imposed Tariffs on China , which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations ! ” Trump said .
Liu later told Chinese state media that China and the United States had agreed to hold more talks in Beijing . He said differences remained over “ principal issues ” but that the talks were constructive and had not broken down .
China dealt the talks a major setback last week by proposing extensive revisions to a draft trade agreement . China wanted to delete prior commitments that Chinese laws would be changed to enact new policies on issues from intellectual property protection to forced technology transfers .
The issue dominated the talks between Liu , Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday , and two people familiar with the discussions said no progress was made as Liu sought to defend the changes .
The top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping argued that China could accomplish the policy changes through decrees issued by its State Council , or cabinet , the sources said . But Lighthizer rejected this , telling Liu that the United States was insisting on restoration of the previous text .
Major U.S. stock indexes , which had fallen sharply through the week as investors worried that the 10-month-old trade war could spiral out of control , reversed course to close higher after Mnuchin also called the talks “ constructive. ” Yields on U.S. government debt also drifted higher after the end of the talks .
In earlier tweets , Trump defended the tariff hike and said he was in “ absolutely no rush ” to finalize a deal , adding that the U.S. economy would gain more from the levies than any agreement .
Despite his insistence that China will absorb the cost of the tariffs , it is U.S. businesses that will pay them and likely pass them on to consumers . It may take three or four months for American shoppers to feel the pinch , economists and industry consultants say .
Following the U.S. tariff hike , China ’ s Commerce Ministry said it would take countermeasures but did not elaborate . China responded to Trump ’ s tariffs last year with levies on a range of U.S. goods including soybeans and pork .
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Friday that Trump had asked him to create a plan to support American farmers . The U.S. government already has rolled out up to $ 12 billion to help offset their China-related losses .
The new 25 % U.S. duty is being imposed on more than 5,700 categories of products , applied to products leaving China after 12:01 a.m. EDT ( 0401 GMT ) on Friday . The biggest sector affected is a $ 20 billion-plus category of internet modems , routers and similar devices . Circuit boards , furniture , and lighting products also are high on the list .
Seaborne cargoes shipped from China before midnight were not subject to the new tax as long as they arrive in the United States prior to June 1 . Those cargoes will be charged the original 10 % rate .
The higher tariffs could reduce U.S. gross domestic product by 0.3 % and China ’ s by 0.8 % in 2020 , consultancy Oxford Economics said .
Although Trump has maintained that his trade policies will boost U.S. manufacturing , some in the sector are concerned that the policies could backfire if the dispute with China is not resolved soon .

Trump’s move would subject about $300 billion worth of Chinese imports to punitive tariffs, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.

Lighthizer said a final decision has not been made on the new duties, which would come on top of an early Friday tariff rate increase to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.

Despite the escalation in tariffs, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said they would press on with more talks, avoiding the worst-case scenario of a complete breakdown of negotiations between the world’s two largest economies.

“Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries,” Trump said on Twitter.

“In the meantime, the United States has imposed Tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations!” Trump said.

Liu later told Chinese state media that China and the United States had agreed to hold more talks in Beijing. He said differences remained over “principal issues” but that the talks were constructive and had not broken down.

China dealt the talks a major setback last week by proposing extensive revisions to a draft trade agreement. China wanted to delete prior commitments that Chinese laws would be changed to enact new policies on issues from intellectual property protection to forced technology transfers.

The issue dominated the talks between Liu, Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday, and two people familiar with the discussions said no progress was made as Liu sought to defend the changes.

The top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping argued that China could accomplish the policy changes through decrees issued by its State Council, or cabinet, the sources said. But Lighthizer rejected this, telling Liu that the United States was insisting on restoration of the previous text.

Major U.S. stock indexes, which had fallen sharply through the week as investors worried that the 10-month-old trade war could spiral out of control, reversed course to close higher after Mnuchin also called the talks “constructive.” Yields on U.S. government debt also drifted higher after the end of the talks.

In earlier tweets, Trump defended the tariff hike and said he was in “absolutely no rush” to finalize a deal, adding that the U.S. economy would gain more from the levies than any agreement.

Despite his insistence that China will absorb the cost of the tariffs, it is U.S. businesses that will pay them and likely pass them on to consumers. It may take three or four months for American shoppers to feel the pinch, economists and industry consultants say.

Following the U.S. tariff hike, China’s Commerce Ministry said it would take countermeasures but did not elaborate. China responded to Trump’s tariffs last year with levies on a range of U.S. goods including soybeans and pork.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Friday that Trump had asked him to create a plan to support American farmers. The U.S. government already has rolled out up to $12 billion to help offset their China-related losses.

The new 25% U.S. duty is being imposed on more than 5,700 categories of products, applied to products leaving China after 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on Friday. The biggest sector affected is a $20 billion-plus category of internet modems, routers and similar devices. Circuit boards, furniture, and lighting products also are high on the list.

Seaborne cargoes shipped from China before midnight were not subject to the new tax as long as they arrive in the United States prior to June 1. Those cargoes will be charged the original 10% rate.

The higher tariffs could reduce U.S. gross domestic product by 0.3% and China’s by 0.8% in 2020, consultancy Oxford Economics said.

Although Trump has maintained that his trade policies will boost U.S. manufacturing, some in the sector are concerned that the policies could backfire if the dispute with China is not resolved soon.

“We were mildly excited yesterday when we thought this was the end game,” said Michael Haberman, president of Gradall Industries Inc in New Philadelphia, Ohio, which sells about 5% of its machinery to China. “For us, the longer this continues the more dangerous it becomes.”

Does anyone know where all those free trade Democrats went?

Since Donald Trump burst on the scene, liberal policy wonks and their Democratic allies had a field day torching him for his tariff policies. Last year when I testified before the Senate on auto tariffs, nearly every Democrat on the committee, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, spoke derisively of what they called Trump's ""dangerous,"" ""destructive,"" and ""mindless"" trade restrictions. They protested that protectionism was harming our relations with our friends and raising prices on our consumers and could thrust the economy into recession.

They all sounded like Milton Friedman and Adam Smith protégés. Democrats were defending the virtues of global capitalism and international commerce, and stiff-arming the Trumpian ""America First,"" nationalist theme. Wall Street and Silicon Valley started steering even more of its campaign cash to reward these pro-business Democrats.

What happened?



Now Donald Trump has renegotiated a new North America free trade deal with some impressive improvements, including greater protections of American drug patents and reduction in Canada agriculture tariffs. Yes, there are some dubious protectionist policies too, such as requiring that Mexican auto workers get paid $16 an hour. Despite these flaws, the overriding value is it thankfully preserves the free trade architecture of the original NAFTA deal. Just six months ago it looked like free trade between Canada, the US and Mexico was going to blow up into a mutually destructive trade war.

Now this new deal ""USMCA"" is grounded in Congress. Will those virtuous free-trade Democrats put up or shut up? So far they aren't showing up at all. Every vote count analysis finds that support from Democrats is nowhere near where it must be to secure ratification through the House.

The born again free trade Democrats are inventing every possible excuse for stonewalling. They are saying it lacks protections for American workers from low-priced Mexican labor and plant closings. This is a farcical argument. In addition to the minimum wage requirement, Mexico must also enact a host of workplace measures that support and protect women, unions and migrant workers. There are also new ""Made in America"" domestic content requirements for manufacturing. These sops to the unions are the very reason some free-trade Republicans are legitimately worried about the deal.

But the GOPers will be fine. The fate of USMCA rests in the lap of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Will she free up her caucus to provide the votes to approve a Trump initiative that's good for all three nations? Or will she ramrod Democrats back into their safe space of resistance to anything Trump is for - even if it advances the interests of Democratic constituents and the nation as a whole?

Even the liberal intellectuals who were ringing the bells for free trade internationalism are now stoically silent on USMCA. These free-trade hypocrites are apparently for every trade deal - unless it is negotiated by Donald Trump.

What is worse, killing USMCA would hurt the very voters and home-town businesses in the districts the Democrats represent. A pro-trade group called the Metropolitan Policy Program reports that major cities - including New York, Houston, St. Louis, Chicago, Austin, and even Detroit have become major export centers with tens of billions of dollars of goods and services shipped abroad. Urban areas are now major trade centers and free trade is imperative to their prosperity.

Since 1994 when Ronald Reagan's vision and Bill Clinton's new Democrat promise to sign NAFTA was delivered, trade across borders in North America has almost quadrupled from roughly $290 billion in 1993 to more than $1.1 trillion in 2016, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, This has been one of the great bipartisan economic successes of modern times.

Voting down USMCA would weaken the entire North American continent as we compete for continued supremacy against the European Union and the Asian tigers. Democrats must get on board.

If they won't, Trump has threatened to rescind NAFTA and reinstall the high tariff policies of the previous era. If it comes to this, for Trump it would be better policy and politics to keep NAFTA in place, and blame Pelosi and the other fake free trade Democrats for preventing an even better deal for American business and workers.

QINGDAO, China (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country is locked in a high-stakes trade dispute with the United States, on Sunday said China rejects “selfish, shortsighted” trade policies, and called for building an open global economy.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Record imports in October drove the U.S. trade deficit to the highest level in a decade .

These include the theft of trade secrets and forcing U.S. companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market , the U.S. charges .

Rep. Luke Messer of Indiana , a former free trade advocate who delivered a rousing floor speech in 2015 saying open markets create jobs and economic opportunities , is blunt about the transformation : “ The president has changed my opinion on these trade agreements , ” he said in a debate among Republicans running for the party ’ s Senate nomination .
His rivals — Rep. Todd Rokita and former state lawmaker Mike Braun — have staked out similar positions , backing Mr. Trump ’ s criticism of “ unfair ” trade deals as well as his decision last month to slap tariffs on Chinese imports .
Republican Rep. James B. Renacci said he is constantly weighing the pros and cons of trade as he calibrates his positions ahead of a Senate run in Ohio .
Democrats say Mr. Renacci is being wishy-washy after a long career of voting for free trade deals , including agreements with South Korea , Colombia and Panama in 2011 , and fast-track trade negotiating powers for President Obama in 2015 .
In Pennsylvania , Rep. Lou Barletta also backed free trade in 2011 and 2015 , but now as a Senate candidate , he touts his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and praises Mr. Trump ’ s stiffer stance .

“ The politics of trade have changed enormously since Trump became president , ” said Darrell West , vice president and director of governance studies and director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution . “ Most Republicans supported free trade , but now they have embraced his tough stance on China . ”
Mr. Trump had long been a critic of U.S. trade policy , and as president he has backed up his talk with action . He withdrew from the TPP , the trade deal Mr. Obama negotiated with the 2015 fast-track powers , and he demanded rewrites of free trade agreements with South Korea , Canada and Mexico .
The irony is that it was Republicans who provided the bulk of votes for each of those deals , with 90 percent supporting the Korean agreement in 2011 , among them then-Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana , and three-quarters backing fast-track powers in 2015 .
“ I think this phenomenon illustrates the importance of leadership , especially from the president , on trade as well as the fact that Trump remains fairly popular within the party , ” said Colin Grabow , policy analyst at the Cato Institute ’ s Herbert A Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies .
“ What ’ s most disappointing is that this protectionist approach will continue to yield self-inflicted wounds and lead to the kind of tit-for-tat exchange we are seeing now that makes Americans less free and ultimately harms workers and consumers , ” said Tim Phillips , president of Americans for Prosperity . “ Hurting consumers and making them pay more for everyday goods is never good politics . ”
David McIntosh , president of the Club for Growth , said it marks a definite shift from the Bush years , when Republicans took for granted that trade deals were always good for the country .
“ What I think is missing is leadership on why trade is important , how many jobs are created because of free trade , how much people benefit in their standard of living because of the cheaper goods they are able to get , ” Mr. McIntosh said .
Mr. McIntosh said tariffs have proved to be ineffective and predicted the same will happen once it becomes clear that the latest round do more harm than good .
“ I worry about candidates who are trying to go off and beat their chests and try to be macho about how they are against trade , ” he said . “ I think we will get the right balance there , but you will see some casualties when you see these candidates swing too far in toward protectionism . ”
Mr. McIntosh said flight from free trade isn ’ t universal within the Republican Party and that a number of prominent candidates are sticking to their records .
Support for the North American Free Trade Agreement among Republican voters has dropped from 43 percent in 2008 to 34 percent now , according to a poll in August from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs .
Democrats , meanwhile , are becoming bullish on trade , with 71 percent of their voters backing NAFTA — up from just 41 percent in 2008 .
Former Rep. Robin Hayes of North Carolina lived through several Republican trade battles .
One was in 2001 , when the House was voting on whether to grant President George W. Bush fast-track trade promotion authority . Mr. Hayes worried that his state ’ s textile industry , already battered by NAFTA , would be further damaged .
He was reduced to tears as House Republican leaders pressured him to be the deciding vote in what turned out to be a 215-214 victory for Mr. Bush .
Four years later , Mr. Hayes again had to be pressured to switch his vote and back the Central America Free Trade Agreement , which cleared the House by a 217-215 vote . Mr. Hayes then lost his seat in the 2008 election .
Mr. Hayes , a former textile mill owner whose home state bled textile jobs after the passage of NAFTA , told The ███ that the votes were tough but he stood by them . He said he was able to win important concessions in exchange for his support .
“ I have to live with myself in terms of this vote regardless of political implications or outcomes , ” he said . “ Was this the right vote ? It absolutely was based on the big picture . We have to have international markets . ”
Asked what he makes of lawmakers who have supported open markets in the past only to adopt the Trump mantle on trade in recent months , Mr. Hayes likened them to Don Quixote in “ Man of La Mancha . ”
“ If I was advising people running a campaign , I would say , ‘ Think in depth about the position you take and you believe in it , ’ ” he said . “ Make sure it is something you can say six months , six years , from now , ‘ I did the right thing . ’ ”
While Mr. Hayes took heat for going from a no to a yes on trade for Mr. Bush , Republican candidates now are facing criticism for going the other way for Mr. Trump .
In the Indiana Republican primary Mr. Braun appears in a television commercial strolling around town with cardboard cutouts of his rivals , highlighting their votes to grant Mr. Obama trade authority .
Mr. Rokita , meanwhile , has accused Mr. Braun ’ s trucking company of benefiting from lopsided trade deals that have displaced American workers .
“ Mike Braun is a bigger hypocrite than even Mexico Joe , ” said Nathan Brand , a Rokita spokesman .
The Braun and Messer campaigns did not respond to inquiries .
Democrats say all of the Republican candidates are opportunists on trade and that Sen. Joe Donnelly , Indiana Democrat , is the only consistent politician in the race .
“ All three GOP candidates ’ phony attempts to catch up to the political mood by talking tough on trade aren ’ t fooling anyone , ” said Michael Feldman , spokesman for the Indiana Democratic Party .
Mr. Grabow said the negative view of trade Mr. Trump has instilled is misguided . If the president is correct about NAFTA , he said , then the 1990s would have been a terrible time for employment .
“ If Trump was a free-trader I suspect many of these same lawmakers would have been happy to maintain their original stances , ” Mr. Grabow said . “ Taking positions which are not aligned with the White House can carry real costs — as Jeff Flake can attest — while mimicking his positions seems to have little downside . No one wants to risk a primary fight by being perceived as insufficiently supportive of Trump . ”","President Trump has rewritten the Washington playbook on trade politics, and many Republican Senate candidates are chasing after him, embracing get-tough approaches that would have been unthinkable for them just a few years ago.

“I worry about candidates who are trying to go off and beat their chests and try to be macho about how they are against trade,” he said. “I think we will get the right balance there, but you will see some casualties when you see these candidates swing too far in toward protectionism.”

Mr. McIntosh said flight from free trade isn’t universal within the Republican Party and that a number of prominent candidates are sticking to their records.

But their base voters are increasingly skeptical.

Support for the North American Free Trade Agreement among Republican voters has dropped from 43 percent in 2008 to 34 percent now, according to a poll in August from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

Democrats, meanwhile, are becoming bullish on trade, with 71 percent of their voters backing NAFTA — up from just 41 percent in 2008.

Former Rep. Robin Hayes of North Carolina lived through several Republican trade battles.

One was in 2001, when the House was voting on whether to grant President George W. Bush fast-track trade promotion authority. Mr. Hayes worried that his state’s textile industry, already battered by NAFTA, would be further damaged.

He was reduced to tears as House Republican leaders pressured him to be the deciding vote in what turned out to be a 215-214 victory for Mr. Bush.

Four years later, Mr. Hayes again had to be pressured to switch his vote and back the Central America Free Trade Agreement, which cleared the House by a 217-215 vote. Mr. Hayes then lost his seat in the 2008 election.

Mr. Hayes, a former textile mill owner whose home state bled textile jobs after the passage of NAFTA, told The Washington Times that the votes were tough but he stood by them. He said he was able to win important concessions in exchange for his support.

“I have to live with myself in terms of this vote regardless of political implications or outcomes,” he said. “Was this the right vote? It absolutely was based on the big picture. We have to have international markets.”

Asked what he makes of lawmakers who have supported open markets in the past only to adopt the Trump mantle on trade in recent months, Mr. Hayes likened them to Don Quixote in “Man of La Mancha.”

“If I was advising people running a campaign, I would say, ‘Think in depth about the position you take and you believe in it,’” he said. “Make sure it is something you can say six months, six years, from now, ‘I did the right thing.’”

While Mr. Hayes took heat for going from a no to a yes on trade for Mr. Bush, Republican candidates now are facing criticism for going the other way for Mr. Trump.

In the Indiana Republican primary Mr. Braun appears in a television commercial strolling around town with cardboard cutouts of his rivals, highlighting their votes to grant Mr. Obama trade authority.

Mr. Rokita, meanwhile, has accused Mr. Braun’s trucking company of benefiting from lopsided trade deals that have displaced American workers.

“Mike Braun is a bigger hypocrite than even Mexico Joe,” said Nathan Brand, a Rokita spokesman.

The Braun and Messer campaigns did not respond to inquiries.

Democrats say all of the Republican candidates are opportunists on trade and that Sen. Joe Donnelly, Indiana Democrat, is the only consistent politician in the race.

“All three GOP candidates’ phony attempts to catch up to the political mood by talking tough on trade aren’t fooling anyone,” said Michael Feldman, spokesman for the Indiana Democratic Party.

Mr. Grabow said the negative view of trade Mr. Trump has instilled is misguided. If the president is correct about NAFTA, he said, then the 1990s would have been a terrible time for employment.

But the president’s pressure is working.

“If Trump was a free-trader I suspect many of these same lawmakers would have been happy to maintain their original stances,” Mr. Grabow said. “Taking positions which are not aligned with the White House can carry real costs — as Jeff Flake can attest — while mimicking his positions seems to have little downside. No one wants to risk a primary fight by being perceived as insufficiently supportive of Trump.”

West Texas Intermediate crude futures surged 24.67 % to settle at $ 25.32 per barrel , for its largest single-day percentage gain in history . Given WTI 's 59 % decline this year a smaller gain , of course , now accounts for a much larger percentage move . International benchmark Brent crude jumped 17.8 % , or $ 4.40 , to trade at $ 29.14 per barrel .
Trump told ███ 's Joe Kernen Thursday that he spoke to President Putin yesterday and Saudi Crown Prince Thursday and expects them to announce an oil production cut of 10 million barrels and could be up to 15 million .
The president later tweeted that a production cut would be `` great for the oil & gas industry ! '' His comments came before a meeting with energy industry executives scheduled for Friday .
`` It will be very welcomed by the industry in the short run , '' Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on ███ 's `` Squawk on the Street . '' `` As long as the coronavirus continues , there 's just a substantial amount of excess capacity being generated every day ... It will be particularly helpful as we come out of this virus and will speed the time hopefully where the supply-demand for oil can get back into balance . ''
Oil production is typically discussed in terms of barrels per day , but Trump made no reference to the time frame of the cuts . Additionally , it was not clear how the cuts would be distributed across oil-producing countries .
RBC commodity strategist Helima Croft said the U.S. could have to give up something in return .
`` What we know is the Saudis were looking at this through the lens of the financial crisis and believe they needed a response commensurate to 08/09 , '' she said , referring to the collapse of prices during the 2008-09 financial crisis .

They will be looking for signs that U.S. production will be curtailed . They will be watching what happens with the Texas Railroad Commission and with Canada , '' she said .","Oil prices skyrocketed on Thursday after President Donald Trump told CNBC Saudis and Russia will ease pressure on oil, ending a price war that has contributed to crude's massive plunge.

West Texas Intermediate crude futures surged 24.67% to settle at $25.32 per barrel, for its largest single-day percentage gain in history. Given WTI's 59% decline this year a smaller gain, of course, now accounts for a much larger percentage move. International benchmark Brent crude jumped 17.8%, or $4.40, to trade at $29.14 per barrel.

Trump told CNBC's Joe Kernen Thursday that he spoke to President Putin yesterday and Saudi Crown Prince Thursday and expects them to announce an oil production cut of 10 million barrels and could be up to 15 million.

The president later tweeted that a production cut would be ""great for the oil & gas industry!"" His comments came before a meeting with energy industry executives scheduled for Friday.

""It will be very welcomed by the industry in the short run,"" Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""As long as the coronavirus continues, there's just a substantial amount of excess capacity being generated every day ... It will be particularly helpful as we come out of this virus and will speed the time hopefully where the supply-demand for oil can get back into balance.""

Oil production is typically discussed in terms of barrels per day, but Trump made no reference to the time frame of the cuts. Additionally, it was not clear how the cuts would be distributed across oil-producing countries.

RBC commodity strategist Helima Croft said the U.S. could have to give up something in return.

""What we know is the Saudis were looking at this through the lens of the financial crisis and believe they needed a response commensurate to 08/09,"" she said, referring to the collapse of prices during the 2008-09 financial crisis.

""The question is can Trump put together the package that gets them to do that?"" Croft said. ""We know there's an emergency OPEC meeting.

World markets plunged further on Tuesday following heavy losses on Wall Street after China delivered a swift rebuff to Donald Trump by imposing retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of US imports.

Beijing ignored warnings from Trump about the dangers of escalating the trade conflict and sent tremors through global markets by announcing a new 25% import duty on a range of US products.

In early trade on Tuesday, Hong Kong led losses when the market reopened after a long weekend. The Hang Seng Index sank 1.7% while Shanghai shed 0.2% and Tokyo was off 0.7% at the break.

Sydney and Singapore each dropped more than one percentage point, with Manila and Jakarta both down 1.6%. There were also losses in Taipei and Wellington, though Seoul edged up slightly.

Medha Samant, director of investment at Fidelity International, told Bloomberg TV: “In the short term, it looks like volatility is here to stay and we could see this risk-off, risk-on going on for a long time.”

The retreat came after the Nasdaq on Wall Street suffered its worst day of 2019 and the Dow ended at its lowest point in more than three months.

In the latest stage of the tit-for-tat battle between the world’s two biggest economies, China targeted almost 2,500 products, from food and consumer goods to chemicals and machinery, and said the increases would come into force next month.

Apple, Boeing and Caterpillar were the biggest casualties of a global market sell-off as investors concluded that they would be among the companies most affected by China’s action.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 600 points, both it and the S&P 500 recording their biggest losses since January, after hopes of a speedy resolution to the dispute were replaced by fears of a long and damaging trade war.

In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 fell 39 points, or 0.55%, to end Monday at 7,163, its lowest level since 13 March, while the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized, more UK-focused companies, fell more than 1.2% to a six-week low.

The U.S. and China are sitting down Wednesday for the first of two days of high-level talks aimed at finding a solution to a trade war that’s casting a growing shadow on both of the world’s two largest economies. But don’t hold your breath for a deal.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who remains the most prominent advocate of a deal in the Trump administration, on Tuesday told the Fox Business Network he expected “significant progress” in this week’s talks.

Administration officials and other people familiar with the state of play, however, say the two sides remain far apart on key issues, with the U.S. side still engaged in an internal debate over how to proceed and ill-prepared for this week’s meetings. The U.S.’s unveiling this week of criminal charges against Chinese corporate giant Huawei Technologies Co. isn’t helping the mood.

The two days of talks between delegations led by Xi Jinping’s top economic emissary, Liu He, and President Donald Trump’s trade tsar, Robert Lighthizer, are the highest-level negotiations since the two leaders sat down for dinner Dec. 1. They come in the wake of lower-level talks this month in Beijing and after a period of market turmoil that has left both governments eager to publicly claim progress to calm investors’ nerves.

Preparations for the talks are ongoing, People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said at his hotel in Washington before the trade talks began on Wednesday morning. Later, Liu and Yi were seen entering the White House complex for the start of the negotiations.

U.S. officials have expressed frustration over an internal split between those like Mnuchin who favor making a deal with China and others who advocate a tougher approach, including Lighthizer, which combined with Trump’s unpredictability has created a chaotic policy-making process, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

Low Expectations

For experts, expectations remain low for any meaningful progress this week.

“At the end of the week we’ll probably get some fairly bland statements suggesting that talks made progress,’’ David Dollar, a former U.S. Treasury representative in China now at the Brookings Institution, told a conference on Tuesday. “I don’t think they can hammer it out in the next few days.’’

Senior U.S. officials are said to remain mindful of the limits of their ability to agree to something meaningful with Trump having rejected proposals brought to him in the past. The politics of any deal are also growing more complicated as Trump’s standing in the polls has been falling again after his gambit to shut down the government to force Congress to approve funding for a wall on the Mexican border went wrong.

“The only person who can cut a deal is Donald Trump. But it’s difficult for him to do so under the current circumstance because he is facing a lot of criticism domestically,’’ said Cheng Li, research director of the Brookings’ John L. Thornton China Center.

Economic Slowdown

Trump has made much of China’s economic slowdown, arguing that it increases pressure on Xi to strike a deal. But the U.S. economy and U.S. companies are also beginning to see damage from the trade war.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday said it expected that Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods would cut the U.S.’s real gross domestic product by at least 0.1 percent on average through 2029. It also predicted overall U.S. GDP growth would slow to 2.3 percent this year, 1.7 percent in 2020, and 1.6 percent in 2021.

Mnuchin on Tuesday acknowledged that growth has slowed in Europe and China, but said he didn’t expect that to dent U.S. growth that he insisted wasn’t being hit by the trade dispute with China. “There is still a very good case for 3 percent growth this year,” he said.

The business community remains more anxious about slowing growth in China and the prospect that the tariffs complicating life for many companies will remain in place for the foreseeable future.

Apple, Harley

Apple Inc. on Tuesday reported a steep drop in sales in Greater China, representing almost $5 billion of lost revenue. Harley-Davidson Inc. earlier in the day said it barely broke even in the last quarter of 2018 after getting caught up in Trump’s trade wars. On Monday, Caterpillar Inc. reported its biggest quarterly profit miss in a decade amid the China slowdown, sending its shares tumbling.

U.S. companies and trade associations have fought the tariffs at every step. While they agree action is needed to address allegations of intellectual property theft and other unfair trade practices, they say the duties are the wrong approach.

WASHINGTON – Wielding tariffs as a foreign policy weapon, President Donald Trump said Friday he would increase duties on steel and aluminum from Turkey as the two nations argue about a imprisoned American.

""I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!"" Trump tweeted. ""Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%.""

He added: ""Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!'

The tweeted tariff threat came little more than a week after the Trump administration placed sanctions on Turkish officials over the imprisonment of American pastor Andrew Brunson, calling his detention ""unjust"" and ""unacceptable.""

BEIJING (AP) — Beijing and Washington have agreed to reduce some punitive tariffs on each other’s goods as talks on ending their trade war progress, a Chinese spokesman said Thursday, removing a possible stumbling block to a settlement.

The agreement came during talks aimed at working out details of a “Phase 1” deal announced Oct. 12. Financial markets were rattled by reports China was pushing for tariffs to be lifted, which raised the possibility of a breakdown in talks.

Negotiators agreed to a “phased cancellation” of tariff hikes if talks progress, said a Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng.

“If the two sides achieve a ‘Phase 1’ agreement, then based on the content of that agreement, tariffs already increased should be canceled at the same time and by the same rate,” Gao said at a news briefing.

As for the size of reductions, Gao said that would depend on the agreement.

Governments of the two biggest global economies have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods in the fight over China’s trade surplus and technology ambitions.

The Oct. 12 agreement was modest and details have yet to be put on paper but it was welcomed as a sign of progress toward ending the trade war.

President Donald Trump agreed to postpone a planned tariff hike while lower-level officials hammered out details.

Trump said China agreed to buy up to $50 billion of American farm goods. Beijing has yet to confirm the scale of its commitment.

News reports said Beijing wants 15% tariffs imposed in September on $125 billion of Chinese imports removed before it will make a formal commitment.

There had been no indication whether Trump might agree, which raised the possibility of another breakdown in negotiations.

China’s imports of American soybeans and other goods tumbled 26.4% in the first nine months of this year following tariff hikes and orders to importers to find other suppliers.

The Oct. 12 agreement helped to ease financial market jitters, but the two sides have yet to report progress on major disagreements over technology and other irritants following 13 rounds of talks.

Trump and Xi were due to meet at this month’s gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders in Chile but that event was canceled due to protests there.

#WednesdayThoughts - Not that I'm dying to visit the White House these days, but I think it's pretty petty to exclude the House Dems who were instrumental in improving and passing #USMCA. — Rep. Linda Sánchez (@RepLindaSanchez) January 29, 2020

“Because of the work of the House Democrats, under the leadership of Richie Neal with his task force, they made tremendous differences in what was proposed originally and what the president will be signing today,” Speaker(D-Calif.) said at a morning news conference.Pelosi spokesman Henry Connelly took it a step further.""The White House hasn't invited House Democrats to their USMCA signing ceremony. But we'll be well represented in the huge changes to the original USMCA draft that Democrats wrested out of the administration on labor, prescription drugs, environment and enforcement mechanisms,” he said.Trump closed the original deal, updating the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2018, but Democrats insisted on changes. Over the course of 2019, they engaged in painstaking negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative, eventually settling on an updated deal that won the backing of prominent unions such as the AFL-CIO.Lighthizer, who won praise from Democrats for his seriousness in the negotiations, acknowledged ""Republicans and Democrats"" who “made this a bipartisan success,” but didn’t mention any Democrats by name.Lighthizer made light of the situation, a nod to the tense partisan divisions in Washington and the ongoing impeachment trial of Trump.“I’ve been in town long enough to know that listing members at a time like this makes more enemies than friends,” he said.Democrats sought credit for their role in the deal.“The first draft that we saw didn’t take care of many of the problems we were worried about,” said Rep.(D-Mich.).“We fought hard to improve the original deal because what the Trump administration originally proposed wasn’t sufficient,” she added.Some pointed to Trump’s decision to leave them out of the ceremony as an unnecessary partisan slight.“Not that I'm dying to visit the White House these days, but I think it's pretty petty to exclude the House Dems who were instrumental in improving and passing,” Rep. Linda(D-Calif.) tweeted.",www.thehill.com,center,Q5aYzSeQGdRR1wOB

Miller,"The Trump administration announced Friday new tariffs on $ 50 billion worth of Chinese goods , intensifying a trade dispute while seeking continued Chinese support in keeping pressure on North Korea .
The 25 percent tariff hits 1,102 products categories , nearly the total on a list that was put on hold last month for trade talks . Mr. Trump had been expected to significant trim that list .
China has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on $ 50 billion of U.S. goods . The escalating dispute stoked fears of a full-blown trade war between the world ’ s two largest economies .
Mr. Trump described it as more of a business deal , stressing his personal relationship with Chinese president Xi Jinping .
“ I have a wonderful relationship with President Xi . We ’ ll all work it out . He understands it ’ s unfair , ” Mr. Trump said on “ Fox & Friends . ”
Mr. Xi made similar comments Thursday about his personal relationship with Mr. Trump . He said he wants to grow the U.S.-China relations .
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the administration was playing defense against what he called the “ unprecedented threat ” of China ’ s theft of intellectual property and cyber attacks .
He accused Beijing of “ aggressively working to undermine America ’ s high-tech industries and our economic leadership through unfair trade practices and industrial policies like ‘ Made in China 2025 . ’ ”
Made in China 2025 is a policy rolled out in 2015 to comprehensively upgrade China ’ s industry , with an emphasis on his-tech including pharmaceuticals , and expend China ’ s influence globally .
Mr. Trump has made import taxes part of his “ America First ” policies to counter China ’ s trade barriers and unfair trade practices . He wants to reduce America ’ s $ 375 billion trade deficit with China .
Sen. Marco Rubio , a Florida Republican and leading China hawk , heralded the tariffs as a “ theft tax . ”
“ China is systematically stealing the fruits of American innovation in an attempt to displace us as the most powerful economy and military in the world , ” he said . “ Hitting China with a ‘ Theft Tax ’ isn ’ t protectionism , it ’ s American leadership . ”

The tariffs focus on products from China ’ s industrial sector including aerospace , information and communications technology , robotics , industrial machinery , new materials and automobiles .
The list does not include goods commonly purchased by American consumers such as cellphones or televisions , according to the administration .
The tariff policies have met opposition from trading partners , free-trade advocates in Congress and industry leaders in America .
The administration did reduce the original list of 1,333 product categories to 888 product categories worth about $ 34 billion . Another 284 products worth $ 16 billion were than added to the new list for the total of 1,102 precuts worth about $ 50 billion .
Jay Timmons , president of the National Association of Manufacturers , said bilateral trade deals are better than trade wars .
“ There is no question that China cheats and that its unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft are hurting America ’ s manufacturing workers , ” he said . “ To put an end to these threats and redefine the U.S.-China economic relationship , manufacturers are calling for a new path forward : a fair , binding , enforceable bilateral trade agreement . ”
The Retail Industry Leaders Association said in a statement : “ The Administration promised ‘ maximum pain on China , minimum pain on American consumers , ’ but America ’ s families and farmers will be the ones hurt most by these tariffs . Tariffs don ’ t punish China , they raise the cost for consumers . For many American families , these increased costs will wipe out any gains from tax reform . ”
Mr. Trump ’ s tough trade action was applauded by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , who typically opposes the president ’ s every move .
“ The president ’ s actions on China are on the money . China is our real trade enemy , and their theft of intellectual property and their refusal to let our companies compete fairly threatens millions of future American jobs , ” the New York Democrat said .
He added , “ While we await further details on this trade action , President Trump is right on target . ”
Other Democrats who generally support import taxes and cracking down on China still found fault with Mr. Trump .
“ While we simply can not let China ’ s unfair trade practices go unchecked , this president ’ s erratic approach to resolving this issue gives me pause , ” said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia .
He pointed to the Trump administration ’ s decision to lift a ban on Chinese cell phone maker ZTE , a major employer that faced bankruptcy because of the U.S. imposed ban for illegally doing business with Iran and North Korea .
The Pentagon also deemed ZTE a security threat because the phones theoretically could be used to spy on Americans .
Mr. Trump made a deal to save ZTE as a personal favor to Mr. Xi .
Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. , New Jersey Democrat , said he supported tariffs but the ZTE decision confused the policy .

Trump had made renegotiating the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) a major campaign issue in 2016, and plans to tout its replacement at events in coming weeks as he campaigns for a second term in office.

'USMCA rebalances trade in North America, replaces the job-killing NAFTA, ends the outsourcing of American jobs, and invests in the American worker,' he said.

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement must still be ratified by Canada before it can take effect. The U.S. Senate this month overwhelmingly approved the legislation, sending the measure to Trump for him to sign into law.

The Mexican parliament has already approved the deal.

Congressional aides said it could take several months before the trade accord is implemented, since the three countries must show they are meeting its obligations before the clock starts ticking on an effective date.

trade,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/2/17072300/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-disaster,Trump’s tariff decision is one of the worst fears about his presidency come to life,2018-03-02,"Zack Beauchamp, German Lopez, Tara Golshan, Alexia Fernández Campbell, P.R. Lockhart, Ella Nilsen, Nicole Narea","When Donald Trump was running for president , many critics worried about the way he would make decisions while in office . Trump is a man prone to emotional outbursts with little knowledge about public policy issues ; it was easy to spin worst-case scenarios in which he might put the country in danger on a whim .
It now looks like those fears are coming to life — that Trump has decided to put the global economy at risk because he was in a pissy mood .
The evidence for this scary-sounding theory comes from a Friday afternoon report published by NBC News , tracing Trump ’ s recent decision to slap large tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum . These tariffs have already prompted threats of retaliation from America ’ s leading trade partners ; European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker has discussed putting tariffs on blue jeans , bourbon , and Harley-Davidson motorcycles — three iconic American exports . Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo is openly warning that Trump ’ s actions may cause another recession .
So how did Trump come to such a monumental decision ? According to NBC ’ s sources in the White House , it was because he got some bad press :
According to two officials , Trump ’ s decision to launch a potential trade war was born out of anger at other simmering issues and the result of a broken internal process that has failed to deliver him consensus views that represent the best advice of his team . On Wednesday evening , the president became “ unglued , ” in the words of one official familiar with the president ’ s state of mind .

It ’ s bad enough that this approach yielded dangerous tariffs . Imagine if the next time Trump is angry , he starts thinking about North Korea .","When Donald Trump was running for president, many critics worried about the way he would make decisions while in office. Trump is a man prone to emotional outbursts with little knowledge about public policy issues; it was easy to spin worst-case scenarios in which he might put the country in danger on a whim.

It now looks like those fears are coming to life — that Trump has decided to put the global economy at risk because he was in a pissy mood.

The evidence for this scary-sounding theory comes from a Friday afternoon report published by NBC News, tracing Trump’s recent decision to slap large tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. These tariffs have already prompted threats of retaliation from America’s leading trade partners; European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker has discussed putting tariffs on blue jeans, bourbon, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles — three iconic American exports. Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo is openly warning that Trump’s actions may cause another recession.

So how did Trump come to such a monumental decision? According to NBC’s sources in the White House, it was because he got some bad press:

According to two officials, Trump’s decision to launch a potential trade war was born out of anger at other simmering issues and the result of a broken internal process that has failed to deliver him consensus views that represent the best advice of his team. On Wednesday evening, the president became “unglued,” in the words of one official familiar with the president’s state of mind. A trifecta of events had set him off in a way that two officials said they had not seen before: Hope Hicks’ testimony to lawmakers investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, conduct by his embattled attorney general and the treatment of his son-in-law by his chief of staff. Trump, the two officials said, was angry and gunning for a fight, and he chose a trade war.

Think about that for a second. People inside the White House are telling the press that bad political news caused the president to become “unglued,” and that he decided the best way to respond to that was to launch a trade war. It’s policymaking out of sheer emotional pique.

How this dangerous decision-making could become the new normal

Dig deeper into the NBC story and the picture gets even more worrisome. Even after his initial outburst, Trump apparently didn’t bother to consult with his economic and diplomatic advisers on the best way to implement these tariffs. In fact, almost no one important was warned of Trump’s monumental decision before it was made, and the White House did virtually nothing to prepare for the all-too-predictable angry response from foreign leaders:

There were no prepared, approved remarks for the president to give at the planned meeting, there was no diplomatic strategy for how to alert foreign trade partners, there was no legislative strategy in place for informing Congress and no agreed upon communications plan beyond an email cobbled together by Ross’s team at the Commerce Department late Wednesday that had not been approved by the White House. No one at the State Department, the Treasury Department or the Defense Department had been told that a new policy was about to be announced or given an opportunity to weigh in in advance.

The reason this kind of thing hasn’t happened before, according to report after report from inside the White House, is that Trump’s advisers have been able to keep his impulses in check. More sober policymakers, like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, have figured out ways to steer him away from his cruder impulses and toward a more measured, conventional policy approach.

The problem is that Trump’s staff is disintegrating amid a series of mounting scandals. The Russia investigation, allegations of domestic violence by a top White House staffer, reports of outlandish spending by Cabinet officials, and just general frustration with Trump’s chaotic management style have led to a number of departures from the Trump White House. This has led to a weakening of the personnel wall between Trump and his more outlandish impulses.

This whole mess played out in the tariff case: A piece in Politico suggests that Rob Porter — the former White House staff secretary who resigned amid multiple allegations of domestic abuse — had been organizing meetings designed to block imposition of new tariffs. “Porter’s resignation removed a fierce opponent of the tariffs from the West Wing and revived the chaotic policy review process that defined the early weeks of Trump’s presidency,” Politico reports.

White House staff chaos is letting Trump be Trump. That means feelings dictating outcomes, policymaking by pique — consequences be damned.

Trump says his tariffs are meant to protect U.S. industry and workers from unfair international competition as part of his “America First” agenda.

The prospect that he could be moving toward an even greater protectionist trade policy is likely to chill financial markets worried about tit-for-tit escalation that could lead to a full-blown global trade war.

Trump has announced tariffs of up to $150 billion on Chinese goods over U.S. complaints of Beijing’s trade practices and its alleged theft of U.S. technology. China has vowed to retaliate in equal measure.

Canada, Mexico and the EU also are moving ahead with their own levies on U.S. goods.

Earlier on Saturday, Trump told reporters it would be “very easy” to make the case for tariffs on auto imports using the rationale that they threaten national security.

“It’s economic. It’s the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet,” he said.

But as described by Sen. Ron Wyden ( D ) of Oregon , Mr. Obama ’ s point person on trade in the Senate , “ the president was all-in on this issue . ”
No question , the president ’ s trade agenda took tremendous bipartisan effort to shape and pass . Senator Wyden took care to praise Republican leaders who he said were always “ straight ” with him . They rescued the trade package from a surprise derailment by House Democrats earlier this month . The president , too , applauded Republicans and Democrats for `` coming together '' on trade .
But it was Democrats who held the key to this presidential priority . Most Republicans in the GOP-controlled Congress may have agreed with Obama on trade , but not enough of them did . To win this signature item , Obama was going to have to win and hold some Democrats , and that was going to take persistent outreach and a convincing argument .
In the end , “ gutsy ” pro-trade Democrats in both houses stuck together despite pressure to abandon a deal , Wyden said . And a “ very determined president ” used the bully pulpit to explain how his approach differs from trade policy of the 1990s , which many Democrats blame for lost jobs and lower wages .
His articulation of his policy “ was a very significant help ” as was his outreach to Congress , Wyden told reporters Wednesday .
The result was the passage of two trade bills by the Senate Wednesday . The first , called fast track , means that Congress can not amend any trade bill the president negotiates – it can only vote up or down . The second provides assistance for workers displaced by global trade . Both bills have now passed both houses , and together , they are one of Obama ’ s major second-term priorities . He intends to use the authority to negotiate a historic trade deal with 11 other Pacific Rim nations .
To get to this point , the president put in hours on the phone with Wyden , at times talking two or three times a day , working out the next day ’ s strategy in 11 p.m. phone calls . And he stayed in touch with the GOP leadership .
But he also reached out to other lawmakers . Sen. Chris Coons ( D ) of Delaware says the president ’ s outreach persuaded him to vote “ yes . ”
In the five years since he ’ s been a senator , Senator Coons says he ’ s never had as much engagement with the White House on any issue as on trade . For months , the senator debated and discussed trade with the secretary of Labor , the secretary of Commerce , the US trade representative , the vice president , and yes , even the president .
Coons says he gave “ comparable ” time to labor and environmental leaders who strenuously oppose the president ’ s push for a Pacific trade deal .
But his mind was changed by the administration ’ s argument that the United States has an opportunity to positively influence the rules of global trade and strategic relations in the Pacific . He attributed Wednesday ’ s narrow Senate passage of “ fast track ” – with not one vote to spare – to the “ personal , relentless , and effective ” lobbying of senators by Obama and his cabinet .
“ I think that frankly is what made the difference , ” said Coons in an interview after the 60-to-38 vote that sent the bill to the president ’ s desk for signature .
Obama 's outreach to members didn ’ t always work . His unexpected show at a congressional softball game on the eve of a key House vote set tweets aflutter , but not the hearts of opposing Democrats . The next morning , his rare visit to Capitol Hill didn ’ t dissuade them from killing his plan through an unusual move .
But Republican leaders found a way around that `` procedural snafu , '' as Obama 's spokesman called it , and the president persisted .
“ He threw himself into it… . He would not take ‘ no ’ for an answer , ” says presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar , adding that Obama used every lever that a president has for influence , and he used them simultaneously .
Not that he wasn ’ t also very involved in the priority of his first term , the Affordable Care Act . But with the ACA , she says , he waited for people on the Hill to make decisions . This time , he moved directly .
“ In 6-1/2 years , you bring to bear the lessons you have learned , and he did that . ”
Whether Obama can carry that forward to the rest of his agenda – infrastructure , corporate tax reform , immigration , the budget , and an Iran deal ( if there is one ) – is another matter .
He was able to pursue fast track because it aligned with the interest of Republicans . But the president and GOP leaders clash on many of these other issues , particularly over spending .
Meanwhile , the Democratic rift over trade has spilled into the presidential race , with Hillary Clinton waffling on her views of the Pacific trade deal . She supported it when she was the president 's secretary of State .

On Thursday , Obama was clearly trying to heal the rift .
“ As president , I 've spent the last 6-1/2 years fighting to grow our economy and strengthen our middle class , and that remains my top priority today , ” he said in his statement . The new trade legislation will give workers “ the chance to compete and win . ”","President Obama has often been accused of being missing in action on Capitol Hill – not a schmoozer, not eager to put in the personal time with lawmakers to advance his priorities.

He attributed Wednesday’s narrow Senate passage of “fast track” – with not one vote to spare – to the “personal, relentless, and effective” lobbying of senators by Obama and his cabinet.

“I think that frankly is what made the difference,” said Coons in an interview after the 60-to-38 vote that sent the bill to the president’s desk for signature.

Obama's outreach to members didn’t always work. His unexpected show at a congressional softball game on the eve of a key House vote set tweets aflutter, but not the hearts of opposing Democrats. The next morning, his rare visit to Capitol Hill didn’t dissuade them from killing his plan through an unusual move.

But Republican leaders found a way around that ""procedural snafu,"" as Obama's spokesman called it, and the president persisted.

“He threw himself into it…. He would not take ‘no’ for an answer,” says presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar, adding that Obama used every lever that a president has for influence, and he used them simultaneously.

Not that he wasn’t also very involved in the priority of his first term, the Affordable Care Act. But with the ACA, she says, he waited for people on the Hill to make decisions. This time, he moved directly.

“In 6-1/2 years, you bring to bear the lessons you have learned, and he did that.”

Whether Obama can carry that forward to the rest of his agenda – infrastructure, corporate tax reform, immigration, the budget, and an Iran deal (if there is one) – is another matter.

He was able to pursue fast track because it aligned with the interest of Republicans. But the president and GOP leaders clash on many of these other issues, particularly over spending.

Meanwhile, the Democratic rift over trade has spilled into the presidential race, with Hillary Clinton waffling on her views of the Pacific trade deal. She supported it when she was the president's secretary of State.

On Thursday, Obama was clearly trying to heal the rift.

“As president, I've spent the last 6-1/2 years fighting to grow our economy and strengthen our middle class, and that remains my top priority today,” he said in his statement. The new trade legislation will give workers “the chance to compete and win.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,FiuuuSzInkRP9poI

In this context , the candidacy of Donald Trump has been presented as a deviation from America ’ s historic “ free trade ” policy when , in fact , America was founded on Alexander Hamilton ’ s protectionist economic system whose greatest defenders would become Abraham Lincoln ’ s Republican Party .
Our nation ’ s long , successful record of trade protectionism has been “ deliberately forgotten , ” says economist Ian Fletcher .
Today , “ standard economic history taught in the United States is distorted by ideology and has key facts airbrushed out , ” Fletcher says :
The idea that America ’ s economic tradition has been economic liberty , laissez faire , and wide-open cowboy capitalism — which would naturally include free trade… is simply not real history . The reality is that all four presidents on Mount Rushmore were protectionists . ( Even Jefferson came around after the War of 1812 ) . Protectionism is , in fact , the real American way .
As Lincoln declared , “ Give us a protective tariff and we will have the greatest nation on earth. ” Lincoln warned that “ the abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government… must produce want and ruin among our people . ”
In 1816 , Thomas Jefferson wrote , “ manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort… keep pace with me in purchasing nothing foreign where an equivalent of domestic fabric can be obtained , without regard to difference of price . ”
In 1832 , the Great Compromiser , Henry Clay , was vocal about his disdain for “ free traders ” : “ It is not free trade that they are recommending to our acceptance . It is in effect , the British colonial system that we are invited to adopt ; and , if their policy prevail , it will lead substantially to the re-colonization of these States , under the commercial dominion of Great Britain . ”
Clay ’ s rival , Andrew Jackson , in explaining his support for a tariff , wrote : “ We have been too long subject to the policy of the British merchants . It is time we should become a little more Americanized , and , instead of feeding the paupers and laborers of Europe , feed our own , or else , in a short time , by continuing our present policy , we shall all be paupers ourselves . ”
“ Under free trade , the trader is the master and the producer the slave . Protection is but the law of nature , the law of self-preservation , of self-development , of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man , ” said Republican President William McKinley . “ [ Free trade ] destroys the dignity and independence of American labor… It will take away from the people of this country who work for a living— and the majority of them live by the sweat of their faces— it will take from them heart and home and hope . It will be self-destruction . ”
Historically , “ free trade ” was a policy supported by Southern agrarians , who benefitted disproportionately from a low-tariff trading system . Northern industrialist Republicans favored higher tariffs to ensure American workers and industry would thrive , and be “ protected ” from foreign aggression that would seek to weaken America by making it reliant on foreign goods .
Following World War II , America began switching from a policy of protection , to a policy of “ free trade , ” which used international trade deals as a means of diplomacy and alliance-building , slowly eroding and ultimately destroying America ’ s status as the world ’ s dominant manufacturing power .
“ For some time now our ‘ best and brightest ’ have been invoking false doctrines that are systematically undermining American prosperity , ” writes Clyde Prestowitz , counselor to the Secretary of Commerce under President Reagan . “ Reversing America ’ s traditional national economic-development policies , U.S. leaders after World War II increasingly embraced consumerism and a faith in the efficacy of unfettered markets and trade that evolved over time into a new gospel of laissez-faire globalization . ”
It wasn ’ t until the mid-90s , however , that trade unilateralism and internationalism were fully embraced as the new dogma . Both Presidents Nixon and Reagan would be much more closely aligned with Trump on trade than they would be with today ’ s free trade dogmatists .
Under the leadership of Clinton and Bush , America began ceding control of its trading policies to international bureaucrats . Today ’ s Republican free traders are the champions of Clinton ’ s trade legacy — NAFTA , the WTO , and China ’ s entrance into the WTO .
If the founders had desired the dissolution of sovereignty and creation of international dependence guaranteed by organizations like the WTO or the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission , it is perhaps unlikely they would have ever fought for independence in the first place . As Jackson said while discussing his support for trade protections : “ If our liberty and republican form of government , procured for us by our revolutionary fathers , are worth the blood and treasure at which they were obtained , it surely is our duty to protect and defend them . ”
Prestowitz says that the new consensus of trade globalism has now become so dominant that we ’ ve been led “ to assume our current economic orthodoxy is the ‘ American Way. ’ Nothing could be further from the truth . In fact , it is a reversal of the doctrine of national economic development that made us the richest country on earth . ”
Consider the recent comments of talk radio host Mark Levin as an example of the transmogrification of the Republican worldview on this issue . Mr. Levin recently suggested that the dangers of tariffs and protectionism are axiomatic — “ It ’ s been tried and it ’ s failed miserably… It ’ s a fact… for me , it ’ s an open and shut case… it ’ s a disaster . I know it . ”
During earlier times in our history , prominent political and business leaders spoke out against such free trade dogmatism . As Jefferson wrote in explaining why his views had evolved to favor more protectionist policies : “ In so complicated a science as political economy , no one axiom can be laid down as wise and expedient for all times and circumstances , and for their contraries . ”
In 1875 , Joseph Wharton — the steel industrialist who founded the nation ’ s first business school and Trump ’ s alma mater , the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania — was more blunt in expressing his disdain for such religious free traders :
[ They ] assum [ e ] for their dogmas an infallibility as absolute as that claimed by the Pope for his dicta… and preaching everywhere the superior claims of their strange creed over the mere bonds of patriotism so that the revenues , development , and the existence of States are to perish in order that their fungus , Trade Philanthropy , may fatten for a while upon the decay , these verbose prophets of the new philosophy have become a nuisance and a source of infection which healthy political organisms can hardly afford to tolerate .
Beginning with Alexander Hamilton ’ s proposals for the industrial and technological development of the United States through use of subsidies , tariffs and patents , U.S. leaders pursued the “ American System ” of government-business partnership for national development of things like the Erie Canal , the telegraph , the transcontinental railroad , the aircraft industry , the RCA company founded by the U.S. Navy , and much more… [ The American System ] consisted of government policies and programs aimed at developing advanced infrastructure and protecting and subsidizing development of intellectual property and manufacturing industries .
“ This , of course , was antithetical to the free-market , laissez-faire policies , ” which Great Britain — and eventually the U.S. — would come to adopt .
Indeed , Henry Clay , the foremost proponent of the American System , made clear that ideological “ free trade ” was the American System ’ s antithesis :
When gentlemen have succeeded in their design of an immediate or gradual destruction of the American System , what is their substitute ? Free trade ! Free trade ! The call for free trade is as unavailing as the cry of a spoiled child , in its nurse ’ s arms , for the moon , or the stars that glitter in the firmament of heaven . It never has existed ; it never will exist . Trade implies , at least two parties . To be free , it should be fair , equal and reciprocal .
Many of the founders demonstrated commitment to promoting American manufacturing .
At his inauguration , George Washington is said to have spurned the fashion of his day — opting not to wear an elegant suit from Europe but instead a woolen suit made of cloth woven at the Hartford Woolen Manufactory in Connecticut . “ I hope it will not be a great while , before it will be unfashionable for a gentleman to appear in any other dress , ” Washington wrote in 1789 .
“ I use no porter or cheese in my family , but such as is made in America , ” Washington wrote , boasting that these domestic products are “ of an excellent quality . ”
One of the first acts of Congress Washington signed was a tariff among whose stated purpose was “ the encouragement and protection of manufactures . ”
Prestowitz further explains that in his 1791 Report on Manufactures , Alexander Hamilton , our nation ’ s first Secretary of Treasury , laid out a proposal that followed the “ English mercantilist model closely ” by calling for high tariffs to protect nascent American industry , supporting agriculture to encourage more exports , promoting “ Buy American ” policies and allocating federal funds for transit systems to facilitate commerce such as roads , bridges , and harbors .
Fletcher notes that “ Hamilton ’ s policies were not adopted in toto right away. ” It took the War of 1812 and witnessing Great Britain ’ s abusive trading practices “ to push America firmly into the protectionist camp . ”
While some founders were less protectionist than Hamilton , they were far more protectionist than today ’ s free traders . Indeed , the extent to which there was disagreement amongst the founders did not come close the chasm that exists today between the Paul Ryan , Wall Street Journal , Mark Levin “ free traders ” versus Pat Buchanan “ protectionists. ” Rather , their disagreements represented comparatively minor shades of variation between two schools of thought — both of which would today be regarded as protectionist .
Given the objections to Britain ’ s trading practices and the belief that trade needs to be “ equal and reciprocal , ” it seems unlikely the founders would support what former Nucor Steel chairman has described as the “ unilateral trade disarmament ” of our policies today .
Henry Clay explained that “ equal and reciprocal ” free trade “ never has existed ; [ and ] it never will exist. ” He warned against practicing “ romantic trade philanthropy… which invokes us to continue to purchase the produce of foreign industry , without regard to the state or prosperity of our own. ” Clay made clear that he was “ utterly and irreconcilably opposed ” to trade which would “ throw wide open our ports to foreign productions ” without reciprocation .
In 1822 , President Monroe observed that “ whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce , ” the conditions necessary for its success — reciprocity and international peace — “ has never occurred and can not be expected. ” Monroe said , “ strong reasons… impose on us the obligation to cherish and sustain our manufactures . ”
Likewise , in 1819 John Adams noted that he did not live in a world in which “ all the nations of the earth ” had adopted “ the abolition of all restrictive , exclusive , and monopolizing laws. ” Adams concluded that while foreign nations “ preserve in cherishing such laws… I know not how we can do ourselves justice without introducing… some portions of the same system . ”
In an 1816 letter , Jefferson , an agrarian who had originally been more supportive of “ free trade , ” expressed vexation that free traders attempted to use his earlier writings to promote their ideological agenda .
You tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence on England for manufactures . There was a time when I might have been so quoted with more candor , but within the thirty years which have since elapsed , how are circumstances changed ! [ … ] [ He ] who is now against domestic manufacture must be for reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation , or to be clothed in skins , and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns . I am not one of these . Experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort .
Jefferson blasted the free traders who use his former opinion on trade “ only as a stalking horse , to cover their disloyal propensities to keep us in eternal vassalage to a foreign and unfriendly people . ”
Yet today religious free traders continue to use the founders ’ legacy to promote their agenda . Indeed , compare the words of our founders and early Republican presidents to those of today ’ s conservative commentariat . This tension is perhaps best exemplified by Mark Levin , who has branded himself a constitutional scholar and “ constitutional conservative . ”
In a recent segment , Levin bizarrely suggests that the bureaucracy necessary for implementing Trump ’ s “ protectionism ” would go far beyond the scope of limited government envisioned by our founders :
Notice there ’ s never any discussion about the massive bureaucracy that ’ s going to be necessary if we have massive tariffs and protectionism — the power of the central government outside the constitution controlling… the movement of goods and services .
However , Lincoln would seem to disagree and argued that a tariff system was less intrusive than domestic taxation :
The tariff is the cheaper system , because the duties , being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points , will require comparatively few officers in their collection ; while by the direct tax system , the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors , going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts , devouring every blade of grass and other green thing .
Curiously , anti-tariff purists seem to favor a taxation model that is the exact inversion of the founder ’ s model — i.e . where income , consumption or sales are directly taxed , but imports are not . Yet this policy , however , would likely only have the effect of incentivizing people involved in production to shift that production overseas . Levin similarly suggests that unrestricted free trade is a necessity :
Ladies and gentlemen , I want you to look around your homes , I want you to look at your automobile in many cases . We kind of need trade , don ’ t we ? Otherwise why are you buying all of these things ?
However , in 1775 , John Adams posed Levin ’ s same question and arrived at the exact opposite conclusion of the “ Liberty ’ s Voice ” host .
“ Can The Inhabitants of North America live without foreign Trade ? ” Adams asked .
Answering his own question , Adams concluded : “ We must at first indeed sacrifice some of our appetites coffee , wine , punch , sugar , molasses… and our dress would not be so elegant… But these are trifles in a contest for Liberty . ”
Levin has said he opposes Trump ’ s protectionism because it will create higher prices for consumers :
A tariff is really just a tax… imposed on the American people… While Trump and his surrogates may have the money to pay the higher prices his policies would cause , many Americans – who are already having difficulty making ends meet – do not .
However , in a declaration that would seem to apply to our relationship with China today , Adams warned against the allure of cheap foreign goods that result from illicit trading practices :
[ British manufactures ] disgorged upon us all their stores of merchandise and manufactures , not only without profit , but at certain loss for a time… The cheapness of these articles allures us into extravagance and luxury , involves us in debt , exhausts our resources , and at length produces universal complaint .
Republican President McKinley rejected the “ cheaper is better ” argument outright : “ They [ free traders ] say , ‘ Buy where you can buy the cheapest. ’ That is one of their maxims… Of course , that applies to labor as to everything else . Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that , and it is the protection maxim : ‘ Buy where you can pay the easiest. ’ And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards . ”
They say , if you had not the Protective Tariff things would be a little cheaper . Well , whether a thing is cheap or whether it is dear depends on what we can earn by our daily labor . Free trade cheapens the product by cheapening the producer . Protection cheapens the product by elevating the producer .
Additionally , Hamilton and Lincoln argued that based on economies of scale , any temporary increase in costs resulting from a tariff would eventually decrease as the domestic manufacturer produced more .
Hamilton explained that despite an initial “ increase of price ” caused by regulations that control foreign competition , once a “ domestic manufacture has attained to perfection… it invariably becomes cheaper . ”
Lincoln similarly said that , “ if a duty amount to full protection be levied upon an article ” that could be produced domestically , “ at no distant day , in consequence of such duty , ” the domestic article “ will be sold to our people cheaper than before . ”
Unlike Levin , Lincoln did not see a tariff as a tax on low-income Americans because it would only burden the consumer according to the amount the consumer consumed .
By the tariff system , the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods… the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few , while the substantial and laboring many who live at home , and upon home products , go entirely free .
Levin argues that adopting protectionist policies to defend America ’ s industrial independence is not conservative . “ What I see developing is not a conservative coalition , but a coalition on the Republican side of big government advocates , ” Levin said . “ The Republican Party now is a party of the progressive Republicans . Theodore Roosevelt… the protectionists , Ross Perot , Pat Buchanan , the No-Growthers . ”
However , contrary to Levin ’ s suggestion , from 1871 to 1913 under the leadership of mostly Republican presidents , “ the average U.S. tariff on dutiable imports never fell below 38 percent [ and ] gross national product ( GNP ) grew 4.3 percent annually , twice the pace in free trade Britain and well above the U.S. average in the 20th century , ” notes Alfred Eckes Jr. , chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission under President Reagan .
Moreover , contrary to Levin ’ s telling of history , defending the American worker through trade protectionism was a priority of the original Republican Party . Free trade was the policy of Democrats . As Ian Fletcher has observed , “ reading the speech of 19th-century Republican politicians today , with their expressions of concern for the wages of the American working man , one finds oneself wondering how the party slipped to its present day let-them-eat-cake position. ” The Party of Lincoln had always been the Party of Protectionism . Indeed , Fletcher notes that Lincoln ’ s number two issue after slavery was the tariff .
In 1896 , the GOP platform pledged to “ renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection , as the bulwark of American industrial independence , and the foundation of development and prosperity . This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry . It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods ; it secures the American market for the American producer . It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman . ”
In fact , the GOP ’ s original view on trade seemed guided by the same “ America First ” principle articulated by Donald Trump .
As Whig representative and later Republican senator , Justin Morrill explained during an 1857 tariff debate : “ I am ruling America for the benefit , first , of Americans , and for the ‘ rest of mankind ’ afterwards . ”
Morrill attacked free trade “ devotees ” declaring , “ There is a transcendental philosophy of free trade , with devotees as ardent as any of those who preach the millennium… Free trade abjured patriotism and boasts of cosmopolitanism . It regards the labor of our own people with no more favor than that of the barbarian on the Danube or the cooly on the Ganges . ”
McKinley similarly made clear that the original Republican Party was a “ workers ’ party ” :
The protective tariff policy of the Republicans… has made the lives of the masses of our countrymen sweeter and brighter , and has entered the homes of America carrying comfort and cheer and courage . It gives a premium to human energy , and awakens the noblest aspiration in the breasts of men . Our own experience shows that it is the best for our citizenship and our civilization and that it opens up a higher and better destiny for our people .
Interestingly , it is not only today ’ s Republican Party that has wiped McKinley from the nation ’ s memory bank , but also President Obama , who went so far as to strip his name from Alaska ’ s Mount McKinley — now dubbed Denali . Donald Trump proclaimed this a “ great insult ” and pledged that , if elected , he would change the name back .
Lastly , Levin goes so far as to accuse Trump of sounding Marxist because of his desire to make the Republican Party a “ workers ’ party ” :
Now he [ Trump ] says the Republican is going to be a new party — the “ workers ’ party. ” The “ workers ’ party ” ? You ’ re going to call it the “ workers ’ party ” ? Like the Communist social workers ’ union ? [ … ] You ’ re going to sound like Marx now ? [ … ] We ’ re going to start talking about the proletariat ? And the bourgeois next ? That ’ s Bernie Sanders stuff !
While Levin presents himself as a guardian of our founders ’ economic principles , his support for unilateral free trade ironically places his trading views closer to Karl Marx than it does to the legacy of Washington , Hamilton , and Lincoln .
In his 1848 address to the Democratic Association of Brussels , Marx declared that he was “ in favor of free trade ” because of its destructive capabilities for hastening social revolution :","In recent decades, a revisionist history of American trade policy has developed an almost religious status in Washington D.C.

In this context, the candidacy of Donald Trump has been presented as a deviation from America’s historic “free trade” policy when, in fact, America was founded on Alexander Hamilton’s protectionist economic system whose greatest defenders would become Abraham Lincoln’s Republican Party.

Our nation’s long, successful record of trade protectionism has been “deliberately forgotten,” says economist Ian Fletcher.

Today, “standard economic history taught in the United States is distorted by ideology and has key facts airbrushed out,” Fletcher says:

The idea that America’s economic tradition has been economic liberty, laissez faire, and wide-open cowboy capitalism — which would naturally include free trade… is simply not real history. The reality is that all four presidents on Mount Rushmore were protectionists. (Even Jefferson came around after the War of 1812). Protectionism is, in fact, the real American way.

In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort… keep pace with me in purchasing nothing foreign where an equivalent of domestic fabric can be obtained, without regard to difference of price.”

“Under free trade, the trader is the master and the producer the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man,” said Republican President William McKinley. “[Free trade] destroys the dignity and independence of American labor… It will take away from the people of this country who work for a living— and the majority of them live by the sweat of their faces— it will take from them heart and home and hope.

Historically, “free trade” was a policy supported by Southern agrarians, who benefitted disproportionately from a low-tariff trading system. Northern industrialist Republicans favored higher tariffs to ensure American workers and industry would thrive, and be “protected” from foreign aggression that would seek to weaken America by making it reliant on foreign goods.

Yet this is now a forgotten history.

Following World War II, America began switching from a policy of protection, to a policy of “free trade,” which used international trade deals as a means of diplomacy and alliance-building, slowly eroding and ultimately destroying America’s status as the world’s dominant manufacturing power.

“For some time now our ‘best and brightest’ have been invoking false doctrines that are systematically undermining American prosperity,” writes Clyde Prestowitz, counselor to the Secretary of Commerce under President Reagan. “Reversing America’s traditional national economic-development policies, U.S. leaders after World War II increasingly embraced consumerism and a faith in the efficacy of unfettered markets and trade that evolved over time into a new gospel of laissez-faire globalization.”

However, Lincoln would seem to disagree and argued that a tariff system was less intrusive than domestic taxation:

The tariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points, will require comparatively few officers in their collection; while by the direct tax system, the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors, going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of grass and other green thing.

Curiously, anti-tariff purists seem to favor a taxation model that is the exact inversion of the founder’s model — i.e. where income, consumption or sales are directly taxed, but imports are not. Yet this policy, however, would likely only have the effect of incentivizing people involved in production to shift that production overseas. Levin similarly suggests that unrestricted free trade is a necessity:

Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to look around your homes, I want you to look at your automobile in many cases. We kind of need trade, don’t we? Otherwise why are you buying all of these things?

However, in 1775, John Adams posed Levin’s same question and arrived at the exact opposite conclusion of the “Liberty’s Voice” host.

“Can The Inhabitants of North America live without foreign Trade?” Adams asked.

Answering his own question, Adams concluded: “We must at first indeed sacrifice some of our appetites coffee, wine, punch, sugar, molasses… and our dress would not be so elegant… But these are trifles in a contest for Liberty.”

Levin has said he opposes Trump’s protectionism because it will create higher prices for consumers:

A tariff is really just a tax… imposed on the American people… While Trump and his surrogates may have the money to pay the higher prices his policies would cause, many Americans – who are already having difficulty making ends meet – do not.

However, in a declaration that would seem to apply to our relationship with China today, Adams warned against the allure of cheap foreign goods that result from illicit trading practices:

[British manufactures] disgorged upon us all their stores of merchandise and manufactures, not only without profit, but at certain loss for a time… The cheapness of these articles allures us into extravagance and luxury, involves us in debt, exhausts our resources, and at length produces universal complaint.

Republican President McKinley rejected the “cheaper is better” argument outright: “They [free traders] say, ‘Buy where you can buy the cheapest.’ That is one of their maxims… Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: ‘Buy where you can pay the easiest.’ And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.”

They say, if you had not the Protective Tariff things would be a little cheaper. Well, whether a thing is cheap or whether it is dear depends on what we can earn by our daily labor. Free trade cheapens the product by cheapening the producer. Protection cheapens the product by elevating the producer.

Additionally, Hamilton and Lincoln argued that based on economies of scale, any temporary increase in costs resulting from a tariff would eventually decrease as the domestic manufacturer produced more.

Hamilton explained that despite an initial “increase of price” caused by regulations that control foreign competition, once a “domestic manufacture has attained to perfection… it invariably becomes cheaper.”

Lincoln similarly said that, “if a duty amount to full protection be levied upon an article” that could be produced domestically, “at no distant day, in consequence of such duty,” the domestic article “will be sold to our people cheaper than before.”

Unlike Levin, Lincoln did not see a tariff as a tax on low-income Americans because it would only burden the consumer according to the amount the consumer consumed.

By the tariff system, the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods… the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many who live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free.

Levin argues that adopting protectionist policies to defend America’s industrial independence is not conservative. “What I see developing is not a conservative coalition, but a coalition on the Republican side of big government advocates,” Levin said. “The Republican Party now is a party of the progressive Republicans. Theodore Roosevelt… the protectionists, Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, the No-Growthers.”

However, contrary to Levin’s suggestion, from 1871 to 1913 under the leadership of mostly Republican presidents, “the average U.S. tariff on dutiable imports never fell below 38 percent [and] gross national product (GNP) grew 4.3 percent annually, twice the pace in free trade Britain and well above the U.S. average in the 20th century,” notes Alfred Eckes Jr., chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission under President Reagan.

Moreover, contrary to Levin’s telling of history, defending the American worker through trade protectionism was a priority of the original Republican Party. Free trade was the policy of Democrats. As Ian Fletcher has observed, “reading the speech of 19th-century Republican politicians today, with their expressions of concern for the wages of the American working man, one finds oneself wondering how the party slipped to its present day let-them-eat-cake position.” The Party of Lincoln had always been the Party of Protectionism. Indeed, Fletcher notes that Lincoln’s number two issue after slavery was the tariff.

In 1896, the GOP platform pledged to “renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of development and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry. It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods; it secures the American market for the American producer. It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman.”

In fact, the GOP’s original view on trade seemed guided by the same “America First” principle articulated by Donald Trump.

As Whig representative and later Republican senator, Justin Morrill explained during an 1857 tariff debate: “I am ruling America for the benefit, first, of Americans, and for the ‘rest of mankind’ afterwards.”

Morrill attacked free trade “devotees” declaring, “There is a transcendental philosophy of free trade, with devotees as ardent as any of those who preach the millennium… Free trade abjured patriotism and boasts of cosmopolitanism. It regards the labor of our own people with no more favor than that of the barbarian on the Danube or the cooly on the Ganges.”

McKinley similarly made clear that the original Republican Party was a “workers’ party”:

The protective tariff policy of the Republicans… has made the lives of the masses of our countrymen sweeter and brighter, and has entered the homes of America carrying comfort and cheer and courage. It gives a premium to human energy, and awakens the noblest aspiration in the breasts of men. Our own experience shows that it is the best for our citizenship and our civilization and that it opens up a higher and better destiny for our people.

Interestingly, it is not only today’s Republican Party that has wiped McKinley from the nation’s memory bank, but also President Obama, who went so far as to strip his name from Alaska’s Mount McKinley — now dubbed Denali. Donald Trump proclaimed this a “great insult” and pledged that, if elected, he would change the name back.

Lastly, Levin goes so far as to accuse Trump of sounding Marxist because of his desire to make the Republican Party a “workers’ party”:

Now he [Trump] says the Republican is going to be a new party — the “workers’ party.” The “workers’ party”? You’re going to call it the “workers’ party”? Like the Communist social workers’ union? […] You’re going to sound like Marx now? […] We’re going to start talking about the proletariat? And the bourgeois next? That’s Bernie Sanders stuff!

While Levin presents himself as a guardian of our founders’ economic principles, his support for unilateral free trade ironically places his trading views closer to Karl Marx than it does to the legacy of Washington, Hamilton, and Lincoln.

In his 1848 address to the Democratic Association of Brussels, Marx declared that he was “in favor of free trade” because of its destructive capabilities for hastening social revolution:",www.breitbart.com,right,CwhEPPABDDZx6Ki9

China’s Retaliation

The U.S. has already slapped duties on $50 billion of Chinese imports since July, which spurred immediate in-kind retaliation from Beijing. China has said it would be forced to retaliate to all of the U.S.’s tariff measures, fanning concerns that a deepening trade war could dent the global economic outlook.

What they won: a vote on a customs enforcement package that includes a measure on Chinese currency manipulation. But it’s unlikely to ever become law, in part because Obama would probably veto it if it ever got to his desk.

White House officials said the agreement that will now open debate on the trade package on Thursday only seems like a dramatic turnaround because Tuesday’s doom and gloom was overblown. The president’s trade agenda is moving again, on its way through the Senate and off to the much more problematic House. And the president has regained the momentum.

“They did a really harsh thing to the president. And in the end, the president’s going to triumph. And he should. He’s right,” said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Monday the United States and Mexico have reached a new trade deal , paving the way for the possible revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
In an Oval Office announcement , Trump said the new agreement would be called the United States-Mexico trade agreement and would replace NAFTA , which he said had “ bad connotations ” for the United States .
“ It ’ s a big day for trade , ” he said . “ It ’ s a big day for our country . ”

“ If they would like to negotiate fairly , we will do that , ” Trump said . He said it ’ s possible that a separate deal could be reached with Canada .
Stocks soared on news of the deal between the two countries . The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 259 points , or 1 percent , to 26,049 . The Nasdaq climbed 72 points , or nearly 1 percent , to 8,018 . The S & P 500 rose 22 points , or 0.8 percent , to 2,897 .
The United States and Mexico have held five consecutive weeks of talks to revise parts of the NAFTA .
In a phone call with Trump , Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto called the deal “ something very positive for the United States and Mexico . ”
The two nations hope to get a final deal signed before Peña Nieto leaves office Dec. 1 . Before the United States can sign the deal , Congress must be given 90 days ’ notice . U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said a formal notice would be sent to Congress on Friday and the deal would be signed by the end of November .
Peña Nieto repeatedly expressed interest for Canada to be incorporated into the agreement . Trump said the United States would have a deal with Canada `` one way or another . ''
`` It ’ ll either be a tariff on cars , or it ’ ll be a negotiated deal , '' he said . `` Frankly , a tariff on cars is a much easier way to go . Perhaps the other would be much better for Canada . ”
In Mexico City , Marcelo Ebrard , Mexico ’ s incoming foreign minister under President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , said Monday he was pleased to see the United States and Mexico craft a new trade deal , according to Reuters .

A big deal looking good with Mexico ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) August 27 , 2018
Negotiators for the United States and Mexico worked over the weekend to iron out remaining differences and strike a deal before Canada is brought back to the table .
One of the sticking points in the talks has centered on the so-called auto rules of origin , which dictate that , to avoid tariffs , a certain percentage of an automobile must be built from parts that originated from countries within the NAFTA region .
Under the new rules , cars must be built with at least 75 percent of parts made in North America , up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA . Also , 40 to 45 percent of an auto will have to be made by workers earning at least $ 16 an hour .
Other stumbling blocks included the procedure to settle disputes between corporations and governments and the Trump administration ’ s push for a sunset provision under which the revised NAFTA agreement would expire after five years unless all three countries took steps to extend it .
Mexico and Canada balked at such a provision , arguing that trade agreements are supposed to offer the assurance of continuity for businesses and make it easier for them to comply with regulatory requirements .
The compromise reached between the United States and Mexico calls for the new deal to run for 16 years . The deal will be reviewed after six years and could then be extended another 16 .
Besides the auto provisions , the agreement also includes standards designed to protect intellectual property and trade secrets , tougher labor requirements for Mexico and environmental obligations designed to combat trafficking in wildlife , timber and fish .
In Congress , which must approve any new deal , some lawmakers took a wait-and-see attitude toward the agreement .
Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , called the deal “ a positive step ” but stressed that the final deal should include Canada and have bipartisan support . “ A trilateral agreement is the best path forward , ” he said .
Sen. Sherrod Brown , D-Ohio , one of the most ardent critics of NAFTA , said that although he needed to review the text of the agreement , “ this is an important step forward. ” But “ we still have a lot of work to do to bring Canada on board and write the legislation needed to make any deal a reality . ”
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , which represents major automakers on policy issues in Washington , sounded an optimistic note Monday after reports of a preliminary trade deal .
Automakers had expressed concerns that a breakdown in NAFTA could compromise their profits , lead to higher vehicle prices and force them to shift production .
“ Automakers support modernizing NAFTA to bring this nearly 25-year-old agreement into the 21st century , ” the Auto Alliance said Monday in a statement . “ We are pleased to hear that the U.S. and Mexico have reached a consensus on several issues , including automotive rules of origin , and we look forward to learning more . ”
Trump ’ s supporters argued that Mexico unfairly benefited from NAFTA and the deal should be reworked .
Mexico ’ s share of vehicles manufactured in North America has grown from about 12 percent in 2007 to about 23 percent in 2017 , according to the Center for Automotive Research . The U.S. share has fallen from 70 percent to 62 percent during that period .
The Auto Alliance urged the United States and Mexico on Monday to “ quickly re-engage with Canada to continue to build on this progress . ”
The group called for negotiators to “ continue to strike the right balance by incentivizing production and investment in North America while keeping new vehicles affordable for more Americans . ”

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Monday the United States and Mexico have reached a new trade deal, paving the way for the possible revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In an Oval Office announcement, Trump said the new agreement would be called the United States-Mexico trade agreement and would replace NAFTA, which he said had “bad connotations” for the United States.

“It’s a big day for trade,” he said. “It’s a big day for our country.”

Trump said that he intends to terminate NAFTA and that the United States would immediately begin negotiations with Canada, the third party in the trilateral trade pact that he has called the “worst deal ever.”

“If they would like to negotiate fairly, we will do that,” Trump said. He said it’s possible that a separate deal could be reached with Canada.

Stocks soared on news of the deal between the two countries. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 259 points, or 1 percent, to 26,049. The Nasdaq climbed 72 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 8,018. The S&P 500 rose 22 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,897.

The United States and Mexico have held five consecutive weeks of talks to revise parts of the NAFTA.

In a phone call with Trump, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto called the deal “something very positive for the United States and Mexico.”

The two nations hope to get a final deal signed before Peña Nieto leaves office Dec. 1. Before the United States can sign the deal, Congress must be given 90 days’ notice.

While they’ve been negotiating, we’ve been in regular contact with them over the last weeks. We’ll continue to work toward a modernized NAFTA. We have a three-way negotiation that’s been ongoing.”

He added, “We’ll only sign a new NAFTA that’s good for Canada and the middle class.""

George declined to comment on the idea of renaming NAFTA.

A big deal looking good with Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2018

Negotiators for the United States and Mexico worked over the weekend to iron out remaining differences and strike a deal before Canada is brought back to the table.

One of the sticking points in the talks has centered on the so-called auto rules of origin, which dictate that, to avoid tariffs, a certain percentage of an automobile must be built from parts that originated from countries within the NAFTA region.

Under the new rules, cars must be built with at least 75 percent of parts made in North America, up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA. Also, 40 to 45 percent of an auto will have to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.

Other stumbling blocks included the procedure to settle disputes between corporations and governments and the Trump administration’s push for a sunset provision under which the revised NAFTA agreement would expire after five years unless all three countries took steps to extend it.

Mexico and Canada balked at such a provision, arguing that trade agreements are supposed to offer the assurance of continuity for businesses and make it easier for them to comply with regulatory requirements.

The compromise reached between the United States and Mexico calls for the new deal to run for 16 years. The deal will be reviewed after six years and could then be extended another 16.

Besides the auto provisions, the agreement also includes standards designed to protect intellectual property and trade secrets, tougher labor requirements for Mexico and environmental obligations designed to combat trafficking in wildlife, timber and fish.

In Congress, which must approve any new deal, some lawmakers took a wait-and-see attitude toward the agreement.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called the deal “a positive step” but stressed that the final deal should include Canada and have bipartisan support. “A trilateral agreement is the best path forward,” he said.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, one of the most ardent critics of NAFTA, said that although he needed to review the text of the agreement, “this is an important step forward.” But “we still have a lot of work to do to bring Canada on board and write the legislation needed to make any deal a reality.”

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents major automakers on policy issues in Washington, sounded an optimistic note Monday after reports of a preliminary trade deal.

Automakers had expressed concerns that a breakdown in NAFTA could compromise their profits, lead to higher vehicle prices and force them to shift production.

“Automakers support modernizing NAFTA to bring this nearly 25-year-old agreement into the 21st century,” the Auto Alliance said Monday in a statement. “We are pleased to hear that the U.S. and Mexico have reached a consensus on several issues, including automotive rules of origin, and we look forward to learning more.”

Trump’s supporters argued that Mexico unfairly benefited from NAFTA and the deal should be reworked.

Mexico’s share of vehicles manufactured in North America has grown from about 12 percent in 2007 to about 23 percent in 2017, according to the Center for Automotive Research. The U.S. share has fallen from 70 percent to 62 percent during that period.

The Auto Alliance urged the United States and Mexico on Monday to “quickly re-engage with Canada to continue to build on this progress.”

The group called for negotiators to “continue to strike the right balance by incentivizing production and investment in North America while keeping new vehicles affordable for more Americans.”

But some policymakers see them in his terms : as the continuation of trade politics by other means . That , at least , is how the Trump administration views China ’ s decision on August 5th to let its currency weaken past seven yuan to the dollar for the first time since 2008 . Though arbitrary , that threshold has assumed huge symbolic importance among traders , economic officials and fund managers ( see Buttonwood ) . They were left stunned .
America ’ s Treasury quickly branded China a “ currency manipulator ” , a charge it has not levelled against any country for 25 years . China , in the Americans ’ view , was cheapening its currency to gain an unfair edge in retaliation for President Donald Trump ’ s surprise announcement four days earlier that he would impose new tariffs of 10 % on roughly $ 300bn of Chinese goods .

This marked the end of investors ’ hopes for a peaceful summer . At the end of July the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates to guard against a slowdown in America ’ s respectable growth rate , and trade tensions had “ returned to a simmer ” , as Jerome Powell , the Fed ’ s chair , noted with satisfaction . But after the yuan ’ s move America ’ s stockmarket suffered its worst day this year . Emerging-market currencies , including the Brazilian real , Indian rupee and South African rand , fell . The price of Brent crude oil tumbled below $ 60 a barrel and safe havens , such as gold , rallied . The same search for safety pushed American ten-year government bond yields to 1.7 % , as investors bet that the Fed would be forced to slash interest rates further to prevent a recession . The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its benchmark interest rate by twice as much as expected , citing “ heightened uncertainty ” and “ historically low ” global bond yields . The Australian dollar fell to its lowest level in a decade .
In matters of war and peace , countries must prepare for the worst . But precautions can look like provocations . In allowing the yuan to fall , China signalled it is prepared for a protracted trade war . It let the yuan weaken in response to the threat of tariffs much as a floating currency would . Otherwise it would have needed to defend an arbitrary line against the dollar every time America turned belligerent . Its move nonetheless makes further belligerence more probable . Mr Trump is now unlikely to change his mind about the new tariffs before they kick in on September 1st .
Both sides blame the other for starting the fight . China has raised tariffs only in response to America ’ s . But America sees its combative economic diplomacy as a belated response to decades of intellectual-property theft and other misdeeds . Each side ’ s attempt to get even looks to the other like one-upmanship . China views a weaker yuan as a reasonable response to Mr Trump ’ s trade duties ; Mr Trump , according to the Wall Street Journal , sees those tariffs as retaliation for China failing to commit to buy more American farm goods .
The irony is that Chinese purchases of American soyabeans and pork were already rising , and the government was offering buyers exemptions from some tariffs . But after Mr Trump ’ s new tariff threat it has reportedly told state-owned companies not to buy American farm goods after all . Thus Mr Trump ’ s tariffs may have caused the decision they were designed to punish .
Whatever the cause of the new levies , what might be their effect ? Some of America ’ s existing tariffs ( of 25 % on roughly $ 250bn-worth of merchandise ) had been imposed on Chinese goods that American importers can buy elsewhere . That minimised the harm to American buyers and maximised the harm to China ’ s exporters , which lost business to close rivals elsewhere . Indeed , according to Goldman Sachs , other Asian countries have filled around half of the gap created by the previous round of tariffs .

But some policymakers see them in his terms: as the continuation of trade politics by other means. That, at least, is how the Trump administration views China’s decision on August 5th to let its currency weaken past seven yuan to the dollar for the first time since 2008. Though arbitrary, that threshold has assumed huge symbolic importance among traders, economic officials and fund managers (see Buttonwood). They were left stunned.

America’s Treasury quickly branded China a “currency manipulator”, a charge it has not levelled against any country for 25 years. China, in the Americans’ view, was cheapening its currency to gain an unfair edge in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement four days earlier that he would impose new tariffs of 10% on roughly $300bn of Chinese goods.

This marked the end of investors’ hopes for a peaceful summer. At the end of July the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates to guard against a slowdown in America’s respectable growth rate, and trade tensions had “returned to a simmer”, as Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chair, noted with satisfaction. But after the yuan’s move America’s stockmarket suffered its worst day this year. Emerging-market currencies, including the Brazilian real, Indian rupee and South African rand, fell. The price of Brent crude oil tumbled below $60 a barrel and safe havens, such as gold, rallied. The same search for safety pushed American ten-year government bond yields to 1.7%, as investors bet that the Fed would be forced to slash interest rates further to prevent a recession. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its benchmark interest rate by twice as much as expected, citing “heightened uncertainty” and “historically low” global bond yields. The Australian dollar fell to its lowest level in a decade.

In matters of war and peace, countries must prepare for the worst. But precautions can look like provocations. In allowing the yuan to fall, China signalled it is prepared for a protracted trade war. It let the yuan weaken in response to the threat of tariffs much as a floating currency would. Otherwise it would have needed to defend an arbitrary line against the dollar every time America turned belligerent. Its move nonetheless makes further belligerence more probable. Mr Trump is now unlikely to change his mind about the new tariffs before they kick in on September 1st.

Both sides blame the other for starting the fight. China has raised tariffs only in response to America’s. But America sees its combative economic diplomacy as a belated response to decades of intellectual-property theft and other misdeeds. Each side’s attempt to get even looks to the other like one-upmanship. China views a weaker yuan as a reasonable response to Mr Trump’s trade duties; Mr Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal, sees those tariffs as retaliation for China failing to commit to buy more American farm goods.

The irony is that Chinese purchases of American soyabeans and pork were already rising, and the government was offering buyers exemptions from some tariffs. But after Mr Trump’s new tariff threat it has reportedly told state-owned companies not to buy American farm goods after all. Thus Mr Trump’s tariffs may have caused the decision they were designed to punish.

Whatever the cause of the new levies, what might be their effect? Some of America’s existing tariffs (of 25% on roughly $250bn-worth of merchandise) had been imposed on Chinese goods that American importers can buy elsewhere. That minimised the harm to American buyers and maximised the harm to China’s exporters, which lost business to close rivals elsewhere. Indeed, according to Goldman Sachs, other Asian countries have filled around half of the gap created by the previous round of tariffs.

The next round of tariffs will hit goods for which China has fewer competitors. That should make it harder for American buyers to switch suppliers. Nonetheless the new tariffs’ direct impact could reduce China’s growth by at least 0.3 percentage points in 2020, according to UBS , to below 6% for the first time since 1990.

As always , his allies argue that this is a brilliant negotiating strategy to force the Democrats to adopt his new NAFTA . I do n't know if that strategy will succeed , but it 's incredibly inconsistent with his stated goal of wanting lower and reciprocal tariffs on U.S. exports .
A quick reminder of how we got here : From day one in the White House , the president has declared his intention to pull out of NAFTA . He has claimed many times that the 1994 deal was the worst deal ever agreed to by the United States . He used this threat of withdrawal to extract a new deal with Canada and Mexico called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( USMCA ) , a deal he modestly labeled `` the most important trade deal we 've ever made by far . ''
This statement , however , should be taken with a grain of salt . In fact , while the USMCA includes some needed modernization to the 25-year-old NAFTA and delivers a sliver of trade liberalization in a few areas , on net it 's more protectionist than NAFTA , due to punishing new `` rules of origin '' and high minimum-wage requirements . But no matter how imperfect the agreement is , it may ease the fear of a NAFTA withdrawal—for now , at least .
With the Democrats regaining a majority in the House , the future of the USMCA is somewhat in limbo . As a result , the president is in full attack mode . He announced last weekend , `` I will be formally terminating NAFTA shortly… . And so Congress will have a choice of the USMBCA or pre-NAFTA , which worked very well . ''
I fail to see what leverage the president believes he has against the Democrats . For one thing , they have always largely opposed free trade in general . I doubt that moving away from trade liberalization will be a big problem for them . Besides , since Trump 's election , the Democrats ' strategy has consisted of opposing him at every turn . With this ultimatum , Trump is giving them a golden opportunity to do just that . The cherry on top is that he will likely be blamed for the economic downfall that would inevitably follow the end of NAFTA .
I also fail to see how the president sees a return to the pre-NAFTA world as advancing his goal of reciprocity in trade duties . Under NAFTA , all U.S. exports going to Mexico are duty-free , as are non-agricultural U.S. exports to Canada . Even in spite of the Canadians ' high dairy duty , 97 percent of U.S. agricultural exports go to our neighbor to the north duty-free . In exchange , Mexico and Canada export their goods to us free of tariffs .
A withdrawal would shatter this balance . Not only will tariffs go up , hurting consumers and exporters in all three countries , but the tariffs would be highest on U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico . As my colleague Dan Griswold explained to me , `` without NAFTA , U.S. duties on imports would jump from virtually zero to an average of 2.3 percent on non-farm products and 3.8 percent on farm products . The corresponding average duties in Canada would jump to 2.3 and 12.4 percent , and in Mexico to 3.5 and 20.1 percent . ''
In other words , by his own standard , President Trump would make trade even more `` unfair '' to American exporters than it was when he came into office . But it gets worse . As it happens , Mexico is the king of free trade agreements . The country has some 40 agreements with other nations . Unlike Americans , exporters in these favored nations will face low duties when exporting to Mexico .
The bottom line is that if President Trump believes unfair trade is defined by other countries imposing higher tariffs on U.S. exporters than the U.S. imposes on them , he needs the current NAFTA in place in case the Democrats reject the USMCA . If he withdraws and the Democrats pull out of the USMCA , he will have done more to bring about unfair trade to U.S. exporters than anyone before him .","After spending months complaining about the disparity between the United States and other nations' duties, along with the unfair treatment of U.S. exporters, President Trump is once again threatening to pull the plug on one of the best tariff-equalizing deals ever made: the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Mr. Trump said the agreement-in-principle with Japan is worth “ billions and billions ” of dollars and includes a big purchase of American corn , partly filling the void left by China ’ s refusal to buy U.S. farm products amid an escalating trade war .
“ It ’ s a very big transaction , and we ’ ve agreed in principle . It ’ s billions and billions of dollars . Tremendous for the farmers , ” Mr. Trump said in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Group of Seven summit in France . “ We have excess corn in various parts of our country , with our farmers , because China did not do what they said they were going to do . ”
Tensions with China were a recurring theme in Biarritz . Mr. Trump agreed when reporters asked if he was having “ second thoughts ” about his approach to the dispute — tit-for-tat tariffs rattled the markets Friday — though the White House said the president ’ s comments were misconstrued .
“ His answer has been greatly misinterpreted . President Trump responded in the affirmative because he regrets not raising the tariffs higher , ” Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said .
Mr. Trump said he expects China to crack first in negotiations , citing the pressure from his tariffs on over $ 500 billion in Chinese goods .
“ I think they want to make a deal much more than I do , ” he said . “ We ’ ll see what happens . But we are talking to China very seriously . ”
His chief economic adviser , Larry Kudlow , told CNN ’ s “ State of the Union ” that negotiators from both countries still plan to meet in September , despite increased tensions .
Mr. Trump was able to contrast the U.S.-China turmoil by highlighting the breakthrough with Japan , saying parties plan to ink a final deal in September . Some tariffs on Japanese goods will be removed , though existing levies on autos will remain .
He also said he doesn ’ t foresee any impediments to trade deal with the U.K. , now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in charge of pulling Britain out of the European Union instead of Theresa May .
“ We ’ re going to do a very big trade deal — bigger than we ’ ve ever had with the U.K. , ” he said . “ We don ’ t anticipate any problems . Before , we were sort of stymied . ”
Mr. Trump struck an upbeat tone from the outset of the summit , which will end Monday with working sessions and a press conference .
The president complimented the weather and his French hosts at an opening lunch Saturday , though tensions over his hard-charging style and posture on Iran , climate and trade have been simmering beneath the surface .
Before flying to France , the president said he may invoke emergency powers to “ order ” U.S. businesses out of China and ramped up tariffs in response to levies Beijing imposed on U.S. products . The events caused the stock market to plummet .
Mr. Trump also dropped the pretense of friendship with Chinese President Xi Jinping by questioning who was the bigger “ enemy ” — Mr. Xi or the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Jay Powell .
The president is furious at Mr. Powell for refusing to signal additional cuts to interest rates . A cut could spur the economy heading into the 2020 election year .
“ I don ’ t think he ’ s doing a good job at all , ” Mr. Trump said before leaving for France . “ I don ’ t think he ’ s much of a chess player . ”
Mr. Trump ’ s critics say it is not the central bank ’ s job to provide cover for his unwieldy trade wars , however . His rhetoric and latest round of tariffs , announced via tweet Friday , are making Wall Street and Capitol Hill skittish .
Sen. Amy Klobuchar , a Minnesota Democrat running for president , told CBS ’ s “ Face the Nation ” that Mr. Trump is using tariffs like a “ meat cleaver ” and that his approach to China is “ complete chaos . ”
Yet Sen. Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally , said Democrats have wanted to confront China for years . He said the president is finally doing it .
“ We just have to accept the pain that comes with standing up to China , ” he told CBS .
“ It ’ s impossible for businesses to plan for the future in this type of environment . The administration ’ s approach clearly isn ’ t working , and the answer isn ’ t more taxes on American businesses and consumers . Where does this end ? ” said David French , senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation .
Mr. Trump says no one at the G7 is trying to talk him out of his tactics with China .
“ I think they respect the trade war . It has to happen , ” Mr. Trump said .
Yet the British prime minister sounded a note of caution while seated just feet away .
“ Just to register the faint , sheep-like note of our view on the trade war , we ’ re in favor of trade peace on the whole , and dialing it down if we can , ” Mr. Johnson said . “ The U.K. has profited massively in the last 200 years from free trade , and that ’ s what we want to see . ”","President Trump said Sunday that he has reached a trade deal with Japan, is confident of reaching one with the U.K., and is still determined to force China to make enough concessions to get a deal with Beijing.

“His answer has been greatly misinterpreted. President Trump responded in the affirmative because he regrets not raising the tariffs higher,” Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

Mr. Trump said he expects China to crack first in negotiations, citing the pressure from his tariffs on over $500 billion in Chinese goods.

“I think they want to make a deal much more than I do,” he said. “We’ll see what happens. But we are talking to China very seriously.”

His chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told CNN’s “State of the Union” that negotiators from both countries still plan to meet in September, despite increased tensions.

Mr. Trump was able to contrast the U.S.-China turmoil by highlighting the breakthrough with Japan, saying parties plan to ink a final deal in September. Some tariffs on Japanese goods will be removed, though existing levies on autos will remain.

He also said he doesn’t foresee any impediments to trade deal with the U.K., now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in charge of pulling Britain out of the European Union instead of Theresa May.

“We’re going to do a very big trade deal — bigger than we’ve ever had with the U.K.,” he said. “We don’t anticipate any problems. Before, we were sort of stymied.”

Mr. Trump struck an upbeat tone from the outset of the summit, which will end Monday with working sessions and a press conference.

The president complimented the weather and his French hosts at an opening lunch Saturday, though tensions over his hard-charging style and posture on Iran, climate and trade have been simmering beneath the surface.

Before flying to France, the president said he may invoke emergency powers to “order” U.S. businesses out of China and ramped up tariffs in response to levies Beijing imposed on U.S. products. The events caused the stock market to plummet.

Mr. Trump also dropped the pretense of friendship with Chinese President Xi Jinping by questioning who was the bigger “enemy” — Mr. Xi or the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell.

The president is furious at Mr. Powell for refusing to signal additional cuts to interest rates. A cut could spur the economy heading into the 2020 election year.

“I don’t think he’s doing a good job at all,” Mr. Trump said before leaving for France. “I don’t think he’s much of a chess player.”

Mr. Trump’s critics say it is not the central bank’s job to provide cover for his unwieldy trade wars, however. His rhetoric and latest round of tariffs, announced via tweet Friday, are making Wall Street and Capitol Hill skittish.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat running for president, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Mr. Trump is using tariffs like a “meat cleaver” and that his approach to China is “complete chaos.”

Yet Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally, said Democrats have wanted to confront China for years. He said the president is finally doing it.

“We just have to accept the pain that comes with standing up to China,” he told CBS.

Retailers, however, say they’re exasperated.

“It’s impossible for businesses to plan for the future in this type of environment. The administration’s approach clearly isn’t working, and the answer isn’t more taxes on American businesses and consumers. Where does this end?” said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation.

Mr. Trump says no one at the G7 is trying to talk him out of his tactics with China.

“I think they respect the trade war. It has to happen,” Mr. Trump said.

Yet the British prime minister sounded a note of caution while seated just feet away.

“Just to register the faint, sheep-like note of our view on the trade war, we’re in favor of trade peace on the whole, and dialing it down if we can,” Mr. Johnson said. “The U.K. has profited massively in the last 200 years from free trade, and that’s what we want to see.”

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday for the second time this year. But its plans going forward have been thrown into confusion thanks to President Donald Trump.

Trump is waging a trade war on multiple fronts, which could raise prices for American companies and consumers and slow economic growth. It has already put a dent in business confidence in the economy, according to a survey of the nation’s top CEOs. And if that becomes a drag on growth, the Fed could put the brakes on its interest rate hikes.

But Trump’s pro-growth policies also present risks: New tax cuts and government spending could kick the healthy economy into overdrive, requiring the Fed to raise rates more quickly, potentially choking the nearly record-long expansion.

Both dangers complicate the central bank’s efforts to maintain a “Goldilocks economy” — not too hot or cold, but growing at a sustainable rate.

For now, fiscal policy looms larger in the Fed’s calculations, Michael Feroli, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, told reporters Monday.

Central bank policymakers are on track to raise interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time since December 2015. It’s part of an effort to gently remove the historic levels of support for the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as growth continues to build momentum.

Markets will be watching closely to see whether the Fed signals one or two additional hikes this year, a decision that will be driven in part by the predicted ripple effects of recent actions by Congress and the president.

Fed officials have emphasized that they’re unsure how to judge the longer-term effects of tax cuts and new government spending, since fiscal stimulus is usually deployed when economic growth is lagging. Right now, unemployment is at 3.8 percent with inflation hovering right around the Fed’s 2 percent target.

A new rule , unveiled by the Commerce Department and first reported by ███ , expands U.S. authority to require licenses for sales to Huawei of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology , vastly expanding its reach to halt exports to the world ’ s No . 2 smartphone maker .
“ This action puts America first , American companies first , and American national security first , ” a senior Commerce Department official told reporters in a telephone briefing on Friday .
Huawei , the world ’ s top telecoms equipment maker , did not respond to a request for comment .
News of the move against the firm hit European stocks as traders sold into the day ’ s gains , while shares of chip equipment makers such as Lam Research and KLA Corp closed down 6.4 % and 4.8 % , respectively , in U.S. trading .
The reaction from China was swift , with a report on Friday by China ’ s Global Times saying Beijing was ready to put U.S. companies on an “ unreliable entity list , ” as part of countermeasures in response to the new limits on Huawei .
The measures include launching investigations and imposing restrictions on U.S. companies such as Apple Inc , Cisco Systems Inc and Qualcomm Inc , as well as suspending purchases of Boeing Co airplanes , the report said here citing a source .
The Commerce Department ’ s rule , effective Friday but with a 120-day grace period , also hits Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd , the biggest contract chipmaker and key Huawei supplier , which announced plans to build a U.S.-based plant on Thursday .
TSMC said on Friday it is “ following the U.S. export rule change closely ” and working with outside counsel to “ conduct legal analysis and ensure a comprehensive examination and interpretation of these rules . ”
The department said the rule is aimed at preventing Huawei from continuing to “ undermine ” its status as a blacklisted company , meaning suppliers of U.S.-made sophisticated technology must seek a U.S. government license before selling to it .
“ There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been in able , in effect , to use U.S. technology with foreign fab producers , ” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday , calling the rule change a “ highly tailored thing to try to correct that loophole . ”
The company was added to the Commerce Department ’ s “ entity list ” last year due to national security concerns , amid accusations from Washington that it violated U.S. sanctions on Iran and can spy on customers . Huawei has denied the allegations .
Frustration among China hawks in the administration that Huawei ’ s entity listing was not doing enough to curb its access to supplies prompted an effort , first reported by ███ in November , to crack down on the company that culminated in Friday ’ s rule .
Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf , a former Commerce Department official , said the rule appeared to be a “ novel , complex expansion of U.S. export controls ” for chip-related items made with U.S. technology abroad and sent to Huawei . But he stressed that chips designed by companies other than Huawei and manufactured with U.S. technology could still be sold to the company without the license requirement .
While the new rules will apply to chips regardless of their level of sophistication , a senior U.S. State Department official who also briefed reporters Friday opened the door to some flexibility for the company , echoing reprieves granted to Huawei by the Trump administration previously .
“ This is a licensing requirement . It does not necessarily mean that things are denied , ” the official said , adding that the rule gives the U.S. government greater “ visibility ” into the shipments . “ What are done with those applications , we ’ ll have to see ... Each application will be judged on its merits . ”
After essentially barring Huawei from buying from U.S. suppliers , the Commerce Department granted licenses to some of Huawei ’ s biggest U.S. partners to continue to sell to the company , while also allowing smaller rural telecoms companies to continue to purchase Huawei equipment to keep their networks up and running .
Huawei , which needs semiconductors for its smartphones and telecoms equipment , has found itself at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China , whose relationship has soured in recent months over the origins of the deadly coronavirus .
While the rule change is aimed at squeezing Huawei and will hit the chip foundries it relies on , U.S. manufacturers of chipmaking equipment could face long-term pain , if chipmakers develop new equipment sources beyond the reach of U.S. rules .
But for now , most chipmakers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA , Lam Research and Applied Materials , which did not respond to requests for comment .
While some of the complex tools required to make chips come from companies outside the United States , such as Japan ’ s Tokyo Electron and Hitachi and the Netherlands ’ ASML , analysts say it would be difficult to put together an entire toolchain for making advanced semiconductors without at least some American equipment .
The burden of dealing with the new rule is most likely to be felt by foundries such as TSMC that buy the tools , rather than U.S. semiconductor firms such as Qualcomm Inc or Nvidia Corp that tap such foundries as part of their supply chain .
“ We are concerned this rule may create uncertainty and disruption for the global semiconductor supply chain , but it seems to be less damaging to the U.S. semiconductor industry than the very broad approaches previously considered , ” Semiconductor Industry Association Chief Executive John Neuffer said in a statement .
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the action was aimed at protecting “ the integrity of 5G networks. ” He added that the rule “ helps prevent Huawei from undermining U.S. export controls . ”","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday moved to block global chip supplies to blacklisted telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies, spurring fears of Chinese retaliation and hammering shares of U.S. producers of chipmaking equipment.

After essentially barring Huawei from buying from U.S. suppliers, the Commerce Department granted licenses to some of Huawei’s biggest U.S. partners to continue to sell to the company, while also allowing smaller rural telecoms companies to continue to purchase Huawei equipment to keep their networks up and running.

Huawei, which needs semiconductors for its smartphones and telecoms equipment, has found itself at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China, whose relationship has soured in recent months over the origins of the deadly coronavirus.

While the rule change is aimed at squeezing Huawei and will hit the chip foundries it relies on, U.S. manufacturers of chipmaking equipment could face long-term pain, if chipmakers develop new equipment sources beyond the reach of U.S. rules.

But for now, most chipmakers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, which did not respond to requests for comment.

While some of the complex tools required to make chips come from companies outside the United States, such as Japan’s Tokyo Electron and Hitachi and the Netherlands’ ASML, analysts say it would be difficult to put together an entire toolchain for making advanced semiconductors without at least some American equipment.

The burden of dealing with the new rule is most likely to be felt by foundries such as TSMC that buy the tools, rather than U.S. semiconductor firms such as Qualcomm Inc or Nvidia Corp that tap such foundries as part of their supply chain.

“We are concerned this rule may create uncertainty and disruption for the global semiconductor supply chain, but it seems to be less damaging to the U.S. semiconductor industry than the very broad approaches previously considered,” Semiconductor Industry Association Chief Executive John Neuffer said in a statement.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the action was aimed at protecting “the integrity of 5G networks.” He added that the rule “helps prevent Huawei from undermining U.S. export controls.”",www.reuters.com,center,6hf1ik52mSbezq7e

`` We need tariffs , but when it starts to impact the company where you work ... you 're thinking , well wait a minute , time out ! '' he said .
Moore is worried the tariffs might cost him his job . The mill where he works , NLMK Pennsylvania , in the town of Farrell , not far from the border with Ohio , employs 750 workers and is a subsidiary of Novolipetsk Steel , or NLMK , Russia 's top steelmaker .
But even though NLMK is creating American jobs , the company is being hit with a 25 percent tariff on steel because it imports raw steel slabs from Russia before turning them into coils in Pennsylvania and then selling that steel to customers that manufacture cars or pipes , for example .
Bill Almashy , a 48-year-old crane operator at the mill , worries that NLMK might not be able to survive the tariffs .
He knows what it is like to lose a steel mill job . This is the third mill he has worked at in recent years . One of the previous mills went bankrupt ; the other moved most of its jobs to Mexico . Along the way , Almashy lost his home , his pension and his 401 ( k ) .
`` A lot of steel in America is gone , '' he said. `` Basically our politicians failed us . ''
And so when he first heard about President Trump 's tariffs , he `` applauded '' the president . He says he still does but does n't understand why his company should be punished for importing steel .
`` Even if they 're foreign-owned , but they have a factory in this country and they 're employing American workers , to me , that 's an American company , '' Almashy said .
To him , exempting this Russian-owned steel mill from tariffs would be a matter of putting `` America First . ''
Moore voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 , but during the last presidential election , he became enamored with Donald Trump 's promise to bring back jobs and renegotiate trade deals . He thought tariffs in the abstract would be beneficial , but now that they could hurt the company he works for , he thinks the Trump administration needs to re-evaluate the idea .
`` Tariffs — they may help some people , but they 're gon na hurt a lot of people too . I do n't know exactly how you balance that , '' Moore said . `` Maybe it 's not the right time for tariffs . '' Maybe , he says , the president ought to focus more on wages and jobs instead .
Moore is about to head into the mill down the road for his shift . He is wearing a dark blue work uniform shirt over his round belly and a Trump hat over his graying hair . It 's a souvenir he picked up during Trump 's inauguration .
Moore insists he has `` no regrets '' about his vote , even though he knows some might think that 's strange given the precariousness of his current employment due to the very tariffs Trump introduced .
`` I have plans to write a letter to President Trump or maybe a personal phone call , '' Moore said . He believes that if he can get the president 's ear , he might be able to persuade him to give NLMK an exemption for the 3 million tons of semi-finished steel slabs it wants to import from Russia .
NLMK , which also has a mill in Indiana , applied for an official exemption from the tariffs with the Department of Commerce in March , arguing that it can not find enough domestic steel slabs to purchase .
But that application is still pending . The Commerce Department has said the review process should take roughly 90 days and it will consider requests for exclusions of `` certain products determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount . ''
Critics say NLMK is exaggerating its supply problem because it wants to continue buying slabs at a steep discount from its parent company in Russia , whose majority shareholder Vladimir Lisin is the wealthiest person in that country . In a statement to NPR , the company did not comment on Lisin but strongly denied it is trying to buy `` cheap foreign slabs . ''
`` I hate to say it , but in a lot of ways NLMK is the boy who cried wolf , '' said Scott Paul , president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing , a group that has been supportive of the president 's steel tariffs . Paul is skeptical that NLMK would actually close its Pennsylvania ( or Indiana ) mill because of the steel tariffs . `` A lot of companies will need to make adjustments ... finding new domestic suppliers , '' he said .
Paul says right now there may not be enough domestic steel slabs available for purchase , but that will change because of the tariffs .
Three U.S. steel companies , AK Steel , U.S. Steel and Nucor , have filed objections to NLMK 's request for an exemption .

Speaking during an impromptu news conference at the G7 summit in Canada on Saturday , Trump said his ultimate goal was the elimination of all trade duties .
`` Ultimately that 's what you want , '' he said . `` You want a tariff free . You want no barriers . And you want no subsidies . Because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries and that 's not fair . ''
Later Saturday , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would with `` absolute certainty '' impose retaliatory measures on July 1 to answer Trump 's tariffs on steel and aluminum . He said the argument that Trump 's tariffs on steel and aluminum are a matter of national security are `` kind of insulting . '' Trudeau said Canadians are nice but added , `` We will not be pushed around . ''
`` I will always protect Canadian workers and Canadian interests , '' Trudeau said .
The remarks prompted Trump to accuse Trudeau of making `` false statements '' and to say the United States would not endorse the G7 communique .
`` Based on Justin 's false statements at his news conference , and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers , workers and companies , I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S . Market ! , '' the President tweeted on Saturday .
In a second tweet , Trump wrote , `` PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @ G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that , 'US Tariffs were kind of insulting ' and he 'will not be pushed around . ' Very dishonest & weak . Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270 % on dairy ! ''
Trump had warned hours earlier that the United States would not allow the continued imposition of trade barriers by other nations .
`` Great meetings and relationships with the six Country Leaders especially since they know I can not allow them to apply large Tariffs and strong barriers to ... U.S.A. Trade , '' Trump wrote in a pair of tweets . `` They fully understand where I am coming from . After many decades , fair and reciprocal Trade will happen ! ''
`` The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers , workers and companies , '' Trump continued . `` While sending their product into our country tax free . We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades — and that is long enough . ''
Trump 's call for the elimination of trade barriers come amid fears of an all-out trade war after the US moved ahead with a 25 % import tax on steel and a 10 % on aluminum on most countries . The United States ' closest trading partners -- the EU , Canada and Mexico -- have vowed to impose retaliatory tariffs on scores of US products beginning in the coming weeks .
Echoing Trudeau , British Prime Minister Theresa May said Saturday that the European Union also will impose countermeasures to the US tariffs .
`` The EU -- of course , we operate as a member of the EU , as we currently are -- the European Union will impose countermeasures to the United States , '' May said . She added that the United Kingdom is a champion of free trade and would work to put in place free trade agreements with the United States and other countries once it leaves the European Union .
`` We want to continue a good trading relationship with the EU , but we also want to take advantage once we are outside it of being able to negotiate our own agreements with other countries around the world because I think that is to the benefit of the people living in the United Kingdom '' May said .
`` We have a very good relationship with President Trump , '' May said . `` We work with President Trump . The United Kingdom has a very good relationship with the United States . ''
G7 leaders had intended to use the summit to confront Trump on the tariffs , which they have described as protectionist and a threat to the global economy .
Trump said he discussed the idea of eliminating tariffs with his G7 counterparts .
`` I did suggest it ... I guess they are going to go back to the drawing board and check it out , '' Trump said . `` The relationships are very good , '' he added , mentioning his discussions with French and Canadian leaders specifically .
On Friday , French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to indicate room for negotiation ahead of a delayed meeting with Trump , telling reporters `` Sometimes we disagree . ''
Globally , tariffs are close to their lowest levels ever — averaging around 2.9 % — according to the latest data from the World Bank . Tariffs have been falling for decades due to free trade agreements .
Before departing the summit , Trump doubled-down on his assertions that the US has been subjected to unfair trade duties for many years . `` It 's going to change . Tariffs will come way down . We 're like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing and that ends . ''
He added , `` if they retaliate , they 're making a mistake . We have a tremendous trade imbalance . When we try to bring our piece up a little bit so it 's not so bad . ''
Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska said Trump 's comments on eliminating tariffs among G7 nations would be `` tremendous news '' if the President is serious about the issue , adding , `` I would happily carry his bag to every single meeting of those negotiations . ''
But Sasse said Trump 's complaints that other countries have taken advantage of the United States are unfounded , adding that he recommended `` less whining on the global stage . ''
`` The simple fact is that more trade has been overwhelmingly beneficial to U.S. families and to net U.S. job creation for 75 straight years , and pretending America has been taken advantage of -- that is , pretending that we 're losers -- is n't true .
`` The constant victim-talk does n't help anyone , '' he continued . `` It does n't help trade negotiations . And it does n't help U.S. citizens understand the disruption in our economy that is actually coming from more technology and more automation , not from free trade agreements -- which have overwhelmingly benefited American families . ''
Earlier this week , Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , vowed to press ahead with legislation that would require lawmakers to approve of trade actions by the President that are done on the grounds of national security , despite opposition from Trump .
The President 's characterization of the United States ' relationships with allies as `` a 10 '' when asked at the news conference about any tensions between his administration and other G7 nations also drew criticism from a senior European diplomat .
`` He must mean there are 10 things on which we totally disagree , '' the diplomat said . `` Or like the title of the movie '10 Things I Hate About You . ' ''
Trump has long criticized the United States ' goods deficit . Economists point out that the current US economy is much more driven by services like hospitals , universities , tech companies and banks . Manufacturing , an industry Trump focuses on , makes up about 10 % of US economic output .
Recent World Trade Organization data shows that America 's average tariff for imported goods is 2.4 % . Canada 's average tariff for imported goods is 3.1 % , and the EU 's average tariff for imported goods is 3 % .","(CNN) President Donald Trump on Saturday said he wanted to see the elimination of trade barriers between the United States and its closest allies amid tensions over the Trump administration's move to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico.

""The simple fact is that more trade has been overwhelmingly beneficial to U.S. families and to net U.S. job creation for 75 straight years, and pretending America has been taken advantage of -- that is, pretending that we're losers -- isn't true.

""The constant victim-talk doesn't help anyone,"" he continued. ""It doesn't help trade negotiations. And it doesn't help U.S. citizens understand the disruption in our economy that is actually coming from more technology and more automation, not from free trade agreements -- which have overwhelmingly benefited American families.""

Earlier this week, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, vowed to press ahead with legislation that would require lawmakers to approve of trade actions by the President that are done on the grounds of national security, despite opposition from Trump.

The President's characterization of the United States' relationships with allies as ""a 10"" when asked at the news conference about any tensions between his administration and other G7 nations also drew criticism from a senior European diplomat.

""He must mean there are 10 things on which we totally disagree,"" the diplomat said. ""Or like the title of the movie '10 Things I Hate About You.'""

Trump has long criticized the United States' goods deficit. Economists point out that the current US economy is much more driven by services like hospitals, universities, tech companies and banks. Manufacturing, an industry Trump focuses on, makes up about 10% of US economic output.

Recent World Trade Organization data shows that America's average tariff for imported goods is 2.4%. Canada's average tariff for imported goods is 3.1%, and the EU's average tariff for imported goods is 3%.",www.cnn.com,left,IeOqhpg2ZpPvsicc

trade,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/conservatives-trade-pact-could-cause-flood-of-immigrants-117620.html?hp=t1_r,Trade pact foes: Deal could cause flood of immigrants,2015-05-05,Seung Min Kim,"Opponents of giving the Obama administration broad authority to negotiate a trans-Pacific trade deal , including Republican senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , are pushing a new argument : It could trigger a flood of immigrants into the country .
Sessions ’ argument – essentially , that the administration could use the authority to expand immigration – was dismissed as an “ urban legend ” by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , whose panel oversees trade .
But with extremely close votes expected in both the House and possibly the Senate on whether to grant President Barack Obama increased powers in trade talks , leading Republicans and members of the administration are taking the threat seriously and working overtime to debunk it , knowing the potency of the immigration issue among Republican voters and elected officials .
GOP leaders will have to keep the vast majority of their members in support of the fast-track authority , while hoping that Obama is able to persuade between 20 and 40 House Democrats to join them . Last week , senior House lawmakers and aides warned that the legislation was in trouble .
Ryan ’ s committee has issued fact sheets trying to disprove the immigration concerns . And House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte ( R-Va. ) shipped out a “ Dear Colleague ” letter flatly stating that the proposed trade deal is “ not an immigration giveaway . ”
Meanwhile , Senate Republicans used their latest weekly address , anchored by Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia , to bat away concerns that the Obama administration could sneak through immigration changes under the guise of a trade deal . Top GOP lawmakers , as well as Obama administration officials , have stressed to conservative skeptics that immigration isn ’ t involved in the trade fight .
“ There ’ s nothing in this bill that applies to immigration , and we ’ ve been assured by the administration that there will be nothing in any of the trade pacts that will involve immigration , ” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) , who steered the trade legislation through his panel , said in an interview Monday .
Of those raising alarms about immigration in a trade deal , Hatch added : “ That ’ s a false issue . If they don ’ t like the bill , that ’ s one thing , but to use that issue is just a false issue . We made sure it ’ s not in there . ”
In their push , Republicans who support trade promotion authority — which would give Obama the power to submit trade agreements to Congress with just up-or-down votes — are battling a veteran immigration reform opponent with a track record of stirring up conservative angst on the issue .
That chief agitator is Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) , who is circulating letters and memos to lawmakers warning that the fast-track legislation pending before both chambers could allow for a tide of foreign workers with little congressional oversight .
“ There are numerous ways TPA could facilitate immigration increases above current law — and precious few ways anyone in Congress could stop its happening , ” Sessions wrote in a memo circulated Sunday .
He argues that language could be added to the TPP that is intended to bring more foreign workers into the United States . The fast-track legislation would give the president that authority for six years , so Sessions argued that future trade deals could also be ripe for immigration policy changes .
Sessions alludes to past trade deals . In 2003 , the Bush administration included temporary visas from Chile and Singapore in their respective trade pacts despite congressional opposition . The Alabama senator opposed granting President George W. Bush trade promotion authority in 2002 .
But in this latest round of trade deals , the Obama administration has told Congress that immigration is playing no role in the talks . In an April 22 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman wrote that no TPP provisions will prompt changes in the nation ’ s immigration law or regulations — echoing his testimony before the Finance Committee earlier that month .
“ I … welcome the opportunity to clarify that the United States is not negotiating and will not agree to anything in TPP that would require any modification to U.S. immigration law or policy or any changes to the U.S. visa system , ” Froman wrote to Grassley .
With those assurances from Froman , Grassley said he decided not to offer an amendment during the Finance Committee ’ s markup of the fast-track bill that would have addressed those immigration concerns . He is open to doing so when the trade debate hits the Senate floor .
And Sessions could also offer immigration-related amendments to the trade legislation . An aide said Sessions was considering several options for amendments , but declined to elaborate Monday .
Although Sessions has been the most vocal Republican on Capitol Hill expressing concern over immigration in a trade deal , he isn ’ t alone . Rep. Lou Barletta ( R-Pa. ) , another hard-liner on the issue , said he was leaning against granting Obama fast-track authority and cited a potential boost in temporary foreign workers as one of his concerns .
“ There ’ s a lot of fear that it ’ ll allow guest workers to come in and take jobs away from Americans , ” Barletta said in an interview . “ So there ’ s a lot of questions that the average American has on whether or not these deals are actually good for the American worker or not . ”
The perceived secrecy surrounding the proposed trade deal — a pending 12-country agreement that would amount to roughly 40 percent of the world ’ s economic output — hasn ’ t helped allay some conservatives ’ concerns . Added Rep. Mo Brooks ( R-Ala. ) , who is otherwise undecided on fast-track : “ If there is any chance whatsoever of the Obama administration using any of these trade bills to increase this huge influx in foreign labor to the detriment of American citizens , I ’ m a ‘ no ’ vote . ”
Despite these concerns , the House Ways and Means Committee is convinced that immigration worries are limited to just a small circle of lawmakers on Capitol Hill . Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck said immigration concerns in the trade deal have “ come up very , very infrequently among members of Congress . ”
Away from Capitol Hill , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also got in on the debunking game , issuing a blog post Monday that said Sessions ’ immigration claim “ just isn ’ t true. ” Goodlatte — a veteran immigration attorney whose committee oversees the issue — also weighed in .
“ In the TPP negotiations , USTR has acted in good faith and has respected Congress ’ constitutionally-granted power to write our nation ’ s immigration laws , ” Goodlatte wrote to lawmakers last week . “ In turn , we should support the TPP and trade promotion authority as a boon to the American economy . ”
Still , immigration is seeping into the trade fight in other ways . GOP resistance to granting Obama fast-track powers is another example of the collateral damage on Capitol Hill from the president ’ s controversial executive actions on immigration last fall , when he acted to defer deportations for more than 4 million immigrants in the United States illegally .
Rep. John Fleming ( R-La . ) pointed to immigration as the “ most obvious ” way that — in Republicans ’ view — Obama has abused his executive power .
“ I believe in free trade ; I support free trade , ” he said . “ But the problem I have with fast track is that it gives this president tremendous power to negotiate things that I don ’ t trust with this president . ”
Still , other conservative lawmakers have dismissed such arguments from fellow Republicans and said the deep distrust of the Obama administration by GOP lawmakers shouldn ’ t preclude them giving Obama a freer hand during trade negotiations .
“ When it comes to giving this president power , I ’ m as nervous about it as anybody . But let ’ s be real , ” said Rep. Matt Salmon ( R-Ariz. ) , who backs fast track . “ There ’ s so much misinformation . Fast track actually sets parameters that we want the president to work under in order to negotiate . I think that ’ s our responsibility . ”","Opponents of giving the Obama administration broad authority to negotiate a trans-Pacific trade deal, including Republican senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, are pushing a new argument: It could trigger a flood of immigrants into the country.

Sessions’ argument – essentially, that the administration could use the authority to expand immigration – was dismissed as an “urban legend” by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, whose panel oversees trade.

But with extremely close votes expected in both the House and possibly the Senate on whether to grant President Barack Obama increased powers in trade talks, leading Republicans and members of the administration are taking the threat seriously and working overtime to debunk it, knowing the potency of the immigration issue among Republican voters and elected officials.

GOP leaders will have to keep the vast majority of their members in support of the fast-track authority, while hoping that Obama is able to persuade between 20 and 40 House Democrats to join them. Last week, senior House lawmakers and aides warned that the legislation was in trouble.

Ryan’s committee has issued fact sheets trying to disprove the immigration concerns. And House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) shipped out a “Dear Colleague” letter flatly stating that the proposed trade deal is “not an immigration giveaway.”

Meanwhile, Senate Republicans used their latest weekly address, anchored by Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, to bat away concerns that the Obama administration could sneak through immigration changes under the guise of a trade deal. Top GOP lawmakers, as well as Obama administration officials, have stressed to conservative skeptics that immigration isn’t involved in the trade fight.

“There’s nothing in this bill that applies to immigration, and we’ve been assured by the administration that there will be nothing in any of the trade pacts that will involve immigration,” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who steered the trade legislation through his panel, said in an interview Monday.

Of those raising alarms about immigration in a trade deal, Hatch added: “That’s a false issue. If they don’t like the bill, that’s one thing, but to use that issue is just a false issue. We made sure it’s not in there.”

In their push, Republicans who support trade promotion authority — which would give Obama the power to submit trade agreements to Congress with just up-or-down votes — are battling a veteran immigration reform opponent with a track record of stirring up conservative angst on the issue.

That chief agitator is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who is circulating letters and memos to lawmakers warning that the fast-track legislation pending before both chambers could allow for a tide of foreign workers with little congressional oversight.

“There are numerous ways TPA could facilitate immigration increases above current law — and precious few ways anyone in Congress could stop its happening,” Sessions wrote in a memo circulated Sunday.

He argues that language could be added to the TPP that is intended to bring more foreign workers into the United States. The fast-track legislation would give the president that authority for six years, so Sessions argued that future trade deals could also be ripe for immigration policy changes.

Sessions alludes to past trade deals. In 2003, the Bush administration included temporary visas from Chile and Singapore in their respective trade pacts despite congressional opposition. The Alabama senator opposed granting President George W. Bush trade promotion authority in 2002.

But in this latest round of trade deals, the Obama administration has told Congress that immigration is playing no role in the talks. In an April 22 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman wrote that no TPP provisions will prompt changes in the nation’s immigration law or regulations — echoing his testimony before the Finance Committee earlier that month.

“I … welcome the opportunity to clarify that the United States is not negotiating and will not agree to anything in TPP that would require any modification to U.S. immigration law or policy or any changes to the U.S. visa system,” Froman wrote to Grassley.

With those assurances from Froman, Grassley said he decided not to offer an amendment during the Finance Committee’s markup of the fast-track bill that would have addressed those immigration concerns. He is open to doing so when the trade debate hits the Senate floor.

And Sessions could also offer immigration-related amendments to the trade legislation. An aide said Sessions was considering several options for amendments, but declined to elaborate Monday.

Although Sessions has been the most vocal Republican on Capitol Hill expressing concern over immigration in a trade deal, he isn’t alone. Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), another hard-liner on the issue, said he was leaning against granting Obama fast-track authority and cited a potential boost in temporary foreign workers as one of his concerns.

Angela Merkel ’ s Germany , supposedly the last great anchor of the liberal world order , is hopelessly addicted to national competitiveness talk . Berlin measures the success of its economic policy not in terms of domestic investment or domestic well-being , but above all in the scale of its trade surplus .

As Paul Krugman has pointed out, Mr. Trump’s Democratic predecessors were no exceptions: Bill Clinton, the arch globalizer, spoke of each nation as being “like a big corporation competing in the global marketplace.” Two years into his presidency, Barack Obama relaunched his Economic Recovery Advisory Board as the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, boldly announcing, “We can outcompete any other nation on earth.”

Angela Merkel’s Germany, supposedly the last great anchor of the liberal world order, is hopelessly addicted to national competitiveness talk. Berlin measures the success of its economic policy not in terms of domestic investment or domestic well-being, but above all in the scale of its trade surplus.

Nor is it merely a German obsession. Competitiveness is an endlessly repeated mantra of the European Commission. Mr. Tusk tweets about it all the time.

So what then is so upsetting about Mr. Trump’s latest outburst?

One of the president’s favorite taboo-breaking moves is that he likes to name enemies, especially those hiding in what is supposed to be America’s own camp. In doing so, he not only offends Atlanticist decorum but also violates a more specific injunction, which permits politicians to talk as much as they like about global competition but not about specific competitors. Normal talk about globalization and competitiveness is directed inward, to the nation. It serves as a call to discipline and hard work. Mr. Trump is taking the idea and pointing it outward, calling out his supposed foes. In so doing, he deliberately fosters economic nationalism.

Conventional competitiveness rhetoric treads a fine line. The point is to stir the pot without causing things to bubble over. With Davos types like Ms. Merkel, you know that whatever rhetoric they employ in public, there are people working behind the scenes who respect international law and global treaties, who understand that blatant national favoritism will blow the system up. The same cannot be said for the Trump administration, which has actually imposed tariffs. They are modest so far, but Mr. Trump has a relish for escalation.

On Wednesday , he blinked on both .
Trump 's decisions to put trade hostilities with the European Union on hold and to delay the Russian President 's visit he had planned for the fall are likely to be widely welcomed among Republicans and among US allies who have been concerned by his tendency to elevate US enemies while criticizing friends .
At the White House , Trump declared what appeared at first to be a stunning breakthrough in transatlantic trade amid fears of an all-out trade war .
`` We had a big day . Very big , '' Trump said , promising a `` new phase '' in the relationship in which both sides win , after meeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker . They sealed their meeting when Juncker kissed Trump , pictured in a tweet posted by Trump later Wednesday evening . It was a far cry from the President 's smoldering rage at Europe that was in evidence during his trip across the Atlantic earlier this month .
`` This was a very big day for free and fair trade . A very big day indeed . '' Trump said .
The President needed a big day . His White House reeled Wednesday over a tape made by his former lawyer Michael Cohen aired on CNN 'S `` Cuomo Prime Time '' that showed he knew about an effort to pay off a Playboy model who said she had an affair with him that contradicted his previous denials .
Trump refused to answer questions about the tape during an photo-op with Juncker -- and the White House later banned CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins from the trade announcement for asking them .
The announcement on trade was dressed up as a huge victory , held in the Rose Garden , the traditional venue for big state announcements , and in front of a group of Republican lawmakers apparently called down from Capitol Hill to serve as a backdrop .
Yet in essence , its real effect seemed to be to disguise a step back by the President who has imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on US allies in Europe , repeatedly threatened to slap a 25 % tariff on European cars imports and blasted the European Union in public .
The two sides said that they had agreed to discuss tearing down all tariffs , trade barriers and subsidies on non-auto industrial goods . Trump said that they had also agreed to work together to resolve the issue of `` retaliatory tariffs '' imposed in recent months .
The President 's announcement that Europe will buy more soybeans and liquid national gas could be good news for US agriculture and industry .
And Juncker , apparently keen to flatter Trump , was eager to play along in language that the President appreciates .
`` When I was invited by the President to the White House , I had one intention : I had the intention to make a deal today . And we made a deal today , '' he said .
It would be huge news if the US and Europe ever agreed to get to the zero tariffs , zero subsidies and zero barriers standard that both leaders proposed on Wednesday .
But it was also clear that the deal unveiled on Wednesday was a truce -- rather than a peace treaty . It averted the trade war Trump had effectively started -- and included a vague commitment for talks toward a real but distant goal . Juncker , though , said both sides agreed to hold off on future tariffs while the talks were taking place -- in an apparent victory for Europe .
In that sense , the deal appeared more of a fix for a problem Trump had created rather than a genuine breakthrough on thorny underlying issues . Given the unpredictable nature of the President 's diplomacy it 's uncertain how long the trade amnesty will last -- once the script is no longer in front of him and when he is fixating at European nations he referred to this month as foes .
After all , on several occasions the administration seemed to reached agreement with China to avert Trump 's trade war , but each time , the President unilaterally doubled down .
The President 's apparent blink on trade came a day after the administration unveiled a $ 12 billion aid package for farmers hurting from retaliatory tariffs , especially imposed by China , on US products .
Given vehement complaints by Republicans in Washington about the tariff war , as well as cries for help from GOP candidates and office holders in the Midwest ahead of midterm elections , questions will now be asked whether the administration has suddenly realized the political impact of Trump 's populist trade approach and is taking steps to mitigate it .
The trade deal issue was not the only climbdown on Wednesday .
Trump 's national security adviser John Bolton announced that the Russian President would now not visit Washington in the fall -- following an invitation issued suddenly by the White House on Twitter last week .
Bolton blamed the `` witch hunt '' -- the White House 's terminology for the special counsel 's Russia investigation -- for the delay and said the visit would now take place after the `` first of the year '' when the probe was over .
The White House has no control over the duration of Robert Mueller 's probe , so its timeline may well be over optimistic .
And Trump 's reversal again came amid fierce opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill over the invitation which followed his deferential behavior when he met Putin in Helsinki last week , and warnings from US intelligence agencies that it is already targeting the midterms .
Since the President also declined to answer questions about the Putin invitation , the prospect that he had been snubbed by the Russian leader could not be ruled out , though the Kremlin -- which had never showed much enthusiasm about the prospect of a Putin visit to Washington -- said Wednesday that it had n't begun planning for the summit .
Given that the Russian leader so comprehensively outdueled Trump in Helsinki , Putin may have had little inclination to offer the US President a do-over in such a high-profile setting .
The two men could still meet elsewhere this year . Both would be expected to be at the Asia Pacific Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea in November , for example , or the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this year .
Given the sometimes erratic nature of Trump 's impulsive foreign policy making , in on the cuff chats with reporters or on Twitter , no one can take it to the bank that where Trump landed on Europe and Putin will end up being his definitive position .
In a contentious hearing on Wednesday , senators repeatedly challenged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the question of whether US foreign policy was represented by formal statements of the State Department , the Pentagon and the foreign policy bureaucracy in the White House or Trump 's often conflicting comments .
Pompeo complained that senators `` somehow disconnect the administration 's activities from the President 's actions . They are one in the same . ''

A victory or a walk-back?

The President needed a big day. His White House reeled Wednesday over a tape made by his former lawyer Michael Cohen aired on CNN'S ""Cuomo Prime Time"" that showed he knew about an effort to pay off a Playboy model who said she had an affair with him that contradicted his previous denials.

Democrats traditionally have been more skeptical than Republicans when it comes to free trade .
The 2020 presidential race also squeezes the timing for a vote on the bill to implement the USMCA . Lawmakers of both parties have warned that passing such a deal will be politically tricky in an election year .

Even amid rising tensions from Trump ’ s tariff threat , Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has reaffirmed his support for the new Nafta deal . Its prospects in Mexico ’ s Congress are good , given the support of Lopez Obrador , whose party controls the nation ’ s legislative branch . Major opposition parties also want it to be enacted .
Nonetheless , the tariff confrontation may have created lasting damage to ties between the two countries . Republicans previously pleaded with Trump to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico , and they ’ ve publicly worried about the lasting impact of changes to global commerce as a result of Trump ’ s multi-front trade wars .

Trump’s position sets him apart from free-trade Republicans, and it also creates a dilemma for 2020 Democratic candidates. Democrats traditionally have been more skeptical than Republicans when it comes to free trade.

The 2020 presidential race also squeezes the timing for a vote on the bill to implement the USMCA. Lawmakers of both parties have warned that passing such a deal will be politically tricky in an election year. That means the best chance for a vote would be before Congress recesses in August to avoid typical end-of-the-year budget fights, according to North Carolina Representative Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally.

“Hopefully, we can get together and make sure that happens in the latter part of July,’’ Meadows said on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.’’

Trump’s New Nafta Is Losing Time to Find Path in Congress

Even amid rising tensions from Trump’s tariff threat, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has reaffirmed his support for the new Nafta deal. Its prospects in Mexico’s Congress are good, given the support of Lopez Obrador, whose party controls the nation’s legislative branch. Major opposition parties also want it to be enacted.

Nonetheless, the tariff confrontation may have created lasting damage to ties between the two countries. Republicans previously pleaded with Trump to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and they’ve publicly worried about the lasting impact of changes to global commerce as a result of Trump’s multi-front trade wars.

Even as Trump retains some bipartisan support for taking a hard stance against Chinese trade practices, few lawmakers wanted him to rip up the accord with Mexico and Canada without a replacement. The USMCA came together after more than a year of painstaking negotiations.

Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who’s up for re-election in 2020, said he has “no doubt’’ there’s enough support in the Senate to ratify the agreement. With help from pro-trade Republicans, Tillis said Sunday on Fox, the Democratic-led House should be able to pass it as well.

“Now that we’ve gotten the threat of tariffs out of the way, I hope that Speaker Pelosi will put that on the House floor,’’ he said.

Each product subject to a new tariff is listed by its eight-digit code under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). I read through the entire document so you don't have to—but it's embeded at the bottom of this post in case you have nothing better to do.

Food

Trump's tariffs come down particularly hard on anyone who has to eat. Tariffs will be applied to ""Cooking stoves, ranges & ovens, other than microwave, for making hot drinks or for cooking or heating food."" Microwaves don't escape either, as they are listed under a different HTSUS code. More specific tariffs will hit equipment used to make chocolate, sugar, and ""macaroni, spaghetti or similar products,"" along with machinery used in the production of poultry, meat, nuts, fruit, and eggs. And in case anything managed to slip through the cracks, there's another tariff on ""machinery for the industrial preparation or manufacture of food or drink.""

And also ""bakery ovens, including biscuit ovens,"" which seems like a weird thing to have to specify.

Alcohol

Trump's earlier tariff on aluminum would make beer cans more expensive, and his tariff on steel threatens not only to make kegs of beer more costly but also to drive the only remaining American keg-making company out of business. Now, Trump is aiming to drive up the cost of making the stuff that goes in those cans and kegs. ""Brewery machinery"" will be subject to tariffs, but so will ""presses, crushers, and similar machinery used in the manufacture of wine, cider,"" and even non-alcoholic beverages like juices.

Clothes

Pretty much every aspect of the manufacture of cloth and clothing will be subject to new import taxes. Sewing machines, spindles, looms, weaving machines, and various other textile-making equipment are subject to tariffs. Even sewing needles, knitting needles, and embroidery needles make the list. ""Machinery for making felt hats,"" is included, as is ""machinery for making or repairing footwear.""

Lighting, Heating, and Home Entertainment

You like using things like lights, televisions, and the internet, right? Unfortunately, the electricity used to power those things has to come from somewhere, and many of Trump's tariffs will end up being passed along to consumers in the form of higher energy bills. Electric generating equipment, including transformers, converters, and wind-powered turbines will be subject to tariffs. Fuses, switches, breakers, are included in the tariffs, along with lithium, nickle, and zinc batteries.

Many of the devices where you might consumer that more-expensive electricity will become more expensive too, because tariffs will hit both high definition and non-HD televisions, audio equipment like speakers and headphones, and light bulbs.

Often, it is too hot. Occasionally, it is too cold. Either way, you'll pay. Tariffs will be placed on boilers, condensers, thermostats, and various other parts of heating and air-conditioning systems.

Dishwashers

Roll up your sleeves and get to work making America great again by scraping the burned-on remnants of last night's dinner off the bottom of that pot, because ""dishwashing machines of the household type"" are subject to Trump's tariffs. Also ""dishwashing machines other than the household type"" and ""parts of dishwashing machines,"" just for good measure.

Recreational Gear

Have a boat? Trump's tariffs will increase the price of outboard motors and boat propellers. Like skiiing? ""Chair lifts, ski draglines,"" and various parts for both are included in the list of tariffs. Play golf? Hope you like walking the course, because ""golf carts and similar motor vehicles"" are subject to tariffs too.

Trains, Planes, and Automobiles (and boats too)



Rail locomotives, rail coaches, rolling stock, and trams are subject to tariffs. So are airplanes, parts of airplane engines, airplane tires and propellers (including turbopropellers). Helicopters weighing less than 2,000 kilograms are subject to tariffs, but so are helicopters weighing more than 2,000 kilograms. There are full pages detailing all the types of motor vehicles that will be subject to tariffs, and including all the parts that you could possibly ever use to build or repair any of them. Tankers, cruise ships, tug boats, ferry boats, ""excursion boats,"" fishing vessels, and even lifeboats are subject to tariffs.

The list also includes ""ships' logs"" and ""flight data recorders."" No, really.

Construction Equipment

The construction industry was already dreading the consequences of paying higher prices for steel, but now it will have to pay higher prices for lots of other things too! Overhead cranes, bulldozers, graders, levelers, scrapers, front-end loaders, backhoes, cement mixers, and any ""machinery for lifting, handling, loading or unloading"" are all subject to tariffs. Going to do some construction the old fashioned way? Buckets and shovels are on the list too. Trump's much anticipated Infrastructure Week just got a whole lot more expensive.

Farms

Farmers were already pretty pissed about Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum, and then got whacked a second time when China imposed retaliatory tariffs on a whole host of agricultural products. Now, things are going to get even worse. Haymaking machinery, straw balers, threshing machinery, harvesting machinery, milking machines, and poultry incubators will be subject to tariffs, and those higher costs will be passed along to anyone who buys milk, eggs, meat, or pretty much anything else that comes from a farm.

Flamethrowers (But Also Fire Extinguishers)

Whether you're trying to stop The Thing from killing you or merely trying to keep your house from burning down, Trump's tariffs will make your goals more expensive to achieve. Tariffs will apply to ""fire extinguishers, whether or not charged,"" and to the parts of fire extinguishers. At least Elon Musk will be pleased (at least until he sees that boring and drilling machinery is also subject to a tariff).

But That's Not All!

Trump's tariffs will also apply to a wide range of random shit, like:

Vaccines (for humans and for animals)

Malaria test kits

Dental fillings

Anti-freeze and other de-icing fluids

Nuclear reactors (also ""parts for nuclear reactors"")

Hand-held blow torches

Chain saws

Syringes (with or without needles attached)

Rocket launchers

Grenade launchers

Catalytic converters

Snowplows and snowblowers

Bookbinding machinery

Cash registers

Human blood

Literally none of these are made up, but don't take my word for it. Here's the full list.

trade,Victor Hanson,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/12/americans-frustrated-with-international-disequilibrium-trade-immigration/,OPINION: The Dangers of Asymmetry,2018-12-11,"Victor Davis Hanson, Jim Geraghty, Kyle Smith, Zachary Evans, Luke Thompson, David French, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Tobias Hoonhout, Kevin D. Williamson, Nro Contributor","President Trump with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing , November 2017 . ( Damir Sagolj/Reuters )
International disequilibrium in trade , religious freedoms , immigration — plenty of Americans are fed up .
It is strange how suddenly a skeptical Wall Street , CEOs , and even university and think-tank policy analysts are now jumping on the once-taboo Trump bandwagon on China : that if something is not done to stop China ’ s planned trajectory to global hegemony , based on its repudiation of the entire post-war trade and commercial order , then it will soon be too late . In a wider sense , at some point on a variety of fronts , Americans got fed up with perceived lopsidedness , and their ensuing exasperation started to change status-quo thinking and policy — whether China ’ s flagrant cheating , the recent illustration , via the “ caravan , ” of rampant hypocrisies about illegal immigration , or weariness with the asymmetries with the Islamic world .
China in its planned trajectory to world global supremacy makes two assumptions about the United States :
that China can weld government-run market capitalism to autocratic government to improve on supposedly chaotic Western democratic and republican government and indulgent human rights ;
that the Western world will continue to excuse Chinese violations of global commercial and trade norms , on their misplaced theories either that the more successful the Chinese become , the more they will evolve to a democratic and transparent society and join the Western liberal community and follow its post-war international norms , or that there is nothing the West can do about a fated Chinese supremacy .
As to Chinese trust that their brand of government-managed capitalism is superior , in the short term , it is true that authoritarian governments , mostly in wartime , occasionally can achieve temporary spectacular results through partnering with capitalists .
But in the longer run , managed capitalism proves far less flexible and ultimately less productive than free markets that are moderately regulated by elected governments rather than heavily controlled by authoritarians or socialists .
In addition , the Chinese misjudge Western patience , especially as its surpluses grow , its violations of copyright and patents become more flagrant , and espionage and technological appropriation are seen as a Chinese birthright .
China assumes that many of the third of a million Chinese students and green-card holders in America have an obligation to engage in espionage for the mother country ; and they further expect that U.S. visitors to China not only do not share such rigid loyalty to the United States , but if they did , they would be sorely punished by Beijing .
If we think Chinese students at Stanford or Cal Tech or in Silicon Valley are won over by our diversity , prosperity , consumerism , free-wheeling popular culture , and unfettered free speech , and that they will take back such an ethos to China , leading eventually to a democratic spring , the Chinese government thinks that we are sorely mistaken . It believes instead that returning Chinese students and green-card holders will be chock-full of invaluable technological , military , and commercial information but nonetheless turned off by American license — perhaps in the same way that Japanese visitors and residents in the United States during the 1920s , a future Admiral Yamamoto and foreign minister Yōsuke Matsuoka among them , eventually became strong advocates for war against the U.S .
Yet the history of democracies , as Thucydides pointed out , is that laxity , complacency , and self-absorption are abruptly replaced in extremis by frantic mobilization to danger , as the entire commonwealth becomes invested in addressing existential challenges . The U.S. responses in 1917 , 1941 , and 1947 bear that out . For all the talk of decline , the Chinese should not wish to provoke the U.S. and its allies into a response that would remind them actually how relatively weak in comparison to the U.S. they actually are in terms of economic clout , military capability , cultural influence , and political unity .
The various manifestations of hostile radical Islamism — the Iranian theocracy and its terrorist surrogates , ISIS affiliates and Sunni fundamentalist terrorism , many within the Pakistani government , and often two-faced authoritarian regimes — all assume a similar idea that the West accepts asymmetry as a sort of psychological penance . Westerners must pay for their inordinate wealth , the theory goes , or for their supposed sins of 19th- and 20th-century colonialism and imperialism , or they ’ re simply too morally compromised to regain enough confidence in the ancient spirit of Christendom and Western civilization to defend their values .
Yet ISIS learned that there are limits to the Western tolerance of beheading . It is a peculiar Western characteristic that despite all the West ’ s pious appeals to its own restraint and humanitarianism , when its patience is rarely and finally exhausted and it feels justifiably aggrieved , it can bring terrifying military resources to bear without much worry over limiting the damage it inflicts .
In terms of culture , we also live in an asymmetrical world with Islam itself : Mosques sprout all over the West ; Christian churches are banned in many kingdoms of the Gulf and more and more are disappearing , from Syria to Turkey . This is said to be normal , and we are to get over it .
Inside a Western country , if one blasphemes Jesus , the mockery is seen as the stuff of comedy , art , popular culture , and entertainment . Try the same in Paris or New York with the prophet of Islam , and the consequences can become violent and relentless . Try it in a Muslim country , and the consequences are death . That asymmetry , again , becomes normative . To Islamic extremists , this is not a token of magnanimity to be reciprocated but rather proof of timidity and impotence to be justifiably exploited .
Mass and illegal immigration to the West from Arab and Muslim nations is assumed , along with the idea that even illegal aliens from the Middle East and North Africa immediately on entrance to Europe or the U.S. have the right and indeed the eagerness to demand from the West the freedoms and prosperity lacking in most Islamic countries — including the liberty to ridicule the hospitality of their newfound hosts .
What Pakistani immigrants expect as visiting rights in Britain , or what Turks assume of Germans , is not reciprocated by Pakistan and Turkey in their treatment of Western visitors in their own countries . Pakistani and Turkish immigrants also insist that their new Western hosts treat them far better than their prior governments did . Fine , that is the Western tradition . And yet immigrants often romanticize the distant countries they have forsaken , and they damn the new hosts who have saved them . No better examples of such schizophrenia can be found than the current confusion and chaos of Islamic citizens and immigrants in France , or the role of many first-generation Muslim intellectuals residing in the West .
The shocking thing about the so-called caravan wearing out its welcome in Tijuana was not that Mexican citizens were tired of the chaos of illegal immigrants demanding services of its newfound host country Mexico — but that Mexicans seemed absolutely oblivious to the irony that Americans might feel toward them as they feel to Central Americans .

International disequilibrium in trade, religious freedoms, immigration — plenty of Americans are fed up.

It is strange how suddenly a skeptical Wall Street, CEOs, and even university and think-tank policy analysts are now jumping on the once-taboo Trump bandwagon on China: that if something is not done to stop China’s planned trajectory to global hegemony, based on its repudiation of the entire post-war trade and commercial order, then it will soon be too late. In a wider sense, at some point on a variety of fronts, Americans got fed up with perceived lopsidedness, and their ensuing exasperation started to change status-quo thinking and policy — whether China’s flagrant cheating, the recent illustration, via the “caravan,” of rampant hypocrisies about illegal immigration, or weariness with the asymmetries with the Islamic world.

China

China in its planned trajectory to world global supremacy makes two assumptions about the United States:

that China can weld government-run market capitalism to autocratic government to improve on supposedly chaotic Western democratic and republican government and indulgent human rights;

that the Western world will continue to excuse Chinese violations of global commercial and trade norms, on their misplaced theories either that the more successful the Chinese become, the more they will evolve to a democratic and transparent society and join the Western liberal community and follow its post-war international norms, or that there is nothing the West can do about a fated Chinese supremacy.

As to Chinese trust that their brand of government-managed capitalism is superior, in the short term, it is true that authoritarian governments, mostly in wartime, occasionally can achieve temporary spectacular results through partnering with capitalists.

But in the longer run, managed capitalism proves far less flexible and ultimately less productive than free markets that are moderately regulated by elected governments rather than heavily controlled by authoritarians or socialists.

In addition, the Chinese misjudge Western patience, especially as its surpluses grow, its violations of copyright and patents become more flagrant, and espionage and technological appropriation are seen as a Chinese birthright.

China assumes that many of the third of a million Chinese students and green-card holders in America have an obligation to engage in espionage for the mother country; and they further expect that U.S. visitors to China not only do not share such rigid loyalty to the United States, but if they did, they would be sorely punished by Beijing.

If we think Chinese students at Stanford or Cal Tech or in Silicon Valley are won over by our diversity, prosperity, consumerism, free-wheeling popular culture, and unfettered free speech, and that they will take back such an ethos to China, leading eventually to a democratic spring, the Chinese government thinks that we are sorely mistaken. It believes instead that returning Chinese students and green-card holders will be chock-full of invaluable technological, military, and commercial information but nonetheless turned off by American license — perhaps in the same way that Japanese visitors and residents in the United States during the 1920s, a future Admiral Yamamoto and foreign minister Yōsuke Matsuoka among them, eventually became strong advocates for war against the U.S.

Yet the history of democracies, as Thucydides pointed out, is that laxity, complacency, and self-absorption are abruptly replaced in extremis by frantic mobilization to danger, as the entire commonwealth becomes invested in addressing existential challenges. The U.S. responses in 1917, 1941, and 1947 bear that out. For all the talk of decline, the Chinese should not wish to provoke the U.S. and its allies into a response that would remind them actually how relatively weak in comparison to the U.S. they actually are in terms of economic clout, military capability, cultural influence, and political unity.

Radical Islam

The various manifestations of hostile radical Islamism — the Iranian theocracy and its terrorist surrogates, ISIS affiliates and Sunni fundamentalist terrorism, many within the Pakistani government, and often two-faced authoritarian regimes — all assume a similar idea that the West accepts asymmetry as a sort of psychological penance. Westerners must pay for their inordinate wealth, the theory goes, or for their supposed sins of 19th- and 20th-century colonialism and imperialism, or they’re simply too morally compromised to regain enough confidence in the ancient spirit of Christendom and Western civilization to defend their values.

Yet ISIS learned that there are limits to the Western tolerance of beheading. It is a peculiar Western characteristic that despite all the West’s pious appeals to its own restraint and humanitarianism, when its patience is rarely and finally exhausted and it feels justifiably aggrieved, it can bring terrifying military resources to bear without much worry over limiting the damage it inflicts.

In terms of culture, we also live in an asymmetrical world with Islam itself: Mosques sprout all over the West; Christian churches are banned in many kingdoms of the Gulf and more and more are disappearing, from Syria to Turkey. This is said to be normal, and we are to get over it.

Inside a Western country, if one blasphemes Jesus, the mockery is seen as the stuff of comedy, art, popular culture, and entertainment. Try the same in Paris or New York with the prophet of Islam, and the consequences can become violent and relentless. Try it in a Muslim country, and the consequences are death. That asymmetry, again, becomes normative. To Islamic extremists, this is not a token of magnanimity to be reciprocated but rather proof of timidity and impotence to be justifiably exploited.

Mass and illegal immigration to the West from Arab and Muslim nations is assumed, along with the idea that even illegal aliens from the Middle East and North Africa immediately on entrance to Europe or the U.S. have the right and indeed the eagerness to demand from the West the freedoms and prosperity lacking in most Islamic countries — including the liberty to ridicule the hospitality of their newfound hosts.

What Pakistani immigrants expect as visiting rights in Britain, or what Turks assume of Germans, is not reciprocated by Pakistan and Turkey in their treatment of Western visitors in their own countries. Pakistani and Turkish immigrants also insist that their new Western hosts treat them far better than their prior governments did. Fine, that is the Western tradition. And yet immigrants often romanticize the distant countries they have forsaken, and they damn the new hosts who have saved them. No better examples of such schizophrenia can be found than the current confusion and chaos of Islamic citizens and immigrants in France, or the role of many first-generation Muslim intellectuals residing in the West.

Mexico and Latin America

The shocking thing about the so-called caravan wearing out its welcome in Tijuana was not that Mexican citizens were tired of the chaos of illegal immigrants demanding services of its newfound host country Mexico — but that Mexicans seemed absolutely oblivious to the irony that Americans might feel toward them as they feel to Central Americans.

In other words, both the Mexican government and Mexican illegal immigrants have their own set of asymmetries that they now treat as de facto entitlements:

$30 billion in remittances from mostly illegal aliens residing in the U.S. are owed to Mexico, without taxation on such transactions, and with the full expectation that the U.S., state, and local governments will provide entitlement subsidies to illegal aliens that in turn help to free up cash to be sent to Mexico.

The U.S. will serve as a safety valve for popular anger at rampant Mexican corruption, inequality, racism, and exploitation. The implicit message to Mexican citizens is something like “March to San Diego rather on Mexico City.”

Mexico, both in its own constitution and legal system, and in daily practice, assumes it would never be as compassionate to illegal immigrants within its own territory as the U.S. is to illegal aliens from Mexico. The entire psychology is bizarre. Sometimes the pretext is a vague notion that “Alta” Mexico — the southwestern United States — really belongs to Mexico. Sometimes the assumption is that the U.S. is so rich and powerful that it can afford to subsidize Mexico for the greater North American good. And sometimes there is a sort of contempt: America treats Mexicans nobly, in a fashion Mexico would never treat like illegal immigrants, because Americans are contemptibly guilt-ridden or morally arrogant.

Are sanctions a fading weapon?

By Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence & Diplomatic Correspondent

The target of these sanctions is Russia rather than China but the impact is likely to be to encourage co-operation between Beijing and Moscow who, to a large extent, already share a worldview and resist what they see as Washington's efforts to throw its weight around.

China's developing military relationship with Russia was underscored by its participation at the recent Vostok exercises and it is not going to halt sophisticated weapons purchases from Russia.

The US move could just deepen the already tense trading relationship with Beijing. Sanctions may be a good way of registering US displeasure and causing Russia economic pain, but they may well not produce the desired outcome, a change in Russian policy.

The world's economic balance of power is slowly changing - sanctions imposed by a once-dominant US is a weapon that is gradually weakening and some believe their overuse could accelerate this process.

Who is affected by the sanctions?

China's Equipment Development Department (EDD), which is responsible for improving China's military technology, and its head, Li Shangfu, are sanctioned for completing ""significant transactions"" with Russia's state arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.

The EDD and Mr Li have been added to a Blocked Persons List, meaning any assets they hold in the US are frozen and Americans are ""generally prohibited"" from doing business with them.

Furthermore, the EDD is denied export licences and excluded from the American financial system.

Washington also blacklisted an additional 33 people and entities associated with Russian military and intelligence.

What other US-China tensions are there?

The two countries are currently embroiled in an escalating trade war.

President Donald Trump has imposed three waves of tariffs on about 40% of China's roughly $500bn of exports to the US and has also threatened further tariffs.

China has responded with tariffs on about $110bn of US exports. In 2017 China imported about $130bn of goods from the US.

There have also been some tensions over disputed territory in the South China Sea, which is subject to overlapping claims by six countries.

China has been accused of militarising the sea to support its vast claims.

trade,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/17/politics/us-china-trade-talks/index.html,'Do you have the paper?': Washington scrambles for details ahead of US-China trade talks,2018-11-17,Donna Borak,"Washington ( CNN ) The telephone lines of Washington 's premiere hotels have been ringing since Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced plans to host high-level trade negotiations with his Chinese counterparts before the end of the month .
Details of the high-stakes trade talks between the world 's two economic superpowers are so thin that Washington trade advocacy groups have resorted to calling around town to ask whether blocs of rooms have been reserved for the Chinese delegation , which may include Chinese Vice Premier Liu He .
Such time-consuming efforts to glean any information on an expected third round of bilateral talks underscores the widespread uncertainty surrounding efforts to lay the groundwork for a trade deal between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their expected meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of November .
With a January 1 deadline to ratchet up US tariffs to 25 % on more than $ 200 billion in Chinese imports approaching , players in Washington are increasingly desperate for any sign of de-escalation , according to interviews with more than a half a dozen business executives , Wall Street analysts , lobbyists and industry groups , including some with close ties to the Trump administration .
`` As any administration doubles down , particularly before a meeting like this , and when there are important issues at stake , everyone in town is trying to find out as much as they can , '' said Wendy Cutler , a managing director for the Asia Society and a former diplomat and negotiator for the Office of the US Trade Representative under President Barack Obama . `` What happened on that phone call ? Where 's the paper ? Do you have the paper ? If you ca n't give me the paper , what 's in the paper ? And if you ca n't tell me , can you tell me if this is in or out ? ''
On Friday , the American President offered a hint over how back-channel communications between the two economic superpowers are progressing , confirming reports that the Chinese had sent a preliminary offer -- which so far remains tightly held .
Trump described it as a `` very complete list `` of 142 concessions on a variety of issues Washington has put to Beijing .
`` It 's a lot of the things we 've asked , '' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office . `` But there are four or five things left off . ''
Trump also revived his threat of imposing a third round of tariffs on $ 267 billion of goods , if necessary , but suggested he probably would n't need to take such a step , because `` China would like to make a deal . ''
Xi offered a reply in remarks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Papua New Guinea on Saturday , where he spoke of the need for global cooperation and international trade and said there was no issue that countries could n't work out `` through consultation . ''
`` History has shown that confrontation , whether in the form of a cold war , a hot war or a trade war , will produce no winners , '' Xi said to applause .
But US Vice President Mike Pence , speaking after the Chinese leader , said while they had `` great respect for President Xi '' and China , there would be no backing down on the trade war with Beijing until it `` changes its ways . ''
`` China has taken advantage of the United States for many , many years and those days are over , '' Pence said .
The upcoming Argentina meeting is the only scheduled opportunity for a direct tête-à-tête between Trump and Xi , though the two leaders exchanged direct visits in 2017 -- with Trump welcoming Xi at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with a lavish banquet and a singing performance in Mandarin by his granddaughter Arabella .
But whatever is announced in Buenos Aires will invert the usual progress of trade negotiations , where leaders meet to formalize agreements already hashed out among lower-level aides . In the end , it 's likely to amount to a pledge by both presidents to end a tense year of damaging tit-for-tat tariffs between the world 's two largest trading partners .
`` Any reduction in trade tensions would be welcomed , but we see it as a short-term truce , '' Michael Gapen , chief US economist at Barclays Investment Bank wrote in a note to clients .
Casting a long shadow over the on-and-off negotiations between the two countries has been a shortage of trust by Chinese negotiators , who have wrestled with conflicting signals from the Trump administration on its trade policy and who to work with , and grappling with the reality that any deal with Trump is n't real until the President says it himself .
`` They are more than a little gun-shy , '' said Craig Allen , president of the US-China Business Council , pointing to two previous failed attempts to broker a trade truce between the two countries .
China 's Liu met Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross twice earlier this year , including last May , when Beijing 's delegation left the room with the belief the two sides had reached a tentative pact , only to have Trump veto the deal .

And in the past few weeks , Beijing has tried to send soft signals over its willingness to open its economy .
`` We make a mistake just looking at the trade relationship and looking at our strengths and weaknesses there , '' Robert Ross , a political science professor at Boston College and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations . `` This is not simply a trade war , this is an economic war . ''","Washington (CNN) The telephone lines of Washington's premiere hotels have been ringing since Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced plans to host high-level trade negotiations with his Chinese counterparts before the end of the month.

Details of the high-stakes trade talks between the world's two economic superpowers are so thin that Washington trade advocacy groups have resorted to calling around town to ask whether blocs of rooms have been reserved for the Chinese delegation, which may include Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.

Such time-consuming efforts to glean any information on an expected third round of bilateral talks underscores the widespread uncertainty surrounding efforts to lay the groundwork for a trade deal between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their expected meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of November.

With a January 1 deadline to ratchet up US tariffs to 25% on more than $200 billion in Chinese imports approaching, players in Washington are increasingly desperate for any sign of de-escalation, according to interviews with more than a half a dozen business executives, Wall Street analysts, lobbyists and industry groups, including some with close ties to the Trump administration.

""As any administration doubles down, particularly before a meeting like this, and when there are important issues at stake, everyone in town is trying to find out as much as they can,"" said Wendy Cutler, a managing director for the Asia Society and a former diplomat and negotiator for the Office of the US Trade Representative under President Barack Obama. ""What happened on that phone call? Where's the paper? Do you have the paper? If you can't give me the paper, what's in the paper? And if you can't tell me, can you tell me if this is in or out?""

On Friday, the American President offered a hint over how back-channel communications between the two economic superpowers are progressing, confirming reports that the Chinese had sent a preliminary offer -- which so far remains tightly held.

Trump described it as a "" very complete list "" of 142 concessions on a variety of issues Washington has put to Beijing.

""It's a lot of the things we've asked,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. ""But there are four or five things left off.""

He optimistically added, ""We'll probably get them, too.""

Trump also revived his threat of imposing a third round of tariffs on $267 billion of goods , if necessary, but suggested he probably wouldn't need to take such a step, because ""China would like to make a deal.""

Xi offered a reply in remarks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Papua New Guinea on Saturday , where he spoke of the need for global cooperation and international trade and said there was no issue that countries couldn't work out ""through consultation.""

""History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, will produce no winners,"" Xi said to applause.

But US Vice President Mike Pence, speaking after the Chinese leader, said while they had ""great respect for President Xi"" and China, there would be no backing down on the trade war with Beijing until it ""changes its ways.""

""China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years and those days are over,"" Pence said.

The upcoming Argentina meeting is the only scheduled opportunity for a direct tête-à-tête between Trump and Xi, though the two leaders exchanged direct visits in 2017 -- with Trump welcoming Xi at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with a lavish banquet and a singing performance in Mandarin by his granddaughter Arabella.

But whatever is announced in Buenos Aires will invert the usual progress of trade negotiations, where leaders meet to formalize agreements already hashed out among lower-level aides. In the end, it's likely to amount to a pledge by both presidents to end a tense year of damaging tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two largest trading partners.

""Any reduction in trade tensions would be welcomed, but we see it as a short-term truce,"" Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Barclays Investment Bank wrote in a note to clients.

Casting a long shadow over the on-and-off negotiations between the two countries has been a shortage of trust by Chinese negotiators , who have wrestled with conflicting signals from the Trump administration on its trade policy and who to work with, and grappling with the reality that any deal with Trump isn't real until the President says it himself.

""They are more than a little gun-shy,"" said Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, pointing to two previous failed attempts to broker a trade truce between the two countries.

China's Liu met Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross twice earlier this year, including last May, when Beijing's delegation left the room with the belief the two sides had reached a tentative pact, only to have Trump veto the deal.

""The Chinese thought they had an agreement with a Cabinet member, who was empowered and had authority from the President,"" said Allen. ""They found out, 'No, they didn't.'""

The Trump administration has been divided between free traders -- including those with Wall Street backgrounds like Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow -- and hardliners like US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, a former academic who has publicly broken with his colleagues on the China issue.

Joshua Bolten , president of the Business Roundtable , said that unilaterally imposing tariffs “ will only stifle job creation , reduce the competitiveness of businesses , and increase prices for American families . ”
A group of retail giants including Walmart , Target and Costco in a letter urged Mr. Trump to reconsider .
“ This is not American industries crying wolf , ” said Sandy Kennedy , president of Retail Industries Leaders Association . “ Higher tariffs will mean higher costs to businesses and in turn higher prices for American families .

Critics also warned that Mr. Trump was setting off a trade war with America ’ s biggest trading partner , as well as possibly souring relations with a key ally in Mr. Trump ’ s upcoming nuclear talks with North Korea leader Kim Jong-un .
Mr. Trump has brushed off talk of trade wars in a tweet earlier this month : “ When a country ( USA ) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with , trade wars are good , and easy to win .

trade,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2016/0919/An-interview-with-the-trade-expert-Donald-Trump-cited-20-times,An interview with the trade expert Donald Trump cited 20 times,2016-09-19,Simon Montlake,"Robert Scott is a man of the moment . As director of trade and manufacturing policy research for the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington , Mr. Scott has long sounded alarms against the effects that global trade is having on the American economy . For many years , arguments like his were largely pushed to the side by the leadership of both parties in Washington . Freer trade had become an American gospel , and Scott ’ s Jeremiads were the stuff of backward-looking pro-labor groups , it seemed .
How 2016 has changed the conversation . Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have captured the concerns of many voters in turning against free trade . Even Hillary Clinton has been pushed to take a position against the Pacific trade deal , known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) .
Has the tide been reversed ? That ’ s unclear , but there ’ s no doubt that economists like Scott are getting new attention . Mr. Trump cited his research 20 times in a July speech on manufacturing in Pennsylvania . Did Trump get it right ? “ The simple answer is no , ” Scott wrote in a response . But the openness to a broader re-consideration of how free American trade should be is certainly welcome .
Scott shared his thoughts with the Monitor . His answers have been edited for clarity and brevity .
Q : In the political debate over the benefits of free trade , what aspects are missing or misrepresented ?
There ’ s too much focus on jobs and not enough on wages . I ’ ve done a number of widely cited papers on jobs lost due to NAFTA [ the North American Free Trade Agreement ] , China trade , US-Korea free trade agreement , and with the TPP countries . Add all them , and it comes to the order 4 or 5 or 6 million jobs that have been lost due to growing trade deficits . That ’ s a significant number . But you have to have to put in context of the fact that there are 140 million people working in the United States .
I would like to rebalance trade . I think that ’ s a key issue . But there ’ s a much larger issue at stake and that is that trade redistributes income to a much , much larger number of people . Essentially , it redistributes income from everyone who doesn ’ t have a college degree to those that do , and the population that doesn ’ t have a college degree makes up a little bit less two-thirds of the labor force . It ’ s 100 million people .
My colleague Josh Bivens has estimated that for a median-wage , full-time worker , that cost came to about $ 1,800 per year in 2011 . That ’ s a function , not of the trade deficit per se , but of the competition with imports from low-wage countries . So it ’ s really a function of the volume of low-wage imports as a share of GDP [ gross domestic product ] , and that has been going up steadily .
This is one of the most important and least understood aspects of trade – trade creates a really tiny amount of benefits . Take the TPP . You ’ re talking about benefits of $ 25 [ billion ] to $ 50 billion – anywhere from one-quarter to one half percent of GDP in the year 2030 . It ’ s about six weeks of growth in GDP at the current rate of growth . That ’ s the net of this whole agreement that we ’ ve spent the last five years fighting about . And yet the growth of trade with low-income countries has transferred a massive amount of wealth to multinational companies and the people that own them .
Q : Supporters of free trade say that it has provided net benefits to most , but not all Americans . Are you persuaded by this argument ?
Trade may be good , but the net benefits are tiny compared to the amount of redistribution . Trade has provided net benefits to the country as a whole , but not to most Americans . Most Americans have been on the losing end of the equation ; they ’ re losing $ 1,800 a year . For most Americans , those losses overwhelm any gains from trade . Some say today you can get a T-shirt for $ 20 instead of $ 30 as a net benefit of trade . But income loss experienced by most working Americans is much much larger than any benefits from trade . Frankly , I think most of the benefits of globalization have gone to the top 10 , 5 , and 1 percent of the income distribution . Those are the people who ’ ve seen really enormous income growth over the last few decades . Trade played a big role in that .
Q : What would a more equitable trading relationship with the rest of world look like ? Should it differ between rich and poor trading nations ?
You have to contrast the experience of countries like Germany and Sweden with countries like the US , and to separate out the labor policies and the trade policies .
Let ’ s start with labor policies . Those countries have massive programs to train and assist workers who have been displaced by trade or have lost their job for any reason , not just trade . They spend as much as 4 percent or 5 percent of GDP . The US has an $ 18 trillion economy , so 5 percent of that would be $ 900 billion . If we were really serious about trying to offset some of the damage done by globalization , that ’ s the level of spending we ’ d have to engage in , in terms of increasing unemployment insurance , training , and job creation . We have a trade adjustment assistance program that has never received more than $ 1 billion of funding , and it often runs out of money .
So the first thing we have to do is adopt labor policies that would ensure high and rising living standards for all workers . If you want to engage in more trade , that ’ s the first thing you ’ ve got to do .
The second thing you ’ ve got to do is , we need to rebalance global trade . In the normal economic development model , capital should flow from rich countries like the United States to poor countries like China or Vietnam . And we ’ ve allowed China and other currency manipulators to stand that model on its head for the past 20 years . China has been buying up foreign assets , principally US Treasury bonds , but also stocks and entire companies . In doing that , they have artificially depressed the value of the currency , which becomes a subsidy on everything they send to us , and a tax on everywhere we export , and China has become our No . 1 export competitor . The other countries who pursue similar policies include Japan , Korea , Singapore , Taiwan , Malaysia , but also , interesting enough , Germany has effectively been manipulating its currency as well .
Trade is a good thing . It just needs to be reframed . Part of the problem we have is that we put in the White House this Office of the United States Trade Representative , we give them cabinet status , and we give the license to go out and negotiate trade deals .... What we got in the TPP is an obscene deal that would prop up profits for pharmaceutical makers and people who produce software and movies . The tariff effects are trivial . Thirty chapters in this agreement are about creating greater monopoly rents for specific industries . This kind of model has to be ended . We need a new kind of model . We have to go back and find a model that ’ s going to move us in the direction of raising labor standards and environmental standards , ending the crisis in greenhouse gas emissions .
Q : Automation has contributed to declining employment in manufacturing in the US and other rich industrialized economies . What should policymakers do in response to this structural change ?
Nothing . Automation is good . It has not caused job loss , that ’ s a fallacy . We ’ ve had automation and high levels of productivity growth in manufacturing for decades… . What happened in late 1990s was the Asian financial crisis and the beginning of currency manipulation and then we did the China WTO [ World Trade Organization ] deal , and that really begat the globalization that we ’ ve seen in the last two decades that ’ s decimated manufacturing . It ’ s really trade that has destroyed those jobs , it ’ s not productivity .
Output of manufactured goods has declined in real value-added terms between 2007 and 2015 . The reason is that goods being consumed by US consumers – all the growth is being absorbed by imports . If we rebalance trade , we ’ d have more demand for manufactured goods and productivity and employment would be in balance .
Q : The 2016 election campaign has surfaced antitrade views within both parties . Do you see a new consensus emerging on what sort of trade policy makes sense for the US ?
I think we have work to do . I don ’ t think we have antitrade views , we have opposition to the trade deals that have been negotiated , such as the TPP . They aren ’ t trade deals alone , they are trade and investment deals . Most of what they do is increase the monopoly power of multinational companies to extract excess profits from consumers in the US and other countries .
We haven ’ t worked out policies to appropriately deal with labor market problems . We need labor market policies to sustain workers through periods of unemployment , give them training , give them job creation .
We need trade policies to rebalance trade and new kinds of approaches to trade deals . That kind of thinking is not taking place . I think that ’ s in part because of the breakdown in our political system where action on far-reaching policies is difficult or impossible given the scorched-earth politics that exist between the two parties in Congress .
Q : Donald Trump has cited your research data in his attacks on US trade policy . Where do you differ with him on the proper response to the effects of trade ?
Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy
Trump rails about currency manipulation but his solution is to impose tariffs . Tariffs are not the answer . We need to take other steps like I ’ ve outlined here , like direct intervention in currency markets . He says he ’ s going to hire the best trade negotiators and negotiate the greatest trade deals . The last thing in the world we need is more trade deals . That ’ s not going to fix our trade problem .
I ’ m glad that Trump is talking about trade and its effect on workers . This is not the first time . My work has been cited by presidential candidates and candidates for Congress for both parties… . They cite it [ currency manipulation ] and they never do it . It ’ s important to highlight the issue but I do not agree with what he [ Trump ] proposes to do .","Robert Scott is a man of the moment.

We have a trade adjustment assistance program that has never received more than $1 billion of funding, and it often runs out of money.

So the first thing we have to do is adopt labor policies that would ensure high and rising living standards for all workers. If you want to engage in more trade, that’s the first thing you’ve got to do.

The second thing you’ve got to do is, we need to rebalance global trade. In the normal economic development model, capital should flow from rich countries like the United States to poor countries like China or Vietnam. And we’ve allowed China and other currency manipulators to stand that model on its head for the past 20 years. China has been buying up foreign assets, principally US Treasury bonds, but also stocks and entire companies. In doing that, they have artificially depressed the value of the currency, which becomes a subsidy on everything they send to us, and a tax on everywhere we export, and China has become our No. 1 export competitor. The other countries who pursue similar policies include Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, but also, interesting enough, Germany has effectively been manipulating its currency as well.

Trade is a good thing. It just needs to be reframed. Part of the problem we have is that we put in the White House this Office of the United States Trade Representative, we give them cabinet status, and we give the license to go out and negotiate trade deals.... What we got in the TPP is an obscene deal that would prop up profits for pharmaceutical makers and people who produce software and movies. The tariff effects are trivial. Thirty chapters in this agreement are about creating greater monopoly rents for specific industries. This kind of model has to be ended. We need a new kind of model. We have to go back and find a model that’s going to move us in the direction of raising labor standards and environmental standards, ending the crisis in greenhouse gas emissions.

Q: Automation has contributed to declining employment in manufacturing in the US and other rich industrialized economies. What should policymakers do in response to this structural change?

Nothing. Automation is good. It has not caused job loss, that’s a fallacy. We’ve had automation and high levels of productivity growth in manufacturing for decades…. What happened in late 1990s was the Asian financial crisis and the beginning of currency manipulation and then we did the China WTO [World Trade Organization] deal, and that really begat the globalization that we’ve seen in the last two decades that’s decimated manufacturing. It’s really trade that has destroyed those jobs, it’s not productivity.

Output of manufactured goods has declined in real value-added terms between 2007 and 2015. The reason is that goods being consumed by US consumers – all the growth is being absorbed by imports. If we rebalance trade, we’d have more demand for manufactured goods and productivity and employment would be in balance.

Q: The 2016 election campaign has surfaced antitrade views within both parties. Do you see a new consensus emerging on what sort of trade policy makes sense for the US?

I think we have work to do. I don’t think we have antitrade views, we have opposition to the trade deals that have been negotiated, such as the TPP. They aren’t trade deals alone, they are trade and investment deals. Most of what they do is increase the monopoly power of multinational companies to extract excess profits from consumers in the US and other countries.

We haven’t worked out policies to appropriately deal with labor market problems. We need labor market policies to sustain workers through periods of unemployment, give them training, give them job creation.

We need trade policies to rebalance trade and new kinds of approaches to trade deals. That kind of thinking is not taking place. I think that’s in part because of the breakdown in our political system where action on far-reaching policies is difficult or impossible given the scorched-earth politics that exist between the two parties in Congress.

Q: Donald Trump has cited your research data in his attacks on US trade policy. Where do you differ with him on the proper response to the effects of trade?

Trump rails about currency manipulation but his solution is to impose tariffs. Tariffs are not the answer. We need to take other steps like I’ve outlined here, like direct intervention in currency markets. He says he’s going to hire the best trade negotiators and negotiate the greatest trade deals. The last thing in the world we need is more trade deals. That’s not going to fix our trade problem.

I’m glad that Trump is talking about trade and its effect on workers. This is not the first time. My work has been cited by presidential candidates and candidates for Congress for both parties…. They cite it [currency manipulation] and they never do it. It’s important to highlight the issue but I do not agree with what he [Trump] proposes to do.",www.csmonitor.com,center,mOSL5HdAqk0W7wJ0

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - U.S. sanctions on China over Hong Kong would ratchet up tensions between the two superpowers, but with no obvious goal beyond punishment. President Donald Trump on Friday says he would take steps to slap penalties on officials of the People’s Republic. The first move of its kind would escalate tensions, yet it probably won’t deter Beijing and could spur retaliation.

But White House press secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged that the administration hasn ’ t yet found a solution to persuading U.S. lawmakers to grant trade-promotion authority to Mr. Obama .
“ I don ’ t have one to announce now , ” he said . “ This is something that ’ s under a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill . ”
Even as administration officials were trying to work through the policy differences with their own party , however , the White House also was grappling with renewed criticism about Mr. Obama bungling his personal outreach effort with an approach perceived by some as condescending and even sexist .

Rep. Joe Courtney , Connecticut Democrat , said the administration has been downplaying lawmakers ’ concerns for years about including an enforceable provision against currency manipulation in the TPP .
“ A huge bipartisan collection of members have been sending up smoke signals for years , going back to 2013 , ” Mr. Courtney said . “ To not have an agreement that has enforceable provisions on that issue , it ’ s almost political malpractice for members of Congress to just sort of look the other way . All of us would have preferred that the administration heeded the early input that all of us were giving on this issue and brought this to the table . ”

Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican who supports the deal , has said the White House needs to provide about 50 votes from the 188 Democratic House lawmakers to help pass the measure . More than 150 House Democrats last year came out in opposition to the deal , and Mrs. DeLauro recited the names of a handful of other Democratic lawmakers who have recently announced their opposition , including Reps.

Analysts say that if Congress were allowed to amend deals , it would make it impossible to negotiate with foreign governments .
But the Senate test vote brought to light the breathtaking spectacle of Democratic lawmakers complaining that the president of their own party was trying to grab too much power .
“ We have seen too much power ceded from Congress to the executive branch at the expense of the United States , particularly in foreign matters , ” said Rep.

Even as the White House was trying to patch up relations with Democratic lawmakers , Mr . Earnest tossed more criticism at Mrs. Warren by saying her claims that the pact is being negotiated in secret “ are just not true . ”
“ If people do want to raise a substantive objection to pursuing this strategy , then they should stick to the facts , ” Mr . Earnest said . We ’ re interested in a substantive debate . But we don ’ t have to say things that aren ’ t true in order to have this debate . ”
“ This is the debate that we want to have , because this is the substance of the debate , ” he said . “ We are well aware that there are people in both parties that have raised concerns about Nike ’ s previous practices in terms of doing business overseas .

The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday fired the latest salvo in the U.S. government ’ s increasing scrutiny of Big Tech , asking the country ’ s five largest tech companies by market cap to provide information about acquisitions over the past decade — it is the first time Microsoft Corp MSFT , -1.12 % has been included in the current round of investigations . That adds to other inquiries already underway by the FTC , the Justice Department and Congress into potential anticompetitive actions made by Alphabet Inc. GOOGL , -0.01 % GOOG , +0.06 % , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN , +0.28 % , Apple Inc. AAPL , +1.15 % and Facebook Inc. FB , +0.84 % .
All but Apple admitted in their most recent annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission that they are being investigated or are at least at risk of regulatory action . Apple made no mention of regulatory or antitrust risks , even after an app maker ’ s chief executive told Reuters he was interviewed in November about the company ’ s interactions with Apple .
For more : The antitrust suspects — Apple and Facebook appear to be most at risk
Alphabet , for example , acknowledged : “ We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in public policies governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business , For instance , various regulatory agencies , including competition , consumer protection , and privacy authorities , are reviewing aspects of our products and services . We continue to cooperate with these investigations . ”
Those admissions have done nothing to slow the companies ’ outsize influence on markets nor their ability to rack up huge profits and revenues , however . In a still-young 2020 , Google parent Alphabet and Amazon have joined Apple and Microsoft in the trillion-dollar market-cap club for the first time .

The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday fired the latest salvo in the U.S. government’s increasing scrutiny of Big Tech, asking the country’s five largest tech companies by market cap to provide information about acquisitions over the past decade — it is the first time Microsoft Corp MSFT, -1.12% has been included in the current round of investigations. That adds to other inquiries already underway by the FTC, the Justice Department and Congress into potential anticompetitive actions made by Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.01% GOOG, +0.06% , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.28% , Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.15% and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.84% .

All but Apple admitted in their most recent annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission that they are being investigated or are at least at risk of regulatory action. Apple made no mention of regulatory or antitrust risks, even after an app maker’s chief executive told Reuters he was interviewed in November about the company’s interactions with Apple.

Alphabet, for example, acknowledged: “We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in public policies governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business, For instance, various regulatory agencies, including competition, consumer protection, and privacy authorities, are reviewing aspects of our products and services. We continue to cooperate with these investigations.”

Those admissions have done nothing to slow the companies’ outsize influence on markets nor their ability to rack up huge profits and revenues, however. In a still-young 2020, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon have joined Apple and Microsoft in the trillion-dollar market-cap club for the first time.

trade,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/white-houses-secret-weapon-on-trade-nancy-pelosi-118565.html?hp=t1_r,White House’s secret weapon on trade: Nancy Pelosi  ,2015-06-03,"Lauren French, Edward-Isaac Dovere","Administration officials have been so impressed by Nancy Pelosi ’ s approach to negotiations over giving President Barack Obama “ fast-track ” trade authority that they ’ ve started to consider a crazy possibility : She could even vote for it herself .
As the liberal leader of a progressive caucus , the House minority leader doesn ’ t really like fast track , which means Congress couldn ’ t amend the terms of Obama ’ s Pacific trade deal . She voted against it when it came up in 2002 . She has serious policy concerns about both Trade Promotion Authority , as it ’ s known , and the treaty called the Trans-Pacific Partnership .
That ’ s put her in a tight spot . She doesn ’ t want her president to be embarrassed by failing to get an authority granted to his predecessors . But congressional sources close to Pelosi say she ’ s peeved that her members are being asked to take such a tough vote on trade when Republicans — the party that has historically carried trade votes — have one of their biggest majorities in history .
Members are left trying to read between the lines of what she ’ s said in public and private , that she ’ s trying to find a path to yes but is full of frustrations about the process and the terms .
In the Senate , Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) voted no and washed his hands of the effort , except for suggesting an idea that would have upended the timing . Pelosi ’ s approach has been the opposite : Obama aides say they don ’ t know how Pelosi will vote in the end , but they gush about how hands-on she ’ s been , how accommodating she ’ s been in letting them make their case , how critical she ’ s been in saying nothing about her position to give her fellow Democrats cover to get to yes .
“ I applaud the leader for creating enough space to really evaluate this legislation , ” said Rep. Ami Bera ( D-Calif. ) , who announced his support for TPA last month and has become the anti-TPA effort ’ s top target to scare others into voting no . “ She ’ s done a good job creating that space . ”
There ’ s the noise about the TPA vote : two dozen publicly undecided Democrats , labor unions threatening Bera and other Democratic yes votes , Obama going around in person and on television to rally support . Then there ’ s the reality : If fast track is going to pass the House , Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) is going to need to keep Republican defections limited to about 50 , Democrats are going to have to make up the rest of the majority and it will pass with the bare minimum of votes .
The White House hopes Pelosi ’ s going to put her thumb on the backs of however many necks she needs , forcing yes votes among the more reluctant but safe members , letting the more endangered members off the hook , finding votes and trading votes until she gets to the 24 , or 25 , or 26 that she needs .
She did it with Obamacare . She ’ s done it at other key moments when Obama ’ s agenda ’ s been on the line . Now the White House is counting on her to do it again .
“ If this is going to pass , Pelosi wants to minimize member impact and not have any single member walk the plank so that a House Republican doesn ’ t have to , ” said one person close to the minority leader .
“ She is caught between a caucus that naturally gravitates toward no and the White House , and loyalty to a White House that is expecting her to get to yes . Her position is that she wants to get to yes and she is talking about this almost on a daily basis , ” said a senior House Democrat . “ She is going to figure it out when we are in the last two minutes where she will be . ”
It ’ s more than just not saying anything . Pelosi pushed the White House to arrange member briefings with Cabinet officials to make their case on TPA and TPP , accommodating with scheduling to the point of almost being too accommodating , making sure that they keep showing up even as their calendars begin to fill with other things . They ’ ve done sessions on currency manipulation , labor protections , Investor State Dispute Settlement , agriculture and food safety and environment , and are now moving on to TPP partner country-specific briefings , with one about Mexico scheduled for Thursday .
Pelosi attends them all . She ’ s also taken to keeping them in line , urging adamant colleagues who start interrupting the presentations to listen and take their seats . People know that you ’ re opposed , Pelosi will tell people like very vocal anti-TPA Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D-Conn. ) , but others are there to learn , she says , so respect that and let them speak .
“ She was a calming influence , keeping it from erupting into a scene , ” said one person who ’ s been in the room .
“ Whether you are for or against TPA , members have been deeply appreciative of the space she has created within the caucus to have a respectful debate and try to at least stipulate to the same set of facts , ” the person close to Pelosi said .
Though he ’ s never much interested in the details of legislative strategy , Obama has been talking trade with Pelosi regularly for months , including pulling her into the Oval Office for an update on the whip count after a bill-signing ceremony in the Rose Garden and over a lunch they had in his private dining room in the West Wing .
She gets a call on her cellphone nearly everyday from White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on a number of issues . “ It ’ s telling that she has already been on record saying she thinks we need to find a pathway to yes on trade promotion authority , ” said Lynda Tran , a partner at 270 Strategies , which is advising the pro-TPA Progressive Coalition for American Jobs . “ We expect her voice will continue to have a significant impact on the discussion around trade both publicly and privately . ”
With the vote coming up , things started coming to a head Tuesday as members returned from a recess week for their caucus meeting ; trade was the chief topic of discussion , according to multiple sources in the room . Pelosi gave them time to debate . Each side got five minutes to make their case , but DeLauro and fellow anti-TPA leaders Reps.

As the House came back into town this week , Obama called her for an update .","Administration officials have been so impressed by Nancy Pelosi’s approach to negotiations over giving President Barack Obama “fast-track” trade authority that they’ve started to consider a crazy possibility: She could even vote for it herself.

But only if she has to.

Story Continued Below

As the liberal leader of a progressive caucus, the House minority leader doesn’t really like fast track, which means Congress couldn’t amend the terms of Obama’s Pacific trade deal. She voted against it when it came up in 2002. She has serious policy concerns about both Trade Promotion Authority, as it’s known, and the treaty called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

That’s put her in a tight spot. She doesn’t want her president to be embarrassed by failing to get an authority granted to his predecessors. But congressional sources close to Pelosi say she’s peeved that her members are being asked to take such a tough vote on trade when Republicans — the party that has historically carried trade votes — have one of their biggest majorities in history.

Members are left trying to read between the lines of what she’s said in public and private, that she’s trying to find a path to yes but is full of frustrations about the process and the terms.

In the Senate, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) voted no and washed his hands of the effort, except for suggesting an idea that would have upended the timing. Pelosi’s approach has been the opposite: Obama aides say they don’t know how Pelosi will vote in the end, but they gush about how hands-on she’s been, how accommodating she’s been in letting them make their case, how critical she’s been in saying nothing about her position to give her fellow Democrats cover to get to yes.

“I applaud the leader for creating enough space to really evaluate this legislation,” said Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.), who announced his support for TPA last month and has become the anti-TPA effort’s top target to scare others into voting no. “She’s done a good job creating that space.”

There’s the noise about the TPA vote: two dozen publicly undecided Democrats, labor unions threatening Bera and other Democratic yes votes, Obama going around in person and on television to rally support. Then there’s the reality: If fast track is going to pass the House, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is going to need to keep Republican defections limited to about 50, Democrats are going to have to make up the rest of the majority and it will pass with the bare minimum of votes.

The White House hopes Pelosi’s going to put her thumb on the backs of however many necks she needs, forcing yes votes among the more reluctant but safe members, letting the more endangered members off the hook, finding votes and trading votes until she gets to the 24, or 25, or 26 that she needs.

She did it with Obamacare. She’s done it at other key moments when Obama’s agenda’s been on the line. Now the White House is counting on her to do it again.

“If this is going to pass, Pelosi wants to minimize member impact and not have any single member walk the plank so that a House Republican doesn’t have to,” said one person close to the minority leader.

Don’t expect the suspense to end soon.

“She is caught between a caucus that naturally gravitates toward no and the White House, and loyalty to a White House that is expecting her to get to yes. Her position is that she wants to get to yes and she is talking about this almost on a daily basis,” said a senior House Democrat. “She is going to figure it out when we are in the last two minutes where she will be.”

It’s more than just not saying anything. Pelosi pushed the White House to arrange member briefings with Cabinet officials to make their case on TPA and TPP, accommodating with scheduling to the point of almost being too accommodating, making sure that they keep showing up even as their calendars begin to fill with other things. They’ve done sessions on currency manipulation, labor protections, Investor State Dispute Settlement, agriculture and food safety and environment, and are now moving on to TPP partner country-specific briefings, with one about Mexico scheduled for Thursday.

Pelosi attends them all. She’s also taken to keeping them in line, urging adamant colleagues who start interrupting the presentations to listen and take their seats. People know that you’re opposed, Pelosi will tell people like very vocal anti-TPA Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), but others are there to learn, she says, so respect that and let them speak.

“She was a calming influence, keeping it from erupting into a scene,” said one person who’s been in the room.

“Whether you are for or against TPA, members have been deeply appreciative of the space she has created within the caucus to have a respectful debate and try to at least stipulate to the same set of facts,” the person close to Pelosi said.

Though he’s never much interested in the details of legislative strategy, Obama has been talking trade with Pelosi regularly for months, including pulling her into the Oval Office for an update on the whip count after a bill-signing ceremony in the Rose Garden and over a lunch they had in his private dining room in the West Wing.

She gets a call on her cellphone nearly everyday from White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on a number of issues. “It’s telling that she has already been on record saying she thinks we need to find a pathway to yes on trade promotion authority,” said Lynda Tran, a partner at 270 Strategies, which is advising the pro-TPA Progressive Coalition for American Jobs. “We expect her voice will continue to have a significant impact on the discussion around trade both publicly and privately.”

With the vote coming up, things started coming to a head Tuesday as members returned from a recess week for their caucus meeting; trade was the chief topic of discussion, according to multiple sources in the room. Pelosi gave them time to debate. Each side got five minutes to make their case, but DeLauro and fellow anti-TPA leaders Reps. Sander Levin (D-Mich.) and Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) blew through that. Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), head of the New Democrat Coalition and a leader of the yes votes, meanwhile, stood to thank Pelosi for the briefings.

After the meeting, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) — who’s still officially undecided himself — called on Democrats and their allies to stop attacking the people who’ve come out in support of TPA.

Most of the actual whip counting among undecided Democrats has remained with the White House legislative affairs office, where former Pelosi aide Amy Rosenbaum is now the acting director. They’re staying in touch with Republicans, keeping updated on how many no votes they’re going to have to make up for on that side — though every Boehner whip count is taken with a mound of salt in a West Wing that’s gotten used to him falling short of predictions.

Sources close to Pelosi say she’s very concerned about political consequences for members who vote yes, and she will keep that number as small as possible, given how much she knows labor will try to make life difficult for those who do vote yes.

Pelosi’s purposefully keeping members quiet to see where Republicans end up. There is no use, she’s told people, for Democrats to say yes or no when they don’t yet know if Republicans will be able to pass it or face a massive mutiny.

As for Pelosi, her allies say she’ll probably be a no vote in the end given her policy objections, but she’ll find other safe Democratic members to press into support if the margin is small enough. Liberals and labor unions are confident she will be a no.

Some in the administration have gotten confident that they’ll have enough votes to squeak by. Others remain very skeptical, worried that for all the months of planning and efforts, there won’t be enough Republicans or Democrats to even get them close.

Welcome to December 1985.

The president in question was Ronald Reagan. The issue was tax reform, and the lawmaker complaining about White House aloofness was Charles Grassley (R) of Iowa. For months, as Reagan worked with the Democratic majority to overhaul the tax code, House Republicans felt a growing sense that he was cutting them out of the process and giving too much to the other side. GOP leaders made common cause with a group of Democrats who disliked the bill and hatched a plan to defeat the procedural rule for considering it. After the plan worked, Reagan needed to switch dozens of GOP votes to get the bill back on track.

The measure soon passed the House and, after some gyrations in the Senate, became law in 1986.

The story suggests that President Obama still could recover from his recent trade defeat. Nevertheless, his situation differs from Reagan’s in several ways that do not work to his advantage.

In December 1985, Reagan was still popular, with Gallup putting his approval rating at 63 percent. President Obama’s approval has been about 20 points lower. Even pro-Obama Democrats still feel disappointment.

“Russia should return to the G-8,” he tweeted on Friday. “It is in everyone’s interest.”

Signaling the birth of a new international bromance, Trump called Conte “a really great guy” in a Saturday tweet.

“He will be honored in Washington, at the White House, shortly. He will do a great job – the people of Italy got it right!” he posted.

Despite the obvious tensions, Trump spoke in glowing terms of his personal relationships with the G7’s heads of state.

“I would say that the level of relationship is a 10,” he boasted. “We have a great relationship – Angela and Emmanuel and Justin,” referring to the leaders of Germany, France and Canada by their first names.

“That doesn’t mean I agree with what they’re doing. And they know very well that I don’t,” he said. “So we’re negotiating – very hard – tariffs and barriers.”

“It is obvious that we will have in the coming weeks, the next months, to continue to work,” French President Emmanuel Macron tactfully said after Trump’s departure.

All seven leaders signed on to the meeting’s traditional closing statement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Saturday, despite widespread speculation that Trump would refuse to join.",www.nypost.com,right,k05xArtsgcmbTXPn

Since April , duties the U.S. has levied on goods from China , Mexico , Canada and the European Union have sparked retaliatory tariffs and trade threats , targeting American farm goods from pork to cheese to apples .
Disquiet among farmers grew in June as crop prices fell thanks to benevolent U.S. weather and additional duties expected from China on products like soybeans , for which it is the U.S. ’ s top customer . The total value of this year ’ s U.S. corn , soybean and wheat crops dropped about $ 13 billion , or 10 % , in June , said Chris Hurt , an agricultural economist at Purdue University . On Monday , U.S. soybean prices continued their downward spiral , heading toward the lowest level in a decade .
The planned tariffs on U.S. soybean exports come as farmers nationwide have boosted plantings of the crop , betting on the oilseeds to deliver stronger returns than corn during a yearslong slump in the farm economy .
For farmers like Mr. Smith , who grows corn and soybeans on 1,500 acres in Cotton Plant , Ark. , the 16 % decline in soybean prices alone translates into a nearly $ 100 per-acre drop in the value of his crop . “ That ’ s $ 100,000 that has disappeared into thin air , ” he said . “ We were already in the red , and now it ’ s even worse . ”

Researchers at the University of Illinois and Ohio State University estimate that over four years , a 25 % tariff on U.S. soybean imports by Beijing would result in an average 87 % decline in income for a midsize Illinois grain farm . The loss would pressure farmland prices , they say , prompting a more than $ 500,000 decline in the farm ’ s net worth by 2021 .
Farmers for Free Trade , an advocacy group , recently rolled out its third advertisement warning about the harmful consequences of trade fights for farmers . U.S. farm and agribusiness groups in June joined manufacturing , retail and technology organizations imploring Congress to step up oversight of the president ’ s actions .
Still , many farmers say they support the Trump administration ’ s trade goals of modernizing Nafta , shrinking the U.S. trade deficit and combating what they see as unfair trade practices by China . They view the president ’ s approach as a negotiating tactic and hope it will bear fruit by fall , when farmers will harvest their crops . Some are prepared to sacrifice financially if the U.S. economy benefits in the long run .

Tariffs ‘might sting us,’ said Nick Schweitzer, an apple grower in Michigan. Photo: Jesse Newman/The Wall Street Journal

Dairy farmers have been banking on sales abroad to help absorb increasing milk supplies that have pushed down prices. Tariffs imposed on U.S. cheese exports by Mexico, the largest buyer of U.S. dairy products, add insult to injury, they say.

Brian Preston, a dairy farmer who milks 800 cows in Quincy, Mich., said trade uncertainty helped prompt a decision to postpone a $2.5 million expansion project on his farm.

Amid Michigan’s rolling hills, Nick Schweitzer, an apple grower, said recent duties levied on U.S. apple exports by China and Mexico could create an oversupply of the fruit on the U.S. market this fall, increasing competition for growers. To produce the largest, highest-quality fruit possible, he is applying more fertilizer and hand-thinning smaller apples, called “fruitlets,” from his trees. Tariffs “might sting us,” said Mr. Schweitzer.

Arkansas’ Mr. Smith said he embraces the Trump administration’s efforts to remove regulatory burdens for farmers. “But if I’m a bag check at Walmart next year, it’s not going to mean a whole lot,” he said.

Trade pressure on farmers has helped fuel the latest talks between U.S. and China aimed at lifting tariffs on soybeans, hogs and more. Here, an American farmer and a steelworker explain how tariffs are impacting their livelihoods.

Trump ’ s unexpected announcement was a stunning reversal , given Washington ’ s tough stance on Chinese trade practices that have put the world ’ s two largest economies on course for a possible trade war .
Sources briefed on the matter said Beijing had demanded the ZTE issue be resolved as a prerequisite for broader trade negotiations .
“ Too many jobs in China lost . Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done ! ” Trump wrote on Twitter , saying he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were working together on a solution for ZTE .
The U.S. Commerce Department last month banned American companies from selling to the firm for seven years as punishment for ZTE breaking a 2017 agreement after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran and North Korea , an investigation dating to the Obama administration .
The penalty cut off ZTE ’ s access to key components such as semiconductors , prompting China ’ s second-largest maker of telecommunications equipment to say last week that it had suspended its main operations .
During trade talks in Beijing earlier this month , Chinese Vice Premier Liu He told U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that China would not continue talks on broader bilateral trade disputes unless Washington agreed to ease the crushing sanctions on ZTE , two people briefed on those meetings said .
“ The message was , ‘ we have to deal with ZTE before we continue talks ’ , ” one of the people said .
Both sources , who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter , said China was willing in principle to import more U.S. agriculture products in return for Washington smoothing out penalties against ZTE , but they did not offer details .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regularly scheduled news briefing on Monday that China “ greatly appreciates the positive U.S. position on the ZTE issue ” .
He said that Liu would travel to Washington from Tuesday to Saturday to continue trade talks .

Trump expects Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross “ to exercise his independent judgment , consistent with applicable laws and regulations , to resolve the regulatory action involving ZTE based on its facts , ” Walters said .
Washington and Beijing have proposed tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks , fanning worries of a full-blown trade war that could hurt global supply chains and dent business investment plans .
In a second tweet on Sunday , Trump said past U.S. trade talks with China posed a hurdle that he predicted the two countries would overcome .
“ China and the United States are working well together on trade , but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China , for so many years , that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries , ” Trump wrote on Twitter .
“ But be cool , it will all work out ! ” he added .
Shortly after Trump ’ s tweet , a Democratic lawmaker , Representative Adam Schiff , on Twitter questioned the move to help the Chinese company , given numerous warnings about ZTE ’ s alleged threat to U.S. national security .
“ Our intelligence agencies have warned that ZTE technology and phones pose a major cyber security threat , ” Schiff said . “ You should care more about our national security than Chinese jobs . ”
It was not clear China would accept Trump ’ s assertion that Beijing needs to work toward a mutually beneficial outcome .
“ The U.S. should be aware that it must become more cooperative and constructive in the trade talks with China , ” the China Daily , China ’ s official English-language newspaper , said in a Monday editorial . The editorial did not mention ZTE .
Trump ’ s comments on ZTE could have a significant impact on shares of American optical components makers such as Acacia Communications Inc and Oclaro Inc , which fell when U.S. companies were banned from exporting goods to ZTE .
ZTE paid over $ 2.3 billion to 211 U.S. exporters in 2017 , a senior ZTE official said on Friday .

“But be cool, it will all work out!” he added.

Shortly after Trump’s tweet, a Democratic lawmaker, Representative Adam Schiff, on Twitter questioned the move to help the Chinese company, given numerous warnings about ZTE’s alleged threat to U.S. national security.

“Our intelligence agencies have warned that ZTE technology and phones pose a major cyber security threat,” Schiff said. “You should care more about our national security than Chinese jobs.”

SHOCKING BLOW

It was not clear China would accept Trump’s assertion that Beijing needs to work toward a mutually beneficial outcome.

“The U.S. should be aware that it must become more cooperative and constructive in the trade talks with China,” the China Daily, China’s official English-language newspaper, said in a Monday editorial. The editorial did not mention ZTE.

Trump’s comments on ZTE could have a significant impact on shares of American optical components makers such as Acacia Communications Inc and Oclaro Inc, which fell when U.S. companies were banned from exporting goods to ZTE.

ZTE paid over $2.3 billion to 211 U.S. exporters in 2017, a senior ZTE official said on Friday.

The U.S. government launched an investigation into ZTE after Reuters reported in 2012 the company had signed contracts to ship hardware and software worth millions of dollars to Iran from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies. (Reuters report that exposed the practice.

ZTE relies on U.S. companies such as Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google. American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of components in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks.

Claire Reade, a Washington-based trade lawyer and former assistant U.S. Trade Representative for China affairs, said the ZTE ban may have caused more alarm in Beijing than Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods.

“Imagine how the United States would feel if China had the power to crush one of our major corporations and make it go out of business,” Reade said.",www.reuters.com,center,qqsNULRxGO6D6MUR

WASHINGTON (AP) — In escalating his trade war, President Donald Trump is persisting in his deceptive argument that tariffs are a pure win for the U.S. and a loss for China. He will not acknowledge that the costs of tariffs are being borne by Americans.

Trump has vowed to impose a blanket tariff of 25% on everything Americans buy from China. That would mean raising tariffs from 10% on $200 billion worth of goods by the end of the week and hitting an additional $325 billion in Chinese products with the same penalty “shortly.” His skewed explanation of how tariffs work — a staple of his rhetoric — unfolded over Twitter, where he also spread a false assertion about hurricane aid to Puerto Rico.

TRUMP: “For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results.” — tweet Sunday.

THE FACTS: This notion of a transfer of wealth from China to the U.S. isn’t happening.

The burden of Trump’s tariffs on imports from China and other countries falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imports, says a study in March by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University and Princeton University. By the end of last year, the study found, the public and U.S. companies were paying $3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing $1.4 billion a month in lost efficiency.

Money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury, but it’s mostly — if not entirely — coming from U.S. businesses and consumers, not China, and it’s not a driver of economic growth but rather a risk to it. That’s why the stock market dropped Monday.

A coalition of U.S. trade organizations representing retail businesses, tech, manufacturing and agriculture sharply disputed Trump’s statement. “For 10 months, Americans have been paying the full cost of the trade war, not China,” it said. “To be clear, tariffs are taxes that Americans pay, and this sudden increase with little notice will only punish U.S farmers, businesses and consumers.”

Trump invariably describes the U.S. trade deficit as money “lost” to other countries, an equation that ignores the value to Americans of what they’ve bought. “We’ve lost so much money with China,” he told an audience in March. “We lose with everybody, almost.” People are no more losing money than when they buy groceries — rather they’re spending it and getting food.

He’s now making the converse case that a tax on imports, paid by Americans, somehow enriches them.

TRUMP: “Puerto Rico has been given more money by Congress for Hurricane Disaster Relief, 91 Billion Dollars, than any State in the history of the U.S.” — tweet Monday.

THE FACTS: That’s not true. The money that Congress has allocated to Puerto Rico for hurricane relief so far is nowhere close to $91 billion.

According to the White House, Trump’s $91 billion estimate includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades, along with $41 billion already approved. Actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed more slowly from federal coffers, about $11 billion so far.

The expected $50 billion in additional money is speculative. It is based on Puerto Rico’s eligibility for federal emergency disaster funds for years ahead, involving calamities that haven’t happened.

That money would require future appropriations by Congress.

The White House’s $91 billion figure for Puerto Rico, even if correct, would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost the U.S government more than $120 billion — the bulk of it going to Louisiana.

Trump has appointed Lighthizer, who just completed a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and is one of the administration’s most vocal China critics, to oversee the new round of talks, officials said.

Kudlow said the meeting was not meant to focus on potential tariffs, though Trump still had that option in his “quiver,” and the automakers would be encouraged to build engines in the United States.

On Sunday, Trump tweeted that China had agreed to cut import levies on American-made cars.

Chinese regulators did not respond to requests for comment on the tweet. Neither country mentioned auto tariffs in their official briefings of the meeting on Saturday.

The US has warned that there is ""more to come"" on trade tariffs.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin - the first of the US delegation to arrive in Davos - said President Donald Trump was ""determined to deal"" with what he sees as unfair foreign competition.

His warning comes after the US imposed steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels.

The tariffs, of up to 50%, prompted an outcry from China and South Korea, the primary targets of the measure.

Mr Mnuchin said the trade actions had been prompted by ""inappropriate behaviours"" by their trading counterparts.

US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross - speaking alongside Mr Mnuchin - denied the move was protectionist, saying it was simply trying to put a stop to trade violations.

""I don't think adhering to rules is protectionism,"" he said.

President Trump has already brushed off concerns that the new US tariffs will lead to a trade war.

But Mr Ross said the US was already in a trade war with ""parties violating the rules and trying to take advantage"".

""There's been a trade war in place for quite a while. The difference is, US troops are now coming to the ramparts,"" he added.

The warning comes just a day after confirmation that an Asia-Pacific trade pact that US President Donald Trump ditched last year is expected to be signed in March.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is one of the world's largest trade agreements, but Mr Mnuchin denied the US was no longer interested in trade deals.

""We are fans of bilateral trading agreements - we absolutely believe in free and fair trade and anyone who wants to do trade with us on a reciprocal basis is welcome to do so,"" he said.

Mr Mnuchin and Mr Ross are the first of the US delegation to arrive at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

On Thursday, President Trump is due to arrive alongside 10 members of the US cabinet as well as senior White House staff.

It's the largest US delegation to attend the annual gathering in the small Swiss mountain town.

Their decision to attend has surprised many, because the conference promoting globalisation and co-operation seems the very antithesis of President Trump's ""America First"" worldview.

But Mr Mnuchin said it was important to communicate with their counterparts.

This effort to expand the president 's power should make the White House happy , since Trump is eager to see his trade efforts bear fruit . We 'll likely hear about that during his State of the Union address . But this bill will also move our nation back to the days of the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 .
It 's a fact that some countries impose higher duties on imports from America than the United States imposes on similar products it imports . For example , the European Union imposes a 10 percent tariff on imported American cars , while we charge only a 2.5 percent duty on European car imports . According to congressman Duffy and President Trump , as long such differences in rates persist , we really wo n't or ca n't have free trade .
Their solution is legislation that would give the president power to raise tariffs on American imports to levels that foreign governments impose on American exports . Such legislation is believed to kill two birds with one stone .
First , it would allegedly rectify the supposed `` unfairness '' by equalizing duties . Second , it would force foreign governments to lower their tariffs , making trade freer for everyone 's benefit . Talking to Fox News recently , Rep. Duffy declared that his strategy will guaranty a speedy resolution and lower tariffs , since no country can afford to not to trade the United States .
These arguments are the same ones the Trump administration served up a year ago when it started a trade dispute with our closest allies by unilaterally raising steel and aluminum duties . That dispute evolved into a trade war with China . Not to worry ; the administration claims that trade wars are easy to win , and that no countries will dare to retaliate ( against our metal tariffs ) because , as Duffy echoed , they ca n't afford to cut themselves off from our huge market .
Wrong . Pretty much all countries have retaliated against Trump 's tariffs . So far , nobody has caved .
Moreover , while Rep. Duffy claims he is `` a free trader , '' apparently he does n't understand that the economic case for free trade is fundamentally unilateral . A country gains by lowering its tariffs regardless of what other countries do . Yes , it would be great if all duties around the world were cut to zero . However , the United States would still benefit from lowering its tariffs to zero , independent of other countries ' trade policies .
That 's because U.S. tariffs are taxes , the burden of which is hung like a millstone around the necks of American consumers . Similarly , foreign tariffs on U.S. exports fall heavily on foreign consumers . As such , it defies logic for an American president to punish American consumers in order to prompt other governments to be kinder to consumers in their jurisdictions by ultimately lowering tariffs .
Finally , according to a detailed paper by my colleague Dan Griswold appropriately called `` Mirror , Mirror , on the Wall , '' it seems like Rep. Duffy and administration officials are n't really sure what a reciprocal system of tariffs should actually look like .
For example , matching higher foreign tariffs line for line would be a very daunting task in our post-war global trading system , which rests on a simple principle : While World Trade Organization countries can set duties as they please , they must apply the same rates on the same item no matter where it comes from . This requirement means that no member can unilaterally raise a duty on given items coming from one country alone . If they do , retaliations and litigations will jeopardize a system that has done so much to free trade over decades .
Rep. Duffy and the president may have to face taxpayers ' wrath when they realize that they 're the reason why the price of thousands of the goods they consume has gone up and their standard of living has gone down .
Focusing on our 11 largest trading partners , Griswold also shows that a reciprocity plan would require raising more than 25,000 duties on `` $ 583 billion in imports to the United States , raising the duties on 45 percent of imports from the affected trading partners . ''

Bob Best enthusiastically supports President Trump 's tough policies against China and other countries .
`` I 'm not a big tariff guy . I 'm a free trade guy , '' says Best , who manages a heating and air conditioning company in Kennesaw , Ga .
`` But sometimes when the bully just does n't listen , you 've got to punch him in the mouth . And that 's what he 's doing . ''
Best supports the president 's actions even though they affect him directly . The price of the heating and air conditioning units that his company sells went up by as much as $ 150 apiece after the cost of building them went up because Trump placed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last year . He had to pass the increase on to his customers .
Trump will have to appeal to Americans ' national pride , and even their patriotism , to succeed in leveling the playing field with China . That 's because virtually every American is likely to feel an impact if Trump 's tariffs go forward on just about everything imported from China .

Bob Best enthusiastically supports President Trump's tough policies against China and other countries.

""I'm not a big tariff guy. I'm a free trade guy,"" says Best, who manages a heating and air conditioning company in Kennesaw, Ga.

""But sometimes when the bully just doesn't listen, you've got to punch him in the mouth. And that's what he's doing.""

Best supports the president's actions even though they affect him directly. The price of the heating and air conditioning units that his company sells went up by as much as $150 apiece after the cost of building them went up because Trump placed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last year. He had to pass the increase on to his customers.

Trump will have to appeal to Americans' national pride, and even their patriotism, to succeed in leveling the playing field with China. That's because virtually every American is likely to feel an impact if Trump's tariffs go forward on just about everything imported from China. He will have to persuade Americans that what's at stake transcends their own interests.

Americans may not like paying higher prices on imported products, but they are more likely to tolerate them if they perceive that American values are at stake, says Henry Olsen, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

""I think you have an element of patriotism,"" Olsen says. ""People recognize that the Chinese government is not a free government, it's not a democratic government, and that it's increasingly becoming a threat to us and the other countries that do believe in those things.""

That 's what makes Pietra Rivoli 's 2005 book The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy : An Ecomonist Examines the Markets , Power , and Politics of World Trade so valuable .

Rivoli 's t-shirt odyssey led her to travel all over the United States and the world—speaking with , among others , cotton farmers in Texas , factory workers in China , and used clothing entrepreneurs in Africa—examining the production and trade of each of the shirt 's many components , the political factors that determined the location of each stage of production , and even the economic ramifications of discarded clothing that often ends up in the Third World .
The book is a valuable primer on how political considerations affect everything we buy and sell , and how even with both major political parties lurching towards increased hostility to trade , there are always opportunities for innovation .
███ spoke with Rivoli over the phone earler this week .
███ : Your book does a great job of explaining the mechanics of trade , the human costs and benefits , and the political factors that inform every aspect of production . Now that we have a president who is focused on building physical barriers as well as economic barriers , what do you think will be the results say one year , or even five years down the road as a result of President Trump 's trade policies ?
Rivoli : There 's a theory in economics called the `` mercantilistic approach , '' which basically said that exports are good and imports are bad . President Trump has talked about our trading relationships with different countries essentially as you might look at a perfect income statement , saying we are losing when we have a trade deficit with country X or country Y . Losing is bad , so we want to try to make trade relations more balanced .
But you do n't want to look at a trading relationship as an income statement . A trade deficit is not equivalent to a business loss and we do n't measure the health or progress of economy using that metric . There are better and more standard metrics , such as job creation or economic growth or standards of living .
What crosses borders today are not final goods , what 's dominating is trade in tasks , and certain things done in certain places . If you look at a t-shirt , you have all kinds of trade embedded in this t-shirt that does not show up when you just look at the final product . In the case I wrote about [ in the book ] , you have a trade flow when the t-shirt enters the United States and that 's what you see in the trade data and statistics when you look at the tag in the back of the shirt . But actually behind that trade flow is lots of other trade that is represented in the global value chain ( GVC ) —the cotton might have started out in the United States or the yarn might have started out somewhere else . This trade behind the trade is what we call intermediate trade and today constitutes about half or more of global trade flows .
This is where you have to be really careful from a policy perspective because as soon as you start to try to limit imports of intermediate goods , then you start to raise the cost or reduce the choice of companies in the United States using those goods as part of their production .
The classic case many talk about right now are auto parts in the global value chain of U.S. automatons , specifically Mexican auto parts coming into the U.S. , then going into American cars that are then exported or sold in the U.S . If we put barriers and cost on those imports of auto parts , then we make cars more expensive and less competitive here . That would be an example of where the mercantilist thinking is actually at cross-purposes with what we probably want . I think a standard , traditional economist view of trade protection is that it raises prices and limits consumer welfare , that 's a notion that goes back to Adam Smith . The new notion of global value chains adds another layer of cost and complexity to trade protection because it is essentially limiting how companies make their production choices .
███ : In his address to Congress this week , President Trump said he supports free trade , but it has to be fair trade , and he has oft-stated his preference for top-down central planning . There 's a passage in your book where you write that the real tragedy of central planning is the `` crushing of intellect , '' and that `` central planners will use the wrong goods , use the wrong inputs , set the wrong prices , hire the wrong people and ultimately produce shoddy products and not enough of them . ''
Under President Trump , are we trending in that direction ? And do you think he would have the congressional support to impose the kind of limits on trade he 's talked about ?
Rivoli : I do n't . If you look at the data on which congressional districts across the country are trade-dependent , there would not be broad-based support for building these kinds of walls in an impermeable way . The quote you just read from my book talks about a very particular setting , which is pre-Xiaoping China . It 's certainly a stretch for me to think we are somewhere near that territory .
That said , I generally do n't like the term fair trade because it means so many very different things . People use the term to suggest workers are being treated well . There are people who talk about fair trade in terms of not having government subsidies or currency manipulation . But we do n't really know what the term means . It sounds good—everything to be fair—but we do n't have an agreed-upon definition for that .
███ : You wrote in your book about `` textile Republicans '' who were against things like the Central America Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) , and crafted policies that led to things like requiring the pockets sewn in t-shirts to be produced in the U.S . These `` free market '' Republicans are purposefully adding another layer to the trade that goes into the creation of a t-shirt . Do you think Republicans and Democrats are moving closer on certain economic issues such as job protectionism ?
Rivoli : It was just this week that The Wall Street Journal ran the results of a that reported support for international trade was higher now among the American public than it had been in over ten years . One of the things that I think gets confounded is support for trade compared to support for trade agreements . I can be in favor of trade and opposed to trade agreements and I can be in favor of trade agreements and opposed to trade .
A lot of what you heard in this election cycle was opposition to trade agreements . You heard a lot about NAFTA ( North American Free Trade Agreement ) , you heard a lot about TPP ( Trans-Pacific Partnership ) , but a legitimate criticism of these trade agreements is that the process by which they are negotiated is opaque . There are often a lot of special interests at work in terms of what these final agreements look like , and Congress has typically only up or down power on them , so they 're not really subject to any kind of broader public discourse . That 's why I think you will probably continue to see this reticence on trade agreements . This is not just true of the United States , it 's true the world over , including of course in Europe right now . That 's different than concerns about trade itself .
███ : You also wrote in your book about how protectionism can help trigger entrepreneurial instincts . Specifically , how protectionism in 18th century England kind of sparked the Industrial Revolution . This is kind of crystal ball stuff , but given the bipartisan lurch against free trade right now , do you see potential as well ?
Rivoli : That 's an interesting question . I think you do already see responses to the barriers . For example , it 's seems pretty true that China is worried about their access to the U.S. market , so that 's a barrier they are potentially facing , and their response to that barrier is to set up factories in the United States . Companies and entrepreneurs often find creative ways to deal with all kinds of barriers . In the case of trade protection , in the 1980s the United States placed limits on Japanese auto imports . The most obvious thing that happens in a case like that is production moves .
███ : You made a very interesting point in your book that seemed directed at people concerned with income inequality and wealth disparity when you wrote , `` The most vulnerable have more to fear from power imbalances and weak institutions than from competitive markets . '' In the context of the Trump administration , where the president and many of his supporters seem to believe there will always only be a finite amount of jobs , how does one make a convincing argument that a rising tide lifts all boats ?
Rivoli : One of the forces that led to Trump was this sense that we have socialism for the elite and capitalism for everyone else . A favorite example I tend to use is `` Dumpling Street '' in Beijing , where you have dozens of guys lined up with their little stalls selling dumplings . You 'd think this should be a pretty good example of a competitive market . Whoever has the best dumplings at the best prices win , right ? But it does n't always work that way , because you have one guy who was able to bribe his way into securing the corner spot .
There are all kinds rules that get implemented that reflect differences in access to power . Those differences affect economic outcomes and so—as I think you recognize—one of the core points of the book is that this unequal access to the rules or to influence or to power limits people 's ability to compete economically .

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they ’ re published .
With so many critical health care products now made offshore that supplies could not meet surging demand as the coronavirus overwhelmed hospitals , America ’ s attention has again turned to the atrophied state of domestic manufacturing .
As imports from Chinese manufacturers vaporized and other countries clamped down on exports , health care workers improvised with homemade face masks while American factories retooled in a desperate race to make ventilators and protective equipment . It ’ s a pattern , it seemed , in which devices invented in the U.S. end up being produced overseas .
“ Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures , ” vowed President Donald Trump ’ s trade adviser , Peter Navarro , during a Coronavirus Task Force press briefing at the White House . Democratic New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo voiced similar frustration : “ Long term , we have to figure out why we wound up in this situation where we don ’ t have the manufacturing capacity in this country . ”
I started reporting on the crisis in American manufacturing long before the coronavirus forced the issue onto center stage .
I wanted to understand what happened to America ’ s efforts to manufacture the lithium ion battery , a product that has become vital to the future of U.S. transportation . Lithium batteries now power not just a new generation of electric cars , but everything from cordless drills to personal drones . Utilities use them to store energy generated by windmills and solar panels . They even push air through the protective suits ordered recently by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help New York hospital workers responding to COVID-19 .
But the effort to establish a lithium battery manufacturing base in the U.S. largely failed , even after the Obama administration made it a keystone of its 2009 stimulus program , aiming to produce 40 % of the world ’ s lithium ion batteries for advanced vehicles by 2015 .
Today , that number stands at about 10 % , largely because of Tesla ’ s battery plant in Nevada . Most of the batteries used in a plethora of U.S. products are shipped in from China or other foreign suppliers . Despite its economic nationalist rhetoric , the Trump administration has done little to revive battery-making , proposing deep cuts to alternative energy research and favoring fossil fuels at every turn . ( A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy declined to comment on the record . )
A shuttered battery plant in Romulus , Michigan , about 10 minutes from Detroit ’ s airport , is a monument to that fizzled dream . Just down a two-lane road from a General Motors plant that makes gas-powered engines , A123 Systems ’ factory had opened a decade ago , with generous funding from Obama ’ s stimulus program .

Then , as now , the federal government was pumping money into the economy to stave off total collapse . Unlike today , however , the goal was to create as many jobs as possible rather than support people whose jobs had to disappear in order to contain a deadly virus . And the Obama administration wanted to do something else , too : Retool major industries to help them survive and thrive in the future .
A123 ’ s Romulus plant now sits quiet . Its giant floor has been for lease for more than a year , while expensive machines wait to be sold at auction , likely for pennies on the dollar . A sister plant and the company ’ s former headquarters , in nearby Livonia , is being repurposed as medical office space . A123 , which did not respond to requests for comment , has only white-collar workers left in America ; all its manufacturing is done in China and the Czech Republic .
That failure to build a robust industry that ’ s critical for the country holds many lessons for leaders during the current predicament .
“ The government invests in basic research and leaves everything else to chance , ” said Sridhar Kota , an engineering professor at the University of Michigan who served as assistant director for advanced manufacturing at the Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Obama administration . “ The free market has spoken for 30 years . It ’ s not working for us , because we are not leveraging our own investments , and lithium ion batteries are just one painful example of that . ”

At a Democratic Party presidential debate in February , candidate Joe Biden sounded like he did back in 2009 and 2010 , traveling the country as Barack Obama ’ s vice president to tout stimulus spending . Asked how the country should address climate change , he ticked down a list that included a familiar prescription .
As if his White House hadn ’ t tried to do exactly that .
Biden was an early cheerleader for the Obama administration ’ s investment in battery research and production . Electric cars were catching on , but their batteries were produced almost exclusively in Asia , which had originally commercialized them for use in camcorders and cellphones before moving on to cars . To fix that , the Obama administration parceled out $ 2.4 billion to manufacturers willing to make batteries in the U.S. and put people back to work in the process .
A123 Systems , a startup that had spun out of MIT with promising new lithium ion technology in 2005 , was granted $ 249 million , the battery stimulus ’ second-largest recipient . It announced new factories in Romulus and Livonia that would ultimately create more than 4,000 jobs . Michigan offered $ 135 million in grants and tax credits and named A123 ’ s planned 75-acre campus a “ Renaissance Zone , ” erasing state and local taxes for 15 years .
In 2010 , at a splashy ribbon-cutting event to showcase the Livonia plant , Obama called in and was piped through loudspeaker , proclaiming that America ’ s economic policies would no longer “ put us behind the innovation race . ”
Attending that ribbon-cutting in person was Perry Seay , hired by A123 about a year after he was laid off from a dental supply company . He took a contract position managing inventory and was excited about joining a startup offering a bright future .
“ The government wanted this to happen , ” Seay said , “ and they threw all this money at it . We all had high hopes . ”
When both of its factories were built , A123 had the capacity to be America ’ s biggest lithium ion battery producer . Its signature client was the startup Fisker Automotive , which made the sleek , battery-powered Karma sports car .
Making lithium ion batteries is not unlike baking cinnamon rolls . At A123 ’ s Romulus plant , where workers donned hazmat suits for protection , batches of graphite and lithium were mixed into a “ slurry ” that was stored in giant holding tanks . Each mixture was rolled out onto copper or aluminum foil , baked in a special oven and pressed to a precise thickness .
The coils were then transported to Livonia , where they were unwound , cut into smaller rolls and re-wound before going into a vacuum oven . Workers fashioned them into circular “ jelly rolls , ” inserted them into metal housings , drizzled them with electrolyte icing and squeezed to help carry lithium ions between the cathode and the anode , which is what releases energy . They were packed into slender cylinders or slim , flat packets . For car batteries , those packets were stacked like pancakes and bolted into metal boxes .
In 2011 , defective A123 batteries sold to Fisker led to a $ 66.8 million recall that tanked the company ’ s stock price . Seay , who by that time had been hired on full time , said A123 ’ s batteries suffered from inconsistent quality . “ It appeared to me like a rush to get things done so we could make use of this money and start selling the Fisker car , ” he said .
A123 also struggled to build a customer base . General Motors , still recovering from its own financial crisis , chose South Korea ’ s LG Chem over A123 to make batteries for the Chevy Volt . “ I was unwilling to take a risk on a startup battery company , ” said Tony Posawatz , who ran GM ’ s Volt program at the time .
A123 wasn ’ t the only battery-maker slowly wilting . Johnson Controls , a leading manufacturer of lead acid batteries , scrapped plans for a new plant that would focus on lithium ion batteries . After disappointing GM Volt sales , a federal audit found that LG Chem had spent nearly all of its stimulus grant but constructed only 60 % of the promised capacity . EnerDel went bankrupt in 2012 and was purchased by a Russian investor . Dow to sold a German firm its interest in a plant it built in Midland , Michigan .
When A123 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2012 , it had used $ 132 million of its $ 249 million federal grant , and its Michigan hiring peaked at 1,000 employees .
Deepening the wounds , a Chinese industrial conglomerate called Wanxiang paid only $ 256.6 million for A123 ’ s assets in 2013 . There was bipartisan outrage in Congress about the deal , but not enough to stop the sale . Wanxiang later bought Fisker too .
For automakers , battery technology still could not compete with gasoline engines . Nancy Gioia , who ran Ford Motor Company ’ s electrification initiatives , couldn ’ t use batteries for trucks and SUVs demanded by American drivers . “ Battery-powered vehicles , at that time , that was a bridge too far , ” Gioia said .
By 2015 , instead of the million electric vehicles projected by the White House , with sales further depressed by low gas prices , only about 400,000 were on American roads .
The federal money had been irresistible , but it also led A123 to invest in manufacturing before enough customers existed for the product , said co-founder and former chief technology officer Bart Riley . “ If you ’ re responding to something that ’ s artificial in the market , you do so at your peril , ” Riley said .
Last October , British data analyst Simon Moores came to the Old Executive Office Building beside the White House to brief some of Trump ’ s staff on the lithium ion battery supply chain .
“ The White House thinks of this in terms of jobs , ” said Moores , a managing director of the research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence . If developed , the full supply chain of battery manufacturing could create around 45,000 jobs , he said . The bigger stakes were what America stood to forfeit .
“ If the U.S. doesn ’ t get its own battery capacity , large scale and high quality , it ’ s going to lose its automotive industry in the next 50 years , ” Moores said .
To be competitive , innovation and manufacturing must exist in a virtuous circle — with engineering improvements closely tied to factory production . For the moment , consumers still demand trucks and SUVs because gas is cheap and battery-powered vehicles come at a premium . But as the cost of batteries declines , that could shift quickly , before Detroit is ready for it .
So far , the trajectory isn ’ t good . By 2024 , Benchmark expects America to have 8.2 % of the world ’ s lithium ion battery-making capacity , while China has 72.8 % and Europe has 14.2 % .
Trump ’ s administration has urged companies to move their supply chains out of China . Trade adviser Navarro , a longtime critic of trade with China , has explicitly cited America ’ s lack of battery manufacturing as a national security threat because of the substantial military applications — ranging from portable radios to thermal imaging for surveillance . China also controls the raw materials used in advanced batteries . Lithium , the world ’ s lightest metal , is primarily mined in Chile and Australia and processed in China .
“ We have virtually all of the battery production migrating elsewhere now , ” Navarro said in a 2018 speech at a Washington think tank . “ And we have the lithium that ’ s used for some of this is coming under the control of foreign powers . ”
But so far , the administration ’ s efforts have either been small-scale or even counterproductive .
Take Trump ’ s trade war , which imposed a 15 % tariff on lithium ion batteries coming from China starting in September 2019 . ( It ’ s since been cut in half . ) Companies and associations — including the Korean company LG Chem and Tesla , the two biggest manufacturers of batteries in the U.S. — pleaded for exemptions with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative because of the difficulty finding sources .
But the tariffs did not spur domestic production , said Cairn Energy Research Advisors analyst Sam Jaffe . “ If you ’ re going to build a factory here to take advantage of that , how do you know it ’ s not going to disappear in six months ? ” Jaffe said . “ It ’ s almost frozen people in their tracks . ”
What would spur domestic production ? According to experts I interviewed : More battery research investment , and policies that foster demand for electric vehicles , like tax incentives and strong emissions standards . That ’ s because regardless of tariffs , global supply chains have been contracting for years . Heavy goods especially now tend to be assembled closer to where they ’ re going to be sold , so if you want something to be made in your country , it makes sense to consume more of it .
Instead , Trump has enthusiastically supported fossil fuels . His Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back Obama-era vehicle fuel economy rules and fighting the extension of a $ 7,500 electric vehicle tax credit . Trump ’ s Bureau of Land Management has eased the way for lithium mining on public lands , but investors have been leery .
Any policy proposal involving climate has become politicized . For example : A bill proposed in December by Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier to create new electric vehicle tax incentives , boost charging infrastructure and issue bonds for domestic battery manufacturers has 31 Democratic co-sponsors and no Republicans .
“ The administration ’ s policy is that this is not a problem , ” said David Hart , director of the Center for Science , Technology and Innovation Policy at George Mason ’ s Schar School of Policy and Government .
As his assistant secretary of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy , Trump installed Daniel Simmons , a former staffer at oil- and gas-friendly think tanks .
White House budgets have proposed slashing renewable energy research funding and even sought to eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy , the office heading federal energy storage research initiatives . Congress has so far declined to adopt the cuts , and some battery research continues , although experts say it ’ s less than needed .
“ People were really interested in what we were doing in the U.S. , ” Jim Greenberger , executive director of the National Alliance for Advanced Technology Batteries , told me . “ Now we ’ re irrelevant internationally . ”
The Trump administration has made a few steps forward . In January , the Energy Department announced an “ energy storage grand challenge ” that will direct $ 158 million toward research and manufacturing improvements . And there have been glimmers of new investment in battery production , such as GM ’ s $ 2.3 billion partnership with LG Chem to produce batteries at its shuttered plant in Lordstown , Ohio .

With so many critical health care products now made offshore that supplies could not meet surging demand as the coronavirus overwhelmed hospitals, America’s attention has again turned to the atrophied state of domestic manufacturing.

As imports from Chinese manufacturers vaporized and other countries clamped down on exports, health care workers improvised with homemade face masks while American factories retooled in a desperate race to make ventilators and protective equipment. It’s a pattern, it seemed, in which devices invented in the U.S. end up being produced overseas.

“Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures,” vowed President Donald Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, during a Coronavirus Task Force press briefing at the White House. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo voiced similar frustration: “Long term, we have to figure out why we wound up in this situation where we don’t have the manufacturing capacity in this country.”

I started reporting on the crisis in American manufacturing long before the coronavirus forced the issue onto center stage.

I wanted to understand what happened to America’s efforts to manufacture the lithium ion battery, a product that has become vital to the future of U.S. transportation. Lithium batteries now power not just a new generation of electric cars, but everything from cordless drills to personal drones. Utilities use them to store energy generated by windmills and solar panels. They even push air through the protective suits ordered recently by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help New York hospital workers responding to COVID-19.

But the effort to establish a lithium battery manufacturing base in the U.S. largely failed, even after the Obama administration made it a keystone of its 2009 stimulus program, aiming to produce 40% of the world’s lithium ion batteries for advanced vehicles by 2015.

Today, that number stands at about 10%, largely because of Tesla’s battery plant in Nevada. Most of the batteries used in a plethora of U.S. products are shipped in from China or other foreign suppliers. Despite its economic nationalist rhetoric, the Trump administration has done little to revive battery-making, proposing deep cuts to alternative energy research and favoring fossil fuels at every turn. (A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy declined to comment on the record.)

A shuttered battery plant in Romulus, Michigan, about 10 minutes from Detroit’s airport, is a monument to that fizzled dream. Just down a two-lane road from a General Motors plant that makes gas-powered engines, A123 Systems’ factory had opened a decade ago, with generous funding from Obama’s stimulus program.

Then, as now, the federal government was pumping money into the economy to stave off total collapse. Unlike today, however, the goal was to create as many jobs as possible rather than support people whose jobs had to disappear in order to contain a deadly virus. And the Obama administration wanted to do something else, too: Retool major industries to help them survive and thrive in the future.

A123’s Romulus plant now sits quiet. Its giant floor has been for lease for more than a year, while expensive machines wait to be sold at auction, likely for pennies on the dollar. A sister plant and the company’s former headquarters, in nearby Livonia, is being repurposed as medical office space. A123, which did not respond to requests for comment, has only white-collar workers left in America; all its manufacturing is done in China and the Czech Republic.

That failure to build a robust industry that’s critical for the country holds many lessons for leaders during the current predicament.

“The government invests in basic research and leaves everything else to chance,” said Sridhar Kota, an engineering professor at the University of Michigan who served as assistant director for advanced manufacturing at the Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Obama administration. “The free market has spoken for 30 years. It’s not working for us, because we are not leveraging our own investments, and lithium ion batteries are just one painful example of that.”

At a Democratic Party presidential debate in February, candidate Joe Biden sounded like he did back in 2009 and 2010, traveling the country as Barack Obama’s vice president to tout stimulus spending. Asked how the country should address climate change, he ticked down a list that included a familiar prescription.

“Invest in battery technology,” Biden said.

As if his White House hadn’t tried to do exactly that.

Biden was an early cheerleader for the Obama administration’s investment in battery research and production. Electric cars were catching on, but their batteries were produced almost exclusively in Asia, which had originally commercialized them for use in camcorders and cellphones before moving on to cars. To fix that, the Obama administration parceled out $2.4 billion to manufacturers willing to make batteries in the U.S. and put people back to work in the process.

A123 Systems, a startup that had spun out of MIT with promising new lithium ion technology in 2005, was granted $249 million, the battery stimulus’ second-largest recipient. It announced new factories in Romulus and Livonia that would ultimately create more than 4,000 jobs. Michigan offered $135 million in grants and tax credits and named A123’s planned 75-acre campus a “Renaissance Zone,” erasing state and local taxes for 15 years.

In 2010, at a splashy ribbon-cutting event to showcase the Livonia plant, Obama called in and was piped through loudspeaker, proclaiming that America’s economic policies would no longer “put us behind the innovation race.”

Attending that ribbon-cutting in person was Perry Seay, hired by A123 about a year after he was laid off from a dental supply company. He took a contract position managing inventory and was excited about joining a startup offering a bright future.

“The government wanted this to happen,” Seay said, “and they threw all this money at it. We all had high hopes.”

When both of its factories were built, A123 had the capacity to be America’s biggest lithium ion battery producer. Its signature client was the startup Fisker Automotive, which made the sleek, battery-powered Karma sports car.

Making lithium ion batteries is not unlike baking cinnamon rolls. At A123’s Romulus plant, where workers donned hazmat suits for protection, batches of graphite and lithium were mixed into a “slurry” that was stored in giant holding tanks. Each mixture was rolled out onto copper or aluminum foil, baked in a special oven and pressed to a precise thickness.

The coils were then transported to Livonia, where they were unwound, cut into smaller rolls and re-wound before going into a vacuum oven. Workers fashioned them into circular “jelly rolls,” inserted them into metal housings, drizzled them with electrolyte icing and squeezed to help carry lithium ions between the cathode and the anode, which is what releases energy. They were packed into slender cylinders or slim, flat packets. For car batteries, those packets were stacked like pancakes and bolted into metal boxes.

It didn’t take long for things to go wrong.

In 2011, defective A123 batteries sold to Fisker led to a $66.8 million recall that tanked the company’s stock price. Seay, who by that time had been hired on full time, said A123’s batteries suffered from inconsistent quality. “It appeared to me like a rush to get things done so we could make use of this money and start selling the Fisker car,” he said.

A123 also struggled to build a customer base. General Motors, still recovering from its own financial crisis, chose South Korea’s LG Chem over A123 to make batteries for the Chevy Volt. “I was unwilling to take a risk on a startup battery company,” said Tony Posawatz, who ran GM’s Volt program at the time.

A123 wasn’t the only battery-maker slowly wilting. Johnson Controls, a leading manufacturer of lead acid batteries, scrapped plans for a new plant that would focus on lithium ion batteries. After disappointing GM Volt sales, a federal audit found that LG Chem had spent nearly all of its stimulus grant but constructed only 60% of the promised capacity. EnerDel went bankrupt in 2012 and was purchased by a Russian investor. Dow to sold a German firm its interest in a plant it built in Midland, Michigan.

When A123 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2012, it had used $132 million of its $249 million federal grant, and its Michigan hiring peaked at 1,000 employees.

Deepening the wounds, a Chinese industrial conglomerate called Wanxiang paid only $256.6 million for A123’s assets in 2013. There was bipartisan outrage in Congress about the deal, but not enough to stop the sale. Wanxiang later bought Fisker too.

For automakers, battery technology still could not compete with gasoline engines. Nancy Gioia, who ran Ford Motor Company’s electrification initiatives, couldn’t use batteries for trucks and SUVs demanded by American drivers. “Battery-powered vehicles, at that time, that was a bridge too far,” Gioia said.

By 2015, instead of the million electric vehicles projected by the White House, with sales further depressed by low gas prices, only about 400,000 were on American roads.

The federal money had been irresistible, but it also led A123 to invest in manufacturing before enough customers existed for the product, said co-founder and former chief technology officer Bart Riley. “If you’re responding to something that’s artificial in the market, you do so at your peril,” Riley said.

Last October, British data analyst Simon Moores came to the Old Executive Office Building beside the White House to brief some of Trump’s staff on the lithium ion battery supply chain.

“The White House thinks of this in terms of jobs,” said Moores, a managing director of the research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. If developed, the full supply chain of battery manufacturing could create around 45,000 jobs, he said. The bigger stakes were what America stood to forfeit.

“If the U.S. doesn’t get its own battery capacity, large scale and high quality, it’s going to lose its automotive industry in the next 50 years,” Moores said.

To be competitive, innovation and manufacturing must exist in a virtuous circle — with engineering improvements closely tied to factory production. For the moment, consumers still demand trucks and SUVs because gas is cheap and battery-powered vehicles come at a premium. But as the cost of batteries declines, that could shift quickly, before Detroit is ready for it.

So far, the trajectory isn’t good. By 2024, Benchmark expects America to have 8.2% of the world’s lithium ion battery-making capacity, while China has 72.8% and Europe has 14.2%.

Trump’s administration has urged companies to move their supply chains out of China. Trade adviser Navarro, a longtime critic of trade with China, has explicitly cited America’s lack of battery manufacturing as a national security threat because of the substantial military applications — ranging from portable radios to thermal imaging for surveillance. China also controls the raw materials used in advanced batteries. Lithium, the world’s lightest metal, is primarily mined in Chile and Australia and processed in China.

“We have virtually all of the battery production migrating elsewhere now,” Navarro said in a 2018 speech at a Washington think tank. “And we have the lithium that’s used for some of this is coming under the control of foreign powers.”

But so far, the administration’s efforts have either been small-scale or even counterproductive.

Take Trump’s trade war, which imposed a 15% tariff on lithium ion batteries coming from China starting in September 2019. (It’s since been cut in half.) Companies and associations — including the Korean company LG Chem and Tesla, the two biggest manufacturers of batteries in the U.S. — pleaded for exemptions with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative because of the difficulty finding sources.

But the tariffs did not spur domestic production, said Cairn Energy Research Advisors analyst Sam Jaffe. “If you’re going to build a factory here to take advantage of that, how do you know it’s not going to disappear in six months?” Jaffe said. “It’s almost frozen people in their tracks.”

What would spur domestic production? According to experts I interviewed: More battery research investment, and policies that foster demand for electric vehicles, like tax incentives and strong emissions standards.

His Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back Obama-era vehicle fuel economy rules and fighting the extension of a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Trump’s Bureau of Land Management has eased the way for lithium mining on public lands, but investors have been leery.

Any policy proposal involving climate has become politicized. For example: A bill proposed in December by Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier to create new electric vehicle tax incentives, boost charging infrastructure and issue bonds for domestic battery manufacturers has 31 Democratic co-sponsors and no Republicans.

“The administration’s policy is that this is not a problem,” said David Hart, director of the Center for Science, Technology and Innovation Policy at George Mason’s Schar School of Policy and Government.

As his assistant secretary of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Trump installed Daniel Simmons, a former staffer at oil- and gas-friendly think tanks.

White House budgets have proposed slashing renewable energy research funding and even sought to eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, the office heading federal energy storage research initiatives. Congress has so far declined to adopt the cuts, and some battery research continues, although experts say it’s less than needed.

“People were really interested in what we were doing in the U.S.,” Jim Greenberger, executive director of the National Alliance for Advanced Technology Batteries, told me. “Now we’re irrelevant internationally.”

The Trump administration has made a few steps forward.

""When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. They're tough. We have to be tough. It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks,"" he said. ""We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually. It's not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen anymore.""

The Washington Post was the first to report on the details of the Australian call.

When asked about the tweet labeling the agreement brokered with Obama's administration a ""dumb deal,"" Turnball said, while the deal may not have been one Trump would've done or considered a ""good deal,"" the President and his administration have committed to honor it.

Earlier this week, Spicer said the Trump administration would honor the agreement, saying the refugees would be submitted to ""extreme vetting.""

Turnbull attempted to keep some semblance of diplomacy, declining to elaborate on details of the call.

""Look, I'm not going to comment on a conversation between myself and the President of the United States other than what we have said publicly, and you can surely understand the reasons for that,"" he said. ""I'm sure you can understand that. It's better these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you'll see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them.""

One person familiar with the circumstances on Saturday notes that President Trump's phone call with Turnbull came after a long day of conversations with other foreign leaders -- Turnbull was the fifth call after conversations with Japanese Prime Minister Abe, French President Hollande, German Chancellor Merkel, and Russian President Putin, each of which lasted close to an hour.

Trump, this source said, was feeling some fatigue after his first major bout of diplomacy. And while his earlier conversations weren't necessarily contentious, they did involve some tense moments. Merkel and Hollande pushed back on the travel ban over the phone. Merkel felt she had to explain the Geneva Convention to Trump -- a lecture a source has said Trump chafed at.

'Tough hombres' talk with Mexican President

CNN has also learned details about the Friday phone call between Trump and Peña Nieto, who canceled an in-person visit with Trump after the US President insisted Mexico pay for a border wall between the two countries.

According to an excerpt of the transcript of the call with Peña Nieto provided to CNN, Trump said, ""You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with. We are willing to help with that big-league, but they have be knocked out and you have not done a good job knocking them out.""

Trump made an offer to help Peña Nieto with the drug cartels.

The excerpt of the transcript obtained by CNN differs with an official internal readout of the call that wrongly suggested Trump was contemplating sending troops to the border in a hostile way.

The Associated Press report said Trump threatened to send US troops to stop criminals in Mexico unless the government did more to control them, but both the US and Mexican governments denied details from the story.

Sources described the AP's reporting as being based upon a readout -- written by aides -- not a transcript.

Spicer described the call with Peña Nieto as ""productive.""

A government official familiar with Trump's interactions with foreign leaders said, ""(Trump's) interactions are naive in that he keeps suggesting we will have the best relationship ever with a broad departure of countries, but there is no substance to back it up. When he encounters a policy challenge, like with Turnbull, he responds with a tantrum.""",www.cnn.com,left,t7g4TRDXyeIwgcnP

trade,Guest Writer - Left,0,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/donald-trump-xi-jinping-china-trade-war/index.html,OPINION: It's Trump vs. Xi in the China trade war -- and it's personal,2019-05-14,Analysis Stephen Collinson,"The showdown is now no longer just a confrontation between China and the US -- one a rising power challenging the long established dominance of the global economic leader . It 's become a test of wills between two of the world 's most powerful men , each of whom has political interests that are more likely to deepen the conflict than to quickly ease it .
Both view themselves as strongmen . Both have imposed their power on their domestic governing systems by force of will . Both have the authority to trigger global shock waves -- as they did when markets plunged following Trump 's tariff hikes last week and China 's multi-billion dollar retaliation on Monday .
Both see the honor of their nation at stake at a crucial moment in the history of US-China relations , as the emerging competition between two great powers becomes sharper than ever .
While Trump has said the two sides were on the verge of a deal last week before China backed out , the gulf in intention between the two giant economies will complicate future talks .
Trump -- lambasting Chinese intellectual property theft and support for state industries -- believes he has to change the global trading system itself because it is a massive ripoff for the United States .
And Trump thinks the strength of the US economy gives him an edge and the ability to pin the blame for the impasse on Xi .
`` We are now a much bigger economy than China , and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election . We are the 'piggy bank ' that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of . NO MORE ! '' Trump said Tuesday in an early morning volley of tweets about the trade faceoff .
Xi sees US demands as an infringement on Chinese sovereignty and has an incentive to keep globalization intact since China has profited handsomely from the status quo in a stunning 20-year growth explosion .
The Chinese leader is no keener to climb down than Trump .
`` China feels it does not have to give in , '' Max Baucus , a former US ambassador to China told CNN 's Kate Bolduan on Monday .
`` Add to that , saving face is a big deal in China . President Xi Jinping does not want to appear to have backed down . I do n't think Americans understand that , '' the former Montana senator said .
While Trump said Monday he will talk to Xi at the G20 summit in Japan in late June -- which is now looming as a massively consequential meeting -- the gaps may be too wide to bridge by then .

One reason why the dispute could go on for a while is because Trump seems to sincerely believe he is winning .
Convinced of the primacy of the healthy US economy , willing to shrug off a day 's losses on the stock market and wielding his favorite tariff tool , Trump is not at all fazed .
`` We 're in a very good position , and I think it 's only going to get better , '' Trump said Monday .
Trump is often ideologically supple and could turn on a dime on the dispute . But he 's held deep seated beliefs about China 's economic threat for decades and has long advocated a protectionist remedy . This is one issue that he 's shown that he really does believe in . After all , he seems ready to gamble on the health of the US economy -- his best political asset heading into his 2020 reelection race .
The President 's hawkish comments on Monday might have been an attempt to calm tumbling markets . But they also entrenched a position from which it will be hard to abandon without being embarrassed .
For now at least , before damage to the economy and consumer budgets from the deepening trade war becomes obvious , Trump may believe he will prosper politically from standing up to China .
And after accusing Beijing of `` raping '' US workers in his 2016 campaign , he will want to make good on his promises before 2020 .
Trump is also using the China confrontation to emphasize his contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden , the apparent 2020 Democratic front-runner .
Biden complained Monday that Trump was approaching the trade spat all wrong by showing `` a lot of bravado , no action . ''
The President however has already charged that Biden is too weak to take on Xi -- and clearly enjoys the contrast .
`` China is DREAMING that Sleepy Joe Biden , or any of the others , gets elected in 2020 . They LOVE ripping off America ! '' Trump tweeted over the weekend .

Trump 's foreign policy bets are often motivated by a desire to shore up his domestic standing . And CNN recently reported that Trump is desperate to deliver on his self-image as a master deal maker , another reason it will be tough for him to fold .
The big political risk for the President is that a prolonged trade war of attrition begins to erode US growth , devalues 401Ks in a market correction and tarnishes the economic feel good factor and undermines Trump 's boasts of a new era of prosperity .
Voters could tire of paying an effective sales tax on goods like iPhones , toys and foodstuffs , despite Trump 's assurance that China and not US consumers foot the bill for tariffs .
US exporters will take a hit from China 's tariffs and US manufacturing will also suffer .
Rick Helfenbein , CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association , said his industry was `` beyond freaked . ''
`` ( We are ) sitting around feeling like we have just bought tickets for the second sailing of The Titanic , the only difference now is we know exactly where the icebergs are , '' Helfenbein said on CNN .
The pain of farmers already suffering from Chinese retaliatory tariffs -- especially those in the swing state Midwest -- could also deliver Trump a 2020 shock .
Punishing Beijing could also have other spillover effects . If China is slowed , other economies , including US export markets in Asia and Europe , could suffer and hurt US jobs and prosperity .
`` If we get the full throttle of all tariffs it does risk a recession , '' Diane Swonk , chief economist of Grant Thornton , told CNN 's Brooke Baldwin on Monday .
Such a doom-laden scenario is one reason why some analysts still bet Trump will close a deal after a period of posturing .
He has , after all , frequently escalated a crisis , then stepped back -- while declaring incremental changes to an existing agreement as a massive victory for the United States .
The scenario eventually eased the crisis over the renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement and offers a blueprint for a deal at the G20 should Trump 's political calculation over the China trade war change .
JUST WATCHED American farmers feeling the brunt of China tariffs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH American farmers feeling the brunt of China tariffs 01:31
The confrontation has already revealed a truth that reflects an important geopolitical evolution : Beijing is not afraid of the United States .
Trump spent the weekend warning China on Twitter that it would be `` hurt very badly '' if it did n't do a deal .
Although he is the most dominant Chinese leader in decades , he can not completely ignore complicated internal Communist Party dynamics . Chinese leaders are always wary of any changes to social conditions -- that could be brought on by a slowing economy -- that could cause public resentment and translate into political activity .
China is also sensitive to its own experience under colonialism and proud of its rise as a key regional power and global player . So there is no circumstance under which Xi could allow himself to be seen as bowing to bullying from any Western leader , let alone an American president as combative as Trump .
The importance of Chinese pride in the dispute was reflected in an article in the People 's Daily , the Communist Party mouthpiece on Monday . The paper accused the US of misjudging China 's `` strength , capability and willpower '' and of taking a `` risky and impetuous decision . ''
Baucus said that Americans underestimated China 's size , power and leverage . He also said that Beijing was playing a far longer game than Washington and , with the leadership 's iron grip on dissent , could afford to absorb the painful side effects of a trade war .
`` I think those who think the US ( has ) leverage do not really fully understand China . China thinks long term . China is an authoritarian government . Their party controls everything , '' he said .
Both Xi and Trump know the other has much to lose . The question now is the age-old diplomatic conundrum : Can they forge an outcome that gives both the option to declare victory ?","The showdown is now no longer just a confrontation between China and the US -- one a rising power challenging the long established dominance of the global economic leader. It's become a test of wills between two of the world's most powerful men, each of whom has political interests that are more likely to deepen the conflict than to quickly ease it.

Both have the authority to trigger global shock waves -- as they did when markets plunged following Trump's tariff hikes last week and China's multi-billion dollar retaliation on Monday.

Both see the honor of their nation at stake at a crucial moment in the history of US-China relations, as the emerging competition between two great powers becomes sharper than ever.

While Trump has said the two sides were on the verge of a deal last week before China backed out, the gulf in intention between the two giant economies will complicate future talks.

Trump -- lambasting Chinese intellectual property theft and support for state industries -- believes he has to change the global trading system itself because it is a massive ripoff for the United States.

And Trump thinks the strength of the US economy gives him an edge and the ability to pin the blame for the impasse on Xi.

""We are now a much bigger economy than China, and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election. We are the 'piggy bank' that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of. NO MORE!"" Trump said Tuesday in an early morning volley of tweets about the trade faceoff.

Xi sees US demands as an infringement on Chinese sovereignty and has an incentive to keep globalization intact since China has profited handsomely from the status quo in a stunning 20-year growth explosion.

The Chinese leader is no keener to climb down than Trump.

""China feels it does not have to give in,"" Max Baucus, a former US ambassador to China told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Monday.

""Add to that, saving face is a big deal in China. President Xi Jinping does not want to appear to have backed down. I don't think Americans understand that,"" the former Montana senator said.

While Trump said Monday he will talk to Xi at the G20 summit in Japan in late June -- which is now looming as a massively consequential meeting -- the gaps may be too wide to bridge by then.

Trump's ideology

One reason why the dispute could go on for a while is because Trump seems to sincerely believe he is winning.

Convinced of the primacy of the healthy US economy, willing to shrug off a day's losses on the stock market and wielding his favorite tariff tool, Trump is not at all fazed.

""We're in a very good position, and I think it's only going to get better,"" Trump said Monday.

Trump is often ideologically supple and could turn on a dime on the dispute. But he's held deep seated beliefs about China's economic threat for decades and has long advocated a protectionist remedy. This is one issue that he's shown that he really does believe in. After all, he seems ready to gamble on the health of the US economy -- his best political asset heading into his 2020 reelection race.

The President's hawkish comments on Monday might have been an attempt to calm tumbling markets. But they also entrenched a position from which it will be hard to abandon without being embarrassed.

For now at least, before damage to the economy and consumer budgets from the deepening trade war becomes obvious, Trump may believe he will prosper politically from standing up to China.

And after accusing Beijing of ""raping"" US workers in his 2016 campaign , he will want to make good on his promises before 2020.

Trump is also using the China confrontation to emphasize his contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden, the apparent 2020 Democratic front-runner.

Biden complained Monday that Trump was approaching the trade spat all wrong by showing ""a lot of bravado, no action.""

The President however has already charged that Biden is too weak to take on Xi -- and clearly enjoys the contrast.

""China is DREAMING that Sleepy Joe Biden, or any of the others, gets elected in 2020. They LOVE ripping off America!"" Trump tweeted over the weekend.

Trump's big gamble

JUST WATCHED 2020 Democrats hammer Trump for not working with allies vs. China Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2020 Democrats hammer Trump for not working with allies vs. China 04:53

Trump's foreign policy bets are often motivated by a desire to shore up his domestic standing. And CNN recently reported that Trump is desperate to deliver on his self-image as a master deal maker, another reason it will be tough for him to fold.

The big political risk for the President is that a prolonged trade war of attrition begins to erode US growth, devalues 401Ks in a market correction and tarnishes the economic feel good factor and undermines Trump's boasts of a new era of prosperity.

Voters could tire of paying an effective sales tax on goods like iPhones, toys and foodstuffs, despite Trump's assurance that China and not US consumers foot the bill for tariffs.

US exporters will take a hit from China's tariffs and US manufacturing will also suffer.

Rick Helfenbein, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said his industry was ""beyond freaked.""

""(We are) sitting around feeling like we have just bought tickets for the second sailing of The Titanic, the only difference now is we know exactly where the icebergs are,"" Helfenbein said on CNN.

The pain of farmers already suffering from Chinese retaliatory tariffs -- especially those in the swing state Midwest -- could also deliver Trump a 2020 shock.

Punishing Beijing could also have other spillover effects. If China is slowed, other economies, including US export markets in Asia and Europe, could suffer and hurt US jobs and prosperity.

""If we get the full throttle of all tariffs it does risk a recession,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist of Grant Thornton, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday.

Such a doom-laden scenario is one reason why some analysts still bet Trump will close a deal after a period of posturing.

He has, after all, frequently escalated a crisis, then stepped back -- while declaring incremental changes to an existing agreement as a massive victory for the United States.

The scenario eventually eased the crisis over the renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement and offers a blueprint for a deal at the G20 should Trump's political calculation over the China trade war change.

Xi's choice

JUST WATCHED American farmers feeling the brunt of China tariffs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH American farmers feeling the brunt of China tariffs 01:31

The confrontation has already revealed a truth that reflects an important geopolitical evolution: Beijing is not afraid of the United States.

Trump spent the weekend warning China on Twitter that it would be ""hurt very badly"" if it didn't do a deal.

Like Trump, Xi is not immune to political pressures.

Although he is the most dominant Chinese leader in decades, he cannot completely ignore complicated internal Communist Party dynamics. Chinese leaders are always wary of any changes to social conditions -- that could be brought on by a slowing economy -- that could cause public resentment and translate into political activity.

China is also sensitive to its own experience under colonialism and proud of its rise as a key regional power and global player. So there is no circumstance under which Xi could allow himself to be seen as bowing to bullying from any Western leader, let alone an American president as combative as Trump.

The importance of Chinese pride in the dispute was reflected in an article in the People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece on Monday . The paper accused the US of misjudging China's ""strength, capability and willpower"" and of taking a ""risky and impetuous decision.""

Baucus said that Americans underestimated China's size, power and leverage. He also said that Beijing was playing a far longer game than Washington and, with the leadership's iron grip on dissent, could afford to absorb the painful side effects of a trade war.

""I think those who think the US (has) leverage do not really fully understand China. China thinks long term. China is an authoritarian government. Their party controls everything,"" he said.

Both Xi and Trump know the other has much to lose. The question now is the age-old diplomatic conundrum: Can they forge an outcome that gives both the option to declare victory?",www.cnn.com,left,kjkLyhh5KZAWSVEJ

Republican cash machine takes on Trump

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington

The Koch network of political organisations has been a reliable cash machine for Republicans for more than a decade. When Donald Trump became the party's nominee, the spigot to conservative candidates continued to flow - although the primary focus of the conservative brothers were congressional candidates and not the top of the ticket.

Since Mr Trump's surprise victory, Charles and David Koch have sought common ground with the president, particularly on tax reform, but they continue to be far from ideological soul mates. Now, as the president bangs the drums of a trade war, the relations between the libertarian-leaning billionaires and the populist-nationalist president are becoming increasingly frayed.

It's not full political warfare yet, however. The advertising and advocacy campaign proposed by the Koch groups tilts in the direction of ""friendly advice"" for the president, not hostile criticism. When paired with congressional efforts to curtail the president's ability to enact new tariffs, however, and the stakes increase.

The Republican party has long been a welcoming home to free trade advocates, who point to the economic benefits of globalism and international competition. Mr Trump is trying to change that - but he's picking a fight with some very deep-pocketed adversaries.

Who are the Koch brothers?

Charles and David Koch's company - the second largest privately owned business in the US - has interests ranging from pipelines to paper towels.

According to Forbes Magazine, each of the men are worth about $60bn (£45bn), and are tied for eighth richest man in the US.

According to the Koch Industries website, they have more than 120,000 employees between all their businesses and subsidiaries.

They have previously put money into groups denying climate change and attacking unions and workers' rights.

But they have also pushed for criminal justice reform and made large donations to the American Civil Liberties Union.

Last November, the brothers helped fund Meredith Corporation's deal to buy US magazine publisher Time Inc.

Conservatives argue that Mr. Obama will use trade negotiating powers to write a binding climate deal into any agreement and say that alone is reason to deny the White House fast-track negotiating powers . Liberal opponents of a trade deal say they don ’ t think the agreement gives the president enough power to work on trade .
The confusing dichotomy underscores the distrust of Mr. Obama on both sides of the political spectrum — and the intensity of opponents determined to scuttle the emerging deal .
They will get their next chance Tuesday as the issue returns to the floor of the Senate for a major filibuster showdown on whether to grant Mr. Obama fast-track negotiating powers , or Trade Promotion Authority . The president needs fast-track powers to conclude negotiations on a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal .
A coalition of Republicans and Democrats will try to hold the center and rally support to pass the trade deal for Mr. Obama and for the business groups that have demanded it , saying it is critical to the U.S. positioning in the world economy to lead on free trade .
Sen. Jeff Sessions , an Alabama Republican who is leading conservative opponents , said he fears fast-track trade authority will be a way for Mr. Obama to impose global warming controls on the U.S. by negotiating stricter greenhouse gas emissions into a binding international agreement and circumventing Congress after lawmakers give him initial approval .
“ Mr . President , we have seen you operate . We are not going to authorize you to enter into the creation of an international union where you get to impose additional powers on us without creating it through the treaty process , ” the Alabama Republican said on the Senate floor last week .
He repeated the warning Monday in a letter to colleagues , urging them to slow down and demand that Mr. Obama release all the details of his plans before Congress gives him approval .
U.S. Trade Representative Michael B.G . Froman has insisted that the administration isn ’ t trying to deceive Congress . In a letter this month to Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. , Wisconsin Republican , Mr. Froman ruled out a number of areas where Republicans fear circumvention .
“ The administration recognizes that the 2015 TPA bill does not provide the administration any new authority to enter into climate change agreements , ” he wrote . “ In addition , the administration is not negotiating language or provisions related to population control , family planning or related topics . ”
One of the bills Republicans are trying to pass as part of the trade package , known as the customs enforcement legislation , adds even more restrictions to the president ’ s powers , including a specific prohibition on negotiating global warming or immigration deals as part of trade agreements .
Republican trade opponents fear that is not enough and worry that Mr. Obama will ignore that legislation , as they say he has done on other immigration and environmental issues .
Democratic trade opponents say their fear is just the opposite — that he would obey customs enforcement and miss out on a good chance to force the U.S. to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions .
Rep. Donna F. Edwards , Maryland Democrat , called the restrictions “ shameful , ” and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , cited the restraints on global warming negotiations as one of her major reasons for leading opposition against Mr. Obama ’ s chief domestic priority .
“ We now have an absolute prohibition , a gag order where we can ’ t talk about climate in the greatest opportunity we would have to deal with climate change , ” said Rep. Daniel T. Kildee Michigan Democrat .
Hollywood weighed in as well . Actor Mark Ruffalo , who portrays Dr. Bruce Banner in the “ Avengers ” movie franchise , called the restriction on global warming negotiations “ insidious . ”
“ We can not allow a trade deal that will put corporate profits above our climate , clean air , and water protections , ” he said in a statement released by Public Citizen .
The trade package has been on weak legislative ground for weeks .
It survived an early vote in the Senate but seemed to have gone down to defeat in the House two weeks ago after opponents , chiefly liberal Democrats , voted against one of their own priorities — assistance for workers displaced by free trade — to poison the entire package .
Republican leaders , with the blessing of Mr. Obama , reworked the process and passed a stand-alone bill with fast-track negotiating powers but not the worker assistance .
The Senate will vote Tuesday on heading off a filibuster of the fast-track powers bill , then likely will vote Wednesday on the worker assistance legislation , which has been coupled with a popular set of trade preferences for African countries and Haiti — a bid to entice Democrats .
The White House said Mr. Obama was working the phones Monday in advance of the filibuster showdown .
The fast-track bill could go straight to the president after passage , but the worker assistance would have to go back to the House , where Democrats would be faced with a final decision on whether to further embarrass their party leader .
Congress also is likely to vote on beginning a conference committee to hammer out final details on the customs enforcement bill .
“ With just a little more trust , a little more cooperation and simply voting consistently , we ’ ll get there , ” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican .","Global warming has emerged as the newest battleground on trade, with opponents on both the right and the left trying to use the hot-button issue to sink President Obama’s quest for a legacy-building free trade deal.

A coalition of Republicans and Democrats will try to hold the center and rally support to pass the trade deal for Mr. Obama and for the business groups that have demanded it, saying it is critical to the U.S. positioning in the world economy to lead on free trade.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who is leading conservative opponents, said he fears fast-track trade authority will be a way for Mr. Obama to impose global warming controls on the U.S. by negotiating stricter greenhouse gas emissions into a binding international agreement and circumventing Congress after lawmakers give him initial approval.

“Mr. President, we have seen you operate. We are not going to authorize you to enter into the creation of an international union where you get to impose additional powers on us without creating it through the treaty process,” the Alabama Republican said on the Senate floor last week.

He repeated the warning Monday in a letter to colleagues, urging them to slow down and demand that Mr. Obama release all the details of his plans before Congress gives him approval.

U.S. Trade Representative Michael B.G. Froman has insisted that the administration isn’t trying to deceive Congress. In a letter this month to Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Wisconsin Republican, Mr. Froman ruled out a number of areas where Republicans fear circumvention.

“The administration recognizes that the 2015 TPA bill does not provide the administration any new authority to enter into climate change agreements,” he wrote. “In addition, the administration is not negotiating language or provisions related to population control, family planning or related topics.”

One of the bills Republicans are trying to pass as part of the trade package, known as the customs enforcement legislation, adds even more restrictions to the president’s powers, including a specific prohibition on negotiating global warming or immigration deals as part of trade agreements.

Republican trade opponents fear that is not enough and worry that Mr. Obama will ignore that legislation, as they say he has done on other immigration and environmental issues.

Democratic trade opponents say their fear is just the opposite — that he would obey customs enforcement and miss out on a good chance to force the U.S. to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

Rep. Donna F. Edwards, Maryland Democrat, called the restrictions “shameful,” and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, cited the restraints on global warming negotiations as one of her major reasons for leading opposition against Mr. Obama’s chief domestic priority.

“We now have an absolute prohibition, a gag order where we can’t talk about climate in the greatest opportunity we would have to deal with climate change,” said Rep. Daniel T. Kildee Michigan Democrat.

Hollywood weighed in as well. Actor Mark Ruffalo, who portrays Dr. Bruce Banner in the “Avengers” movie franchise, called the restriction on global warming negotiations “insidious.”

“We cannot allow a trade deal that will put corporate profits above our climate, clean air, and water protections,” he said in a statement released by Public Citizen.

The trade package has been on weak legislative ground for weeks.

It survived an early vote in the Senate but seemed to have gone down to defeat in the House two weeks ago after opponents, chiefly liberal Democrats, voted against one of their own priorities — assistance for workers displaced by free trade — to poison the entire package.

Republican leaders, with the blessing of Mr. Obama, reworked the process and passed a stand-alone bill with fast-track negotiating powers but not the worker assistance.

The Senate will vote Tuesday on heading off a filibuster of the fast-track powers bill, then likely will vote Wednesday on the worker assistance legislation, which has been coupled with a popular set of trade preferences for African countries and Haiti — a bid to entice Democrats.

The White House said Mr. Obama was working the phones Monday in advance of the filibuster showdown.

The fast-track bill could go straight to the president after passage, but the worker assistance would have to go back to the House, where Democrats would be faced with a final decision on whether to further embarrass their party leader.

Congress also is likely to vote on beginning a conference committee to hammer out final details on the customs enforcement bill.

“With just a little more trust, a little more cooperation and simply voting consistently, we’ll get there,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus “ was a contagion ” for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad — and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply .

It will be 10 percent for aluminum.” Threats of retaliation poured in within days. “We are discussing different U.S. products from which import tariffs can be imposed.” Two weeks later, the president stoked growing fears that a trade war with China could be looming. He announced tariffs on consumer goods to punish China for stealing intellectual property from American companies. “This is the first of many.” The Chinese immediately responded with threats to retaliate against American products. These unilateral moves could test the strength of the global system for resolving trade disputes. Whether the product is technology, cheap chickens or, yes, even bananas.",www.nytimes.com,left,ppX1Uf1gxe1AwIbh

It would also be a drain on the economy. When Obama slapped heavy tariffs on Chinese tires, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found, he saved no more than 1,200 jobs—at an annual cost to consumers of $900,000 per job.

Spending nearly a million dollars to save a job that typically pays $41,000 a year is not a recipe for prosperity. It's the equivalent of selling $20 bills for a dollar apiece. Trump's dream of ""buy American and hire American"" would work exactly the same way.

Trump, of course, is a business magnate whose companies have sold products made everywhere from China to Honduras. In this case, wisdom lies in following his example, not his advice.

Collectively , the grouping represents more than 80 percent of the world 's economic output and two-thirds of its people . Its primary aim is to promote international financial stability .
The G20 Summit 2019 in Osaka , Japan has ended [ Reuters ]
The US-China trade war and climate change have been contentious issues during the G20 summit . Here are key excerpts from the G20 Declaration that reference them .
`` We strive to realize a free , fair , non-discriminatory , transparent , predictable and stable trade and investment environment , and to keep our markets open . International trade and investment are important engines of growth , productivity , innovation , job creation and development . We reaffirm our support for the necessary reform of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) to improve its functions .
`` We reaffirm our commitment to further strengthening the global financial safety net with a strong , quota-based , and adequately resourced International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) at its center .
An open and resilient financial system , grounded in agreed international standards , is crucial to support sustainable growth . We remain committed to the full , timely and consistent implementation of the agreed financial reforms . ''
`` Noting the important work of the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and Intergovernmental Science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Sources ( IPBES ) , and in the light of recent extreme weather events and disasters , we recognize the urgent need for addressing complex and pressing global issues and challenges , including climate change , resource efficiency , air , land , fresh water and marine pollution , including marine plastic litter , biodiversity loss , sustainable consumption and production , urban environmental quality and other environmental issues , and for promoting and leading energy transitions , with the best available science , while promoting sustainable growth
We emphasize the importance of providing financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in accordance with the Paris Agreement .
The United States reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement because it disadvantages American workers and taxpayers . The U.S. reaffirms its strong commitment to promoting economic growth , energy security and access , and environmental protection . The U.S. ’ s balanced approach to energy and environment allows for the delivery of affordable , reliable , and secure energy to all its citizens while utilizing all energy sources and technologies , including clean and advanced fossil fuels and technologies , renewables , and civil nuclear power , while also reducing emissions and promoting economic growth .

Erdogan says Trump wo n't impose sanctions on Turkey for buying Russian missile system
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his US counterpart Donald Trump informed him that the US would not impose sanctions on Turkey for buying Russian-made S-400 missiles .
The issue of sanctions had cropped up in an earlier bilateral meeting between the NATO allies , where Trump said they were working to ensure Turkey did not get penalised . Erdogan added that he expected the US to deliver US-made F-35 fighter jets in July as talks between the two countries continue .

When asked by a reporter about his ban on US companies selling high-tech components to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei , Trump said :
`` I did agree to allow our companies '' to sell equipment to the firm .
Huawei is a leader in the latest 5G mobile phone technology . The US says the company is a threat to US national security .
Trump said China will also be buying more US farm goods .
Trump was asked by a reporter if he agreed it was `` despicable '' for a government to kill a journalist .
Trump replied : `` Yes , I do . I think it 's horrible . Or anybody else , by the way . And if you look at Saudi Arabia , you see what 's happening , thirteen people , or so , have been prosecuted . Others are being prosecuted . They 've taken it very , very seriously . And they will continue to . ''
Trump : US wo n't raise tariffs on Chinese goods for now
President Donald Trump says the US will hold off raising tariffs on more than $ 300bn worth of Chinese goods while negotiations to end the trade war between the two countries continue .
`` We will be continuing to negotiate . And I promised that for at least the time being , we are not going to be lifting tariffs on China , and we wo n't be adding an additional , I guess we have $ 350bn left which could be taxed , or could be tariffed . And we 're not doing that . We 're going to work with China on where we left off to see if we can make a deal , '' Trump said at a news conference at the end of the two-day G20 Summit .

At the conclusion of the G20 Summit , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the leaders have agreed to principles governing the global economy .
`` Trade tensions are continuing , and that 's a risk . We have to keep those risks and tensions in mind . Still , we have united in agreeing that we have to lead the world economy , '' Abe said at a news conference .
`` There is some dissatisfaction between countries . So although there are concerns , what we have to do is establish principles to lead the world economy to the future . Free , fair and inclusive economy and open competition . Those principles have been affirmed between the leaders at this G20 meeting . ''
Abe also said the leaders discussed the rapidly evolving digitalisation of the world economy , plastic pollution of the seas and women 's rights .

North Korea said on Saturday US President Donald Trump 's offer to meet leader Kim Jong Un at the Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) is a `` very interesting suggestion , '' raising prospects for a third face-to-face meeting between the two leaders .
According to the North 's official Korean Central News Agency , First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said that the meeting , if realized , would serve as `` another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations . ''
But Choe said that North Korea has yet to receive an official proposal for the DMZ meeting from the US .
Earlier Saturday , Trump invited Kim to shake hands during his planned visit to the DMZ , which has served as a de-facto border between the Koreas since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War . Trump is scheduled to fly to South Korea later Saturday for a two-day trip after attending the G 20 Summit .
President Trump says he and Turkish President Erdogan were trying to find solutions to Turkey ’ s purchase of Russian made S-400 defence missiles , due to be delivered next month .
The US has threatened to impose sanctions on his NATO ally because of the purchase but Trump said President Barack Obama ’ s administration had placed unfair restrictions on Turkey ’ s plan to buy US-made Patriot missiles . Trump said Turkey had turned to Russia because of Obama 's move .
“ We ’ re looking at different solutions . It ’ s a problem there ’ s no question of about it , ” Trump said .
Trump also said he would visit NATO ally Turkey some time in the future .

Chinese state media : US wo n't levy new tariffs on Chinese exports
The Xinhua news agency is reporting that the US has agreed to not levy new tariffs on Chinese exports following talks between the two countries ' leaders .
China and the US have agreed to restart trade talks and will have discussions on specific issues , Xinhua said .
After a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , US President Donald Trump says relations between the two countries are `` back on track '' after a breakdown in trade talks last month .
`` We had a very , very good meeting with China . I would say probably even better than expected . The negotiations are continuing , '' Trump told reporters .
He said both sides will be making statements later on Saturday .
The meeting between the two has been seen by analysts and economists as the most important of the G20 Summit . They say a failure to agree on ways to ratchet down the US-China trade dispute could have dire consequences for the world economy .
In a joint press conference with representatives of France and the United Nations , Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for urgent action to address climate change .
`` In our view climate change concerns the future of mankind , '' he said , `` so our generation needs to make the right choice . All countries need to step up to the plate and deliver on their commitments in the Paris Agreement to the full extent . ''
He added : `` We must promote green infrastructure , green investment , and green financing . We look forward to working with like-minded parties to build a green Silk Road to achieve high-quality development and to leave behind a clean and beautiful world for future generations . ''
But these are rare words of support for fighting climate change during the G20 Summit .
While French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged not to sign any G20 statement that leaves out any reference to the 2015 Paris deal on combatting climate change , he ’ s up against the US , which is trying to stifle any mention of it . Under pressure from the US , Japan is on course to leave out references to global warming in the final communique .
Meanwhile G20 countries have increased their annual spending on coal-fired plants to $ 64bn , according to a report by the Overseas Development Institute . It also says G20 nations have tripled subsidies for the industry in recent years .

Who pays for Trump 's tariffs : US consumers , companies , or China ?
Meanwhile , Trump laid out his vision for the two countries trade relationship :
`` As you know we ’ ve had an excellent relationship but we want to do something that will even it up with respect to trade , '' Trump said .
`` I think it ’ s something that ’ s actually very easy to do . I actually think we were very close … something happened where it slipped a little bit and now we ’ re getting a little bit closer , but it would be historic if we could do a fair trade deal . We ’ re totally open to it and I know you ’ re totally open to it . I think we can go on to do something that would be truly be monumental and great for both countries and that ’ s what I look forward to doing . ''
The most highly anticipated event of this year ’ s G20 Summit is under way . US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are meeting to discuss their ongoing trade dispute .
Before their meeting they made brief statements to the media .
Xi reminded Trump about the history of modern relations between China and the US , starting with a table tennis tournament between American and Chinese players in the 1970s which paved the way for formal diplomatic relations which began in 1979 .
“ The small ball played a big role in moving world events , ” Xi said .
“ Forty years on , enormous change has taken place in the international situation and China-US relations , ” Xi said .
“ But one basic fact remains unchanged . China and the United States both benefit from cooperation and lose in a confrontation . Cooperation and dialogue are better than friction and confrontation . ”

Speaking to ███ 's programme Inside Story , Aly-Khan Satchu , economist and CEO of Rich Management , an investment advisory company in Kenya , thinks that both Presidents Trump and Xi are n't in the mood to compromise .
`` Overwhelming the summit is this gladiatorial combat between President Trump and Xi Jinping is the trade war , the tariff war . Essentially the direction of the global economy is going to be driven by whether these two can have a truce .
`` Both of whom are going to be unable to reconcile … . Trump is a train driver but the train tracks have been set and he can either speed it up or slow it down . Xi , the paramount leader … the nature of paramount leaders and you ’ re up on a pedestal and everyone can point at you and he can ’ t compromise either .
`` And while everyone ’ s talking about a big fat agenda , let ’ s make no mistake - this is about the two superpowers and about whether they can come to some kind of resolution . The direction of travel is much more adversarial and we should read the signs for what they are . ''
███ 's James Bays says the big event of the G20 Summit is the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping .
`` The big discussions are going to be about trade . And this is absolutely central , I think , to the mission of the G20 , which is about the world ’ s economic outlook because many are worried about the ongoing trade war between the US and China , '' says Bays .
`` Since May , trade negotiations broke down . Things could get worse or better . Trump , again , has been trumpeting about the state of the US stock market . But of course , the US stock market depends on the global economy . And economists are watching very , very closely what happens at this meeting . And they fear , in a worst-case scenario , if the trade war were to get worse , then it could tank the whole global economy . ''
US President Donald Trump held a working breakfast with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , also known as MBS , at a hotel in Osaka .
Neither of them answered questions about the investigation into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia 's consulate in Istanbul last year .
Trump heaped praise on MBS , saying it was `` a great honour '' to meet with him and described Saudi Arabia as `` a good purchaser of American products . '' Turning to MBS , Trump added , `` You 've done a really spectacular job . ''

US President Donald Trump began the second day of the G20 Summit by shifting the focus to the Korean Peninsula . In an early morning tweet he wrote :
`` After some very important meetings , including my meeting with President Xi of China , I will be leaving Japan for South Korea ( with President Moon ) . While there , if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this , I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello ( ? ) ! ''

While there , if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this , I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello ( ? ) ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 28 , 2019
It did not appear that US officials had warned North Korea in advance about Trump 's unexpected offer of a meeting , and it was n't clear whether or not such a meeting would prove feasible .
Japan 's Nikkei newspaper is reporting that the G20 leaders will agree to accelerate World Trade Organization ( WTO ) reforms but stop short of calling for the need to resist protectionism in a communique to be issued on Saturday .
The G20 members broadly agreed on the need to accelerate stalled WTO reforms in Friday 's session on global growth and trade , a Japanese government official told reporters , according to the Reuters news agency .
Instead of a pledge to resist protectionism , Japan is working with other G20 nations to urge members to promote a `` free , fair and non-discriminatory '' trade policy , the paper said . The proposal has been endorsed by several members already , it said without citing sources .
The G20 leaders will release the communique after they wrap up their two-day meeting on Saturday .
It will be the second straight G20 summit in which members forgo pledging the need to denounce protectionism . The language on protectionism was removed at last year 's summit in Buenos Aires , nodding to a request by Washington which is sensitive to criticism of the tariffs it is slapping on some G20 members .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped the US and China would make some progress towards defusing their ongoing trade dispute .
Germany 's export-oriented economy is extremely exposed to , and already suffering from , the impact of soured trade relations between the world 's largest and second-largest economies .
Merkel said in a statement that she had discussed trade in her bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump , who has taken to task both Beijing and Berlin , two of the world 's main exporters , on the issue .
`` We hope that discussions between China and the U.S. on the margins of this conference will , along with other talks , perhaps lead to successes , '' she told reporters .

An exiled advocate for China 's ethnic Uighur minority urged world leaders to act to prevent the disappearance of his people 's culture .
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Osaka meeting , Rebiya Kadeer said strong world pressure was essential to free an estimated one million people , mostly ethnic Uighurs , held in internment camps in western China .
`` ( The ) entire Uighur people are facing ( an ) existential threat , and it 's real and urgent , '' Kadeer , the 72-year-old head of the World Uyghur Congress , said through an interpreter . `` I call ( on ) European countries who are economically dependent on China to wake up and stand up against Chinese genocide of Uighurs and take practical actions immediately . ''
Chinese officials describe the camps as voluntary `` vocational education centres '' where Turkic-speaking Uighurs receive job training .
Kadeer 's presence in Osaka will no doubt anger China , which labels her a dangerous separatist and has previously condemned Japan for allowing her entry .
Trump prepares for 'productive ' talks with Xi on trade war
US President Donald Trump said he hoped for productive talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on a trade war that is casting a shadow on global growth , but added he had not made any promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs .
Concerns remain that an agreement will not be reached between China and the US .
`` At a minimum , it will be productive , '' Trump said of the meeting with Xi .
`` We 'll see what happens and what comes out of it , '' Trump told reporters after a series of meetings with leaders where he made clear his priority was two-way trade deals to boost the US economy .
Asked , however , if he had promised Xi a six-month reprieve on imposing new tariffs on a $ 300bn list of Chinese imports , Trump said : `` No . ''
China hopes US can meet it halfway in G20 talks
China 's Foreign Ministry expressed hope Washington can `` meet China halfway '' as President Xi prepares to meet Trump amid a costly tariff fight over trade and technology .
Investors are hoping for a repeat of Trump and Xi 's December agreement to postpone new tariff hikes and other action while they tried to negotiate a settlement . But analysts caution any truce at the G20 is likely to be temporary because of the array of disputes that separate the two sides .
The two sides are in a stalemate after 11 rounds of talks . Beijing has said any agreement must be balanced and rejects US complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology .
`` We hope that the US can meet China halfway and work together with us to promote a positive result from the meeting , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said . `` This is in the interest of both countries and also meets the common expectation of the international community . ''
Leaders of Russia , India and China have urged joint action against unilateralism .
Meeting on Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit , Russian President Vladimir Putin , China 's Xi , and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about ways to bolster ties between their nations .
Putin emphasised the three countries agreed on the need to rely on international law , respect national sovereignty , and refrain from interference in internal affairs of other nations .
He added they held meetings with foreign ministers and top security officials to coordinate action against terrorism , drug trafficking and other challenges .
Putin noted Russia , China and India firmly oppose protectionism , unilateral actions , and unlawful sanctions .
British Prime Minister Theresa May told Putin that Russia must end its `` irresponsible and destabilising activity '' if relations between the two countries , soured by the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil , were to improve .
May also told the Russian president during their G20 meeting she wanted the two Russians that the United Kingdom says is responsible for the attack on Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year brought to justice .
`` The prime minister said that the use of a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Salisbury formed part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour and was a truly despicable act that led to the death of a British citizen , Dawn Sturgess , '' a statement from her office said .
`` [ She ] underlined that we remain open to a different relationship , but for that to happen the Russian government must choose a different path . ''
In a meeting with President Xi , Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe brought up the issue of the ongoing protests against a proposed law in Hong Kong that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China .
Abe said it was important to preserve the territory 's freedoms for it to `` prosper under 'one country , two systems ' policy . '' Before the summit began , Xi had said he did n't want the subject raised . But Hong Kong activists have urged the G20 leaders to put pressure on the Chinese government .

The US is trying to get G20 leaders to soften their stance against climate change . But the EU countries have fiercely rejected it . French President Emmanuel Macron said removing any reference to the Paris deal in the final statement would be a red line for him .

It 's a tense time between Russia and the US , but not a tense relationship between their leaders , says ███ 's James Bays [ Kevin Lamarque/Reuters ]
Donald Trump has met Russian President Vladimir Putin . ███ 's James Bays was also there :
`` There are many key issues these two countries differ on . And certainly , if you were to speak privately to military commanders in the US , they say they are deeply concerned about Russia , and Russia 's threats in Ukraine , Russia 's involvement in Syria , Russia trying to pull out of some treaties governing nuclear relations between the two .
`` It is a tense time , but not a tense relationship , it seems , between the two leaders . ''
Over the clatter of photographers ' cameras , a reporter asked Trump if he was going to tell Putin not to meddle in US elections in the future . Trump replied : `` Yes , of course , I will . '' He then turned to Putin with a smile and said , `` Do n't meddle with the election , please ! ''

One of the sticking points in the US-China trade war is the move by Trump to bar US companies from selling key components like computer chips to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei , a leader in the latest 5G mobile phone technology , on national security grounds .
EU leaders on Friday warned of the damage that escalating US-China trade frictions were inflicting on the global economy , as the summit got under way .
The US-China trade relations are `` difficult '' and contributing to a slowdown in the global economy , European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told a news conference , Reuters reported .
He also said the EU was working closely with the US , China and Japan on reforming the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
Meanwhile , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke about the need to reform the WTO .
The development of the global economy is largely driven by one-sided decisions and disputes felt by the entire system , he said .
`` We should still focus on the World Trade Organization reform to achieve balanced development of the global economy and so this growth is open to everyone , '' Modi told a meeting of leaders from Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa , collectively known as the BRICS countries , on the sidelines of the G20 summit .

███ 's James Bays on how the Japanese have avoided upsetting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at this year 's G20 : `` It 's worth noting that the last time there was a G20 in Buenos Aires , the family photo focused on him because there were some that would n't shake his hand .
`` I think the Japanese organisers knew that was embarrassing for Saudi Arabia , and we 've seen that some of the shots of the various leaders walking together to the family photo were kept very , very wide .
`` You could n't really make anyone out , so that , I think , the moments when people were looking rather coldly towards others or were n't shaking hands were n't really evident to us . ''
Chinese President Xi said on Friday the Gulf region is now in a very sensitive situation and is `` standing at a crossroads of war and peace '' , state media reported .
China always stands on the side of peace and opposes the war , Xi told United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka , state news agency Xinhua said .
After his meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and India 's Modi , President Trump had a bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , whom he called `` a fantastic person , a fantastic woman . ''
Subjects discussed included Iran , Libya , supporting the economy of Ukraine , trade negotiations with China , and global trade standards more generally .
After the meeting , Prime Minister Abe greeted each of the G20 leaders one-by-one .
Mason Richey , a professor of international relations at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul , tells ███ : `` I think that Trump is going to be interested in playing up the positive side of the relationships that the US has with allies and strategic partners whether that be Japan , or whether that be NATO or whether that be India .
`` And I think in some ways he 's perhaps playing good-cop-bad-cop with himself . He 's played bad cop with Japan and India on security issues and on trade issues . And now he 's a there playing up the positive side of the relationship , talking about how close the US relationship is with India and Japan . ''

President Trump arrived at the G20 summit venue by car and was greeted by Prime Minister Abe , the host .
`` We 'll be discussing trade , we 'll be discussing military , '' Trump told reporters , praising Japanese car companies building plants in the US .
`` The car companies have been terrific . They 're coming in and they 're building magnificent plants . We have n't had that , and we very much appreciate it . ''
North Korea , Iran , and bilateral trade were issues raised in the discussions , though few details were offered .
Later , Indian Prime Minister Modi joined for a trilateral meeting . Abe described the grouping as `` the foundation of peace and prosperity in the region '' .
As for US-India trade talks , Trump declared , `` It 'll be very positive ... I think we will just continue to get along with India ... I think we are going to have some very big things to announce . Very big trade deal . ''
In a tweet on Thursday , Trump said Indian tariffs on US products were `` unacceptable '' .

Earlier this month , India imposed higher retaliatory tariffs on 28 US goods such as walnuts , almonds and apples .
That was in retaliation for Trump 's move to scrap trade privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences ( GSP ) for India , the biggest beneficiary of a scheme that allowed duty-free exports of up to $ 5.6bn a year .
Speaking of Iran , Trump stated , `` We have a lot of time - there 's no rush they can take their time . There is absolutely no time pressure . Hopefully , in the end , it 's going to work out . If it does , great , if it does n't , you 'll be hearing about it . ''","The annual summit of the Group of 20 nations has ended in Osaka, Japan. The ongoing trade war between China and the United States, the world's two biggest economies, topped the agenda.

The G20 is an international leaders' forum comprising 19 countries and the European Union.

Collectively, the grouping represents more than 80 percent of the world's economic output and two-thirds of its people. Its primary aim is to promote international financial stability.

The G20 Summit 2019 in Osaka, Japan has ended [Reuters]

The G20 Declaration

The US-China trade war and climate change have been contentious issues during the G20 summit. Here are key excerpts from the G20 Declaration that reference them.

Global business environment

""We strive to realize a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open. International trade and investment are important engines of growth, productivity, innovation, job creation and development. We reaffirm our support for the necessary reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to improve its functions.



""We reaffirm our commitment to further strengthening the global financial safety net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced International Monetary Fund (IMF) at its center.



An open and resilient financial system, grounded in agreed international standards, is crucial to support sustainable growth. We remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation of the agreed financial reforms.""

Work on climate change

""Noting the important work of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Intergovernmental Science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Sources (IPBES), and in the light of recent extreme weather events and disasters, we recognize the urgent need for addressing complex and pressing global issues and challenges, including climate change, resource efficiency, air, land, fresh water and marine pollution, including marine plastic litter, biodiversity loss, sustainable consumption and production, urban environmental quality and other environmental issues, and for promoting and leading energy transitions, with the best available science, while promoting sustainable growth



We emphasize the importance of providing financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in accordance with the Paris Agreement.



The United States reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement because it disadvantages American workers and taxpayers. The U.S. reaffirms its strong commitment to promoting economic growth, energy security and access, and environmental protection. The U.S.’s balanced approach to energy and environment allows for the delivery of affordable, reliable, and secure energy to all its citizens while utilizing all energy sources and technologies, including clean and advanced fossil fuels and technologies, renewables, and civil nuclear power, while also reducing emissions and promoting economic growth.""

Erdogan says Trump won't impose sanctions on Turkey for buying Russian missile system

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his US counterpart Donald Trump informed him that the US would not impose sanctions on Turkey for buying Russian-made S-400 missiles.

The issue of sanctions had cropped up in an earlier bilateral meeting between the NATO allies, where Trump said they were working to ensure Turkey did not get penalised. Erdogan added that he expected the US to deliver US-made F-35 fighter jets in July as talks between the two countries continue.

Trump: US companies can sell equipment to Huawei

When asked by a reporter about his ban on US companies selling high-tech components to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, Trump said:

""I did agree to allow our companies"" to sell equipment to the firm.

Huawei is a leader in the latest 5G mobile phone technology. The US says the company is a threat to US national security.

Trump said China will also be buying more US farm goods.

Trump on Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi

Trump was asked by a reporter if he agreed it was ""despicable"" for a government to kill a journalist.

Trump replied: ""Yes, I do. I think it's horrible. Or anybody else, by the way. And if you look at Saudi Arabia, you see what's happening, thirteen people, or so, have been prosecuted. Others are being prosecuted. They've taken it very, very seriously. And they will continue to.""

Trump: US won't raise tariffs on Chinese goods for now

President Donald Trump says the US will hold off raising tariffs on more than $300bn worth of Chinese goods while negotiations to end the trade war between the two countries continue.

""We will be continuing to negotiate. And I promised that for at least the time being, we are not going to be lifting tariffs on China, and we won't be adding an additional, I guess we have $350bn left which could be taxed, or could be tariffed. And we're not doing that. We're going to work with China on where we left off to see if we can make a deal,"" Trump said at a news conference at the end of the two-day G20 Summit.

Japan's Abe: G20 heads to promote 'inclusive economy'

At the conclusion of the G20 Summit, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the leaders have agreed to principles governing the global economy.

""Trade tensions are continuing, and that's a risk. We have to keep those risks and tensions in mind. Still, we have united in agreeing that we have to lead the world economy,"" Abe said at a news conference.

""There is some dissatisfaction between countries. So although there are concerns, what we have to do is establish principles to lead the world economy to the future. Free, fair and inclusive economy and open competition. Those principles have been affirmed between the leaders at this G20 meeting.""

Abe also said the leaders discussed the rapidly evolving digitalisation of the world economy, plastic pollution of the seas and women's rights.

North Korea: Trump's offer to meet 'very interesting'

North Korea said on Saturday US President Donald Trump's offer to meet leader Kim Jong Un at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a ""very interesting suggestion,"" raising prospects for a third face-to-face meeting between the two leaders.

According to the North's official Korean Central News Agency, First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said that the meeting, if realized, would serve as ""another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations.""

But Choe said that North Korea has yet to receive an official proposal for the DMZ meeting from the US.

Earlier Saturday, Trump invited Kim to shake hands during his planned visit to the DMZ, which has served as a de-facto border between the Koreas since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Trump is scheduled to fly to South Korea later Saturday for a two-day trip after attending the G 20 Summit.

Trump: Turkey's missile deal is 'complicated'

President Trump says he and Turkish President Erdogan were trying to find solutions to Turkey’s purchase of Russian made S-400 defence missiles, due to be delivered next month.

The US has threatened to impose sanctions on his NATO ally because of the purchase but Trump said President Barack Obama’s administration had placed unfair restrictions on Turkey’s plan to buy US-made Patriot missiles. Trump said Turkey had turned to Russia because of Obama's move.

“We’re looking at different solutions. It’s a problem there’s no question of about it,” Trump said.

Trump also said he would visit NATO ally Turkey some time in the future.

Chinese state media: US won't levy new tariffs on Chinese exports

The Xinhua news agency is reporting that the US has agreed to not levy new tariffs on Chinese exports following talks between the two countries' leaders.

China and the US have agreed to restart trade talks and will have discussions on specific issues, Xinhua said.

Trump: Relations with China are 'back on track'

After a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, US President Donald Trump says relations between the two countries are ""back on track"" after a breakdown in trade talks last month.

""We had a very, very good meeting with China. I would say probably even better than expected. The negotiations are continuing,"" Trump told reporters.

He said both sides will be making statements later on Saturday.

The meeting between the two has been seen by analysts and economists as the most important of the G20 Summit. They say a failure to agree on ways to ratchet down the US-China trade dispute could have dire consequences for the world economy.

Cooling on the climate

In a joint press conference with representatives of France and the United Nations, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for urgent action to address climate change.

""In our view climate change concerns the future of mankind,"" he said, ""so our generation needs to make the right choice. All countries need to step up to the plate and deliver on their commitments in the Paris Agreement to the full extent.""

He added: ""We must promote green infrastructure, green investment, and green financing. We look forward to working with like-minded parties to build a green Silk Road to achieve high-quality development and to leave behind a clean and beautiful world for future generations.""

But these are rare words of support for fighting climate change during the G20 Summit.

While French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged not to sign any G20 statement that leaves out any reference to the 2015 Paris deal on combatting climate change, he’s up against the US, which is trying to stifle any mention of it. Under pressure from the US, Japan is on course to leave out references to global warming in the final communique.

Meanwhile G20 countries have increased their annual spending on coal-fired plants to $64bn, according to a report by the Overseas Development Institute. It also says G20 nations have tripled subsidies for the industry in recent years.

Trump-Xi meeting under way: Seeking a 'historic' trade deal

Meanwhile, Trump laid out his vision for the two countries trade relationship:

""As you know we’ve had an excellent relationship but we want to do something that will even it up with respect to trade,"" Trump said.

""I think it’s something that’s actually very easy to do. I actually think we were very close … something happened where it slipped a little bit and now we’re getting a little bit closer, but it would be historic if we could do a fair trade deal. We’re totally open to it and I know you’re totally open to it. I think we can go on to do something that would be truly be monumental and great for both countries and that’s what I look forward to doing.""

Trump-Xi meeting under way: Ping pong diplomacy and trade

The most highly anticipated event of this year’s G20 Summit is under way. US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are meeting to discuss their ongoing trade dispute.

Before their meeting they made brief statements to the media.

Xi reminded Trump about the history of modern relations between China and the US, starting with a table tennis tournament between American and Chinese players in the 1970s which paved the way for formal diplomatic relations which began in 1979.

“The small ball played a big role in moving world events,” Xi said.

“Forty years on, enormous change has taken place in the international situation and China-US relations,” Xi said.

“But one basic fact remains unchanged. China and the United States both benefit from cooperation and lose in a confrontation. Cooperation and dialogue are better than friction and confrontation.”

No sign of rapprochement over trade war?

Speaking to Al Jazeera's programme Inside Story, Aly-Khan Satchu, economist and CEO of Rich Management, an investment advisory company in Kenya, thinks that both Presidents Trump and Xi aren't in the mood to compromise.



""Overwhelming the summit is this gladiatorial combat between President Trump and Xi Jinping is the trade war, the tariff war. Essentially the direction of the global economy is going to be driven by whether these two can have a truce.

""Both of whom are going to be unable to reconcile … . Trump is a train driver but the train tracks have been set and he can either speed it up or slow it down. Xi, the paramount leader … the nature of paramount leaders and you’re up on a pedestal and everyone can point at you and he can’t compromise either.

""And while everyone’s talking about a big fat agenda, let’s make no mistake - this is about the two superpowers and about whether they can come to some kind of resolution. The direction of travel is much more adversarial and we should read the signs for what they are.""





The lead-up to the Trump-Xi meeting

Al Jazeera's James Bays says the big event of the G20 Summit is the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

""The big discussions are going to be about trade. And this is absolutely central, I think, to the mission of the G20, which is about the world’s economic outlook because many are worried about the ongoing trade war between the US and China,"" says Bays.

""Since May, trade negotiations broke down. Things could get worse or better. Trump, again, has been trumpeting about the state of the US stock market. But of course, the US stock market depends on the global economy. And economists are watching very, very closely what happens at this meeting. And they fear, in a worst-case scenario, if the trade war were to get worse, then it could tank the whole global economy.""

Trump-MBS bilateral meeting

US President Donald Trump held a working breakfast with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, at a hotel in Osaka.

Neither of them answered questions about the investigation into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul last year.

Trump heaped praise on MBS, saying it was ""a great honour"" to meet with him and described Saudi Arabia as ""a good purchaser of American products."" Turning to MBS, Trump added, ""You've done a really spectacular job.""

'Hello': Another Trump-Kim meeting on the cards?

US President Donald Trump began the second day of the G20 Summit by shifting the focus to the Korean Peninsula. In an early morning tweet he wrote:

""After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!""

After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2019

It did not appear that US officials had warned North Korea in advance about Trump's unexpected offer of a meeting, and it wasn't clear whether or not such a meeting would prove feasible.

Resisting protectionism

Japan's Nikkei newspaper is reporting that the G20 leaders will agree to accelerate World Trade Organization (WTO) reforms but stop short of calling for the need to resist protectionism in a communique to be issued on Saturday.

The G20 members broadly agreed on the need to accelerate stalled WTO reforms in Friday's session on global growth and trade, a Japanese government official told reporters, according to the Reuters news agency.

Instead of a pledge to resist protectionism, Japan is working with other G20 nations to urge members to promote a ""free, fair and non-discriminatory"" trade policy, the paper said. The proposal has been endorsed by several members already, it said without citing sources.

The G20 leaders will release the communique after they wrap up their two-day meeting on Saturday.

It will be the second straight G20 summit in which members forgo pledging the need to denounce protectionism. The language on protectionism was removed at last year's summit in Buenos Aires, nodding to a request by Washington which is sensitive to criticism of the tariffs it is slapping on some G20 members.

Merkel hopes for US-China trade resolution

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped the US and China would make some progress towards defusing their ongoing trade dispute.

Germany's export-oriented economy is extremely exposed to, and already suffering from, the impact of soured trade relations between the world's largest and second-largest economies.

Merkel said in a statement that she had discussed trade in her bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump, who has taken to task both Beijing and Berlin, two of the world's main exporters, on the issue.

""We hope that discussions between China and the U.S. on the margins of this conference will, along with other talks, perhaps lead to successes,"" she told reporters.

Uighur leader urges world leaders to pressure China

An exiled advocate for China's ethnic Uighur minority urged world leaders to act to prevent the disappearance of his people's culture.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Osaka meeting, Rebiya Kadeer said strong world pressure was essential to free an estimated one million people, mostly ethnic Uighurs, held in internment camps in western China.

""(The) entire Uighur people are facing (an) existential threat, and it's real and urgent,"" Kadeer, the 72-year-old head of the World Uyghur Congress, said through an interpreter. ""I call (on) European countries who are economically dependent on China to wake up and stand up against Chinese genocide of Uighurs and take practical actions immediately.""

Chinese officials describe the camps as voluntary ""vocational education centres"" where Turkic-speaking Uighurs receive job training.

Kadeer's presence in Osaka will no doubt anger China, which labels her a dangerous separatist and has previously condemned Japan for allowing her entry.

Trump prepares for 'productive' talks with Xi on trade war

US President Donald Trump said he hoped for productive talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on a trade war that is casting a shadow on global growth, but added he had not made any promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs.

Concerns remain that an agreement will not be reached between China and the US.

""At a minimum, it will be productive,"" Trump said of the meeting with Xi.

""We'll see what happens and what comes out of it,"" Trump told reporters after a series of meetings with leaders where he made clear his priority was two-way trade deals to boost the US economy.

Asked, however, if he had promised Xi a six-month reprieve on imposing new tariffs on a $300bn list of Chinese imports, Trump said: ""No.""

China hopes US can meet it halfway in G20 talks

China's Foreign Ministry expressed hope Washington can ""meet China halfway"" as President Xi prepares to meet Trump amid a costly tariff fight over trade and technology.

Investors are hoping for a repeat of Trump and Xi's December agreement to postpone new tariff hikes and other action while they tried to negotiate a settlement. But analysts caution any truce at the G20 is likely to be temporary because of the array of disputes that separate the two sides.

The two sides are in a stalemate after 11 rounds of talks. Beijing has said any agreement must be balanced and rejects US complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.

""We hope that the US can meet China halfway and work together with us to promote a positive result from the meeting,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. ""This is in the interest of both countries and also meets the common expectation of the international community.""

Russia, India, China condemn 'unilateralism'

Leaders of Russia, India and China have urged joint action against unilateralism.

Meeting on Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin, China's Xi, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about ways to bolster ties between their nations.

Putin emphasised the three countries agreed on the need to rely on international law, respect national sovereignty, and refrain from interference in internal affairs of other nations.

He added they held meetings with foreign ministers and top security officials to coordinate action against terrorism, drug trafficking and other challenges.

Putin noted Russia, China and India firmly oppose protectionism, unilateral actions, and unlawful sanctions.

Russia must end 'irresponsible activity', May tells Putin

British Prime Minister Theresa May told Putin that Russia must end its ""irresponsible and destabilising activity"" if relations between the two countries, soured by the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil, were to improve.

May also told the Russian president during their G20 meeting she wanted the two Russians that the United Kingdom says is responsible for the attack on Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year brought to justice.

""The prime minister said that the use of a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Salisbury formed part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour and was a truly despicable act that led to the death of a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess,"" a statement from her office said.

""[She] underlined that we remain open to a different relationship, but for that to happen the Russian government must choose a different path.""

Russia has denied any involvement in the attack.

Hong Kong still a hot button issue

In a meeting with President Xi, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe brought up the issue of the ongoing protests against a proposed law in Hong Kong that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.

Abe said it was important to preserve the territory's freedoms for it to ""prosper under 'one country, two systems' policy."" Before the summit began, Xi had said he didn't want the subject raised. But Hong Kong activists have urged the G20 leaders to put pressure on the Chinese government.

Climate change divides G20 nations

The US is trying to get G20 leaders to soften their stance against climate change. But the EU countries have fiercely rejected it. French President Emmanuel Macron said removing any reference to the Paris deal in the final statement would be a red line for him.

World leaders need to really listen - there is no such thing as clean coal!

Trump-Putin meeting

It's a tense time between Russia and the US, but not a tense relationship between their leaders, says Al Jazeera's James Bays [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]

Donald Trump has met Russian President Vladimir Putin. Al Jazeera's James Bays was also there:

""There are many key issues these two countries differ on. And certainly, if you were to speak privately to military commanders in the US, they say they are deeply concerned about Russia, and Russia's threats in Ukraine, Russia's involvement in Syria, Russia trying to pull out of some treaties governing nuclear relations between the two.

""It is a tense time, but not a tense relationship, it seems, between the two leaders.""

Over the clatter of photographers' cameras, a reporter asked Trump if he was going to tell Putin not to meddle in US elections in the future. Trump replied: ""Yes, of course, I will."" He then turned to Putin with a smile and said, ""Don't meddle with the election, please!""

Focus on technology and data

After the photo session, leaders attended the ""Side-Event on Digital Economy"".

Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a ""fair, just, and non-discriminatory market environment"" and added that ""data to the digital economy is the same as oil to industrial economies"".

President Trump's comments struck a more cautious note: ""At the same time as we expand digital trade, we must also ensure the resilience and security of our 5G network,"" he said.

One of the sticking points in the US-China trade war is the move by Trump to bar US companies from selling key components like computer chips to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, a leader in the latest 5G mobile phone technology, on national security grounds.

Trade war damages global growth

EU leaders on Friday warned of the damage that escalating US-China trade frictions were inflicting on the global economy, as the summit got under way.

The US-China trade relations are ""difficult"" and contributing to a slowdown in the global economy, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told a news conference, Reuters reported.

He also said the EU was working closely with the US, China and Japan on reforming the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke about the need to reform the WTO.

The development of the global economy is largely driven by one-sided decisions and disputes felt by the entire system, he said.

""We should still focus on the World Trade Organization reform to achieve balanced development of the global economy and so this growth is open to everyone,"" Modi told a meeting of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, collectively known as the BRICS countries, on the sidelines of the G20 summit.

No awkward moments for Saudi crown prince

Al Jazeera's James Bays on how the Japanese have avoided upsetting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at this year's G20: ""It's worth noting that the last time there was a G20 in Buenos Aires, the family photo focused on him because there were some that wouldn't shake his hand.

""I think the Japanese organisers knew that was embarrassing for Saudi Arabia, and we've seen that some of the shots of the various leaders walking together to the family photo were kept very, very wide.

""You couldn't really make anyone out, so that, I think, the moments when people were looking rather coldly towards others or weren't shaking hands weren't really evident to us.""

China's Xi says Gulf region is at a 'crossroads'

Chinese President Xi said on Friday the Gulf region is now in a very sensitive situation and is ""standing at a crossroads of war and peace"", state media reported.

China always stands on the side of peace and opposes the war, Xi told United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, state news agency Xinhua said.

'A fantastic woman'

After his meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and India's Modi, President Trump had a bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he called ""a fantastic person, a fantastic woman.""

Subjects discussed included Iran, Libya, supporting the economy of Ukraine, trade negotiations with China, and global trade standards more generally.

After the meeting, Prime Minister Abe greeted each of the G20 leaders one-by-one.

Trump's 'good cop, bad cop' act

Mason Richey, a professor of international relations at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, tells Al Jazeera: ""I think that Trump is going to be interested in playing up the positive side of the relationships that the US has with allies and strategic partners whether that be Japan, or whether that be NATO or whether that be India.

""And I think in some ways he's perhaps playing good-cop-bad-cop with himself. He's played bad cop with Japan and India on security issues and on trade issues. And now he's a there playing up the positive side of the relationship, talking about how close the US relationship is with India and Japan.""

Trump, Modi and Abe meet

President Trump arrived at the G20 summit venue by car and was greeted by Prime Minister Abe, the host.

""We'll be discussing trade, we'll be discussing military,"" Trump told reporters, praising Japanese car companies building plants in the US.

""The car companies have been terrific. They're coming in and they're building magnificent plants. We haven't had that, and we very much appreciate it.""

North Korea, Iran, and bilateral trade were issues raised in the discussions, though few details were offered.

Later, Indian Prime Minister Modi joined for a trilateral meeting. Abe described the grouping as ""the foundation of peace and prosperity in the region"".

As for US-India trade talks, Trump declared, ""It'll be very positive ... I think we will just continue to get along with India ... I think we are going to have some very big things to announce. Very big trade deal.""

In a tweet on Thursday, Trump said Indian tariffs on US products were ""unacceptable"".

Earlier this month, India imposed higher retaliatory tariffs on 28 US goods such as walnuts, almonds and apples.

That was in retaliation for Trump's move to scrap trade privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for India, the biggest beneficiary of a scheme that allowed duty-free exports of up to $5.6bn a year.

Speaking of Iran, Trump stated, ""We have a lot of time - there's no rush they can take their time. There is absolutely no time pressure. Hopefully, in the end, it's going to work out. If it does, great, if it doesn't, you'll be hearing about it.""",www.aljazeera.com,left,87PJwty008Y3yGp2

As the trade bill was on the brink of collapse , Reid sat silently at his desk on the Senate floor — not lifting a finger to either kill the bill or help the president of his own party .
It was an oddly complacent posture for the Nevadan , considering the dominating presence he ’ s been atop the Senate Democratic Caucus for years . His restraint reflected how divisive the trade debate has become for the White House and progressives — as well as Reid ’ s desire to quickly move on to a more politically palatable issue . And by not continuing to press what almost surely would have been a losing hand , Reid ’ s bond with Obama appears to have persevered through the biggest clash between the White House and Senate Democrats in the six years of Obama ’ s presidency .
“ It ’ s not going to affect our relationship , ” Reid said of the president during an interview Thursday . “ We ’ ve been to the dance together lots of times , and just because he didn ’ t take me home this time , I ’ m not mad at him . ”
Sitting back in his chair and wearing sunglasses covering his blinded right eye , a relaxed Reid was resigned to the outcome of the trade fight , which cleared a filibuster that he supported on Thursday . Reid said he “ tried not to be an obstacle ” to Obama ’ s trade agenda , even though he staunchly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the “ fast-track ” trade bill .
“ I knew what the outcome ’ s going to be for a long time , ” Reid said . “ In my caucus , we have a dozen people who have been pro-trade . That ’ s why I ’ ve been very careful in trying to understand them , and of course the vast majority of Democrats who are against the trade bill . So I ’ ve tried not to be an obstacle to the bill passing . ”
Asked why he didn ’ t try to line up the votes to kill legislation he strongly opposes , Reid shrugged and said , “ Well , maybe I didn ’ t want to . ”
How the 75-year-old Reid handled the issue showcases the challenge of overseeing a caucus that ’ s still adjusting to minority status after huge election losses last fall . He ’ s had to balance the demands of liberal hard-liners and moderates who are hungry for compromise and blamed Reid ’ s tight grip of the legislative process for some of their political problems .
Reid is also contending , of course , with a president who is eager to solidify his legacy during his final two years — even if that means , at times , dividing his party on Capitol Hill . The tensions hit a high mark a few weeks ago when the president dismissed Warren as a “ politician like everybody else . ”
Reid said he wasn ’ t upset with Obama over the remarks .
“ He was at some press event and spoke out , ” Reid said . “ He ’ s frustrated . I understand that , I ’ ve been that way a few times myself . ”
“ This is not personal , ” she said in an interview . “ This is about issues that powerfully affect working families all across this country . ”
Warren , who sits on Reid ’ s leadership team , defended the senior senator ’ s handling of the trade legislation . Should he have taken a stronger stand to buttress opposition ?
“ He ’ s managing the caucus the way he should , ” Warren responded . “ He ’ s the kind of leader we need . He listens to all sides , and he stands up for what he believes in . ”
So far this Congress , Reid has succeeded , at times , in forcing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bend to his demands , notably to drop an effort to kill Obama ’ s immigration actions and fully fund the Department of Homeland Security . But his caucus has also had its share of missteps , such as its handling of a human trafficking bill that contained abortion language Democrats failed to notice .
And after demanding that McConnell finish surveillance and highway measures before taking up the trade bill , Reid backed down , bowing to pressure from pro-trade Democrats .
Last week , Reid lined up his caucus to oppose taking up the trade bill over concerns that enforcement issues were not being taken seriously , causing an embarrassing setback for the president . The next day , however , Reid and his successor , Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , cut a deal to bring the fast-track bill to the floor in exchange for some concessions . Whether Democrats got anything significant out of the exercise is a matter of debate .
Still , Reid contends that such deal-making would never have occurred if Republicans were still in the minority .

“ If we think that something is good , we just move to it , we don ’ t mess around with it , ” Reid said . “ If we feel there ’ s things that should be slowed , we should slow them down , as we did on trade … We ’ ll continue to do that . But I wish I ’ d had 3 percent of the cooperation that I ’ ve given them when they were stopping everything . ”
Republicans and some moderate Democrats , though , say that ’ s a charitable interpretation of recent events .

“ There are lots of strong , opinionated voices in the caucus , ” he said , “ but Leader Reid always does a great job listening to people , trying to bring people together and moving the caucus forward . ”
It ’ s true that the Republican Senate has been voting more than the last Congress . Just this year , the Senate has voted on more amendments through Thursday than during the same period in 2014 and 2013 combined . It has taken 185 roll call votes through May 21 , more than the 161 in 2013 and 131 in 2014 over the same number of days .
But new majorities frequently exhibit a youthful exuberance . When Democrats took the Senate in 2007 and made Reid the majority leader , the Senate ended up voting on more than 200 amendments . Through all of 2014 , the last year of the Democratic majority , Reid ’ s Senate voted on just 15 amendments — though both parties bore responsibility for the meager activity .
There are already signs McConnell ’ s Senate is struggling to keep up the pace set in January , when the GOP took up more than 30 amendments to legislation concerning the Keystone XL pipeline . Just two amendments apiece have been considered for the trade bill and an Iran nuclear deal review bill .

Read more opinion LISTEN TO ARTICLE 6:31 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email
There ’ s no chance China will cut its trade surplus with the U.S. in response to President Donald Trump ’ s tariff threats . For starters , Washington has made no specific demand to which Beijing can respond . But its efforts may have an unexpected side effect : a debt crisis in China .
The 25 percent additional tariffs on exports of machinery and electronics looked , at first blush , like a stealth tax on offshoring . The focus on categories like semiconductors and nuclear components , in which U.S.-owned manufacturers in China are strong , recalled Trump ’ s 2016 promise to tax “ any business that leaves our country . ”
It seems , though , that offshoring wasn ’ t the target after all . Now , with the imposition of new tariffs on low-value exports that mostly involve Asian value chains , the simple fact of selling cheap products that the U.S. buys has become the problem .
Either way , the administration appears set on shrinking its current-account deficit ( which , at a moderate 2.4 percent of GDP , is far lower than the 6 percent clocked in 2006-7 ) just as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates . Distress has already been registered in China . On July 13 , the yuan ( also known as the renminbi ) hit 6.725 to the dollar , the weakest in a year and 5 percent lower than at the end of May .
Such a move is nothing earth-shaking for less controlled currencies . But a stable renminbi is a key plank in the leadership ’ s promise to its people , and the exchange rate is tightly managed by the central bank .
Chinese investors have been buying official assurances for a year that the renminbi would be a fortress , but now they ’ re not so sure and are exporting money again : May saw net capital outflows and a decline in the foreign-exchange reserves . The currency is the most visible sign of slippage in the image that China tries to project of an economy so brilliantly managed that the bright sun of GDP expansion is untroubled by even temporary clouds on trade , employment or consumption .
There are many other signs : The Shanghai Composite Index of stocks has declined 7 percent in a month , dropping below the government ’ s red line of 3,000 for the first time since September 2016 . Corporate bonds are about to set a record for the most defaults in a year . Junk bond yields are spiking . The chorus of anxiety about debt is reaching a crescendo , with daily press reports on governments that can ’ t pay their employees or meet pension obligations . Property prices are tumbling in some cities and frozen in others whose governments have placed a finger in the dyke by halting transactions .
That the massive burden of debt will drag the economy into recession is as obvious as the empty towers that rise on every landscape . Precise estimates are difficult , since the government ’ s dedication to the optics of invincibility induces financial institutions to push debt into alternate , opaque channels . But on any metric , the amount of new lending each year grows faster than the economy , and the interest newly owed exceeds the incremental rise in GDP . In other words , the whole economy is a Ponzi scheme .
Many analysts point out that the Chinese government owns everything , including the banks , and can just issue renminbi to infinity to keep the economy solvent . The flaw in that argument is China ’ s role in the global economy : It ’ s the world ’ s biggest exporter and second-biggest importer . The currency acts as the interface between the domestic and international economies , and its value is a matter of supply and demand .
The Ponzi economy has been sustained by cheap dollars coming in through legitimate or illegitimate channels , and the problem now is that structural surpluses are disappearing and there is less “ hot ” money from the U.S. seeking yield . When dollars enter , the central bank buys them and issues renminbi . If it has to issue more than is justified by the amount of inflows , it creates inflation , and inflation , which has toppled or almost toppled governments from the Ming dynasty to Tiananmen , is the third rail of Chinese politics .
That brings us back to Trump and his trade war . The fundamental idea underlying this salad of a trade agenda is an old one from the right wing of the Republican Party , which believes that the U.S. has paid too dearly for its postwar leadership role under the Bretton Woods regime ; putting America first means America marching alone .
The dollar standard , and not trade policies , underpins the global system of commerce . The U.S. runs trade deficits as a consequence of its desire to own the currency that dominates global commerce , not as a casualty of predatory policies by China . The rise of the gold standard in the second half of the 19th century was the key foundation for the expansion of global trade . Its collapse , starting in 1913 , drove a trade implosion .
After Bretton Woods , the dollar took over as a global standard , and , when former President Richard Nixon made the greenback no longer redeemable for gold , it was freed to become a pure fiat currency . That meant that the U.S. could project any level of currency around the world to support its national economic growth and lifestyle improvements that exceeded productivity gains . No wonder China wishes the renminbi could do the same .
It is tempting to see the recent yuan depreciation as a strategy to blunt the effect of U.S. tariffs , but really , the capital account is of much greater import to China Inc. than the current account . China ’ s central bank will almost certainly try to pull back the exchange rate in the near term : Authorities care more about the pile of reserve gold , successful stock-exchange debuts for Xiaomi Corp. and Ant Financial , and lucrative bond issues than about the private and largely foreign-owned companies that dominate exports .
The truth is that China has followed a mercantilist trading policy since Mao Zedong . Most significantly , the investment splurge in the reform years helped political elites rake billions off the forced savings of the Chinese people . That was enabled by incoming capital , and there is no indication that will change .
Until now , China has managed to keep its huge raft of nonperforming debt afloat thanks to capital inflows , as successive waves of quantitative easing pushed dollars into the world . A tighter dollar would seem to make the bursting of China ’ s credit bubble an inevitability . When that happens , the renminbi will have to depreciate sharply . This will have a deflationary impact on the world . It will also lead to a decline in China ’ s share of global GDP , dramatically reduce the nation ’ s demand for commodities , and diminish its role on the international political stage .
Much about Chinese trade practices is genuinely unfair . But the inequity flows as much from U.S. policy favoring big corporations at the expense of workers as it does from Chinese structural subsidies .

There’s no chance China will cut its trade surplus with the U.S. in response to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. For starters, Washington has made no specific demand to which Beijing can respond. But its efforts may have an unexpected side effect: a debt crisis in China.

The 25 percent additional tariffs on exports of machinery and electronics looked, at first blush, like a stealth tax on offshoring. The focus on categories like semiconductors and nuclear components, in which U.S.-owned manufacturers in China are strong, recalled Trump’s 2016 promise to tax “any business that leaves our country.”

It seems, though, that offshoring wasn’t the target after all. Now, with the imposition of new tariffs on low-value exports that mostly involve Asian value chains, the simple fact of selling cheap products that the U.S. buys has become the problem.

Either way, the administration appears set on shrinking its current-account deficit (which, at a moderate 2.4 percent of GDP, is far lower than the 6 percent clocked in 2006-7) just as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Distress has already been registered in China. On July 13, the yuan (also known as the renminbi) hit 6.725 to the dollar, the weakest in a year and 5 percent lower than at the end of May.

Such a move is nothing earth-shaking for less controlled currencies. But a stable renminbi is a key plank in the leadership’s promise to its people, and the exchange rate is tightly managed by the central bank.

Chinese investors have been buying official assurances for a year that the renminbi would be a fortress, but now they’re not so sure and are exporting money again: May saw net capital outflows and a decline in the foreign-exchange reserves. The currency is the most visible sign of slippage in the image that China tries to project of an economy so brilliantly managed that the bright sun of GDP expansion is untroubled by even temporary clouds on trade, employment or consumption.

There are many other signs: The Shanghai Composite Index of stocks has declined 7 percent in a month, dropping below the government’s red line of 3,000 for the first time since September 2016. Corporate bonds are about to set a record for the most defaults in a year. Junk bond yields are spiking. The chorus of anxiety about debt is reaching a crescendo, with daily press reports on governments that can’t pay their employees or meet pension obligations. Property prices are tumbling in some cities and frozen in others whose governments have placed a finger in the dyke by halting transactions.

That the massive burden of debt will drag the economy into recession is as obvious as the empty towers that rise on every landscape. Precise estimates are difficult, since the government’s dedication to the optics of invincibility induces financial institutions to push debt into alternate, opaque channels. But on any metric, the amount of new lending each year grows faster than the economy, and the interest newly owed exceeds the incremental rise in GDP. In other words, the whole economy is a Ponzi scheme.

Many analysts point out that the Chinese government owns everything, including the banks, and can just issue renminbi to infinity to keep the economy solvent. The flaw in that argument is China’s role in the global economy: It’s the world’s biggest exporter and second-biggest importer. The currency acts as the interface between the domestic and international economies, and its value is a matter of supply and demand.

The Ponzi economy has been sustained by cheap dollars coming in through legitimate or illegitimate channels, and the problem now is that structural surpluses are disappearing and there is less “hot” money from the U.S. seeking yield. When dollars enter, the central bank buys them and issues renminbi. If it has to issue more than is justified by the amount of inflows, it creates inflation, and inflation, which has toppled or almost toppled governments from the Ming dynasty to Tiananmen, is the third rail of Chinese politics.

That brings us back to Trump and his trade war. The fundamental idea underlying this salad of a trade agenda is an old one from the right wing of the Republican Party, which believes that the U.S. has paid too dearly for its postwar leadership role under the Bretton Woods regime; putting America first means America marching alone.

The dollar standard, and not trade policies, underpins the global system of commerce. The U.S. runs trade deficits as a consequence of its desire to own the currency that dominates global commerce, not as a casualty of predatory policies by China. The rise of the gold standard in the second half of the 19th century was the key foundation for the expansion of global trade. Its collapse, starting in 1913, drove a trade implosion.

After Bretton Woods, the dollar took over as a global standard, and, when former President Richard Nixon made the greenback no longer redeemable for gold, it was freed to become a pure fiat currency. That meant that the U.S. could project any level of currency around the world to support its national economic growth and lifestyle improvements that exceeded productivity gains. No wonder China wishes the renminbi could do the same.

It is tempting to see the recent yuan depreciation as a strategy to blunt the effect of U.S. tariffs, but really, the capital account is of much greater import to China Inc. than the current account. China’s central bank will almost certainly try to pull back the exchange rate in the near term: Authorities care more about the pile of reserve gold, successful stock-exchange debuts for Xiaomi Corp. and Ant Financial, and lucrative bond issues than about the private and largely foreign-owned companies that dominate exports.

The truth is that China has followed a mercantilist trading policy since Mao Zedong. Most significantly, the investment splurge in the reform years helped political elites rake billions off the forced savings of the Chinese people. That was enabled by incoming capital, and there is no indication that will change.

Until now, China has managed to keep its huge raft of nonperforming debt afloat thanks to capital inflows, as successive waves of quantitative easing pushed dollars into the world. A tighter dollar would seem to make the bursting of China’s credit bubble an inevitability. When that happens, the renminbi will have to depreciate sharply. This will have a deflationary impact on the world. It will also lead to a decline in China’s share of global GDP, dramatically reduce the nation’s demand for commodities, and diminish its role on the international political stage.

Much about Chinese trade practices is genuinely unfair. But the inequity flows as much from U.S. policy favoring big corporations at the expense of workers as it does from Chinese structural subsidies. Both are difficult problems to address — much harder than penalizing exports. No one will benefit when China shrinks and turns inward. Trump should be careful what he wishes for.",www.bloomberg.com,center,HKLDY6Jug0TTuoWe

In a white paper on China’s official position on the trade talks released by the State Council Information Office on Sunday, Beijing made it clear the U.S. government “should bear the sole and entire responsibility” for the current stalemate, and hit back at allegations that Beijing had backtracked from its earlier promises.

On the specific allegation that China significantly changed the text under negotiation after the latest round of talks, the white paper said it was “common practice” to make new proposals and adjustments as the talks progressed, something the U.S. had done consistently.

“The more the U.S. government is offered, the more it wants,” the document said.

At a press conference in Beijing on Sunday, Wang Shouwen, China’s vice-minister for commerce, accused the U.S. of being “irresponsible” in accusing Beijing of backtracking on its promises.

trade,Bloomberg,1,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-14/how-trump-s-trade-war-went-from-method-to-madness?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=businessweek&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businessweek&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic,How Trump’s Trade War Went From Method to Madness,2019-11-14,"Shawn Donnan, Jenny Leonard","It started with a carefully calibrated trade weapon , an algorithm that spat out a list of targets for an assault on China ordered up by a U.S. president determined to rebalance the relationship between the world ’ s two biggest economies . The goal : building leverage for negotiations aimed at forcing wholesale changes in China ’ s economic architecture while limiting the pain to businesses and consumers at home . “ We ’ ve given this an enormous amount of thought , ” Robert Lighthizer , the U.S. trade representative , told senators in March 2018 , highlighting the work of the computer model his team had constructed . “ It ’ s a sensible , moderate , appropriate amount , ” he went on , “ and it is calculated and created in a very businesslike , sensible way . ”
The algorithm produced a 28-page list of Chinese-made products , including aircraft tires , pacemakers , and printed circuit boards , whose total value— $ 34 billion—matched an estimate of the annual cost to U.S. businesses of Chinese intellectual-property theft and forced technology transfers . The more than 800 items on the list were selected for their potential to inflict pain on industries Beijing has designated as strategically important while taking into account the potential disruption to U.S. supply chains . Adding to the complexity , the task was to throttle back China ’ s imports without American consumers taking notice or endangering President Donald Trump ’ s promised economic boom .
The model , though , didn ’ t account for the unpredictability of Trump . Behind closed doors , the president took the modest number—equal to 7 % of the $ 505 billion in goods the U.S. imported from China in 2017—almost as an affront . He didn ’ t want moderate or appropriate . He grumbled to aides the figure was too low and demanded it be rounded up to at least $ 50 billion . Trump also asked his staff , almost as an aside : “ Do you think I should put tariffs on everything from China ? ”
Twenty months later , what began as method now looks more and more like madness . A tit-for-tat tariff war has ensnared more than 70 % of bilateral trade in goods and raised the specter of a decoupling of two economies that once seemed destined to become progressively more intertwined . If the countries can ’ t resolve at least some of their differences in the coming weeks , the White House will on Dec. 15 add 15 % punitive tariffs on a further $ 160 billion in Chinese imports , delivering on what were once just presidential ruminations . That tariff round could jeopardize America ’ s record-long expansion , according to some economists . As it stands , the existing duties will knock 0.8 % off global growth in 2020 , according to recent forecasts from the International Monetary Fund .

The disruptions of an all-out trade war may yet be averted : Trump and China ’ s president , Xi Jinping , appear intent on reaching at least a partial truce by mid-December . In a Nov. 12 speech , Trump again signaled he would refrain from a new tariff assault if Beijing agrees to a “ phase one ” deal that hinges largely on it stepping up U.S. agricultural purchases to as much as $ 50 billion within two years , more than twice the level before the conflict , and curtailing intellectual-property theft . Trump sees it as the start of a more comprehensive agreement . But Chinese officials quietly say they see any future successful phases as unlikely and that commodity purchases will at first simply be at the level they were before the Trump tariffs . Skeptics in the Trump administration also question whether Beijing is willing to close a larger transformative deal with a president running for reelection amid a slowing economy .
Politicians and businesses across the board agree Trump was right to take on China . At the same time , the issues being tackled in a first phase of the trade deal are much narrower than the ambitious goals the White House once set for itself . There ’ s little doubt the fight will have a place in history , says Douglas Irwin , an economic historian at Dartmouth : No American president in the past century has waged an economic war on this scale . But while Trump created an opportunity , he risks squandering it as well .
“ Are we going to look back and say , ‘ This was all a failure ’ ? I don ’ t think so , ” says Wendy Cutler , a former U.S. trade negotiator who leads the Asia Society Policy Institute . “ But if we end up comparing what they ’ re able to accomplish vs. their initial objectives , I think their accomplishments are going to fall way short . And they won ’ t be the first administration to do that . But wow , they certainly raised the stakes and certainly allowed U.S. interests to suffer through the tariffs in this effort . ”
The picture that emerges from dozens of interviews over the past year with officials and other people close to negotiations is one in which one man ’ s impetuousness has confounded attempts at strategy . It ’ s the story of a president caught between his instincts as a dealmaker , his place in history , and a contentious band of aides , some of whom goad him into more radical action and others who tease him into restraint .

“ That ’ s very Nixonian ! ” intoned Larry Kudlow , the head of the National Economic Council , as the president and his aides huddled in the Oval Office in August to debate an intervention to weaken the dollar . The strong greenback is an obsession for Trump , who believes it undermines his tariffs . Three months on , the invocation has different connotations as Trump faces possible impeachment . But back then it was a code between two seventysomething men for avoiding an economic mistake—an allusion to Richard Nixon ’ s August 1971 decision to end the dollar ’ s convertibility to gold . That move led to years of turmoil in markets and the stagflation of the 1970s .
Well into September , Trump said he would never settle for a partial deal with China ; it had to be the grand slam . Yet behind the scenes , his advisers were starting to discuss how to negotiate a stage-by-stage agreement and harvest elements that both sides had already largely concurred on , including a pact to avoid competitive currency devaluations hashed out in February when the Chinese team was in Washington .
To extract concessions from China , the self-proclaimed “ Tariff Man ” would have to roll back some duties put in place over the summer—a move some of his advisers , including Peter Navarro , the White House ’ s most strident China hawk , oppose . In a Nov. 8 email to reporters , Navarro blamed “ propagandists within the Chinese government ” for inciting stories that a withdrawal of tariffs might be nigh . He and Kudlow , who says tariff “ concessions ” are needed to close the deal , have sparred openly .

The two men ’ s battle echoes divides that have existed inside the administration since the beginning . On Oct. 11 , shortly before Trump sat down with China ’ s top negotiator , Vice Premier Liu He , in a televised Oval Office meeting to announce a “ substantial phase one deal , ” Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with the president so he could sign off on the step-by-step approach . This , they argued , was a way to pocket some wins , take the pressure off the U.S. economy , and have another crack at the tricky issues in a second stage . Only one member of the team disagreed .
Navarro , who was present , appeared intent on sabotaging the plan and , according to one person with knowledge of what transpired , interrupted the two cabinet members so forcefully that Trump eventually turned to him and said : “ Peter , calm down ! ” Asked about the incident , Navarro said he is “ always a passionate defender of the president ’ s deep understanding of the situation with China and his practical solutions . But I don ’ t comment on private meetings with the president . What happens in the Oval should stay in the Oval . ”
Within an hour of that exchange , Liu and his team arrived at the White House to finalize the truce . The discussion before the cameras arrived seemed inconclusive to some attending and left them confused , though Trump would minutes later praise a “ lovefest ” in U.S.-China relations to reporters . In the days that followed , Trump insisted that the teams were making progress and that he and Xi would likely sign the deal at a Nov. 16-17 gathering of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Santiago . That summit was canceled after anti-government protests broke out in Chile , and a new venue and date haven ’ t been decided . In the meantime , the two countries are still negotiating exactly what each side will concede in a phase one deal .
Deal or No Deal Notable moments in the past year of the U.S.-China trade war , annotated with Trump ’ s tweets .
The events of the past few weeks fit a pattern of false dawns in the trade war . At least three other times a pact seemed within reach , only to collapse in a back-and-forth of recriminations . One of the key moments came in May , when miscalculations by both sides blew up an expansive deal that had taken months to put together . Within days , Trump threatened new tariffs and placed Chinese telecommunications gear maker Huawei Technologies Co. on a U.S. Department of Commerce blacklist , restricting its ability to buy hardware , software , and services from American high-tech suppliers .

The Huawei decision cast a shadow on a late June encounter between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka , where the Chinese president asked his U.S. counterpart to ease pressure on the company and—according to Trump—promised to immediately buy “ a tremendous amount ” of American agricultural products . Trump agreed and returned from Osaka optimistic that a deal was in sight . But by the time U.S. negotiators returned from a round of follow-up talks in Shanghai in late July , the mood was souring . “ That is the problem with China , they just don ’ t come through , ” read one in a barrage of Trump tweets on July 30 , in which he complained that Beijing hadn ’ t lived up to its promise to restart agricultural purchases .
That set up one of the most volatile months of the trade war , feeding recession fears in the U.S. as signs of a slowdown in manufacturing continued to build , particularly in key presidential election battleground states . In early August , Trump announced a major escalation—tariffs covering the remaining $ 300 billion in China imports that would start to take effect Sept. 1 . At his behest , the Treasury Department officially labeled China a currency manipulator . Then , on Aug. 23 , the president directed U.S. businesses to explore ways of getting out of China . “ Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China , including bringing your companies HOME , ” he tweeted .

Markets tumbled , and panicked chief executive officers and donors demanded to have a word with the president . Among them were Blackstone ’ s Stephen Schwarzman and Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson , according to people close to the negotiations who asked not to be identified because the calls were private . They say the interventions succeeded . From that moment on , Trump was in deescalation and dealmaking mode .
Fears of an economic slowdown in the U.S. that coalesced in August also changed the equation . Publicly , Trump ’ s advisers point to historic lows in unemployment and modest inflation to bat back concerns . They blame the Federal Reserve and a strong dollar for growth well below the 3 % to 4 % Trump once promised . ( The U.S. grew at an annual rate of 1.9 % in the third quarter . ) But the angst that the trade war may be exacting a greater-than-anticipated economic toll is thinly veiled .
Worries about the economy burnished the attractiveness of a phase one deal that puts on hold new tariffs that would directly hit U.S. consumers . A partial pact would also reward American farmers for standing with Trump , despite being cut off from one of their most important markets . According to people familiar with the negotiations , missing from the partial deal are measures to address a key U.S. concern : how China often forces foreign companies to hand over technology . There ’ s also nothing related to the vast web of subsidies China uses to help its companies compete internationally—an issue Beijing is unlikely to budge on .
Despite the diminished expectations , Trump and his allies are quick to defend his handling of the trade war . American supply chains have started shifting away from China , they say , pointing to Apple Inc. and other companies ’ shifting of production to such places as India and Vietnam . And they are elated that Trump will also leave in place tariffs on a large portion of Chinese imports as an enforcement tool to ensure Beijing lives up to its side of the bargain .
Kudlow argues that a phase one deal will reduce the uncertainty hanging over the U.S. economy while starting to address important elements of the rivalry with China . “ It ’ s a big win for the president . Because his tough negotiating style and his use of tariffs—both of which have come under great criticism—are paying off . ”
Even Navarro touts the strategy in public . “ The great deal President Trump seeks for America , China , and the world is the deal Ambassador Lighthizer negotiated in May 2019 but China reneged on , ” he says . That agreement would have addressed what he calls China ’ s seven “ deadly structural sins , ” including its industrial subsidies and its dumping of low-cost products in the U.S . He also argues Trump , “ as a master negotiator , ” will ensure further phases happen . “ Of course I support the president in pursuing this strategy because it helps the American economy and American farmers , ranchers , and workers . ”

Critics , on the other hand , point to a U.S. trade deficit that ’ s on track to end 2019 some $ 150 billion larger than at the end of 2016 , on the eve of Trump taking office . And they argue that the tariffs and export restrictions his administration has put in place have , if anything , reinforced Beijing ’ s determination to outpace the U.S. in critical areas such as artificial intelligence and biomedicine .
Trump ’ s phase one deal , if it happens , “ will not alter China ’ s ambitions , ” says Charlene Barshefsky , who negotiated China ’ s entry into the World Trade Organization under President Bill Clinton . Rather than using protectionism and industrial policy to give American businesses a leg up , the U.S. should be investing in education , research , and infrastructure to boost its own competitive position . “ We ’ ll never out-China China , ” she says . “ And if you spent 10 minutes in the country , you ’ d know that . ”
Democrats looking to challenge Trump in 2020 will likely portray a phase one deal as caving . Yet , for better or worse , he has embedded the view of a malign China in Washington . Candidates from former Vice President Joe Biden to Senator Elizabeth Warren agree the U.S. has to take on Beijing , though they find fault in Trump ’ s tactics . Notably , none of the front-runners have committed to removing tariffs on China .
A U.S. business community that wants both a short-term end to the uncertainty and longer-term fundamental changes in China ’ s economic governance is also wondering if it was all worth it . “ What we all need now is a trade truce , ” says Myron Brilliant , who heads the international division at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . Whether the fight will prove worth it “ will depend on what comes next . ”
Many China experts argue Trump ’ s approach was too improvised and forced allies into a “ you ’ re either with us or against us ” equation that is divorced from the economic and business realities they face . “ We ’ re in a political era of simple solutions at a time when these really require complicated and coordinated actions , ” says Jude Blanchette , an expert on Chinese leadership politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank .
Irwin , the Dartmouth professor , says an historical reference point is the War of 1812—which the U.S. waged against an England that was by far its largest trading partner and a predatory one to boot . One slogan touted at the beginning of that conflict , he says , was “ on to Canada ! ” —a promise to annex new territories . When the war ended with a return to preexisting boundaries , the parameters for victory changed : “ You know what our slogan was after the war ? ‘ Not one inch of territory ceded ! ’ ” Trump and his aides “ launched the trade war against China and said , ‘ We are going to remake the economy and get the state out of industrial policy and mercantilism , ’ ” Irwin says . “ We are ending it by saying , ‘ They are buying just as much stuff as they did before . ’ ”","SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

It started with a carefully calibrated trade weapon, an algorithm that spat out a list of targets for an assault on China ordered up by a U.S. president determined to rebalance the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies. The goal: building leverage for negotiations aimed at forcing wholesale changes in China’s economic architecture while limiting the pain to businesses and consumers at home. “We’ve given this an enormous amount of thought,” Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, told senators in March 2018, highlighting the work of the computer model his team had constructed. “It’s a sensible, moderate, appropriate amount,” he went on, “and it is calculated and created in a very businesslike, sensible way.”

The algorithm produced a 28-page list of Chinese-made products, including aircraft tires, pacemakers, and printed circuit boards, whose total value—$34 billion—matched an estimate of the annual cost to U.S. businesses of Chinese intellectual-property theft and forced technology transfers. The more than 800 items on the list were selected for their potential to inflict pain on industries Beijing has designated as strategically important while taking into account the potential disruption to U.S. supply chains. Adding to the complexity, the task was to throttle back China’s imports without American consumers taking notice or endangering President Donald Trump’s promised economic boom.

The model, though, didn’t account for the unpredictability of Trump. Behind closed doors, the president took the modest number—equal to 7% of the $505 billion in goods the U.S. imported from China in 2017—almost as an affront. He didn’t want moderate or appropriate. He grumbled to aides the figure was too low and demanded it be rounded up to at least $50 billion. Trump also asked his staff, almost as an aside: “Do you think I should put tariffs on everything from China?”

Twenty months later, what began as method now looks more and more like madness. A tit-for-tat tariff war has ensnared more than 70% of bilateral trade in goods and raised the specter of a decoupling of two economies that once seemed destined to become progressively more intertwined. If the countries can’t resolve at least some of their differences in the coming weeks, the White House will on Dec. 15 add 15% punitive tariffs on a further $160 billion in Chinese imports, delivering on what were once just presidential ruminations. That tariff round could jeopardize America’s record-long expansion, according to some economists. As it stands, the existing duties will knock 0.8% off global growth in 2020, according to recent forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.

The disruptions of an all-out trade war may yet be averted: Trump and China’s president, Xi Jinping, appear intent on reaching at least a partial truce by mid-December. In a Nov. 12 speech, Trump again signaled he would refrain from a new tariff assault if Beijing agrees to a “phase one” deal that hinges largely on it stepping up U.S. agricultural purchases to as much as $50 billion within two years, more than twice the level before the conflict, and curtailing intellectual-property theft. Trump sees it as the start of a more comprehensive agreement. But Chinese officials quietly say they see any future successful phases as unlikely and that commodity purchases will at first simply be at the level they were before the Trump tariffs. Skeptics in the Trump administration also question whether Beijing is willing to close a larger transformative deal with a president running for reelection amid a slowing economy.

Politicians and businesses across the board agree Trump was right to take on China. At the same time, the issues being tackled in a first phase of the trade deal are much narrower than the ambitious goals the White House once set for itself. There’s little doubt the fight will have a place in history, says Douglas Irwin, an economic historian at Dartmouth: No American president in the past century has waged an economic war on this scale. But while Trump created an opportunity, he risks squandering it as well.

“Are we going to look back and say, ‘This was all a failure’? I don’t think so,” says Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who leads the Asia Society Policy Institute. “But if we end up comparing what they’re able to accomplish vs. their initial objectives, I think their accomplishments are going to fall way short. And they won’t be the first administration to do that. But wow, they certainly raised the stakes and certainly allowed U.S. interests to suffer through the tariffs in this effort.”

● Oval Office Scuffles

The picture that emerges from dozens of interviews over the past year with officials and other people close to negotiations is one in which one man’s impetuousness has confounded attempts at strategy. It’s the story of a president caught between his instincts as a dealmaker, his place in history, and a contentious band of aides, some of whom goad him into more radical action and others who tease him into restraint.

trade,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/trade-bill-democrats-117978.html?hp=r2_4,Dems look to start Senate trade war next week ,2015-05-14,Burgess Everett,"Senate liberals know they are going to lose the battle over fast-track trade authority . But they ’ re doing all they can to prolong the fight — perhaps even past the Memorial Day recess into June — in hopes that a long delay will damage the bill ’ s already difficult prospects in the House .
A coalition of Senate Democrats who ’ ve long opposed new trade agreements , led by Sherrod Brown of Ohio , say they are planning to throw up procedural roadblocks and offer amendments that would expand worker protections and undermine GOP support for the fast-track measure . While they can ’ t win the battle , Brown and his allies hope their resistance will stoke popular sentiment against the bill and encourage Democrats to vote against it in the House , where Republican leaders warn they still need about 20 more votes for approval .
“ The handwriting ’ s on the wall , ” Brown said of the prospects of beating the bill in the Senate . But , he said : “ There ’ s real opportunity in the House to defeat it . ”
“ We ’ re going to work as hard as we can to defeat this legislation , ” added Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) in an interview Thursday . “ Time is on our side . The longer we keep it on the floor , the more the American people understand what a disastrous agreement this is , the better it is for us . ”
Senate rules will work in their favor , given that any single member can drag out debate for days by objecting to time and amendment agreements . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ’ s promise to have an open amendment process will also help liberals , as they mull offering amendments on currency manipulation and additional worker protections that could be tough for vulnerable Republicans to oppose . And lawmakers need to deal with the expiring PATRIOT Act next week , along with transportation law , putting the squeeze on the Senate ’ s tight schedule .
The White House and Senate Republicans are pressing the pace to keep momentum on their side after they broke a filibuster this week . Fast-track Trade Promotion Authority is the centerpiece of President Barack Obama ’ s economic agenda , and it is necessary if he wants to speed a huge trade pact with 12 Pacific Rim nations through Congress without amendment .
Republicans even tried to schedule a rare Friday Senate session to begin debating amendments , an effort that proved unsuccessful . The GOP is already blaming Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) for delaying votes and debate on the bill .
Meanwhile , liberal Democrats huddled this week with Brown to plot the measure ’ s defeat and are continuing to formulate a plan of attack . They remain tight-lipped about what exactly they will do to jam up McConnell ’ s priorities , but they ’ ve promised to make it an ugly skirmish .
“ The procedural tools will come out , ” warned Sen. Brian Schatz ( D-Hawaii ) .
The time crunch is going to work against McConnell . Dealing with the high-stakes trade measure and a controversial extension of surveillance programs at the same time is going to be difficult , if not impossible . When push comes to shove , Republicans may be forced to punt trade until after the recess to deal with the more pressing PATRIOT Act .
“ Sen . McConnell has written more checks than he can cash on the schedule , ” said Adam Jentleson , a spokesman for Reid . “ Something ’ s got ta give , it ’ s just not clear what . ”
McConnell ( R-Ky. ) shrugged off the pessimism . “ We will finish it next week , ” he said of TPA on Thursday afternoon .
“ We ’ re running out of time , ” added McConnell ’ s whip , Sen. John Cornyn of Texas . “ My goal is to finish it next week . I ’ m an optimist . ”
But Republicans are already preparing for the worst . Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) said in an interview that if he had his way , the Senate would stay in through the recess to finish his bill . That ’ s highly unlikely given that four senators are already running for president ; and the Senate barely works on Fridays anymore .
“ Anything beyond next week is obstructionism , ” Hatch said of Democrats ’ threats to hold up the bill . This week ’ s filibuster , he added , smacked of a Democratic strategy “ so that they can claim that they don ’ t have enough time to bring up amendments . ”
Potentially problematic amendments began piling up as soon as the Senate voted to begin debate on the bill . Brown wants to crank up spending on the Trade Adjustment Assistance program , which could appeal to several Rust Belt Republicans looking to assure their constituents that any job losses from new trade bills will be blunted by the TAA program .
“ If McConnell wants to keep us in , late nights and all , I ’ m fine , ” Brown said . “ I want to make sure we get these amendments out there . ”
Republicans already have begrudgingly agreed to move a trade assistance measure along with the fast-track bill , but expanding the TAA protections even further could erode GOP support for the fast-track measure it ’ s paired with .
Republicans have offered an amendment to strip the bill of the trade-assistance program , which likely would fail if it gets a vote but serves as a direct challenge to Brown .
“ If they want to defeat it , they might be able to defeat it with some amendments that just make it improbable to use , ” Hatch said of fast-track .
Sen. James Lankford ( R-Okla. ) wants the Senate to attach a provision that would require that religious liberty be factored into any new trade deals , injecting a social issues debate into an already fraught battle over economics and prosperity . He and Brown will get votes on their proposals on Monday evening .

But they’re doing all they can to prolong the fight — perhaps even past the Memorial Day recess into June — in hopes that a long delay will damage the bill’s already difficult prospects in the House.

A coalition of Senate Democrats who’ve long opposed new trade agreements, led by Sherrod Brown of Ohio, say they are planning to throw up procedural roadblocks and offer amendments that would expand worker protections and undermine GOP support for the fast-track measure. While they can’t win the battle, Brown and his allies hope their resistance will stoke popular sentiment against the bill and encourage Democrats to vote against it in the House, where Republican leaders warn they still need about 20 more votes for approval.

Story Continued Below

“The handwriting’s on the wall,” Brown said of the prospects of beating the bill in the Senate. But, he said: “There’s real opportunity in the House to defeat it.”

“We’re going to work as hard as we can to defeat this legislation,” added Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in an interview Thursday. “Time is on our side. The longer we keep it on the floor, the more the American people understand what a disastrous agreement this is, the better it is for us.”

Senate rules will work in their favor, given that any single member can drag out debate for days by objecting to time and amendment agreements. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s promise to have an open amendment process will also help liberals, as they mull offering amendments on currency manipulation and additional worker protections that could be tough for vulnerable Republicans to oppose. And lawmakers need to deal with the expiring PATRIOT Act next week, along with transportation law, putting the squeeze on the Senate’s tight schedule.

The White House and Senate Republicans are pressing the pace to keep momentum on their side after they broke a filibuster this week. Fast-track Trade Promotion Authority is the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s economic agenda, and it is necessary if he wants to speed a huge trade pact with 12 Pacific Rim nations through Congress without amendment.

Republicans even tried to schedule a rare Friday Senate session to begin debating amendments, an effort that proved unsuccessful. The GOP is already blaming Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for delaying votes and debate on the bill.

Meanwhile, liberal Democrats huddled this week with Brown to plot the measure’s defeat and are continuing to formulate a plan of attack. They remain tight-lipped about what exactly they will do to jam up McConnell’s priorities, but they’ve promised to make it an ugly skirmish.

“The procedural tools will come out,” warned Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).

The time crunch is going to work against McConnell. Dealing with the high-stakes trade measure and a controversial extension of surveillance programs at the same time is going to be difficult, if not impossible. When push comes to shove, Republicans may be forced to punt trade until after the recess to deal with the more pressing PATRIOT Act.

“Sen. McConnell has written more checks than he can cash on the schedule,” said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid. “Something’s gotta give, it’s just not clear what.”

McConnell (R-Ky.) shrugged off the pessimism. “We will finish it next week,” he said of TPA on Thursday afternoon.

“We’re running out of time,” added McConnell’s whip, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. “My goal is to finish it next week. I’m an optimist.”

But Republicans are already preparing for the worst. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said in an interview that if he had his way, the Senate would stay in through the recess to finish his bill. That’s highly unlikely given that four senators are already running for president; and the Senate barely works on Fridays anymore.

“Anything beyond next week is obstructionism,” Hatch said of Democrats’ threats to hold up the bill. This week’s filibuster, he added, smacked of a Democratic strategy “so that they can claim that they don’t have enough time to bring up amendments.”

Potentially problematic amendments began piling up as soon as the Senate voted to begin debate on the bill. Brown wants to crank up spending on the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which could appeal to several Rust Belt Republicans looking to assure their constituents that any job losses from new trade bills will be blunted by the TAA program.

“If McConnell wants to keep us in, late nights and all, I’m fine,” Brown said. “I want to make sure we get these amendments out there.”

Republicans already have begrudgingly agreed to move a trade assistance measure along with the fast-track bill, but expanding the TAA protections even further could erode GOP support for the fast-track measure it’s paired with.

Republicans have offered an amendment to strip the bill of the trade-assistance program, which likely would fail if it gets a vote but serves as a direct challenge to Brown.

“If they want to defeat it, they might be able to defeat it with some amendments that just make it improbable to use,” Hatch said of fast-track.

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) wants the Senate to attach a provision that would require that religious liberty be factored into any new trade deals, injecting a social issues debate into an already fraught battle over economics and prosperity. He and Brown will get votes on their proposals on Monday evening.

And Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) have offered amendments aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration. Cruz says he won’t support anything that doesn’t include his amendment.

“We should put it in writing and make it binding law. I am a strong supporter of free trade, but I cannot support legislation that would allow the president to once again circumvent Congress to enact his own immigration laws,” Cruz said.

Democrats say that even if McConnell moves to block or limit the amendment jockeying early next week, their liberal members are likely to object to swift consideration of the fast-track bill. That could drag out the bill until the end of the week, which would then crash into the McConnell’s efforts to extend portions of the PATRIOT Act.

Republicans privately complained that Reid was playing both sides by working to delay the bill and block amendments, only to then complain about not getting votes on Democratic amendments.

Liberals and libertarians are vowing to fight McConnell’s effort to offer a clean extension of current surveillance law, including the bulk data-collection program, meaning the Senate may have to devote significant time to that, too.

In the middle of it all is Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Hatch’s primary dance partner on trade issues. And though he said in an interview he’s doing everything he can to move the trade bill before the recess, he’s also vowed to filibuster any effort to extend the PATRIOT Act without reforms to bulk data collection.

“I’m going to pull out all the stops to do both,” Wyden said.

China has imposed tariffs of up to 25% on 128 US imports, including pork and wine, after US President Donald Trump raised duties on foreign steel and aluminium imports in March.

The tariffs affecting some $3bn (£2.1bn) of imports kick in on Monday.

Beijing said the move was to safeguard China's interests and balance losses caused by new US tariffs.

China had previously said it did not want a trade war but would not sit by if its economy was hurt.

Mr Trump, however, has insisted that ""trade wars are good"", and that it should be ""easy"" for the US to win one.

The American authorities have already announced plans for further targeted tariffs for tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, the BBC's Chris Buckler reports from Washington.

Relatively mild to start with

By Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong

China's theft of foreign intellectual property is what sparked all this in the first place, according to Washington. If international companies want to operate in China they must hand over their intellectual property for the privilege, thus delivering the likes of German high-speed rail technology into the hands of Chinese engineers.

Yet now that China's retaliatory tariffs have kicked in, there are also those sympathetic with that argument who are worried that launching a potential tariff war is not the way to fix the problem. Naturally others say China has been getting away with this for years and tough measures were needed in order to force change.

There is also the overall imbalance in US-China trade but a large Chinese surplus, of course, means it is potentially much more exposed during a trade war than America. For this reason Beijing will want to negotiate a way out of this escalating tariff showdown.

Its first set of tariffs are relatively mild but they come in response to the first round of US tariffs and a second has already been announced. There are plenty more American companies to be hit and other nations, especially those in Europe and Asia, could soon find themselves dragged into this conflict.

Which products are affected?

US scrap aluminium and frozen pork will be subject to a 25% additional tariff - on top of existing duties.

Several other American foods including nuts, fresh and dried fruit, ginseng and wine will be hit by a 15% increase.

Rolled steel bars will likewise see a 15% rise in duties.

Why is this happening now?

China said the new tariffs were a retaliatory measure in light of Mr Trump's decision to raise duties on steel and aluminium imports.

But further tax hikes may lie ahead.

On 22 March, the US said it was planning to impose duties on up to $60bn of Chinese imports and limit its investment in the US, in retaliation for years of alleged intellectual property theft.

President Donald Trump ordered the doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs against Turkey , roiling global markets as relations between the NATO allies hit a new low .
Trump announced the decision in a Friday morning tweet following a defiantly nationalist speech Friday by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in which he vowed that his country wouldn ’ t bow to “ economic warfare. ” Tensions have intensified in recent weeks over Turkey ’ s detention of an American evangelical pastor .
The Turkish lira Friday morning posted its worst weekly decline since 2008 , raising the prospect of political upheaval in a nation with a key role in several of the world ’ s biggest challenges . The lira has now passed the Argentine peso as the worst performing currency of 2018 , according to ███ data .
`` I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency , the Turkish Lira , slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar ! Aluminum will now be 20 % and Steel 50 % . Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time ! '' Trump said on Twitter .
Heightening the tension of the day , Erdogan conferred by phone Friday with U.S. adversary Russian President Vladimir Putin on economic ties , Turkish and Russian media reported .
A U.S. deadline for Turkey to release Pastor Andrew Brunson lapsed less than two days ago , according to an administration official with knowledge of the ultimatum . The deadline -- which had been set for 6 p.m. on Aug. 8 -- came just hours after Turkish officials met with counterparts at the State Department and Treasury Department in Washington to try to resolve the dispute .
The clash reverberated across global markets as Turkey ’ s economic crisis threatened to spread . The S & P 500 Index erased a weekly advance , European and emerging-market equities slid more than 1 percent and the 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.90 percent .

President Donald Trump ordered the doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs against Turkey, roiling global markets as relations between the NATO allies hit a new low.

Trump announced the decision in a Friday morning tweet following a defiantly nationalist speech Friday by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in which he vowed that his country wouldn’t bow to “economic warfare.” Tensions have intensified in recent weeks over Turkey’s detention of an American evangelical pastor.

The Turkish lira Friday morning posted its worst weekly decline since 2008, raising the prospect of political upheaval in a nation with a key role in several of the world’s biggest challenges. The lira has now passed the Argentine peso as the worst performing currency of 2018, according to Bloomberg data.

""I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!"" Trump said on Twitter.

Heightening the tension of the day, Erdogan conferred by phone Friday with U.S. adversary Russian President Vladimir Putin on economic ties, Turkish and Russian media reported.

A U.S. deadline for Turkey to release Pastor Andrew Brunson lapsed less than two days ago, according to an administration official with knowledge of the ultimatum. The deadline -- which had been set for 6 p.m. on Aug. 8 -- came just hours after Turkish officials met with counterparts at the State Department and Treasury Department in Washington to try to resolve the dispute.

The clash reverberated across global markets as Turkey’s economic crisis threatened to spread. The S&P 500 Index erased a weekly advance, European and emerging-market equities slid more than 1 percent and the 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.90 percent. The euro sank as much as 1 percent to the weakest in more than a year, extending a drop triggered earlier by a Financial Times report that the European Central Bank raised concerns about banks’ exposure to Turkey.

Turkey is seeking to stanch an economic meltdown amid fallout from U.S. sanctions imposed last week over the continued detention of Brunson, who was jailed on espionage and terrorism allegations more than two years ago and recently released to house arrest.

The U.S. was Turkey’s fourth largest trading partner last year with $21 billion in commerce, behind Germany, China and Russia.

Shares of Turkish steelmakers Kardemir Karabuk Demir Celik Sanayi ve Ticaret AS and Eregli Demir ve Celik Fabrikalari TAS plunged as much as 8 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively, after Trump’s tweet. Shares of the bank Turkiye Is Bankasi AS fell 8.7 percent, more than any full-day drop since 2013.

Steel was Turkey’s fourth-largest export last year, valued at $11.5 billion and accounting for about 7 percent of total exports, according to the country’s Steel Exporters’ Association. Turkey ranks as the world’s eighth-biggest steel producer.

While the U.S. was the top destination for Turkish steel exports last year, it tumbled to third place in the first half of this year as earlier tariffs diminished the trade.

The move against Erdogan’s government also highlights the disconnect between Turkey and the U.S. as they fail to negotiate their way out of an array of conflicts. Relations used to be based on strategic interests, but more recently they’ve been dominated by discord over alliances in Syria’s civil war, Ankara’s strengthening ties with Moscow, and its uneasy position within NATO.

Turkey has been a key ally in the fight against Islamist terrorism in Iraq and Syria, and the U.S. base in Incirlik is an important staging area.

Trump is working ""diligently"" to bring home Brunson, the president’s lawyer Jay Sekulow said earlier on Fox News. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are also involved in that effort, he said.

When Turkey moved Brunson from prison to house arrest last month, Pompeo said it was a welcome decision but not enough.
