The failed rescue operation in Yemen: what happened

Al-Qaeda's Yemen-based branch, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), kidnapped South African teacher Pierre Korkie and his wife Yolande Korkie in May 2013. The group then kidnapped American freelance journalist Luke Somers from the capital city of Sanaa in September 2013. In January, AQAP released Yolande Korkie. This November, US special forces launched a rescue operation elsewhere in Yemen that retrieved eight hostages from AQAP.

On Wednesday, perhaps in response to the earlier US raid, AQAP announced that it would kill Somers and Korkie if the US did not pay the demanded ransom. On Friday, President Obama approved a US-led special forces operation, along with Yemeni soldiers, to rescue the two hostages, held in a village in southern Yemen. About 100 soldiers descended on the village very late on Friday night. US special forces landed six miles away from the village and hiked in to preserve the element of surprise.

During the firefight, US special forces observed a single AQAP militant enter the building where the hostages were held. The militant was only there ""for about a five to seven count . . . long enough of course to shoot people or take any other action,"" according to a Pentagon official. The militant had attempted to murder the hostages: by the time special forces got to the building, the hostages had both suffered from very serious unspecified injuries.

Both hostages were loaded onto a helicopter and flown to a nearby US Navy ship. Somers died en-route; Korkie died on the ship hospital operating table.

Terrorists are murdering more American hostages

Most countries pay ransoms when their citizens are taken hostage abroad. The US refuses to do this, believing that paying ransoms would just give terrorists the incentive to kidnap more Americans; instead it uses the US military to rescue its citizens, which makes taking Americans hostages more dangerous. The US policy is controversial and much-debated but it is ultimately meant to protect American lives. South Africa, notoriously, often simply refuses to provide its citizens any help whatsoever; Yolande Korkie's release was negotiated by a charity group because the South African government would not intervene.

Over the past year or two, terrorist groups in the Middle East have been taking more Americans hostage. Terrorist groups in Syria, including the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, have taken several Americans hostage and demanded exorbitant ransoms for their release. During 2014, ISIS has begun murdering its American hostages, beginning with the journalist James Foley, and broadcasting horrific videos of their deaths. While there are surely multiple overlapping reasons that ISIS would do this, one reason that some analysts have suggested is that ISIS may be attempting to compel the US to change its policy on paying ransoms.

Public outrage in the US over the terrorist murders of American citizens has been significant. While the Obama administration has stepped up efforts to rescue American hostages, AQAP's pledge to murder Somers if it did not receive its ransom — a pledge it ultimately kept — shows that jihadist terrorist groups are committed to forcing the US to start paying ransoms, even at the cost of inviting US special forces raids.

The recent increase in terrorist groups taking and murdering American hostages, then, can be partially understood as a conflict between jihadists and the United States over America's ransom-paying policy.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon Tuesday reported a rise in complaints of misconduct against military brass and senior civilian officials over the last two years, and a steady trend in proven allegations of sexual misbehavior and improper relationships among its most senior officials.

The increase in complaints and steady stream of disgraced generals, admirals and senior officials comes despite the Pentagon’s repeated stance that it has a “zero-tolerance” policy for such ethical and legal misbehavior.

On Tuesday, the Pentagon Inspector General reported a 13% increase from fiscal year 2015 to 2017 in the number of complaints alleging misconduct among senior officials, from 710 to 803. Moreover, the Inspector General found that investigators continued to substantiate allegations against senior officials, including sexual misconduct, at a steady rate.

“In the category of personal misconduct, there has been a steady trend in substantiated allegations of improper relationships and sexual misconduct,” according to the report, which highlighted 10 management and performance challenges facing the Pentagon.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and a member of the Armed Services Committee, blistered the Pentagon on Tuesday for not taking the issue more seriously. She has championed legislation to remove the authority of uniformed troops to decide which cases go to court martial.

""This data confirms that there is no accountability for those at the top,"" she said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""How can (the Pentagon) uphold good order and discipline when the very people charged with doing so are either committing misconduct themselves or letting it go unpunished?

""It is another thread in the unfortunately all-too-common theme of powerful men getting away with ‎doing whatever they want with little consequence. ‎‎It's time to take away their power to decide what to do with serious crimes.""

In October, a Pentagon spokeswoman issued a statement saying Defense Secretary Jim Mattis expects “exemplary” conduct from senior officials. The statement echoes others made since at least the early 1990s that the Pentagon has a “zero-tolerance” policy for sexual misconduct.

Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced on Monday that some forces are being repositioned inside Iraq, not leaving the country.

The military official said the operation involved several hundred troops, mostly coalition and NATO forces being moved from the main military base in Baghdad's Green Zone. The base had been a frequent target of rocket attacks.

Top administration officials are scheduled to brief all House members on the unfolding events in Iran and Iraq on Wednesday, a Democratic aide told NPR.

Esper, Pompeo, CIA Director Gina Haspel, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley and Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will brief the House in a closed-door session.

Administration officials are scheduled brief senators on Wednesday.

Iraqi lawmakers passed a resolution on Sunday calling for all foreign troops to leave the country.

NPR's Tom Bowman reported that there are about 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, helping in the fight against ISIS there. But U.S. military officials said they would halt those efforts while bracing for retaliation from Iran.

The rising tensions stem from a U.S. drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and several others last week — a move that Iran said was a violation of the country's sovereignty. Iran has vowed to avenge.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hopes the Iraqi parliament will reconsider its decision.

us_military,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-transgender-exclusive-idUSKBN1AC2FN,Top U.S. general says no changes yet to transgender policy,2017-07-27,Idrees Ali,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s sudden decision to ban transgender personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it .
Trump ’ s declaration , which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday , appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military , and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by ███ on Thursday .
“ I hope our commander in chief understands that we don ’ t transmit orders via Twitter , and that he can ’ t , either , ” one said by telephone , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
“ Even if this were an order , implementing it legally would take considerable time , if it ’ s even possible . ”
Rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists , who say they number in the thousands ..
The United States ’ top military officer , Marine General Joseph Dunford , told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel .
Dunford , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump ’ s announcement in a note to service chiefs , commanders and senior enlisted leaders .
“ I know there are questions about yesterday ’ s announcement on the transgender policy by the President , ” Dunford wrote .
“ There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President ’ s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance , ” Dunford said in the message , first reported by ███ .
Related Coverage Army chief had no advance knowledge of Trump 's transgender ban
Dunford then made the assurance that the military would “ treat all of our personnel with respect . ”
His message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump ’ s decision .
One official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army , Navy , Marine Corps and Air Force acknowledged that Trump ’ s announcement on Wednesday was “ unexpected . ”
The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year . But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay to allow for a review .
As a presidential candidate , Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians , gays , bisexuals and transgender people .
His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans .
The White House said Trump had “ extensive discussions with his national security team , ” and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead .
Trump cited “ tremendous medical costs and disruption ” as a justification for the ban , a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual ’ s capabilities , not gender identity or sexual preference .
The Army ’ s chief of staff , General Mark Milley , said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army .
“ I will be candid . ... This is a complex issue and there ( are ) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it , but this is not clean-cut either way , ” he said .
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of Trump ’ s decision was still being worked out .
Separately , the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees , a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took .
Trump ’ s plan to ban transgender military service members has unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue .
Trump ’ s tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect , nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join .
But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military , the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight , legal experts say .

Trump’s declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military, and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by Reuters on Thursday.

“I hope our commander in chief understands that we don’t transmit orders via Twitter, and that he can’t, either,” one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

“Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it’s even possible.”

Rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands..

The United States’ top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel.

Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump’s announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders and senior enlisted leaders.

“I know there are questions about yesterday’s announcement on the transgender policy by the President,” Dunford wrote.

“There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President’s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance,” Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters.

Dunford then made the assurance that the military would “treat all of our personnel with respect.”

His message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump’s decision.

One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force acknowledged that Trump’s announcement on Wednesday was “unexpected.”

The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay to allow for a review.

As a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.

His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans.

The White House said Trump had “extensive discussions with his national security team,” and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead.

Trump cited “tremendous medical costs and disruption” as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual’s capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference.

The Army’s chief of staff, General Mark Milley, said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army.

“I will be candid. ... This is a complex issue and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it, but this is not clean-cut either way,” he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of Trump’s decision was still being worked out.

Separately, the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took.

Trump’s plan to ban transgender military service members has unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue.

Trump’s tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.

But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say.

“There’s no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military,” said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal.

It was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to reservists.

‘BREAKS YOUR SPIRIT’

Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status.

“I try to be tough about it,” he said, but added: “It breaks your spirit down.”

One active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted.

“We’re scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from,” the officer said by phone.

“Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today’s military.

WASHINGTON — Retired General David Petraeus will not be docked one star for his conviction on charges of leaking classified information to his biographer and former lover, according to a letter sent by the Pentagon to the Senate and obtained by USA TODAY.

Stephen Hedger, a top official for legislative affairs, wrote Friday to Sen. John McCain saying that Defense Secretary Ash Carter considers the Petraeus matter closed, according to the letter, which was obtained by USA TODAY from the Senate.

A Defense department official told USA TODAY on Saturday that Carter accepted the Army's recommendation that Petraeus not be sanctioned with demotion. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.

Carter agreed with the findings of an Army review that recommended Petraeus be allowed to maintain his four-star rank in retirement, the official said. Holding that rank, while prestigious, also allows him to collect a pension of around $220,000. Loss of a star could have cost him tens of thousands of dollars a year.

Petraeus did not respond to a request for comment through one of his lawyers.

Petraeus reached a plea agreement with the Justice Department last year after a years-long investigation showed he gave Paula Broadwell secret information, including names of covert officers and war strategy.

Petraeus, the highest-profile commander of his generation, lied to FBI agents, divulged a massive amount of sensitive data to Paula Broadwell, and fretted about how she handled them in an interview she recorded with him, court documents showed. She was the co-author of a biography about Petraeus titled, All In, The Education of General David Petraeus.

The federal court levied a fine of $100,000 against him and placed him on probation in the plea deal.

The news of the letter was first reported by the Washington Post.

Federal investigators found Petraeus kept eight black books containing classified and unclassified notes he took during meetings, conferences and briefings during his tenure as a military commander. In late August 2011, he delivered the books to a private Washington residence where Broadwell — his biographer and mistress — stayed during a week-long trip to the area.

Petraeus agreed to plead guilty to one criminal count of mishandling classified information.

After acknowledging the affair and resigning from the CIA in November 2012, Petraeus signed an agency ""security exit form,'' in which he assured authorities there was ""no classified material in my possession, custody or control at this time.''

They have also targeted telecom companies , infrastructure systems and more than 200 oil , gas and heavy machinery companies around the world .
The hackers have “ developed the ability to disrupt critical infrastructure and they already have the ability to wipe data , ” said James A. Lewis , a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington . “ But they ’ ve gone well beyond that now . The question is what services — pipelines ? dams ? — will they target now . ”
Iran is still not “ at the top of the league ” of countries with the ability to cause widespread destruction via cyberattacks , Mr. Lewis and other experts said .

They have also targeted telecom companies, infrastructure systems and more than 200 oil, gas and heavy machinery companies around the world.

The hackers have “developed the ability to disrupt critical infrastructure and they already have the ability to wipe data,” said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. “But they’ve gone well beyond that now. The question is what services — pipelines? dams? — will they target now.”

Iran is still not “at the top of the league” of countries with the ability to cause widespread destruction via cyberattacks, Mr. Lewis and other experts said. But Tehran is much further along than American officials gave it credit for in 2009, when a classified intelligence assessment concluded that it had the motivation to inflict harm, but lacked the skills and resources to do so.

Iran promises ‘forceful revenge’ for general’s killing.

President Obama met with allied defense chiefs to discuss the campaign against militants from the Islamic State. They've been gaining ground in Iraq and Syria, prompting questions about U.S. strategy.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

The United States' strategy against the group called ISIS has an upside and a downside. The upside is that the United States has assembled a coalition. The downside is that the United States has assembled a coalition. This week President Obama met military leaders from 21 countries that have joined the U.S.

Iraqis and Syrians are fighting for themselves on the ground with other Arab nations joining the air campaign, and that's all good from a U.S. perspective. The trouble, as we'll report this morning, is that not all of those countries share exactly the same interests, so not all are on the same page. Our coverage starts with NPR's Scott Horsley.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: It's been just over a month since President Obama went before the American people and spelled out his strategy for degrading and defeating the militants. Obama says the U.S. and its allies have enjoyed some successes - driving ISIS away from the Mosul Dam, for example. But the president says he remains deeply concerned about the besieged Syrian town of Kobani, as well as parts of Iraq's Anbar province where ISIS has been tightening its grip.

The $ 28 billion Distributed Common Ground System is too slow and unstable and hurts operations in some cases , say intelligence officers who rely on the computer network to collect and quickly dispense data on hard-to-find insurgents and the homemade bombs they plant .
The “ official use only ” memo issued in November was in the form of a survey of four combat and support units in Afghanistan .
Soldiers with the 130th Engineer Brigade said that , after training , “ the system is still too complex and overwhelming for most to use . ”
“ DCGS continues to be unstable , slow , not friendly and a major hindrance to operations at the [ battalion ] level and lower , ” the brigade said .
The 101st Airborne Division found DCGS ’ workstation “ very complex and tiresome to figure out , ” says the memo from the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command to U.S. Army Forces Command , which prepares soldiers for deployment .
The seven-page memo says that 4th Infantry Division soldiers “ arrived to their first duty assignment with almost no exposure to the DCGS-A . ”
The firsthand complaints were documented despite Army pledges that the catch-all intelligence processor is working out its bugs during a more than decadelong development .
An Army spokesman at the Pentagon said the survey is part of an Army-wide process to “ ensure constant improvement ” and to fix problems .
“ The issues identified in this training readiness assessment conducted last year provided the Army with the feedback required to evaluate and refine our soldiers ’ pre-deployment training as well as to enhance DCGS-A workflow concerns , ” the spokesman said .
“ As a result of this survey , theater leaders took immediate steps to address the training gaps of survey respondents , while the Army incorporated the soldiers ’ feedback to enhance pre-deployment training and DCGS-A capabilities for the next rotations . ”
Soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division said Army training on the Distributed Common Ground System “ is outdated and [ requires ] a complete overhaul to capture the complex environment we work in . ”
The division , which officially returned Friday to Fort Campbell , Ky. , said its targeting cell uses an off-the-shelf computer server , Palantir , for “ ease of use ” in carrying out what is called link analysis — trying to find connections among suspected insurgents .
Rep. Duncan Hunter , California Republican , has urged the Army over the past two years to let more units use Palantir in their hunt for improvised explosive devices , the No . 1 killer of U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Mr. Hunter said top brass often made it difficult to buy Palantir because the Army wanted to protect the Distributed Common Ground System , for which it has spent much money and development time .
In the survey , a copy of which was obtained by The ███ , the 101s Division said it used the system in a limited way to present updates to the division ’ s commanding general . Outside the division ’ s fusion center , all other sections relied on Microsoft PowerPoint .
The 4th Infantry Division , which has been in charge of Regional Command South since July , said its intelligence officers received 80 hours of training on the Distributed Common Ground System but still “ lack an overall understanding of how it fits into building a common intelligence picture . ”
The division said a network feature enabling soldiers to “ reach back ” to stateside analysts to help process intelligence “ is currently not working . ”
Meanwhile , the 130th Engineer Brigade talked of “ lost man hours ” on “ systems that would not remain stable and a host of computer issues . ”
It said the Distributed Common Ground System , though it boasts multiple capabilities , was confined to searching the military ’ s file of classified material and its workstation “ was never utilized. ” The unit instead turned to Palantir and Google Earth .
The 130th said Distributed Common Ground System received upgrades that “ erase or lose all of the user ’ s data ” and is handicapped by “ woefully inadequate computing power . ”
The one-star general who signed the memo wrote a summary that said , “ DCGS-A is a very powerful tool that can be useful in supporting analysts ability to perform in-depth analysis of the operational environment . ”
He added : “ It is lacking in some areas , such as reach back capability , system processing speed , system stability and network compliance in garrison and in theater . ”
Pre-deployment training at Fort Huachuca , Ariz. , “ is only adequate for teaching ‘ buttonology , ’ ” he said .
The general called for revamping the entire training system because what is learned in the states “ is not tailored to the units ’ needs . ”
In the 2014 defense budget , Congress cut the Army ’ s $ 267 million request for the Digital Common Ground System to $ 110 million .","An internal memo from the U.S. command in Afghanistan says soldiers are voicing strong complaints about the Army’s battlefield intelligence network, for which Congress just slashed spending by 60 percent.

Esper made a startling break with President Trump on Wednesday , saying he opposes the use of active-duty troops to help quell nationwide protests while putting clear distance between himself and the White House as questions grow about the Pentagon ’ s role in the crisis .
Mr. Esper made the comments amid withering criticism from lawmakers and retired officers who said the Pentagon chief has allowed the military to be drawn into a fierce political debate . Bucking the president raises questions about how long he will remain in his post . The White House was noncommittal about his future .
“ As of right now , Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper , ” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters . “ If the president loses faith , we will all learn about that in the future . ”
Days after Mr. Trump said he was strongly leaning toward using the military to restore order in Washington and other cities , Mr. Esper told a Pentagon briefing that “ the option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations . ”
“ We are not in one of those situations now , ” he said .
Pentagon leaders mulled whether to send roughly 1,600 troops dispatched to Washington back to their home bases in New York and North Carolina . There were conflicting reports late Wednesday on whether the troop redeployments began . Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press that some 200 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division scheduled to leave were staying in the Washington area for now .
Mr. Esper ’ s blunt words also underscored the delicate balance he must strike as the leader of a diverse military force with top leaders who are taking increasingly public stands against systemic racism and injustice after the death last week of George Floyd , a black man , during a confrontation with Minneapolis police .
The defense chief , a former defense industry official deeply familiar with the world of Washington politics , sought to keep his department out of the line of fire from the chain of events outside the White House on Monday night .
Mr. Esper said National Guard forces did not use tear gas or rubber bullets as widely reported . He insisted he played no role in the decision to aggressively disband protesters minutes ahead of the president ’ s extraordinary walk across Lafayette Square to pose with a Bible in front of the historic , riot-damaged St. John ’ s Church .
But he also acknowledged that he was aware of Mr. Trump ’ s destination when the walk began .
“ I did know … that many of us were going to join President Trump and review damage at Lafayette Park and at St. John ’ s Episcopal Church , ” Mr. Esper told reporters . “ What I was not aware of was exactly where we were going when we arrived at the church , and what the plans were once we got there . ”
Mr. Esper said he personally ordered an investigation to determine who gave the green light for a National Guard helicopter to fly low over a crowd of demonstrators as an intimidation tactic , and he expressed regret over his widely criticized use of the term “ battlespace ” in a phone call with U.S. governors this week to describe city streets gripped by protests , riots and looting .
But the secretary made his strongest comments when he discussed Mr. Trump ’ s threat to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act and the role of active-duty forces in a simmering domestic dispute .
“ I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act , ” he said at one point . “ I do everything I can to stay apolitical . ”
The very suggestion sparked a roiling debate in military circles . Two retired former heads of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — Adm. Michael Mullen and Gen. Martin Dempsey — raised doubts about the wisdom of employing the military to keep order .
Adm. Mullen , writing this week in The Atlantic , raised the stakes with a direct questioning of Mr. Trump ’ s leadership .
The admiral said he was confident that the men and women in uniform “ will obey lawful orders . … I am less confident in the orders they will be given by this commander in chief . ”
Gen. Dempsey wrote in a Twitter post that “ America is not a battleground . Our fellow citizens are not the enemy. ” Retired Gen. Michael V. Hayden , former director of the CIA and NSA , told CNN in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Esper “ didn ’ t do enough ” to keep the military out of the political dogfight .
Mr. Trump has not formally followed through with his threat to use the 1807 law . National Guard troops are active in dozens of states across the country to assist law enforcement , but no active-duty forces have been mobilized other than in the Washington area , where Army troops were placed on standby at bases outside the District of Columbia .
Even some leading Republicans , such as Gov . Greg Abbott of Texas , said they had no interest in seeing active-duty forces patrol the streets in their states .
But Mr. Esper ’ s statement Wednesday is unlikely to be the last word on the controversy , Pentagon watchers said .
“ Distancing himself from POTUS , and clarifying that he wasn ’ t aware what POTUS was going to ask of him , is not only surreal but also suggests SECDEF and POTUS aren ’ t in [ sync ] . Not a good look to our adversaries , ” Caroline Baxter , a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corp. , tweeted Wednesday .
The president reportedly was irked by Mr. Esper ’ s comments , which seem to have caught the White House by surprise . Top administration officials offered little in the way of reassurance that the secretary retains Mr. Trump ’ s trust .
Ms. McEnany appeared to dismiss Mr. Esper ’ s comments by noting that the president “ has the sole authority to invoke the Insurrection Act . ”
But with pushback from the military and loud complaints on Capitol Hill , military analysts say there are innumerable risks and unintended consequences to a wide-scale deployment of U.S. forces in the homeland , including the psychological pain it could inflict on the nation and the fear that it could lead to an escalation of tensions .
“ Law enforcement and the National Guard receive training for domestic crowd-control operations and are experienced in the local conditions necessary to keep protesters safe while preventing the proliferation of violence . Active-duty troops , however , are trained primarily to kill the enemy in war zones , ” said retired Army Lt. Col. Daniel Davis , now a senior fellow at Defense Priorities , a Washington think tank that advocates a more restrained U.S. foreign policy .
Mr. Esper expressed his opposition after a host of retired military leaders blasted the notion of using the Insurrection Act . But he went much further in seeking to distance himself and the military from the extraordinary events that unfolded at the White House on Monday evening .
He said he was unaware when he arrived at the White House that he would be part of a photo opportunity with the president . Mr. Esper also said he had no knowledge of what was being done on the streets a block from the White House to clear the way for Mr. Trump and his entourage .
“ I was not aware of law enforcement plans for the park , ” he said . “ I was not briefed on them , nor should I expect to be . ”
Mr. Esper also made clear that he is not sure who is responsible for directing a National Guard helicopter to conduct low-flying maneuvers in the area . The National Guard is investigating the incident at Mr. Esper ’ s direction .
The secretary began the press conference by offering his personal thoughts on the death of Mr. Floyd , the subsequent protests and systemic racism in the U.S . It was the first time he spoke at length about Mr. Floyd ’ s killing .
“ The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman is a horrible crime , ” he said . “ The officers on the scene that day should be held accountable for his murder . It is a tragedy we have seen repeat itself too many times .
“ Racism is real in America , and we must all do our very best to recognize it , to confront it and to eradicate it , ” Mr. Esper continued . “ More often than not , we have led on these issues . And while we still have much to do on this front , leaders across DoD and the services take this response seriously . ”
Top officials across the military offered similar messages this week as leaders sought to unify the armed forces , confront the Pentagon ’ s own struggles with racism and express support for those who are peacefully protesting for change .
“ As members of the Joint Force — comprised of all races , colors and creeds — you embody the ideals of our Constitution , ” Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley said in a letter to commanders late Tuesday . “ Please remind all of our troops and leaders that we will uphold the values of our nation , and operate consistent with national laws and our own high standards of conduct at all times . ”","Defense Secretary Mark T.

But the secretary made his strongest comments when he discussed Mr. Trump’s threat to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act and the role of active-duty forces in a simmering domestic dispute.

“I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act,” he said at one point. “I do everything I can to stay apolitical.”

The very suggestion sparked a roiling debate in military circles. Two retired former heads of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — Adm. Michael Mullen and Gen. Martin Dempsey — raised doubts about the wisdom of employing the military to keep order.

Adm. Mullen, writing this week in The Atlantic, raised the stakes with a direct questioning of Mr. Trump’s leadership.

The admiral said he was confident that the men and women in uniform “will obey lawful orders. … I am less confident in the orders they will be given by this commander in chief.”

Gen. Dempsey wrote in a Twitter post that “America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy.” Retired Gen. Michael V. Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, told CNN in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Esper “didn’t do enough” to keep the military out of the political dogfight.

Mr. Trump has not formally followed through with his threat to use the 1807 law. National Guard troops are active in dozens of states across the country to assist law enforcement, but no active-duty forces have been mobilized other than in the Washington area, where Army troops were placed on standby at bases outside the District of Columbia.

Even some leading Republicans, such as Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, said they had no interest in seeing active-duty forces patrol the streets in their states.

But Mr. Esper’s statement Wednesday is unlikely to be the last word on the controversy, Pentagon watchers said.

“Distancing himself from POTUS, and clarifying that he wasn’t aware what POTUS was going to ask of him, is not only surreal but also suggests SECDEF and POTUS aren’t in [sync]. Not a good look to our adversaries,” Caroline Baxter, a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corp., tweeted Wednesday.

Dissension in the ranks

The president reportedly was irked by Mr. Esper’s comments, which seem to have caught the White House by surprise. Top administration officials offered little in the way of reassurance that the secretary retains Mr. Trump’s trust.

Ms. McEnany appeared to dismiss Mr. Esper’s comments by noting that the president “has the sole authority to invoke the Insurrection Act.”

But with pushback from the military and loud complaints on Capitol Hill, military analysts say there are innumerable risks and unintended consequences to a wide-scale deployment of U.S. forces in the homeland, including the psychological pain it could inflict on the nation and the fear that it could lead to an escalation of tensions.

“Law enforcement and the National Guard receive training for domestic crowd-control operations and are experienced in the local conditions necessary to keep protesters safe while preventing the proliferation of violence. Active-duty troops, however, are trained primarily to kill the enemy in war zones,” said retired Army Lt. Col. Daniel Davis, now a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington think tank that advocates a more restrained U.S. foreign policy.

Mr. Esper expressed his opposition after a host of retired military leaders blasted the notion of using the Insurrection Act. But he went much further in seeking to distance himself and the military from the extraordinary events that unfolded at the White House on Monday evening.

He said he was unaware when he arrived at the White House that he would be part of a photo opportunity with the president. Mr. Esper also said he had no knowledge of what was being done on the streets a block from the White House to clear the way for Mr. Trump and his entourage.

“I was not aware of law enforcement plans for the park,” he said. “I was not briefed on them, nor should I expect to be.”

Mr. Esper also made clear that he is not sure who is responsible for directing a National Guard helicopter to conduct low-flying maneuvers in the area. The National Guard is investigating the incident at Mr. Esper’s direction.

The secretary began the press conference by offering his personal thoughts on the death of Mr. Floyd, the subsequent protests and systemic racism in the U.S. It was the first time he spoke at length about Mr. Floyd’s killing.

“The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman is a horrible crime,” he said. “The officers on the scene that day should be held accountable for his murder. It is a tragedy we have seen repeat itself too many times.

“Racism is real in America, and we must all do our very best to recognize it, to confront it and to eradicate it,” Mr. Esper continued. “More often than not, we have led on these issues. And while we still have much to do on this front, leaders across DoD and the services take this response seriously.”

Top officials across the military offered similar messages this week as leaders sought to unify the armed forces, confront the Pentagon’s own struggles with racism and express support for those who are peacefully protesting for change.

“As members of the Joint Force — comprised of all races, colors and creeds — you embody the ideals of our Constitution,” Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley said in a letter to commanders late Tuesday. “Please remind all of our troops and leaders that we will uphold the values of our nation, and operate consistent with national laws and our own high standards of conduct at all times.”

Why has the president decided on this now?

The timing of this transgender ban is almost as interesting as the move itself.

Why now? With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch, the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign, the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill, perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side.

Republicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals. As one White House insider acknowledged, this is straight out of that playbook. While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights, he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now, more than ever.

Or perhaps, as Politico is reporting, the White House sought to resolve an intraparty dispute that threatened passage of a key military spending bill in the House of Representatives. That the president chose to do so suddenly, with little advanced notice, would not be out of the ordinary for this administration.

The president's action will create a furore among liberals and the media commentators whose disdain for the current administration is not a new development. This is a fight the White House will welcome.

What is the status of transgender service personnel?

The independent Rand Corporation estimated in 2016 that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000.

Rand also predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would cause a 0.13% increase in healthcare spending (approximately $8.4m).

We 're calling the project `` Back at Base . '' This is the second of four reports this week about the National Guard .
Inside the hangar at Washington state 's Joint Base Lewis-McChord ( JBLM ) , the Army National Guard mechanics are busy maintaining a neat line of Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters .
Some of the Washington Guard 's Chinooks have flown in every war since Vietnam and they have the bullet holes to prove it .
`` So we get hand-me-downs , '' says Col. David Caporicci , the deputy commander of the 66th Theater Aviation Command . `` So , like I 'm the middle child . So my bigger brother , the Army , gets brand new stuff and when he gets new stuff I get his old stuff . Unfortunately you know the knees are worn out in the pants and the socks got holes in them and that 's what I get ! ''
It 's a mostly friendly family rivalry here in Washington state .
But as Congress cuts $ 500 billion out of the Defense Department budget , the active Army and the National Guard are competing for the same dollars .
At JBLM , which is 40 miles south of Seattle , the fight is over equipment : Not just old helicopters but also whether the Guard gets some of the active Army 's best armored vehicles known as Strykers .
`` We 're saying , 'Hey , put us in . ' You know we 've been a heavy brigade combat team for years , '' says Major Gen. Bret Daugherty , who leads the Washington National Guard . `` There 's 600 unused vehicles parked at JBLM right now there 's absolutely no reason we could n't convert to Strykers and save the Army money in that process . ''
Daugherty is part of a three-state effort to let the Guard swap old Bradley fighting vehicles for the more modern Strykers .
He says the Guard needs the Strykers because its troops are called on for so many missions . For example , they 've deployed to Iraq , and they also help the state . Right now the Guard is training in preparation of any major earthquakes in the region .
`` When that earthquake strikes us and all the bridges come down , tanks and Bradleys are not going to be able to help the citizens of Washington , whereas wheeled Stryker vehicles with their state of the art electronics and digital communications suite will , '' says Daugherty .

NPR — along with seven public radio stations around the country — is chronicling the lives of America's troops where they live. We're calling the project ""Back at Base."" This is the second of four reports this week about the National Guard.

Inside the hangar at Washington state's Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), the Army National Guard mechanics are busy maintaining a neat line of Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters.

Some of the Washington Guard's Chinooks have flown in every war since Vietnam and they have the bullet holes to prove it.

""So we get hand-me-downs,"" says Col. David Caporicci, the deputy commander of the 66th Theater Aviation Command. ""So, like I'm the middle child. So my bigger brother, the Army, gets brand new stuff and when he gets new stuff I get his old stuff. Unfortunately you know the knees are worn out in the pants and the socks got holes in them and that's what I get!""

It's a mostly friendly family rivalry here in Washington state.

But as Congress cuts $500 billion out of the Defense Department budget, the active Army and the National Guard are competing for the same dollars.

At JBLM, which is 40 miles south of Seattle, the fight is over equipment: Not just old helicopters but also whether the Guard gets some of the active Army's best armored vehicles known as Strykers.

""We're saying, 'Hey, put us in.' You know we've been a heavy brigade combat team for years,"" says Major Gen. Bret Daugherty, who leads the Washington National Guard. ""There's 600 unused vehicles parked at JBLM right now there's absolutely no reason we couldn't convert to Strykers and save the Army money in that process.""

Daugherty is part of a three-state effort to let the Guard swap old Bradley fighting vehicles for the more modern Strykers.

He says the Guard needs the Strykers because its troops are called on for so many missions. For example, they've deployed to Iraq, and they also help the state. Right now the Guard is training in preparation of any major earthquakes in the region.

""When that earthquake strikes us and all the bridges come down, tanks and Bradleys are not going to be able to help the citizens of Washington, whereas wheeled Stryker vehicles with their state of the art electronics and digital communications suite will,"" says Daugherty.

But the active Army says it needs those Strykers to do their job, too.

""It's a zero-sum game,"" says Lt. Gen. Stephen Lanza, the commander of all active Army forces at JBLM. ""I think it's an Army decision. I think the Guard brings it up and I think the Army will decide if they want to convert that brigade to a Stryker brigade.""

Lazna says he can't spare people or equipment. After the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon shifted its focus to the Pacific — everything from humanitarian missions to deterring China — and Lanza's command is central to that plan.

""If you have a strategy that's not resourced, one of two things has to happen. Either you change the strategy or you provide the additional resources to accomplish the strategy you've been given,"" he says.

The National Guard could lose 35,000 citizen soldiers nationally and 1,000 from Washington state.

One of them will probably be Caporicci — who works at that aircraft hangar.

The Army has already targeted his aviation command for deactivation. The helicopters are staying, it's just the officers who won't.

""It means I'll have to go find a real job ... It's not anything anybody can ... well you know, nobody likes to be laid off,"" he says.

The United States Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump to enforce his policy of banning certain transgender people from the military.

The court voted 5-4 to grant a Trump administration request to lift injunctions blocking the policy while challenges continue in lower courts.

The four liberal judges on the court opposed the ruling.

The policy prohibits ""transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition"" from serving.

The top court's ruling is not a mandate, but it has opened up the option for the military to enforce the ban.

The Trump administration had also appealed for an expedited ruling on the case, which the Supreme Court declined to take up.

What is the transgender policy?

The president announced on Twitter in 2017 that the country would no longer ""accept or allow"" transgender Americans to serve in the military, citing ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"".

The then defence secretary Jim Mattis refined the policy to limit it to individuals with a history of gender dysphoria, or when a person's biological sex and identity does not match.

He said the new policy would make exceptions for several hundred transgender people already serving openly or willing to serve ""in their biological sex"".

There are currently some 8,980 active duty transgender troops, according to Department of Defence data analysed by the Palm Center, a public policy nonprofit.

Gen Mattis in his memo argued that ""by its very nature, military service requires sacrifice,"" and that those who serve ""voluntarily accept limitations on their personal liberties"".

The move is a reversal of an Obama administration policy that ruled transgender Americans could serve openly in the military as well as obtain funding for gender re-assignment surgery.

The battle continues

This is just one Supreme Court action - and it's a procedural move, not a formal court opinion - but it may be a sign that a conservative majority sympathetic to presidential powers and prerogatives is flexing its muscles.

The Trump administration, frustrated that lower-court judges had again blocked implementation of one of its policy decisions, asked the justices to step in and clear the path.

The White House wanted a quick ruling because, it said, allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military presented ""too great a risk to military effectiveness"".

By a bare majority, the court complied.

Although the justices did not entirely bypass the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which the president has tried to paint as a bastion of liberal judges, they did the next best thing for the president.

They permitted the transgender ban to go into effect while the legal fight, which could last years, grinds on.

For the past two years, the president's opponents - locked out of national power until recently - have looked to the judicial system as a last line of defence.

As Tuesday clearly showed, however, those defences are only as strong as a majority of the Supreme Court says they are.

What are the legal challenges?

Several trial judges around the country had issued injunctions blocking the ban.

One injunction was reversed in a federal appeals court earlier this month, with a three-judge panel ruling the policy was not a ""blanket ban"" on transgender troops, and so the courts should defer to the executive branch's military decisions.

While Mr Trump's rationale for banning transgender troops was financial, according to estimates by the RAND Corporation, a policy think tank working with the US Armed Forces, transition-related healthcare costs are between $2.4m (£1.8m) and $8.4m per year.

“This House resolution tries to undermine the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevent terrorist activity by Iran and its proxies, and attempts to hinder the President’s authority to protect America and our interests in the region from the continued threats. These Congressional actions are completely misguided. In fact, this ridiculous resolution is just another political move because, under well-established Supreme Court precedent, it’s non-binding and lacks the force of law,” he said in a statement issued ahead of the president’s rally in Toledo, Ohio.

“President Trump’s decision to strike Qassem Soleimani, the world’s leading terrorist, was the right course of action and authorized under his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive as well as the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force.”",www.nypost.com,right,flKczYr2LzmVMxBa

With less than four days to go before peace talks are to begin in Afghanistan between that nation's authorities and the Taliban insurgency, things are not looking promising.

Taliban fighters are stepping up attacks on Afghan security forces. American warplanes are counterattacking. And a prisoner exchange that was to take place before those intra-Afghan talks start is being rejected by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

On Friday in western Kabul, the Associated Press reports that gunmen opened fire at a largely Shiite gathering, killing at least 32 and injuring scores more. The Islamic State-Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the attack.

All this comes after the U.S. and the Taliban — but not the Afghan government — signed an agreement Feb. 29 in Doha, Qatar with the stated aim of ""bringing peace to Afghanistan"" more than 18 years after U.S. forces pushed the Taliban out of power.

IRAQ

SAUDI ARABIA

Islamic State militants have carried out deadly bombings and shootings in Saudi Arabia against security forces and minority Shi’ite Muslims, after the authorities crushed an al Qaeda insurgency more than a decade ago.

Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) has focused on attacking military bases in raids over the last year. It has become the dominant militant group in the region.

The extent of support provided by Islamic State to ISWAP is unclear and many security experts say the relationship is mainly in name rather than direct funding and logistical support.

AFGHANISTAN

Islamic State in Khorasan (ISIS-K), which took its name from a historical region that covered much of modern-day Afghanistan and parts of Central Asia, appeared in late 2014 in the eastern province of Nangarhar, where it retains a stronghold. It announced its formation in January 2015.

The group’s leadership has pledged allegiance to Baghdadi but it is not clear that ISIS-K has direct operational links with the main movement.

It has claimed attacks on civilian targets in cities including Kabul and fought the Afghan Taliban for control of a number of rural districts. U.S. commanders say its forces number fewer than 2,000.

The movement is little understood and many Afghan officials in Kabul doubt the veracity of some of its claims of responsibility.

SRI LANKA

Islamic State claimed the Easter Sunday bomb attacks on churches and hotels in April and released a video showing eight men declaring loyalty to Baghdadi.

IS claimed the men in the video, released by its Amaq news agency, carried out the suicide bombings.

Sri Lankan officials blamed two domestic Islamist groups with suspected ties to Islamic State.

INDONESIA

Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country and most people practise a moderate form of Islam. But there has been a resurgence in militancy and authorities have said they believe thousands of Indonesians draw inspiration from Islamic State, while about 500 Indonesians are thought to have gone to Syria to join the group.

A court sentenced a cleric, Aman Abdurrahman, to death last year for masterminding deadly attacks. Abdurrahman is considered the ideological leader of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) - a loose grouping of Islamic State sympathisers in Indonesia.

Suicide bombings in May last year in Surabaya that killed more than 30 people were linked to JAD cells.

The Philippines fears that extremists fleeing Iraq and Syria could find a safe haven in the jungles and remote villages of Muslim areas of Mindanao, where there is a long history of lawlessness, clan rivalry and separatist and Islamist rebellion.

us_military,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/politics/scotus-transgender-ban/index.html,Supreme Court allows transgender military ban to go into effect,2019-01-22,"Ariane De Vogue, Zachary Cohen","Washington ( CNN ) The Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump 's transgender military ban to go into effect on Tuesday , dealing a blow to LGBT activists who call the ban cruel and irrational .
In an unsigned 5-4 order , the justices took no stance on the legality of the ban , first proposed in a surprise tweet by Trump in 2017 , but Tuesday 's action clears the way for it to take effect while lower courts hear additional arguments .
The four liberal justices objected to allowing the administration 's policy banning most transgender people from serving in the military to go into effect .
The policy , first announced by the President in July 2017 via Twitter , and later officially released by then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis in 2018 , blocks individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition known as gender dysphoria from serving with limited exceptions . It also specifies that individuals without the condition can serve , but only if they do so according to the sex they were assigned at birth .
In a statement released after the Supreme Court action , the Pentagon sought to clarify that its policy is not a ban on all transgender persons from the military .
`` As always , we treat all transgender persons with respect and dignity . ( The Department of Defense 's ) proposed policy is NOT a ban on service by transgender persons . It is critical that DoD be permitted to implement personnel policies that it determines are necessary to ensure the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world . DoD 's proposed policy is based on professional military judgment and will ensure that the U.S. Armed Forces remain the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world , '' Lt. Col. Carla Gleason , a Pentagon spokesperson , told CNN .
In July 2017 , Trump surprised military leaders by tweeting , `` After consultation with my Generals and military experts , please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military , '' Trump said . `` Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and can not be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail . ''
His tweets came less than a month into the six-month delay set by Mattis to review the US military 's policy on transgender service members .
The Pentagon was forced to allow transgender applicants to join the military on January 1 , 2018 , after a federal court ruling .
After Trump called for a ban on transgender persons serving in the military , Mattis directed Patrick Shanahan , the then-deputy secretary of defense and now-acting Secretary of Defense , and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Paul Selva to develop the implementation plan .
Most transgender persons are now disqualified from military service except :
Service members who have been stable for three years in their biological sex prior to joining the military -- meaning 36 months after completion of surgery and hormone treatments .
Service members diagnosed with `` gender dysphoria '' after joining the military can stay in the military if they do n't require a change of gender and remain deployable . Gender dysphoria involves a conflict between a person 's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which the person identifies , according to the American Psychiatric Association .
Service members who were diagnosed with `` gender dysphoria '' before the effective date of the policy can still serve and receive medical treatment .
Transgender persons without a gender dysphoria diagnosis or history can serve in their birth sex .
The Defense Department can issue waivers on a case-by-case basis .
The policy also states that transgender persons serving who require gender reassignment surgery or hormonal treatment during their service would be disqualified due to their inability to be deployed for a period longer than 12 months .
By the government 's own numbers in 2016 , there were approximately 8,980 Service members that identify as transgender . During the Obama administration , 937 members were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and began or completed their transition .
The Pentagon policy remains on hold at least temporarily because of an injunction from a Maryland federal judge that is technically still in place , but is expected to be paused in the next few days based on the Supreme Court 's action .
A defense official tells CNN the Pentagon is not putting the transgender restrictions into place immediately , pending the resolution of the Maryland case . A Justice Department official said it will file a motion to dissolve the final injunction , and the ACLU believes the Maryland judge will follow the Supreme Court 's move .
Shortly after the court 's order , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tweeted that the policy was `` purpose-built to humiliate brave men & women seeking to serve their country . ''

''","Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump's transgender military ban to go into effect on Tuesday, dealing a blow to LGBT activists who call the ban cruel and irrational.

In an unsigned 5-4 order, the justices took no stance on the legality of the ban, first proposed in a surprise tweet by Trump in 2017, but Tuesday's action clears the way for it to take effect while lower courts hear additional arguments.

The four liberal justices objected to allowing the administration's policy banning most transgender people from serving in the military to go into effect.

The policy, first announced by the President in July 2017 via Twitter, and later officially released by then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis in 2018, blocks individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition known as gender dysphoria from serving with limited exceptions. It also specifies that individuals without the condition can serve, but only if they do so according to the sex they were assigned at birth.

In a statement released after the Supreme Court action, the Pentagon sought to clarify that its policy is not a ban on all transgender persons from the military.

""As always, we treat all transgender persons with respect and dignity. (The Department of Defense's) proposed policy is NOT a ban on service by transgender persons. It is critical that DoD be permitted to implement personnel policies that it determines are necessary to ensure the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world. DoD's proposed policy is based on professional military judgment and will ensure that the U.S. Armed Forces remain the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world,"" Lt. Col. Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokesperson, told CNN.

In July 2017, Trump surprised military leaders by tweeting , ""After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,"" Trump said. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.""

His tweets came less than a month into the six-month delay set by Mattis to review the US military's policy on transgender service members.

The Pentagon was forced to allow transgender applicants to join the military on January 1, 2018, after a federal court ruling.

Who is affected by SCOTUS decision?

After Trump called for a ban on transgender persons serving in the military, Mattis directed Patrick Shanahan, the then-deputy secretary of defense and now-acting Secretary of Defense, and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Paul Selva to develop the implementation plan.

Most transgender persons are now disqualified from military service except:

Service members who have been stable for three years in their biological sex prior to joining the military -- meaning 36 months after completion of surgery and hormone treatments.

Service members diagnosed with ""gender dysphoria"" after joining the military can stay in the military if they don't require a change of gender and remain deployable. Gender dysphoria involves a conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which the person identifies, according to the American Psychiatric Association.

Service members who were diagnosed with ""gender dysphoria"" before the effective date of the policy can still serve and receive medical treatment.

Transgender persons without a gender dysphoria diagnosis or history can serve in their birth sex.

The Defense Department can issue waivers on a case-by-case basis.

The policy also states that transgender persons serving who require gender reassignment surgery or hormonal treatment during their service would be disqualified due to their inability to be deployed for a period longer than 12 months.

By the government's own numbers in 2016, there were approximately 8,980 Service members that identify as transgender. During the Obama administration, 937 members were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and began or completed their transition.

The Pentagon policy remains on hold at least temporarily because of an injunction from a Maryland federal judge that is technically still in place, but is expected to be paused in the next few days based on the Supreme Court's action.

A defense official tells CNN the Pentagon is not putting the transgender restrictions into place immediately, pending the resolution of the Maryland case. A Justice Department official said it will file a motion to dissolve the final injunction, and the ACLU believes the Maryland judge will follow the Supreme Court's move.

Reaction to SCOTUS decision

Shortly after the court's order, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tweeted that the policy was ""purpose-built to humiliate brave men & women seeking to serve their country.""

""Deeply concerning that #SCOTUS is allowing his ban to proceed for now,"" she continued.

The court's move is a victory for the Trump administration. While government lawyers wanted the Court to take up the case, they also fought to allow the ban to go into effect while the case plays out in the lower courts.

""Today's dual rulings on the transgender ban allow the controversial policy to go into effect for now, but also allow the appeals to go forward in the lower courts,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analysis and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law.

""The government had asked the Justices to take the issue up even before the appeals courts could rule. Even though the Court denied that request, the fact that the Court is allowing the policy to go into effect suggests not only that it will eventually take the case on the merits, but also that five of the Justices believe the government is likely to prevail if and when that happens,"" Vladeck said.

The Justice Department applauded the order, saying in a statement that the Defense Department ""has the authority to create and implement personnel policies it has determined are necessary to best defend our nation.""

""Due to lower courts issuing nationwide injunctions, our military had been forced to maintain a prior policy that poses a risk to military effectiveness and lethality for over a year,"" Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department said in a statement. ""We will continue to defend in the courts the authority and ability of the Pentagon to ensure the safety and security of the American people.""

Laura Durso, Vice President of the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the Cener for American Progress, called the policy ""dehumanizing.""

The White House has not yet decided how it will implement the president's ban on transgender people serving in the US military.

Mr Trump's surprise Twitter announcement on Wednesday has been met with criticism from rights groups.

Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration would work alongside the Pentagon to decide how to proceed.

It is not yet clear how the announcement will affect current transgender service personnel.

Transgender service members have expressed concern that they will be discharged, or unable to re-enlist.

The timing also appears to have caught defence officials by surprise.

Why was the ban introduced?

""The United States government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US military,"" Donald Trump tweeted.

""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.""

He added that the decision came ""after consultation with my Generals and military experts"".

Some US media outlets have questioned the spending justification. The Washington Post drew attention to an analysis that the US military spends almost $42m (£32m) a year on the erectile dysfunction medication Viagra - several times the total estimated cost of transgender medical support.

Asked at a press briefing if troops on battlefields would be immediately sent back, Ms Huckabee Sanders said the policy had yet to be worked out.

""The decision is based on a military decision. It's not meant to be anything more than that,"" she said.

The timing of this transgender ban is almost as interesting as the move itself.

Why now? With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch, the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign, the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill, perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side.

Republicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals.

While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights, he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now, more than ever.

What is the status of transgender service personnel?

The independent Rand Corporation estimates that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000.

The Obama administration announced last year that transgender people would be allowed to serve openly in the military.

Many active duty members came out following the decision.

Then-defence secretary Ash Carter also set a deadline of one year for the various branches of the military to begin accepting transgender recruits.

The new joint agency, the Space Development Agency, is seen as the centerpiece of the Pentagon's efforts, as it will oversee satellite development and launch contracts.

Boeing stock climbed 1.5% to 356.30 on the stock market today, heading toward a 374.58 buy point. Lockheed was up 1.8%, Northrop rose 1.9%, and Raytheon jumped 2.4%. Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD), which makes propulsion systems for the military and commercial sectors, surged nearly 22% after reporting strong earnings late Monday.

Creating a Space Force will have an outsized effect on the Air Force, whose Air Force Space Command is responsible for military launches. The service's Space and Missile Systems Center also controls 85% of the Pentagon's space procurement budget, according to Defense One.

But the Pentagon is pushing the service to speed up acquisitions and launches as the military moves from large satellites to smaller, cheaper and more resilient ones.

The new age of space technology ""will unlock growth in the U.S. industrial base, expand the commercial space economy and strengthen partnerships with our allies,"" the draft reportedly says.

Last month, George Ferguson, a senior defense analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence said that standing up a Space Force would likely increase spending for satellites.

But a new service would still need to compete against the other established branches for funding. The Pentagon's budget is already stretched with spending on Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet, Northrop's B-21 bomber, several massive shipbuilding programs, and missile defense priorities.

Speaking from the Pentagon briefing room podium , Esper noted that `` we are not in one of those situations now , '' distancing himself from President Donald Trump 's recent threat to deploy the military to enforce order .
`` The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort , and only in the most urgent and dire of situations . We are not in one of those situations now . I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act , '' he told reporters . Esper also distanced himself from a maligned photo-op outside St. John 's Church .
Wednesday 's press briefing by Esper went over poorly at the White House , where his standing was already viewed to be tenuous , multiple people familiar with the matter said .
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany would not directly answer Wednesday whether Trump still has confidence in Esper , saying instead , `` as of right now Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper . ''
`` With regard to whether the President has confidence , I would say if he loses confidence in Secretary Esper , I 'm sure you all will be the first to know , '' McEnany said during Wednesday 's press briefing .
`` Should the President lose faith , we will all learn about that in the future , '' she added .
Late Wednesday night , three sources told CNN that Esper will stay on the job for now . He was at the White House for a little under three hours earlier , where he had several meetings , including one in the Oval Office with Trump .
A senior Republican source told CNN that there has been ongoing tension involving Esper and that Trump has no respect for his defense chief . Esper has had little influence and essentially takes his lead from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the source said , adding that this latest press conference will undoubtedly make things worse .
Trump and other top officials , including national security adviser Robert O'Brien , are `` not happy '' with Esper after his Wednesday remarks , three people familiar with the White House 's thinking said .
One White House official said aides there did not get a heads up about the content of Esper 's remarks , most notably Esper 's decision to publicly break with the President on the use of the military to address unrest in US cities .
Esper 's comments Wednesday came after defense officials told CNN this week that there was deep and growing discomfort among some in the Pentagon even before Trump announced Monday that he is ready to deploy active duty forces if local leaders fail to ramp up enforcement efforts .
As tear gas wafted through the air in Lafayette Park across from the White House , Trump announced from the Rose Garden that if state or city leaders refuse `` to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents , '' he will invoke the Insurrection Act , an 1807 law that allows a president to deploy the US military to suppress civil disorder .
Esper and Gen. Mark Milley , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , have faced a flurry of questions and criticism in the wake of Trump 's comments , pressure that culminated in Esper 's appearance in the Pentagon briefing room Wednesday where he attempted to distance himself from the President 's rhetoric and clean up some of his own .
Asked about his use of the word `` battlespace '' when discussing quelling violence on the streets amid civil unrest , Esper attempted to explain that it was `` something we use day in and day out ... it 's part of our military lexicon that I grew up with ... it 's not a phrase focused on people . ''
`` In retrospect I would have used different wording , '' Esper said .
Esper also addressed the killing of Floyd , calling it a `` horrible crime '' and said `` racism is real in America , and we must all do our very best to recognize it , to confront it , and to eradicate it . ''
`` The officers on the scene that day should be held accountable for his murder . It is a tragedy that we have seen repeat itself too many times . With great sympathy , I want to extend the deepest of condolences to the family and friends of George Floyd from me and the Department . Racism is real in America , and we must all do our very best to recognize it , to confront it , and to eradicate it , '' he said .
Later , Wednesday Esper 's predecessor , former Defense Secretary James Mattis , launched an extraordinary attac k on Trump , calling him `` the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try . ''
`` We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort . We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership . We can unite without him , drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society , '' Mattis said in a statement .
`` This will not be easy , as the past few days have shown , but we owe it to our fellow citizens ; to past generations that bled to defend our promise ; and to our children , '' he said .
Mattis had avoided attacking the President in his public remarks since resigning in December 2018 , claiming he owes the Trump administration a `` duty of silence . ''
Prior to his statement Wednesday , the retired four-star Marine Corps general had not mentioned Trump by name , but did implicitly criticize his former commander in chief , with whom he sharply disagreed on matters of international engagement and alliances , in a string of recent public statements and interviews .
Mattis made clear Wednesday he no longer feels bound by that same duty , issuing a scathing rebuke of the President he once served .
`` Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief , with military leadership standing alongside , '' he said .
`` We must reject any thinking of our cities as a 'battlespace ' that our uniformed military is called upon to 'dominate . ' At home , we should use our military only when requested to do so , on very rare occasions , by state governors . Militarizing our response , as we witnessed in Washington , D.C. , sets up a conflict—a false conflict— between the military and civilian society , '' Mattis added . `` It erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect , and of which they themselves are a part . ''
Meanwhile , Wednesday 's events have increased the focus on the fate of Mattis ' successor .
Sentiments inside the White House toward Esper had been gradually souring before this week 's episode , with both Trump and O'Brien viewing Esper as not entirely committed to the President 's vision for the military .
One person suggested the White House was reluctant to fire Esper given the current crisis and the fact that there are only five months left before the election . Another person suggested Trump could leave Esper in place and push blame his way . The President has a history of letting top officials languish in positions long after he 's lost confidence in them .
For months , the President and O'Brien have been losing faith in Esper 's ability to lead the military and his tendency to avoid offering a full-throated defense of the President or his policies , according to multiple administration officials .
O'Brien , in particular , has spoken to the President about Esper 's television remarks , which the White House has viewed on repeated occasions as problematic or off-message . On at least one occasion , O'Brien presented the President with print-outs that compare his own public remarks on a topic to those of Esper to highlight the contrast .
Trump has privately expressed frustrations with Esper in recent weeks , which aides believe would likely be accelerated by his comments about the ongoing nationwide protests . He vented about Esper at length during a recent weekend at Camp David , according to multiple sources .
Those complaints have raised questions about Esper 's future at the Pentagon should Trump win a second term , but his comments from the Pentagon briefing room Wednesday have prompted speculation that the timing of his departure could be moved up , the source said .
`` I think this is the end for him , '' they added .
A US official close to Esper and familiar with White House thinking said the secretary is being `` skewered '' by those inside the White House for coming out Wednesday to express his views .
`` ( I 'm ) not sure who thought that was a good idea , '' another official told CNN .
In December , Esper sat for an interview with Fox News ' Bret Baier at the Ronald Reagan Defense Forum and when asked what it was like to work for Trump , he responded , `` he is just another one of many bosses I 've had and you 've had your time that you learn to work with . ''
The remark irritated the President , who tends to expect lavish praise from his Cabinet , according to two administration officials . O'Brien , by contrast , almost never breaks with the President in his public remarks . O'Brien , who took over as national security adviser last September , is said by multiple administration officials to have expressed some level of interest in the job of either secretary of state or secretary of defense , should either of those positions become available .
On Tuesday , White House officials scratched their head at an interview Esper gave to NBC News claiming he did not know he was walking to St. John 's church on Monday with the President . Officials said the plans were clear inside the West Wing and that Esper 's explanations made little sense . Esper clarified on Wednesday that while he knew they were going to the church , he did not know the movement would turn into a photo opportunity .
In the hour after his press conference ended , Esper was seen arriving at the White House alongside Milley and Attorney General Bill Barr .
The trio stood together , all wearing masks , for a few moments before entering the building .
Outside the GOP lunch Wednesday , Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said that he hopes the President will listen to Esper 's perspective , telling reporters : `` I think Secretary Esper has the right to express his point of view , and the President does his , and I hope the President is willing to listen to the perspective of others and take that into account as he makes his decisions . ''
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito , a Republican from West Virginia , said she is `` glad '' Esper `` made his views '' on the Insurrection Act known .
The secretary of defense `` needs to be able to express his opinion , which is what he did , '' she told reporters Wednesday .
Asked whether Esper 's job could be in jeopardy following his remarks , or face some backlash from the Trump , Capito said , `` I would hope not , '' adding that the he is `` expressing his opinion '' and the President has to take `` into consideration '' that he 's the leader of the US armed forces .
Asked if he still has confidence in Esper as Defense Secretary , Rep. Mac Thornberry , the top Republican on the House Armed Services simply answered : `` yes . ''
On Tuesday , Thornberry said it would be appropriate for Esper and chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Gen. Mark Milley , to testify before the committee if the President followed through on his threat to invoke the Insurrection Act , a move that Esper made clear on Wednesday he did not believe was necessary at this time .
`` I am concerned that in the current environment , it would be all too easy to put our men and women in uniform in the middle of a domestic political and cultural crisis . Discussions regarding the Insurrection Act could easily make them political pawns . The respect , trust , and support our troops have earned from their fellow citizens is the foundation of their strength and we must be careful not to erode that strength , '' he said in a statement .
Asked Tuesday if he had confidence in Esper , the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , Rep. Adam Smith , said he `` ca n't really answer that question at this point '' until he speaks with Esper , which he had not done yet despite requesting a conversation with him .
Smith also called on both Esper and Milley to testify before the panel in an open hearing next week and `` explain this domestic engagement to the American people . ''
`` I have serious concerns about using military forces to respond to protestors . The role of the US military in domestic US law enforcement is limited by law . It must not be used in violation of those limits and I see little evidence that President Trump understands this fundamental premise , '' he said .
But while Esper attempted to clarify his view on using active duty troops to rein in protesters Wednesday , Milley was notably absent during the press briefing .
When asked why he was not present , a defense official told CNN it is because Milley believes it is up to the political and civilian control to explain the current situation .","Washington (CNN) Secretary of Defense Mark Esper is on shaky ground with the White House after saying Wednesday that he does not support using active duty troops to quell the large-scale protests across the United States triggered by the death of George Floyd and those forces should only be used in a law enforcement role as a last resort.

Speaking from the Pentagon briefing room podium, Esper noted that ""we are not in one of those situations now,"" distancing himself from President Donald Trump's recent threat to deploy the military to enforce order.

""The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act,"" he told reporters. Esper also distanced himself from a maligned photo-op outside St. John's Church.

Wednesday's press briefing by Esper went over poorly at the White House, where his standing was already viewed to be tenuous, multiple people familiar with the matter said.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany would not directly answer Wednesday whether Trump still has confidence in Esper, saying instead, ""as of right now Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.""

""With regard to whether the President has confidence, I would say if he loses confidence in Secretary Esper, I'm sure you all will be the first to know,"" McEnany said during Wednesday's press briefing.

""Should the President lose faith, we will all learn about that in the future,"" she added.

Late Wednesday night, three sources told CNN that Esper will stay on the job for now. He was at the White House for a little under three hours earlier, where he had several meetings, including one in the Oval Office with Trump.

A senior Republican source told CNN that there has been ongoing tension involving Esper and that Trump has no respect for his defense chief. Esper has had little influence and essentially takes his lead from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the source said, adding that this latest press conference will undoubtedly make things worse.

Trump and other top officials, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien, are ""not happy"" with Esper after his Wednesday remarks, three people familiar with the White House's thinking said.

One White House official said aides there did not get a heads up about the content of Esper's remarks, most notably Esper's decision to publicly break with the President on the use of the military to address unrest in US cities.

Esper's comments Wednesday came after defense officials told CNN this week that there was deep and growing discomfort among some in the Pentagon even before Trump announced Monday that he is ready to deploy active duty forces if local leaders fail to ramp up enforcement efforts.

As tear gas wafted through the air in Lafayette Park across from the White House, Trump announced from the Rose Garden that if state or city leaders refuse ""to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" he will invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows a president to deploy the US military to suppress civil disorder.

Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have faced a flurry of questions and criticism in the wake of Trump's comments, pressure that culminated in Esper's appearance in the Pentagon briefing room Wednesday where he attempted to distance himself from the President's rhetoric and clean up some of his own.

Asked about his use of the word ""battlespace"" when discussing quelling violence on the streets amid civil unrest, Esper attempted to explain that it was ""something we use day in and day out ... it's part of our military lexicon that I grew up with ... it's not a phrase focused on people.""

""In retrospect I would have used different wording,"" Esper said.

Esper also addressed the killing of Floyd, calling it a ""horrible crime"" and said ""racism is real in America, and we must all do our very best to recognize it, to confront it, and to eradicate it.""

""The officers on the scene that day should be held accountable for his murder. It is a tragedy that we have seen repeat itself too many times. With great sympathy, I want to extend the deepest of condolences to the family and friends of George Floyd from me and the Department. Racism is real in America, and we must all do our very best to recognize it, to confront it, and to eradicate it,"" he said.

Mattis breaks his silence

Later, Wednesday Esper's predecessor, former Defense Secretary James Mattis, launched an extraordinary attac k on Trump, calling him ""the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try.""

""We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society,"" Mattis said in a statement.

""This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children,"" he said.

Mattis had avoided attacking the President in his public remarks since resigning in December 2018, claiming he owes the Trump administration a ""duty of silence.""

Prior to his statement Wednesday, the retired four-star Marine Corps general had not mentioned Trump by name, but did implicitly criticize his former commander in chief, with whom he sharply disagreed on matters of international engagement and alliances, in a string of recent public statements and interviews.

Mattis made clear Wednesday he no longer feels bound by that same duty, issuing a scathing rebuke of the President he once served.

""Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside,"" he said.

""We must reject any thinking of our cities as a 'battlespace' that our uniformed military is called upon to 'dominate.' At home, we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors. Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict—a false conflict— between the military and civilian society,"" Mattis added. ""It erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part.""

Esper on thin ice?

Meanwhile, Wednesday's events have increased the focus on the fate of Mattis' successor.

Sentiments inside the White House toward Esper had been gradually souring before this week's episode, with both Trump and O'Brien viewing Esper as not entirely committed to the President's vision for the military.

One person suggested the White House was reluctant to fire Esper given the current crisis and the fact that there are only five months left before the election. Another person suggested Trump could leave Esper in place and push blame his way. The President has a history of letting top officials languish in positions long after he's lost confidence in them.

For months, the President and O'Brien have been losing faith in Esper's ability to lead the military and his tendency to avoid offering a full-throated defense of the President or his policies, according to multiple administration officials.

O'Brien, in particular, has spoken to the President about Esper's television remarks, which the White House has viewed on repeated occasions as problematic or off-message. On at least one occasion, O'Brien presented the President with print-outs that compare his own public remarks on a topic to those of Esper to highlight the contrast.

Trump has privately expressed frustrations with Esper in recent weeks, which aides believe would likely be accelerated by his comments about the ongoing nationwide protests. He vented about Esper at length during a recent weekend at Camp David, according to multiple sources.

Those complaints have raised questions about Esper's future at the Pentagon should Trump win a second term, but his comments from the Pentagon briefing room Wednesday have prompted speculation that the timing of his departure could be moved up, the source said.

""I think this is the end for him,"" they added.

A US official close to Esper and familiar with White House thinking said the secretary is being ""skewered"" by those inside the White House for coming out Wednesday to express his views.

""(I'm) not sure who thought that was a good idea,"" another official told CNN.

In December, Esper sat for an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier at the Ronald Reagan Defense Forum and when asked what it was like to work for Trump, he responded, ""he is just another one of many bosses I've had and you've had your time that you learn to work with.""

The remark irritated the President, who tends to expect lavish praise from his Cabinet, according to two administration officials. O'Brien, by contrast, almost never breaks with the President in his public remarks. O'Brien, who took over as national security adviser last September, is said by multiple administration officials to have expressed some level of interest in the job of either secretary of state or secretary of defense, should either of those positions become available.

On Tuesday, White House officials scratched their head at an interview Esper gave to NBC News claiming he did not know he was walking to St. John's church on Monday with the President. Officials said the plans were clear inside the West Wing and that Esper's explanations made little sense. Esper clarified on Wednesday that while he knew they were going to the church, he did not know the movement would turn into a photo opportunity.

In the hour after his press conference ended, Esper was seen arriving at the White House alongside Milley and Attorney General Bill Barr.

The trio stood together, all wearing masks, for a few moments before entering the building.

Republicans defend Esper

Outside the GOP lunch Wednesday, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said that he hopes the President will listen to Esper's perspective, telling reporters: ""I think Secretary Esper has the right to express his point of view, and the President does his, and I hope the President is willing to listen to the perspective of others and take that into account as he makes his decisions.""

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said she is ""glad"" Esper ""made his views"" on the Insurrection Act known.

The secretary of defense ""needs to be able to express his opinion, which is what he did,"" she told reporters Wednesday.

Asked whether Esper's job could be in jeopardy following his remarks, or face some backlash from the Trump, Capito said, ""I would hope not,"" adding that the he is ""expressing his opinion"" and the President has to take ""into consideration"" that he's the leader of the US armed forces.

Asked if he still has confidence in Esper as Defense Secretary, Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the House Armed Services simply answered: ""yes.""

On Tuesday, Thornberry said it would be appropriate for Esper and chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Mark Milley, to testify before the committee if the President followed through on his threat to invoke the Insurrection Act, a move that Esper made clear on Wednesday he did not believe was necessary at this time.

Saunders, Brian Mcnicoll, Aymenn Al-Tamimi, Jared Whitley","Eight years ago Army Private Bowe Bergdahl was stationed in Afghanistan . He didn ’ t like his fellow soldiers , his commanding officer , or pretty much anything about his circumstances . So he planned to change them .
Bergdahl reportedly gave away his equipment , mailed his laptop to his parents in the U.S. , and deserted his post . He was captured and held by the Taliban for five years .
The Taliban aren ’ t dummies . They knew — as did the whole world — that then-president Obama was desperate to close the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Obama didn ’ t care much about how Gitmo was emptied , just as long as it was .
So in 2014 the Taliban proposed a prisoner swap . They asked for five top Taliban leaders : Mullah Mohammad Fazl ( former Taliban deputy defense minister ) , Mullah Norullah Noori ( senior military commander ) , Abdul Haq Wasiq ( former Taliban deputy minister of intelligence ) , Khairullah Khairkhwa ( heroin trafficker and Taliban governor of Herat Province ) , and Mohammed Nabi Omari ( senior Taliban official who had served in several roles including liaison to the Haqqani terrorist network ) in exchange for lowly Private Bergdahl .
Obama accepted the deal . National Security Advisor Susan Rice — she of the infamous Benghazi lies — began lying in defense of Bergdahl and Obama ’ s deal . Rice said Bergdahl had served “ with honor and distinction. ” Then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton took credit for her part in engineering the deal .
But soon the leaks began . Bergdahl was suspected of desertion . The men in his unit said he ’ d just “ walked off ” one night . Search teams sent in an intense effort to find Bergdahl suffered injuries , such as one SEAL who was wounded so badly he had to give up his SEAL career .
Bergdahl began talking . He said that the Taliban had treated him better than Americans did . It ’ s entirely possible that he intended to desert to the Taliban , but we ’ ll never know .
To no one ’ s surprise , at least three of the released senior Taliban rejoined and went back to fighting American and NATO forces in Afghanistan .
In his court martial , Bowe Bergdahl pled guilty to desertion . The military judge , Army Col. Jeffrey Nance , last week held a week-long hearing on evidence that can affect the sentence he gives Bergdahl . And that ’ s where President Trump comes in .
The problem is what the Uniform Code of Military Justice labels “ unlawful command influence. ” In rough terms , “ unlawful command influence ” occurs whenever someone in the chain of command above the defendant attempts to influence the outcome of the court martial to the detriment of the defendant .
“ UCI ” can happen in myriad ways . A general could call the judge to say he ’ s expecting a tough result . A commander could choose the members of the court martial board on the basis of telling them that their performance reports will reflect the decision . Or someone higher up in the chain of command — which includes the president — can make a statement that says what he wants done .
In 1974 , I was a very young captain and an Air Force judge advocate . I received orders to attend the JAG School . It turned out to be two weeks of work crammed into six weeks so we had plenty of time to do other things . One was to travel to Washington , D.C. to meet the big boss , the Air Force Judge Advocate General .
But Maj. Gen. Harold R. Vague ( the best name ever for a lawyer ) wasn ’ t at all living up to his name when he told us that if we ever experienced or even suspected unlawful command influence in a military justice case we were handling , we should call him directly and he ’ d be on the next plane to solve the matter .
As the courts have said , unlawful command influence is a cancer on the military justice system . It is guarded against every day , but nevertheless it happens .
As in the case of decorated Navy Special Warfare Operator ( SEAL ) Senior Chief Keith Barry . Barry was charged with sexual assault and court martialed in 2014 . Rear Adm. Patrick Lorge , overseeing the case and not believing the evidence , had planned to overturn the conviction , which was in his power to do .
But Lorge received confusing advice from his own JAG . Far worse , Vice Adm. Nanette DeRenzi , then the Navy ’ s Judge Advocate General , told Lorge that she was under intense pressure from Congress on sexual assault cases and that a lot of her time was being taken up dealing with them .
When DeRenzi retired , she was succeeded by Vice Adm. James Crawford III . Crawford told Lorge “ not to put a target on his back , ” so naturally Lorge concluded that he had to approve Barry ’ s sentence rather than overturn it .
Barry ’ s lawyers pushed back , appealing the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces . That court appointed Air Force Col. Vance Spath — outside the Navy chain of command — to perform a special investigation . Spath found the facts cited above and returned the case to the appeals court for decision where it is still pending .
In cases where UCI is found , the defendant may have all charges dismissed or his punishment can be reduced . In Barry ’ s case , the military justice system was so perverted by unlawful command influence — up to and including two Navy judge advocate generals — the case should be dismissed in its entirety and Barry returned to duty .
During the 2015-2016 campaign , candidate Trump repeatedly said that Bergdahl was a “ traitor ” who deserved harsh punishment , maybe even being shot . In last week ’ s hearing before Judge Nance , the matter was raised again by Bergdahl ’ s lawyers .
Candidate Trump ’ s remarks during the campaign were made before he became the top of Bergdahl ’ s chain of command . They can be ignored as Nance almost certainly will do .
But in mid-October , a reporter asked President Trump about the Bergdahl case . Instead of saying “ no comment , ” as he obviously should have , Trump said that he couldn ’ t say anything more about the case . But , as he always does , especially when he shouldn ’ t , Trump went on .
Trump said , “ …but I think people heard my comments in the past , ” clearly reinforcing them .
Prosecutors told Judge Nance that the president was only answering the question and not reaffirming his campaign statements . Nance said he was having a “ hard time ” with that argument , noting that public confidence in the military justice system was something he had to consider .
Nance is precisely correct . He not only has to consider the public ’ s confidence but also the military ’ s confidence in the system . The military justice system , even more than the civilian one , depends on trust because of the one huge difference between them .
The civilian courts answer to no one other than the appellate courts and , ultimately , the Supreme Court . The military courts , like everyone else in the military , answer to their commanders . The highest-ranking commander is the Commander-in-Chief .
That ’ s why Nance took the unheard-of step of subjecting himself to questions by both the defense and prosecuting attorneys . He said he had complete confidence in his ability to render an impartial decision on Bergdahl ’ s sentence .
But Trump ’ s words hang like a dark cloud over Nance . He may choose to dismiss the case against Bergdahl . More likely , he will render a sentence that is lighter than he otherwise would have and say so . Either way , the case will go through the appellate process and probably reach the Supreme Court in a couple of years .
This isn ’ t the first time that Trump displayed his uncaring ignorance of military matters . In a December 2015 early primary debate , Trump said — twice — that we should specifically target terrorists ’ families because though terrorists may not care about their own lives , they certainly care about the lives of their families .
As I wrote at the time , intentionally targeting civilian non-combatants is a war crime . Trump either didn ’ t know that or didn ’ t care . Either is inexcusable .
There is a bond between every president and every soldier , sailor , airman , Marine and coastguardsman . It is a bond of trust that was repeatedly violated by Presidents Clinton and Obama . Now Trump has violated it .
Candidate Trump ’ s remarks about Bergdahl are of no consequence . President Trump ’ s remarks may result in a deserter going unpunished for one of the gravest crimes a soldier can commit . It ’ s long past time for him to know better , and to understand .","Eight years ago Army Private Bowe Bergdahl was stationed in Afghanistan.

There is a bond between every president and every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and coastguardsman. It is a bond of trust that was repeatedly violated by Presidents Clinton and Obama. Now Trump has violated it.

Candidate Trump’s remarks about Bergdahl are of no consequence. President Trump’s remarks may result in a deserter going unpunished for one of the gravest crimes a soldier can commit. It’s long past time for him to know better, and to understand.",www.spectator.org,right,kKl5INUQdtNu9SMT

Americans by more than 2-1 said the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani has made the United States less safe, a nationwide USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds, amid broad concerns about the potential consequences ahead.

A majority of those surveyed, by 52%-34%, called President Donald Trump's behavior with Iran ""reckless.""

Americans were divided on the wisdom of the drone strike at the Baghdad airport last week that killed Soleimani and others: 42% supported it, 33% opposed it; 25% said they didn't know what to think. Republicans were much more supportive than Democrats; independents were almost evenly split.

But there was overwhelming agreement – in each case by more than 6-1 – that the attack made it more likely Iran would strike American interests in the Middle East (69%), that there would be terrorist attacks on the American homeland (63%), and that the United States and Iran would go to war (62%).

By 52%-8%, those polled said the attack made it more likely that Iran would develop nuclear weapons.

The online survey of 1,005 adults, taken Tuesday and Wednesday, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The Iranian rocket attack on U.S. bases in Iraq took place near the end of the time the poll was in the field. The survey was completed before Trump addressed the nation Wednesday from the White House.

us_military,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/06/06/exclusive-bergdahl-declared-jihad-secret-documents-show/,"Bergdahl declared jihad in captivity, secret documents show",2014-06-06,James Rosen,"U.S. Army Sgt . Bowe Bergdahl at one point during his captivity converted to Islam , fraternized openly with his captors and declared himself a `` mujahid , '' or warrior for Islam , according to secret documents prepared on the basis of a purported eyewitness account and obtained by Fox News .
The reports indicate that Bergdahl 's relations with his Haqqani captors morphed over time , from periods of hostility , where he was treated very much like a hostage , to periods where , as one source told Fox News , `` he became much more of an accepted fellow '' than is popularly understood . He even reportedly was allowed to carry a gun at times .
The documents show that Bergdahl at one point escaped his captors for five days and was kept , upon his re-capture , in a metal cage , like an animal . In addition , the reports detail discussions of prisoner swaps and other attempts at a negotiated resolution to the case that appear to have commenced as early as the fall of 2009 .
The reports are rich in on-the-ground detail -- including the names and locations of the Haqqani commanders who ran the 200-man rotation used to guard the Idaho native -- and present the most detailed view yet of what Bergdahl 's life over the past five years has been like . These real-time dispatches were generated by the Eclipse Group , a shadowy private firm of former intelligence officers and operatives that has subcontracted with the Defense Department and prominent corporations to deliver granular intelligence on terrorist activities and other security-related topics , often from challenging environments in far-flung corners of the globe .
The group is run by Duane R. ( `` Dewey '' ) Clarridge , a former senior operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1980s best known for having been indicted for lying to Congress about his role in the tangled set of events that became known as the Iran-Contra scandal . He was pardoned by the first President Bush in December 1992 while on trial .
Clarridge counts a number of achievements in his spy career as well , including a prominent role in the establishment of a national counterrorism center at CIA , a move widely copied around the world by foreign intelligence agencies . A New York Times profile of Clarridge published in January 2011 disclosed the contractual relationship Eclipse had with the Pentagon , through subcontractors , and reported further that Clarridge 's activities had included efforts to help find Bergdahl .
Clarridge told Fox News his group enjoyed a subcontract through the assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict from November 2009 through May 31 , 2010 , and that after the contract was terminated , he invested some $ 50,000 of his own money to maintain the elaborate network of informants and handlers that had yielded such detailed accounts of Bergdahl 's status .
Clarridge further told Fox News that by the end of 2010 , he had furnished at least 13 of these detailed SITREPs , or situation reports , that his network generated about Bergdahl to Brig . Gen. Robert P. Ashley Jr. , who in April 2010 was named director of intelligence , at the J-2 level , at U.S. Central Command , or CENTCOM , headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida .
Clarridge said Eclipse SITREP # 3023 , dated Aug. 23 , 2012 -- in which a member of the Haqqani network , said to be close to Bergdahl 's captors , reported that the American prisoner had declared himself a `` mujahid '' -- was among the reports provided to Ashley .
The latter is now commanding general at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence and Fort Huachuca , where a message left with the public affairs office was not immediately returned .
The documents obtained by Fox News show that Eclipse developed and transmitted numerous status reports on the whereabouts of the errant American soldier , spanning a period from October 2009 , roughly three months after Bergdahl reportedly walked off his base in Afghanistan and fell into custody of the Haqqani network , up through August 2012 .
At one point -- in late June 2010 , after Bergdahl succeeded in one of his escape attempts -- the Haqqani commanders constructed a special metal cage for him , and confined him to it . At other points , however , Bergdahl was reported to be happily playing soccer with the Haqqani fighters , taking part in AK-47 target practice and being permitted to carry a firearm of his own , laughing frequently and proclaiming `` Salaam , '' the Arabic word for `` peace . ''
Reached by telephone , retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis , a 45-year service veteran who served as CENTCOM commander from August 2010 to August 2012 , told Fox News he may have received bits and pieces of the intelligence generated by Eclipse , but said Ashley , with whom he maintained a close working relationship , had not forwarded on to him the specific SITREPs cited by Fox News .
Mattis was also adamant that no one at CENTCOM or within the broader U.S. military or intelligence community -- despite intensive investigation of such allegations -- ever learned of anything to suggest Bergdahl had evolved into an active collaborator with the Haqqani network or the Taliban . `` We were always looking for actionable intelligence , '' Mattis said . `` It was n't just the IC [ intelligence community ] . We had tactical units that were involved in the fight . We had SIGINT . Any collaborators who were on the other side and who came over to our side . We kept an eye on this . ... There was never any evidence of collaboration . ''
Fox News reported on Monday that Bergdahl was the subject of a `` major classified file '' prepared by the U.S. intelligence community , and that many members of that community harbored concerns that Bergdahl , during his period of captivity , may have engaged in collaboration with the enemy .
Experts consulted by Fox News said that SITREP # 3023 presents a picture of an American captive who , if not an active collaborator , may have succumbed to Stockholm Syndrome -- the dynamic by which hostages can become enamored of their captors and join their cause -- or simply feigned allegiance in order to survive . The report cited a source new to Eclipse -- a member of the Haqqani network said to be close to Mullah Sangeen , the Haqqani commander charged at all points over the last five years with operational custody and control of Bergdahl -- whose trustworthiness had not been fully vetted by the group . However , the report stated , the informant `` does have plausible access to the information reported below , and claims to have seen Bergdahl personally in Shawal , '' in North Waziristan .
`` In the early stages Sgt . Bowe Bergdahl 's captivity , '' the report states , `` he was held at Palasin , Naurak , FATA [ Federally Administered Tribal Areas ] , under the control of Mullah Sangeen and under the direct supervision of Haji Mursaleem , Sangeen 's father . Conditions and locality changed after Mursaleem died [ in September 2010 ] , and Bergdahl was kept under tight guard after his attempted escape from his new place of detention in Shawal .
`` As of August 2012 , '' the report continues , `` the person with responsibility for Bergdahl 's captivity is Sangeen 's brother , who has delegated the actual guarding of Bergdahl to Abubakr Asadkhel , a Burra Khel Wazir loyal to Sangeen , and whose sub-tribe lives in Shawal . Abubakr leads approximately 200 armed men from his tribe and operates from five bases ( markaz ) in Shawal . ... Abubakr 's tribe is one of the prosperous branches of the Wazir and owns lots of trucks . Abubakr circulates his prisoner between schools in the area he controls , and his different insurgent bases . ''
Conditions for Bergdahl have greatly relaxed since the time of the escape . Bergdahl has converted to Islam and now describes himself as a mujahid . Bergdahl enjoys a modicum of freedom , and engages in target practice with the local mujahedeen , firing AK47s . Bergdahl is even allowed to carry a loaded gun on occasion . Bergdahl plays soccer with his guards and bounds around the pitch like a mad man . He appears to be well and happy , and has a noticeable habit of laughing frequently and saying 'Salaam ' repeatedly .
At other points , the SITREPs depict a much nastier relationship between Bergdahl and his captors . In July 2010 , Eclipse SITREPs based on confidential talks with Afghan Taliban commanders reported that `` the original command structure for the responsibility of holding the captured soldier remains intact . ''
Overall responsibility for the captive is in the hands of Haqqani commander Sangeen , with Bandiwan , one of his deputies , responsible for making the detailed arrangements . There are two locations where the soldier is kept : one in Degan and the other in Shawal , North Waziristan . When in Degan he is kept in the compound of Eid Wale , a local Dawr who is close to Sangeen and is a chromite dealer . The other location is at Shawal . The [ source ] confirmed that the soldier had been missing for five days and when he was recovered , he was a little worse from wear ( lack of food ; a bit slimmer ) but otherwise in good health .
But an earlier dispatch stated that after his re-capture , on or about June 22 , 2010 , Bergdahl was `` in ill-health , and has been collapsing . `` A SITREP dated one week before Bergdahl 's ill-fated escape attempt placed him in the Bazaar area of Miramshah , and noted that `` he seemed not to be tightly controlled . ''
The Eclipse reports suggest that negotiations over Bergdahl 's fate began within a few months after his capture . An October 2009 SITREP disclosed that Sirajuddin Haqqani , the Pashtun warlord controlling the broader network that bears his name , had reached out through Pakistani political contacts to propose a prisoner swap . A July 2010 SITREP stated that two months prior , in late May , `` negotiations between the Haqqani and representatives of the missing US soldier collapsed . '' At that point , the report said , Bergdahl was moved to a more secure location .
The New York Times , in its 2011 profile of Clarridge , described his agents ' dispatches as `` an amalgam of fact , rumor , analysis and uncorroborated reports . '' The fabled ex-spook made the more than one dozen SITREPs that Eclipse prepared on the Bergdahl case -- all previously unpublished -- available to Fox News because he wanted to demonstrate , as he put it : `` We know what we 're talking about .

A deserter with blood on his heels will walk free , leaving dead and maimed Americans in his wake , because of a bully ’ s pulpit and a weak man ’ s bench and gavel . The miscarriage results from a president who tweets too much and a judge who discerns too little .
Candidate Trump tweeted some harsh things about the consequences he believed deserter Bowe Bergdahl should face . Among other things , Trump called Bergdahl a “ dirty rotten traitor ” and a “ no good traitor who should have been executed . ”
Commentators expressed concern at the time about inappropriate command influence prejudicing military proceedings . Military commanders are not supposed to twist subordinate arms about military justice , not even the Commander in Chief . But , candidates are not commanders . Yet .
Still , based on Trump ’ s angry blasts , Bergdahl ’ s lawyers sought a pardon or commutation from President Obama . They also sought a dismissal or other leniency from authorities presiding over the court martial . They were turned away in both instances . The presiding judge announced that he had not been influenced by Trump ’ s public outbursts . In any event , Trump had no command authority when he tweeted . The case continued .
After Bergdahl pled guilty , however , reporters challenged Trump about his pre-election tweets , asking if he had fatally tainted the prosecution . As National Review ’ s Legal Analyst and former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy points out , the only reasonable response for the seated Commander in Chief to offer is “ No comment. ” Trump needlessly volunteered to the effect : “ People heard what I said . ”
Commentators again tutted that Trump was renewing his previous efforts at interference by publicly endorsing his prior thinking . But this time , he did it as president and Commander in Chief . Therefore , he put unlawful pressure on the military and its court martial system . The New York Times reported that the JAG Corps judge was willing to take the bait :
“ I will consider the president ’ s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence , ” the judge , Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army , said during a hearing at Fort Bragg . ' ”
Today Col. Nance sentenced Bergdahl to a minor fine and a dishonorable discharge . The ruling allows the man who wrote anti-American screeds , who left his post and cost valiant Americans ’ their lives and health to walk free on America ’ s streets . No word yet on his possible book and movie deals .
Nance ’ s statement is an illogical disgrace and Bergdahl ’ s sentence is a travesty .

A deserter with blood on his heels will walk free, leaving dead and maimed Americans in his wake, because of a bully’s pulpit and a weak man’s bench and gavel. The miscarriage results from a president who tweets too much and a judge who discerns too little.

Candidate Trump tweeted some harsh things about the consequences he believed deserter Bowe Bergdahl should face. Among other things, Trump called Bergdahl a “dirty rotten traitor” and a “no good traitor who should have been executed.”



Commentators expressed concern at the time about inappropriate command influence prejudicing military proceedings. Military commanders are not supposed to twist subordinate arms about military justice, not even the Commander in Chief. But, candidates are not commanders. Yet.



Still, based on Trump’s angry blasts, Bergdahl’s lawyers sought a pardon or commutation from President Obama. They also sought a dismissal or other leniency from authorities presiding over the court martial. They were turned away in both instances. The presiding judge announced that he had not been influenced by Trump’s public outbursts. In any event, Trump had no command authority when he tweeted. The case continued.



After Bergdahl pled guilty, however, reporters challenged Trump about his pre-election tweets, asking if he had fatally tainted the prosecution. As National Review’s Legal Analyst and former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy points out, the only reasonable response for the seated Commander in Chief to offer is “No comment.” Trump needlessly volunteered to the effect: “People heard what I said.”

Commentators again tutted that Trump was renewing his previous efforts at interference by publicly endorsing his prior thinking. But this time, he did it as president and Commander in Chief. Therefore, he put unlawful pressure on the military and its court martial system. The New York Times reported that the JAG Corps judge was willing to take the bait:

“I will consider the president’s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence,” the judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, said during a hearing at Fort Bragg.'”

Today Col. Nance sentenced Bergdahl to a minor fine and a dishonorable discharge. The ruling allows the man who wrote anti-American screeds, who left his post and cost valiant Americans’ their lives and health to walk free on America’s streets. No word yet on his possible book and movie deals.



Nance’s statement is an illogical disgrace and Bergdahl’s sentence is a travesty.

Nothing in law or logic makes the president's intemperate outbursts or his subsequent mention of them “mitigation” for the crimes of Bergdahl. They are external noise that should have no bearing on the proceeding or Nance’s judgment. They provide no information to suggest Berdahl’s betrayal is less treacherous to his nation or less dangerous for his comrades. They do not shed light on Bergdahl’s mental or physical health, or provide any basis to excuse his actions.



The president’s ill-advised words don’t mitigate in favor of Berdahl. They weigh against continuing the case. They run the risk of tainting the prosecution by undue influence. The case then, should either be deemed compromised and dismissed, or the statements excluded and ignored, and justice administered by the book. They provide no factual, legal, or moral justification to alter a just sentence in Bergdahl’s favor.



This is especially true in a case where the relevant decision maker is a judge and not a jury. Federal rules of evidence allow the exclusion of evidence that may be more prejudicial than relevant or probative. But the concern is primarily about improperly influencing lay jurors. Col. Nance is not an impressionable member of a jury who needs to be protected from sensational headlines. He is a sworn and trained officer and jurist. His appropriate comment should have been: ""I will disregard the president's irrelevant and inadmissible commentary. ""



He should not have said, and then acted, on the suggestion that he would actually use the president’s comments as a thumb on the scale to benefit the defendant.

Nance might have meant his ruling as a defiant middle finger aimed at President Trump (which, itself would indicate he was not influenced by unlawful pressure). But, the ruling did not produce a gesture at the president. It was much bigger. It fully, offensively spoke to the men and women who serve and sacrifice, their families, and millions of informed Americans who bear witness.

May God please comfort the families and rest the souls of the men who died searching to find and rescue the deserter.

The Army should use photos of “average-looking women” when it needs to illustrate stories about female soldiers, a specialist recommends — images of women who are too pretty undermine the communications strategy about introducing them into combat roles.

That’s the gist of an internal Army e-mail an Army source shared with POLITICO.

“In general, ugly women are perceived as competent while pretty women are perceived as having used their looks to get ahead,” wrote Col. Lynette Arnhart, who is leading a team of analysts studying how best to integrate women into combat roles that have previously been closed off to them. She sent her message to give guidance to Army spokesmen and spokeswomen about how they should tell the press and public about the Army’s integration of women.

“There is a general tendency to select nice looking women when we select a photo to go with an article (where the article does not reference a specific person). It might behoove us to select more average looking women for our comms strategy. For example, the attached article shows a pretty woman, wearing make-up while on deployed duty. Such photos undermine the rest of the message (and may even make people ask if breaking a nail is considered hazardous duty),” Arnhart said.

She wrote that a photo of a female soldier with mud on her face that news agencies used last spring “sends a much different message—one of women willing to do the dirty work necessary in order to get the job done.”

( WATCH: Women rule the workforce? Check the numbers)

Arnhart’s note was originally sent to two people, including Col. Christian Kubik, chief of public affairs for the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command. He forwarded the email to all public affairs officers supporting TRADOC with the note: “A valuable reminder from the TRADOC experts who are studying gender integration — when [public affairs officers] choose photos that glamorize women (such as in the attached article), we undermine our own efforts. Please use ‘real’ photos that are typical, not exceptional.”

In a statement, Army spokesman George Wright said the comments “were an internal email conversation” and “not an Army position.”

After POLITICO first reported on the e-mail in Tuesday’s Morning Defense, critics seized upon Arnhart’s guidance as proof that today’s Army culture has a long way to go before women will be treated as equals.

Martha McSally says she was 'preyed upon and then raped' in Air Force by superior officer,,Gregg Re,"Sen. Martha McSally , the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat , disclosed during an emotional Senate hearing on Wednesday she was `` preyed upon and then raped '' in the Air Force by a superior officer .
The Arizona Republican , who served 26 years in the Air Force , made the disclosure during a Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations in the military . McSally said she did n't report the assault because she did n't trust the system , and was ashamed and confused .
“ My drive to fight against sexual assault in the ranks is not from the outside looking in , '' McSally began . `` And it is deeply personal . ''
McSally said that during her military career , she was `` greatly privileged to prepare and then lead my amazing Airmen in combat , which is the apex responsibility of any warrior leader . ''
But , McSally added that she had also `` witnessed so many weaknesses in the processes involving sexual assault prevention , investigation , and adjudication , '' which motivated her `` to make recommendations to Air Force leaders , shaped my approach as a commander , and informed my advocacy for change while I remained in the military and since I have been in Congress . ''
Then McSally revealed her own experience with abuse -- as she said she would use her `` voice and unique experience to work on this mission to stop military sexual assault for good . ''
`` I am so inspired by the many survivors who found the strength to share their stories , report their assaults , and demand accountability , justice , and change , '' McSally said . `` It is because of you that a light has been shined on this silent epidemic and so many improvements have been made—including more than 100 legislative actions over the last decade—on all aspects of military sexual assault . ''
`` So , like you , I also am a military sexual assault survivor , but unlike so many brave survivors , I didn ’ t report being sexually assaulted , '' she continued . `` Like so many women and men , I didn ’ t trust the system at the time . I blamed myself . I was ashamed and confused . I thought I was strong but felt powerless . The perpetrators abused their position of power in profound ways . In one case I was preyed upon and raped by a superior officer . ''
McSally did not name the officer , but said she shares in the disgust of the failures of the military system and many commanders to address sexual violence . She said that 's why the public must demand that higher-ranking officials be part of the solution .
`` Like many victims , I felt like the system was raping me all over again . '' — Arizona GOP Sen. Martha McSally
`` I stayed silent for many years , but later in my career , as the military grappled with the scandals , and their wholly inadequate responses , I felt the need to let some people know I too was a survivor , '' she said , choking up as she detailed what had happened to her . `` I was horrified at how my attempt to share generally my experiences was handled . I almost separated from the Air Force at 18 years of service over my despair . Like many victims , I felt like the system was raping me all over again . ''
But , McSally said , `` I didn ’ t quit . I decided to stay and continue to serve and fight and lead . To be a voice from within the ranks for women -- and then in the House and now the Senate . ''
An Air Force spokesperson apologized to McSally on Wednesday , calling the alleged rape `` appalling . ''
“ The criminal actions reported today by Senator McSally violate every part of what it means to be an Airman , '' Air Force Capt . Carrie J. Volpe said in a statement . `` We are appalled and deeply sorry for what Senator McSally experienced and we stand behind her and all victims of sexual assault . We are steadfast in our commitment to eliminate this reprehensible behavior and breach of trust in our ranks . ”
The revelation came just weeks after Sen. Joni Ernst , R-Iowa , came forward in January with her story of being raped by a former boyfriend , saying she decided to do so after details of her divorce were made public .
McSally 's disclosure also comes at a time of increased awareness over the problem of harassment and assault in the armed forces . Reports of sexual assaults across the military jumped nearly 10 percent in 2017 — a year that also saw an online nude-photo sharing scandal rock the Defense Department .
McSally was defeated by Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the 2018 Senate election by 2 percentage points . Interim Sen. Jon Kyl then announced he would resign as Arizona 's other senator , and Republican Gov . Doug Ducey chose McSally to replace Kyl .","Sen.

""I stayed silent for many years, but later in my career, as the military grappled with the scandals, and their wholly inadequate responses, I felt the need to let some people know I too was a survivor,"" she said, choking up as she detailed what had happened to her. ""I was horrified at how my attempt to share generally my experiences was handled. I almost separated from the Air Force at 18 years of service over my despair. Like many victims, I felt like the system was raping me all over again.""

But, McSally said, ""I didn’t quit. I decided to stay and continue to serve and fight and lead. To be a voice from within the ranks for women -- and then in the House and now the Senate.""

An Air Force spokesperson apologized to McSally on Wednesday, calling the alleged rape ""appalling.""

“The criminal actions reported today by Senator McSally violate every part of what it means to be an Airman,""Air Force Capt. Carrie J. Volpe said in a statement. ""We are appalled and deeply sorry for what Senator McSally experienced and we stand behind her and all victims of sexual assault. We are steadfast in our commitment to eliminate this reprehensible behavior and breach of trust in our ranks.”

The revelation came just weeks after Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, came forward in January with her story of being raped by a former boyfriend, saying she decided to do so after details of her divorce were made public.

McSally's disclosure also comes at a time of increased awareness over the problem of harassment and assault in the armed forces. Reports of sexual assaults across the military jumped nearly 10 percent in 2017 — a year that also saw an online nude-photo sharing scandal rock the Defense Department.

McSally was defeated by Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the 2018 Senate election by 2 percentage points. Interim Sen. Jon Kyl then announced he would resign as Arizona's other senator, and Republican Gov. Doug Ducey chose McSally to replace Kyl.

The SDNY prosecutors are a clever lot . In a two-count complaint , they theorize ( in Count Two ) that Saipov caused eight deaths in the course of damaging an automobile in interstate commerce . But the criminal statute invoked ( section 33 ( a ) of the U.S. penal code ) is really addressed at incidentally endangering human beings while doing violence to a car , not incidentally endangering the car while doing violence to human beings .

ISIS clearly qualifies as such an enterprise under federal law ( under section 1961 , it is a group of individuals associated in fact — even though not a legal entity — and it engages in acts of murder , among other depravities ) . Further , even if Saipov was not a member of ISIS before his killing spree , he was patently seeking entry into the network . . . and he succeeded in getting it . ISIS branded him “ one of the caliphate soldiers ” in its claim of responsibility .
All that said , this is not an easy prosecution — certainly not as easy as the blatant brutality of Saipov ’ s attack would make it appear . I am quite confident that whichever judge is assigned to the case will deny the inevitable motions to dismiss death counts . When we step back , a foolish outburst , even from the White House , is trivial juxtaposed to Saipov ’ s barbarity .

us_military,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/politics/uss-roosevelt-investigation/index.html,"In major reversal, Navy opts to uphold firing of aircraft carrier captain who warned about coronavirus outbreak",2020-06-19,"Zachary Cohen, Ryan Browne, Barbara Starr","Washington ( CNN ) In a major reversal , the US Navy has decided to fire the captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier who warned about the spread of the coronavirus pandemic aboard his ship , a decision that comes after the findings of a preliminary investigation recommended he be reinstated , the service 's two most senior officials announced Friday .
The results of the latest Navy probe faulted Capt . Brett Crozier for several missteps , including not adhering to proper protocols to prevent the pandemic 's spread on the ship , such as social distancing , and being too slow in evacuating sailors from the ship once it arrived in port in Guam , they said .
`` I will not reassign Captain Brett Crozier as the commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt , nor will he be eligible for future command . Captain Crozier will be reassigned , '' Adm. Michael Gilday , the Chief of Naval Operations told reporters during a Pentagon briefing , which took place shortly after news of the decision broke .
`` While I previously believed Captain Crozier should be reinstated , following his relief in April , after conducting an initial investigation , the much broader , deeper investigation that we conducted in the weeks following that had a much deeper scope , '' he said , speaking alongside Navy Secretary Kenneth Braithwaite .
The stunning development is yet another twist in a months-long controversy over Crozier 's dismissal and comes after Navy officials confidently recommended he be reinstated as the ship 's commander back in April following an initial probe .
Both Gilday and Braithwaite said the Navy failed to investigate the matter properly during its preliminary review .
Defense Secretary Mark Esper was briefed on the findings Friday and `` believes the investigation to have been thorough and fair and supports the Navy 's decisions based on their findings , '' Chief Pentagon Spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement .
Rep. Mac Thornberry , the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , said in a statement that Navy officials were ultimately right to conduct a deeper investigation into the matter .
`` The Navy was right to conduct a thorough investigation into the spread of COVID-19 on the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the actions Navy leaders took to keep Sailors safe . It is clear that there are lessons to be learned and improvements that must be made , '' he wrote .
`` When this incident first emerged , I declined to comment on the status of Captain Crozier . I do not believe it is appropriate for Members of Congress , who are outside the chain of command , to comment on individual personnel actions . Doing so is too often unfair to the individual service members involved and their leadership . I continue to hold that view , '' the Texas Republican added .
The deeper investigation concluded that Crozier and the Strike Group Commander , Rear Adm. Stuart Baker , `` did not do enough , soon enough to fulfill their primary obligation ... and they did not effectively carry out our guidelines for events spread of the virus , '' according to Gilday .
`` Both Admiral Baker and Captain Crozier fell well short of what we expect of those in command . Had I known then what I know today , I would have not made that recommendation to reinstate Captain Crozier . Moreover , if Captain Crozier were still in command today , I would be relieving him , '' he said .
Though Crozier has been relieved of command of the ship , he is expected to remain in the Navy .
Baker will also be held accountable for poor decision-making and his promotion is being put on hold , the Navy said in a statement .
`` They were slow , eggressing sailors off the ship . And they failed to move sailors to available safer environments quickly , '' Gilday said . `` When obstacles arose , both failed to tackle the problem head on and to take charge . And in a number of instances they placed crew comfort in front of crew safety . ''
`` Additionally , Captain Crozier exercised questionable judgment When he released sailors from quarantine on the ship , which put his crew at higher risk , and may have increased the spread of the virus of aboard the Theodore Roosevelt , '' he added .
Crozier was initially fired in April for what the acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly , who subsequently resigned , said was poor judgment for too widely disseminating a warning about the spread of virus aboard his vessel , a warning that eventually made its way into the press .
Several defense officials told CNN that the Navy initially recommended that Crozier be restored to command of the carrier following a preliminary inquiry later that month .
Officials told CNN that the Navy was so confident that the Pentagon leadership would endorse its recommendation to reinstate Crozier that it was forced to scuttle a planned press conference to announce the results after Defense Secretary Mark Esper did not immediately endorse the findings , helping to convince then acting Navy Secretary James E. McPherson to launch a broader inquiry .
The fallout from the outbreak aboard the Roosevelt , which spread to more than 1,000 crew members before the Navy ceased publishing data on the number of infected sailors , sparked a major controversy within the Navy , leading to Modly 's resignation .
Crozier 's memo which set off the chain of the events warned Navy leadership that decisive action was needed to save the lives of the ship 's crew . `` We are not at war . Sailors do not need to die . If we do not act now , we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our Sailors , '' it read , three US defense officials confirmed to CNN .
Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident , actions which included a $ 240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving Crozier a rousing send off in public remarks to the crew .
`` I believe if there is ever a time to ask for help it is now regardless of the impact on my career , '' Crozier wrote in his email , the contents of which a US official directly familiar with the message confirmed to CNN .
The email was addressed to Crozier 's immediate superior Baker and several other senior Navy officials in the region .
The investigation did not fault Crozier for sending the email and attached memo but faulted him for not having all the facts in hand , leaving off people that needed to see it , and not warning Baker in advance that he was sending It .
Gilday reiterated Friday that Crozier was not relieved because of the email or the subsequent leak but he made clear they were what sparked the controversy .
`` The determination that I just mentioned about his not being reinstated to command , and the action holding the strike group commander 's promotion in advance , that 's not about the email that he sent , and it 's certainly not about the fact that it leaked , '' he said .
`` Captain Crozier hit send once in that email . Captain Crozier did not leak that email or intend for it to be leaked . So at that time , I felt that the facts did not justify relief based on the narrow scope , '' Gilday added .
In his memo , Crozier implored Navy leaders to take immediate steps to address the situation .

Video of Crozier receiving raucous applause from his crew while departing the aircraft carrier following his initial ouster went viral on the internet and several lawmakers had called for him to be reinstated .","Washington (CNN) In a major reversal, the US Navy has decided to fire the captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier who warned about the spread of the coronavirus pandemic aboard his ship, a decision that comes after the findings of a preliminary investigation recommended he be reinstated, the service's two most senior officials announced Friday.

The results of the latest Navy probe faulted Capt. Brett Crozier for several missteps, including not adhering to proper protocols to prevent the pandemic's spread on the ship, such as social distancing, and being too slow in evacuating sailors from the ship once it arrived in port in Guam, they said.

""I will not reassign Captain Brett Crozier as the commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, nor will he be eligible for future command. Captain Crozier will be reassigned,"" Adm. Michael Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations told reporters during a Pentagon briefing, which took place shortly after news of the decision broke.

""While I previously believed Captain Crozier should be reinstated, following his relief in April, after conducting an initial investigation, the much broader, deeper investigation that we conducted in the weeks following that had a much deeper scope,"" he said, speaking alongside Navy Secretary Kenneth Braithwaite.

The stunning development is yet another twist in a months-long controversy over Crozier's dismissal and comes after Navy officials confidently recommended he be reinstated as the ship's commander back in April following an initial probe.

Both Gilday and Braithwaite said the Navy failed to investigate the matter properly during its preliminary review.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper was briefed on the findings Friday and ""believes the investigation to have been thorough and fair and supports the Navy's decisions based on their findings,"" Chief Pentagon Spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.

What the investigation found

Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that Navy officials were ultimately right to conduct a deeper investigation into the matter.

""The Navy was right to conduct a thorough investigation into the spread of COVID-19 on the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the actions Navy leaders took to keep Sailors safe. It is clear that there are lessons to be learned and improvements that must be made,"" he wrote.

""When this incident first emerged, I declined to comment on the status of Captain Crozier. I do not believe it is appropriate for Members of Congress, who are outside the chain of command, to comment on individual personnel actions. Doing so is too often unfair to the individual service members involved and their leadership. I continue to hold that view,"" the Texas Republican added.

The deeper investigation concluded that Crozier and the Strike Group Commander, Rear Adm. Stuart Baker, ""did not do enough, soon enough to fulfill their primary obligation ... and they did not effectively carry out our guidelines for events spread of the virus,"" according to Gilday.

""Both Admiral Baker and Captain Crozier fell well short of what we expect of those in command. Had I known then what I know today, I would have not made that recommendation to reinstate Captain Crozier. Moreover, if Captain Crozier were still in command today, I would be relieving him,"" he said.

Though Crozier has been relieved of command of the ship, he is expected to remain in the Navy.

Baker will also be held accountable for poor decision-making and his promotion is being put on hold, the Navy said in a statement.

""They were slow, eggressing sailors off the ship. And they failed to move sailors to available safer environments quickly,"" Gilday said. ""When obstacles arose, both failed to tackle the problem head on and to take charge. And in a number of instances they placed crew comfort in front of crew safety.""

""Additionally, Captain Crozier exercised questionable judgment When he released sailors from quarantine on the ship, which put his crew at higher risk, and may have increased the spread of the virus of aboard the Theodore Roosevelt,"" he added.

Inside the Navy's reversal

Crozier was initially fired in April for what the acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly, who subsequently resigned, said was poor judgment for too widely disseminating a warning about the spread of virus aboard his vessel, a warning that eventually made its way into the press.

Several defense officials told CNN that the Navy initially recommended that Crozier be restored to command of the carrier following a preliminary inquiry later that month.

Officials told CNN that the Navy was so confident that the Pentagon leadership would endorse its recommendation to reinstate Crozier that it was forced to scuttle a planned press conference to announce the results after Defense Secretary Mark Esper did not immediately endorse the findings, helping to convince then acting Navy Secretary James E. McPherson to launch a broader inquiry.

The fallout from the outbreak aboard the Roosevelt, which spread to more than 1,000 crew members before the Navy ceased publishing data on the number of infected sailors, sparked a major controversy within the Navy, leading to Modly's resignation.

Crozier's memo which set off the chain of the events warned Navy leadership that decisive action was needed to save the lives of the ship's crew. ""We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our Sailors,"" it read, three US defense officials confirmed to CNN.

Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident, actions which included a $240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving Crozier a rousing send off in public remarks to the crew.

""I believe if there is ever a time to ask for help it is now regardless of the impact on my career,"" Crozier wrote in his email, the contents of which a US official directly familiar with the message confirmed to CNN.

The email was addressed to Crozier's immediate superior Baker and several other senior Navy officials in the region.

The investigation did not fault Crozier for sending the email and attached memo but faulted him for not having all the facts in hand, leaving off people that needed to see it, and not warning Baker in advance that he was sending It.

Gilday reiterated Friday that Crozier was not relieved because of the email or the subsequent leak but he made clear they were what sparked the controversy.

""The determination that I just mentioned about his not being reinstated to command, and the action holding the strike group commander's promotion in advance, that's not about the email that he sent, and it's certainly not about the fact that it leaked,"" he said.

""Captain Crozier hit send once in that email. Captain Crozier did not leak that email or intend for it to be leaked. So at that time, I felt that the facts did not justify relief based on the narrow scope,"" Gilday added.

In his memo, Crozier implored Navy leaders to take immediate steps to address the situation.

""Decisive action is required. Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure,"" his memo said.

""This is a necessary risk. It will enable the carrier and air wing to get back underway as quickly as possible while ensuring the health and safety of our Sailors. Keeping over 4,000 young men and women on board the TR is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those Sailors entrusted to our care,"" Crozier added.

Bergdahl has been the target of criticism from some who served with him in Afghanistan, who argue that he is guilty of desertion because he allegedly walked off his base unarmed in 2009 after expressing concerns about the U.S. mission against the Taliban. Obama acknowledged that there are questions surrounding the circumstances that led to Bergdahl’s capture, but said that officials’ immediate focus is on helping the soldier recover from the stresses of his captivity.

Obama also responded Tuesday to claims that his agreeing to the release of five members of the Taliban who had been detained for years at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba poses a threat to U.S. national security .

Their release “was conditioned on the Qataris keeping eyes on them and creating a structure in which we can monitor their activities.

Absolutely. that’s been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo. There is a certain recidivism rate that takes place.”

But, he added, “I wouldn’t be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security and we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if in fact they are engaging in activities that threaten our defenses.”

In the video , the narrator also gives his opinion about an issue that 's become a focal point since Bergdahl 's release : the soldier 's health .
`` They first asked us about the health condition of the captive and told us to tell them the truth if he was not well , but we saw him , that he was fine , and we told them that , '' the narrator says .
Since announcing Bergdahl 's release over the weekend , Obama administration officials have repeatedly said they fast-tracked the operation over concerns about his health and safety , which appeared to be in jeopardy .
Recent intelligence , in addition to two proof-of-life videos of Bergdahl released in recent months , led to growing concern about his health and safety , a senior defense official said Wednesday .
Chris Voss , the FBI 's former lead international hostage negotiator , said that might have been exactly what Bergdahl 's captors wanted .
`` You expect the hostage-takers to make it look like the hostage is in bad shape so that they can drive a better bargain , and clearly it looks to me that 's what they did here , '' he told CNN 's `` The Lead with Jake Tapper '' on Wednesday .
National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Bergdahl served with honor and distinction . But there 's a growing chorus of criticism from some who served with him , describing him as a deserter
`` I believe that he totally deserted not only his fellow soldiers , but his leadership that wanted the best for him and for our country , '' said former Army Staff Sgt . Justin Gerleve , who was Bergdahl 's squad leader
Some soldiers involved in operations to find Bergdahl have said at least six soldiers were killed searching for him . Asked about this point , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find Bergdahl .
Gerleve told `` The Lead '' that he believes Bergdahl is at least partly to blame for the soldiers ' deaths .
`` I ca n't really say I blame Bergdahl to fullest extent , but if he would n't have deserted us , these soldiers very well could have been in a different place at a different time , '' he said .
An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl 's 2009 disappearance concluded that he left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report . The official spoke to CNN on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information .
There was no definitive finding Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials could n't do without talking to the soldier .
On Wednesday , a U.S. official said that commanders referred to Bergdahl as a `` good soldier '' in that initial fact-finding report , and that fellow soldiers said he 'd left the post on other occasions .
The official , who has been briefed on the investigation , said the report said that Bergdahl had mailed his computer and other items home before his disappearance , but his motivation was unclear .
Hagel said Wednesday that it 's `` unfair '' to Bergdahl and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base . He reiterated that the Army will conduct a review of the case .
Hagel spoke with Bergdahl 's family via telephone Wednesday , a senior Defense official told reporters . The defense secretary reassured them that Bergdahl would continue getting support with regard to his medical care and reintegration , and that the department was focused on their son 's health , the official said .
Bergdahl will remain at a U.S. Army medical center in Germany until he completes treatment , a U.S. defense official there told CNN . After that , Bergdahl will return to the United States and go to a San Antonio military base , the official said .
As the debate over Bergdahl showed no sign of slowing Wednesday , his hometown of Hailey , Idaho , canceled a `` Bowe is Back '' event planned to celebrate his return `` in the interest of public safety . '' Organizers , the city said , expected a large number of supporters and protesters to increase attendance .
`` Hailey , a town of 8,000 , does not have the infrastructure to support an event of the size this could become , '' the city said .
Bergdahl 's captors handed him over to the United States in exchange for the release of five prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .

A video shows the minutes before Bergdahl is swooped away by a Black Hawk chopper

Taliban members shake hands with men from the Black Hawk

Bergdahl's hometown cancels an event planned to celebrate his return

Dressed in all white with a striped shawl across his shoulders, the gaunt American looks up at the Black Hawk chopper circling overhead.

Armed Taliban men stand around him, one with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher ready.

When the chopper lands, the American is led there by two men, one carrying a white flag. He is given a pat-down, loaded on to the helicopter and whisked away.

A new video released by the Taliban showed the final moments of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl 's five years in captivity, just before he was handed over to the United States.

As debate over the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's release showed no signs of slowing Wednesday, the video revealed intriguing clues about Bergdahl, his Taliban captors and his American rescuers.

The narration on the video says the transfer took place in Khost province, in eastern Afghanistan.

""We had a number of tribal elders with us ... in order to build trust between us and the other side,"" a voice in the video says.

Surrounded by Mujahideen

At one point in the video, Taliban members start chanting, ""Long live Mujahideen of Afghanistan, long live Mullah Omar, the leader of Taliban.""

Mujahideen refers to those who carry out jihad.

The narrator's voice said armed fighters were stationed throughout the transfer area.

""We waited in the area for around 10 minutes before the helicopters arrived, and there were 18 Mujahideen fighters with me in the area,"" the narrator said.

Indeed, the video showed armed men perched high and low on nearby hillsides.

""Our arrangement was that once the helicopters are on the ground, three people from the other side would get off the helicopter and three from our side, including the captive, would move toward the helicopter to hand him over.""

The video has few words in English, other than this message superimposed over Bergdahl:

Photos: Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bergdahl Photos: Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bergdahl Five detainees at Guantanamo Bay were transferred to Qatar in exchange for the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was being held by the Taliban. Two senior administration officials confirmed the names of the released detainees, whose photos were obtained by WikiLeaks. Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, seen here, was an early member of the Taliban in 1994 and was interior minister during the Taliban's rule. He was arrested in Pakistan and was transferred to Guantanamo in May 2002. During questioning, Khairkhwa denied all knowledge of extremist activities. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bergdahl Mullah Mohammad Fazl commanded the main force fighting the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in 2001, and served as chief of army staff under the Taliban regime. Fazl was detained after surrendering to Abdul Rashid Dostam, the leader of Afghanistan's Uzbek community, in November 2001. He was transferred into U.S. custody in December 2001 and was one of the first arrivals at Guantanamo, where he was assessed as having high intelligence value.

The Navy SEAL who says he shot and killed Osama bin Laden says he is worried the Pentagon might prosecute him for publicly telling his story of the May 2011 raid on the al Qaeda leader 's compound in Pakistan .

In his most extensive live television interview to date , O'Neill said he realized the power of his story while speaking with a group that included about 20 families of victims of the September 11 attacks . He said it was the first time he 'd really spoken about the mission , and that men and women cried and told him `` it was closure for them . ''
At that moment , he said , he realized the importance of sharing what he could -- and that he needed to find a way to do so `` with respect for the tactics , for the safety of our troops and for the Department of Defense . ''
Responding to criticisms from former administration officials and current servicemembers that he should n't be talking publicly , O'Neill said , `` I think it 's important historically for this to get out there . ''

He said he called his family members beforehand -- not offering details on what he was doing , but knowing that they 'd soon find out no matter how the mission ended .

From the get-go , Chris Kyle 's military career is all about responding to terrorism . Kyle joins up after al-Qaeda bombs the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 . We see him and his wife Taya 's stunned reactions to 9/11 .
And then , bam . Kyle 's at war in Iraq . The film does not contain , as best I can tell , a single reference to George W. Bush , Saddam Hussein , or weapons of mass destruction . There 's no Dick Cheney , no Colin Powell at the UN , no anti-war protests . The film implies that the Iraq War was a deliberate response to 9/11 .
In fact , the Bush administration premised its 2003 Iraq invasion primarily on the alleged threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction . As National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice memorably put it , `` we do n't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud . '' The Bush administration repeatedly asserted that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was actively developing nuclear weapons and other programs it might use against the United States . Bush and some his top advisers had come into office , before 9/11 even occurred , believing that Saddam was a threat and discussing possible ways to remove him .
The war , in other words , was not actually about 9/11 . And , crucially , the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction that were the basis of the war turned out not to exist .
It 's not just that American Sniper weirdly excises all of this history ; it 's that the film replaces it with the implication that 9/11 gave America little choice but to invade Iraq , that the 2003 US invasion was something that happened to us , not something we chose to do . Chris Kyle repeatedly explains that he 's fighting to protect his family , again suggesting that the invasion was a necessary preemptive defense against Iraqi terrorists , when no such threat actually existed .
This implication was n't necessary for the film to work : watching Kyle and his wife react in horror to 9/11 did n't add anything to our understanding of his character . All the scene does is recast the Iraq war in a false , noble light .
American Sniper presents the war as a response to al-Qaeda . In fact , the opposite is true .
In the film 's narrative , the Iraq war begins with Kyle 's first mission against al-Qaeda in Iraq . Over the course of four tours , Kyle fights a number of vicious AQI operatives , including a Syrian sniper named Mustafa that serves as Kyle 's foil , as well as another guy nicknamed The Butcher .
Viewers are left with the impression that the Iraq war was against al-Qaeda at the outset , and that the fighting was chiefly against them . You could be forgiven for thinking that America invaded Iraq because it had become a hotbed of al-Qaeda operations .
In fact , Iraq did become a hotbed of al-Qaeda operations , but it was not until after the invasion , and indeed the invasion and bungled American occupation were what allowed them such fertile ground .
Al-Qaeda in Iraq did not exist at the war 's outset . Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , who would later form the group , entered Iraq specifically because he hoped the US invasion would provide the chaos and anger he needed to succeed , and he was right . The group only established its large foothold after many Iraqis had turned against the American occupation , which alienated Iraqis with its mismanagement of the country , and with terrible mistakes such as disbanding the Iraqi army , which left many thousands of military-trained Iraqis unemployed and angry .
The real story of Iraq 's insurgency is not just one of monstrous al-Qaeda , and it 's not just of a fight between good and evil .
American Sniper can be forgiven for not wanting to explore the sordid history of al-Qaeda 's rise . Less forgivable , though , is that it portrays the American invasion as a righteous blow against the evil of al-Qaeda , when in fact that invasion was one of the best things that ever happened to al-Qaeda . The film does n't just skip this history , but actively distorts it .
The narrative sets up the war as a morality play : there are evil terrorists , and Chris Kyle needs to kill them . It 's as simple as that .
In an early speech that basically defines the film 's politics , Chris Kyle 's father declares that there are three kind of people : sheep , the wolves that prey on them , and the sheep dogs that hold them at bay . `` We 're not raising any sheep in this family , '' Kyle 's father tells his son , `` and I 'll whup your ass if you ever become a wolf . ''
That means Kyle is a sheepdog . Kyle and his buddies in uniform are good guys hunting terrorists . It 's hardly a surprise , then , that all of the violence in Iraq is attributed to simple evil , and that Iraq 's millions of citizens are often barely distinguishable from al-Qaeda .
Kyle repeatedly refers to Iraqis as `` savages , '' and the film makes no effort to prove him wrong . Two out of three Iraqi children the film focuses on pick up weapons ( though one puts it down before firing ) , and the third tortured by another Iraqi . When another soldier questions whether Kyle may have shot an innocent man , Kyle simply shouts him down . The issue never comes up again .
In fact , many thousands of Iraqis died fighting al-Qaeda , and the group 's defeat never would have been possible without the 2005 Anbar Awakening , in which many Iraqi communities in al-Qaeda hotspots took up arms to uproot the group .
The film also skips over one of the ugliest but most important aspects of the war : the divisions between Iraq 's Sunni and its Shias , both of whom fought the US as well as one another , in what ultimately became a civil war . The words Sunni and Shia are hardly mentioned in the film , if at all . The idea that Iraqis could be much else other than terrorists , or that an Iraqi might take up arms for any reason other than to kill Americans , does n't really factor in American Sniper 's narrative .
Again , it would be understandable for a mainstream Hollywood production to not want to delve into sectarian politics . But rather than merely skirting Iraq 's sectarian conflict , the film instead replaces it with a narrative that the war was all about America versus al-Qaeda , which is simply false and misleading .
Once the film has established the invasion as a righteous response to 9/11 , which it was n't , and the war itself as a black-and-white battle against evil al-Qaeda terrorists , when the truth is far murkier , it then carries that narrative to its logical conclusion : opposing the Iraq War , or even insufficiently endorsing its glory , is tantamount to betrayal .
When Kyle 's brother , also a soldier , says `` fuck this place , '' Kyle channels the viewer 's bafflement . When another soldier dies , and a grieving family member reads an anti-war letter at the funeral , Kyle tells his wife that `` that letter '' is what killed him . His wife absorbs this line quietly , seemingly accepting it as gospel .
Without exploring why the Iraqis are fighting — America 's mistakes , the Sunni/Shia sectarian dynamics — the film gives us no resources for seeing beyond Kyle 's `` good versus evil '' perspective . In American Sniper , the Iraq War is nothing but a just war against al-Qaeda , and the only real casualties are American soldiers .
Getting the Iraq War this wrong is a disservice to the Americans who fought in it
American Sniper is absolutely consumed by questions of good and evil . From the opening sheepdog monologue , right down to Kyle 's final assessment of the war — that the only thing he regretted is he that he could n't save more American soldiers — the question of the war 's morality is placed front-and-center .
But the politics of the Iraq war defy the film 's simple `` wolves '' versus `` sheepdogs '' moral framing . American troops were alternately invaders and protectors .

But does this movie, much of which portrays intense ground combat in Iraqi cities, have anything to say about the war itself?

The film's star, Bradley Cooper, insists the film is ""not a political discussion about war."" But viewers of American Sniper are given a highly political re-telling of the Iraq War — and one that so wildly misrepresents the truth of the war that it is practically tantamount to whitewashing history.

American Sniper falsely suggests we invaded Iraq over 9/11

From the get-go, Chris Kyle's military career is all about responding to terrorism. Kyle joins up after al-Qaeda bombs the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. We see him and his wife Taya's stunned reactions to 9/11.

Iraqis are portrayed as ""savages"" and mostly evil terrorists

The narrative sets up the war as a morality play: there are evil terrorists, and Chris Kyle needs to kill them. It's as simple as that.

In an early speech that basically defines the film's politics, Chris Kyle's father declares that there are three kind of people: sheep, the wolves that prey on them, and the sheep dogs that hold them at bay.

But rather than merely skirting Iraq's sectarian conflict, the film instead replaces it with a narrative that the war was all about America versus al-Qaeda, which is simply false and misleading.

The dangerous implications of American Sniper's distortions

Once the film has established the invasion as a righteous response to 9/11, which it wasn't, and the war itself as a black-and-white battle against evil al-Qaeda terrorists, when the truth is far murkier, it then carries that narrative to its logical conclusion: opposing the Iraq War, or even insufficiently endorsing its glory, is tantamount to betrayal.

When Kyle's brother, also a soldier, says ""fuck this place,"" Kyle channels the viewer's bafflement. When another soldier dies, and a grieving family member reads an anti-war letter at the funeral, Kyle tells his wife that ""that letter"" is what killed him.

Donald Trump has dragged America into a moral abyss. And yet Congress, the press, and the public are unwilling to admit that we are now standing in blood.

`` Vigilance and force protection considerations remain a priority for commanders and their personnel , '' US Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell said in a statement .
`` It is recommended Marines and family members check their online/social footprint , ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information . ''
The warning came after a group calling itself the Islamic State Hacking Division put the allegedly hacked information about members of the air force , army and navy , included photos and ranks , on the Internet , according to monitoring group SITE Intelligence .
The hacking group said it took the information from government servers , databases and emails and called on its followers to mount attacks .
A defense source , however , told The New York Times most of the information was in fact available in public records and did not appear to have been hacked from government servers .
`` With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases , we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers residing in America can deal with you , '' the group wrote .
`` Now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses , all you need to do is take the final step , so what are you waiting for ? ''
The self-proclaimed hackers said the 100 military staff had targeted the Islamic State group in Iraq , Syria and Yemen .
A Defense Department official told AFP they were looking into the posting .
`` I ca n't confirm the validity of the information , but we are looking into it , '' the official said .
The United States is leading an international coalition targeting the Islamic State group ( ISIS ) in Iraq and Syria , where the Islamist militants have taken over swaths of territory .
ISIS has claimed responsibility for hacking attacks in the United States in the past , including against Central Command , which oversees the air war against the ISIS group .
In January , the hacked Centcom Twitter feed posted what appeared to be an office phone directory of officers that was slightly out of date , forcing the military to take down the command 's Twitter feed for a period .
The words `` CyberCaliphate '' and `` I love you ISIS '' replaced Central Command 's usual logo on Twitter and YouTube before the pages were suspended .
This month , the FBI said it was investigating a string of hacks that defaced US websites with imagery from the Islamic State jihadist group .
Websites including a racecar speedway in the state of Ohio , a Goodwill center in Missouri and a church in Canada were defaced with the radical group 's black flag .
Attacks against similar low-profile websites were also recorded in Montana , New York , Massachusetts and Minnesota .
The Islamic state group has relied on an aggressive propaganda campaign online to appeal to possible recruits to join and support the violent Islamists in Iraq and Syria .
US commanders and senior officials have previously said the ISIS group has shown a great acumen for propaganda and for promoting itself to potential jihadist recruits .
The group has called for lone wolf attacks in coalition countries , including the United States , Canada , Japan and Italy .","The US Marine Corps on Sunday urged ""vigilance"" among staff after the Islamic State group published the alleged names and addresses of 100 military personnel and urged supporters to kill them.

""Vigilance and force protection considerations remain a priority for commanders and their personnel,"" US Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell said in a statement.

""It is recommended Marines and family members check their online/social footprint, ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information.""

The warning came after a group calling itself the Islamic State Hacking Division put the allegedly hacked information about members of the air force, army and navy, included photos and ranks, on the Internet, according to monitoring group SITE Intelligence.

The hacking group said it took the information from government servers, databases and emails and called on its followers to mount attacks.

A defense source, however, told The New York Times most of the information was in fact available in public records and did not appear to have been hacked from government servers.

""With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases, we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers residing in America can deal with you,"" the group wrote.

""Now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses, all you need to do is take the final step, so what are you waiting for?""

The self-proclaimed hackers said the 100 military staff had targeted the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

A Defense Department official told AFP they were looking into the posting.

""I can't confirm the validity of the information, but we are looking into it,"" the official said.

The United States is leading an international coalition targeting the Islamic State group (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, where the Islamist militants have taken over swaths of territory.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for hacking attacks in the United States in the past, including against Central Command, which oversees the air war against the ISIS group.

In January, the hacked Centcom Twitter feed posted what appeared to be an office phone directory of officers that was slightly out of date, forcing the military to take down the command's Twitter feed for a period.

The words ""CyberCaliphate"" and ""I love you ISIS"" replaced Central Command's usual logo on Twitter and YouTube before the pages were suspended.

This month, the FBI said it was investigating a string of hacks that defaced US websites with imagery from the Islamic State jihadist group.

Websites including a racecar speedway in the state of Ohio, a Goodwill center in Missouri and a church in Canada were defaced with the radical group's black flag.

Attacks against similar low-profile websites were also recorded in Montana, New York, Massachusetts and Minnesota.

Trump in December ordered a withdrawal of the 2,000 American troops in Syria , saying they had defeated Islamic State militants there , even as U.S.-backed Syrian forces continued a final push against the group ’ s last outpost .
But Trump has been under pressure from multiple advisers to adjust his policy to ensure the protection of Kurdish forces , who supported the fight against Islamic State and who might now be threatened by Turkey , and to serve as a bulwark against Iran ’ s influence .
“ A small peacekeeping group of about 200 will remain in Syria for a period of time , ” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement .
The decision was announced after Trump spoke by phone to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan . A White House statement said the two leaders agreed , regarding Syria , to “ continue coordinating on the creation of a potential safe zone . ”
A senior administration official said Trump ’ s decision had been in the works for some time . It was unclear how long the 200 troops would be expected to remain in the area or where exactly they would be deployed .
Leaving even a small group of U.S. troops in Syria could pave the way for European allies to commit hundreds of troops to help set up and observe a potential safe zone in northeast Syria .

The decision to retain peacekeepers could help Trump overcome criticism that he had ordered a precipitous withdrawal from Syria that could lead to Islamic State regaining strength .
“ This is a clear direction to our allies and coalition members that we will be on the ground in some capacity , ” the senior U.S. administration official said .
Until now , European allies have balked at providing troops unless they received a firm commitment that Washington was still committed to the region .
Belgian Defense Minister Didier Reynders told reporters on Thursday before a meeting with acting Pentagon chief Patrick Shanahan that the issue of keeping troops in Syria in the future would be a matter for discussion with U.S. officials .
Turkey wants to set up a safe zone with logistical support from allies and says it should be cleared of the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG militia , which Ankara considers a terrorist group .
The White House did not say where exactly its troops would be based . In addition to northeast Syria , officials have talked about the importance of keeping some troops at the strategic Tanf garrison on the Iraq-Jordan border .
A U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the initial plan was to have some troops in northeastern Syria and some at Tanf . The official said planning was ongoing and could change .
The Tanf garrison was set up when Islamic State fighters controlled eastern Syria bordering Iraq . But since the militants were driven out , Tanf has assumed a role as part of a U.S. strategy to contain Iran ’ s military buildup .
U.S. officials have told ███ that while in Munich last week , Shanahan held a meeting on Syria with a small group of defense ministers . They talked about needing some sort of security arrangement in northeast Syria after the United States left . Shanahan will meet his Turkish counterpart on Friday .

Until now, European allies have balked at providing troops unless they received a firm commitment that Washington was still committed to the region.

Belgian Defense Minister Didier Reynders told reporters on Thursday before a meeting with acting Pentagon chief Patrick Shanahan that the issue of keeping troops in Syria in the future would be a matter for discussion with U.S. officials.

Turkey wants to set up a safe zone with logistical support from allies and says it should be cleared of the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers a terrorist group.

The White House did not say where exactly its troops would be based. In addition to northeast Syria, officials have talked about the importance of keeping some troops at the strategic Tanf garrison on the Iraq-Jordan border.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the initial plan was to have some troops in northeastern Syria and some at Tanf. The official said planning was ongoing and could change.

The Tanf garrison was set up when Islamic State fighters controlled eastern Syria bordering Iraq. But since the militants were driven out, Tanf has assumed a role as part of a U.S. strategy to contain Iran’s military buildup.

U.S. officials have told Reuters that while in Munich last week, Shanahan held a meeting on Syria with a small group of defense ministers. They talked about needing some sort of security arrangement in northeast Syria after the United States left. Shanahan will meet his Turkish counterpart on Friday.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham issued a statement applauding Trump’s decision to keep a small contingent of U.S. troops in Syria as part of an international stabilizing force, saying the president had followed sound military advice that would help avoid the problems the United States faced in Iraq.",www.reuters.com,center,SXjNg4J1oPpGGFE9

IS has been grimly resilient over many years. It regenerated itself from the ruins of an earlier group, al-Qaeda in Iraq.

A big military operation in 2016 and 2017 was needed to end IS control of territory straddling Iraq and Syria.

Many jihadist fighters ended up dead or in prison. But that did not kill the organisation.

It is still active in its old stamping grounds in Iraq and Syria, mounting ambushes, extorting funds, and ending more lives.

The Iraqi state has effective elite army and police units, mainly trained by the Americans and European allies who joined the fight against IS.

Since Soleimani's assassination, the US has suspended training as well as operations. So have Denmark and Germany.

The Germans are pulling military trainers out to Jordan and Kuwait.

Iraqi forces take most of the risks on the ground in operations against IS. But as well as training, they have relied on vital logistical help from US forces, who are now hunkering down in their bases.

IS militants have something else to celebrate. When Mr Trump decided to kill Soleimani they were gifted the spectacle of one of their enemies, the US president, assassinating another.

In 2014, the jihadists went on the offensive, seizing broad swathes of Iraq, including Mosul, the country's second city.

The leading Shia cleric in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, issued a call-to-arms to fight the Sunni extremists.

Young Shia men volunteered in their thousands - and Soleimani and his Quds Force were a big part of their transformation into armed units. The militias were ruthless, often brutal foes of IS.

Now, the Iran-backed groups have been absorbed into the Iraqi military under an umbrella organisation called the Popular Mobilisation. The most prominent militia leaders have become powerful political leaders.

In the years after 2014, the US and the militias faced the same enemy. But the Shia militias now look certain to return to their roots, which lie in the fight against the US-led occupation after the 2003 invasion.

They killed many American soldiers - helped by training and better weapons supplied by Soleimani - which was one of the reasons that President Trump gave for ordering the attack last week.

Before Soleimani was killed the Shia militias were already going back to targeting the Americans.

Their leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, met Soleimani at Baghdad's airport and was blown to pieces alongside him in the same car.

These attacks culminated in a rocket strike that killed an American and wounded others , then the attempted storming of our embassy in Baghdad . The first attack crossed the red line drawn by the president last summer — that if Iran harmed an American , it would face severe consequences . The president meant what he said , as Mr. Suleimani learned the hard way .
Mr. Suleimani ’ s killing was justified , legal and strategically sound . But the president ’ s critics swarmed as usual . After the embassy attack , a Democratic senator declared that the president had “ rendered America impotent. ” Some Democrats then pivoted after the Suleimani strike , calling him “ reckless ” and “ dangerous. ” Those are the words of Senator Elizabeth Warren , who also described Mr. Suleimani — the leader of a State Department-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization plotting to kill American troops — as a “ senior foreign military official. ” Senator Bernie Sanders likened America ’ s killing of a terrorist on the battlefield to Vladimir Putin ’ s assassination of Russian political dissidents .
Some Democrats seem to feel a strange regret for the killing of a monster who specialized in killing Americans . The linguist his proxies killed on Dec. 27 , Nawres Hamid , was merely his last victim out of more than 600 in Iraq since 2003 . His forces have instigated attacks against our troops in Afghanistan . He plotted a ( foiled ) bombing in Washington , D.C. , and attempted attacks on the soil of our European allies . He armed the terrorist group Hezbollah in Lebanon with rockets to pummel the Jewish state of Israel . And he was greeted moments before his death by a terrorist responsible for the bombing of our embassy in Kuwait in 1983 .
Some of the president ’ s critics will concede that Mr. Suleimani was an evil man , but many complain his killing was unlawful . Wrong again . He was a United States-designated terrorist commander . As I have been briefed , he was plotting further attacks against Americans at the time of his death . The authority granted to the president under Article II of the Constitution provides ample legal basis for this strike . Furthermore , those who accept the constitutionality of the War Powers Act should recall that Congress ’ s 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force very much remain in effect and clearly cover the Suleimani operation . This will be a relief to the Obama administration , which ordered hundreds of drone strikes using such a legal rationale .","Last week, our military and intelligence services brought justice to Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s terror mastermind.

One U.S. official told The ███ that Mr. Obama ’ s plan has prompted frustration in the administration ’ s national security and intelligence circles and triggered a heated fight inside the Pentagon over what specific units will remain inside Afghanistan , as well as the extent to which they can remain at all “ counterterrorism-relevant . ”
The official confirmed that Mr. Obama ’ s decision to confine remaining U.S. forces to Kabul and Bagram Air Field , just north of the Afghan capital , by the end of 2015 will eliminate a strategic patchwork of forward operating bases used for drone missions and required for Special Forces raids such as the one that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan three years ago .
A former senior U.S. military official told The Times that the closure of forward operating bases , including one in the northeastern city of Jalalabad , which deployed vital backup when a helicopter went down during the bin Laden operation , will render similar raids against remaining al Qaeda leaders such as Ayman al-Zawahiri impossible .
The Obama plan risks “ leading us back into the 1990s , when we were semi-blindly firing off Tomahawk missiles into empty training camps hours after bin Laden had flown the coop and hopped into a Toyota Land Cruiser , ” said David Sedney , who served until last year as a deputy assistant defense secretary overseeing Afghanistan , Pakistan and Central Asia .
With regard to drone operations , the heavy U.S. troop presence in northern Afghanistan over the past decade created the logistical capability for sustained cross-border targeting in Pakistan ’ s Federally Administered Tribal Areas , where more than 250 U.S. drone strikes were reported from 2005 through 2013 .

The catch , according to one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the drone program , is that the Grey Eagle ’ s accuracy and efficiency depend on ground intelligence gathered by soldiers at forward operating bases in the region .
“ Technically , you can probably continue to do drone operations from Bagram , but the important question is : Where are you going to get targetable intel from ? ” said the source . “ How are you going to know what to hit and know that it ’ s going to be there when your drones get there ?

“ Politically , there will also be a great cost for it , ” he said . “ It ’ s one thing to continue an activity . It ’ s another thing to renew it . ”
Mr. Obama said Tuesday that the current U.S. force of nearly 35,000 troops in Afghanistan will be cut to roughly 9,800 by the end of this year .
“ By the end of 2015 , we will have reduced that presence by roughly half and will have consolidated our troops in Kabul and on Bagram Air Field , ” the president said . By the end of 2016 , he said , the U.S. military will “ draw down to a normal embassy presence ” in the Afghan capital .
Mr. Obama offered few details about how U.S. troops will operate beyond saying that “ we ’ re open to cooperating with Afghans on two narrow missions after 2014 : training Afghan forces and supporting counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al Qaeda . ”
The Pentagon offered similarly guarded responses this week when pressed for details about the future of U.S. drones , Special Forces and counterterrorism operations that have included incursions into Pakistan from forward operating bases in Afghanistan .
“ I won ’ t detail the specifics in terms of exactly how counterterrorism operations are going to work going forward , ” Rear Adm. John Kirby , the Pentagon ’ s top press secretary , told CNN on Tuesday . “ We know it ’ s a persistent challenge , and nobody is going to turn their back on that . ”
Despite such assurances , many counterterrorism analysts are skeptical . “ The reality is that the fewer troops we have in Afghanistan , the fewer bases we have there and [ the ] less ability we have to conduct airstrikes , be it droned or manned aircraft , ” said Bill Roggio , editor of The Long War Journal and a scholar focused on al Qaeda at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies .
Mr. Roggio , who spoke with The Times before Mr. Obama ’ s announcement this week , said 5,000 to 10,000 troops on the ground is “ just not enough coverage to conduct air operations and counterterror operations in Afghanistan , let alone Pakistan . ”
“ When you get down to 6,000 , you ’ re getting down to the proverbial self-licking ice cream cone , ” said Frederick W. Kagan , who heads the American Enterprise Institute ’ s Critical Threats Project in Washington .
“ What you have is one base that can defend itself and probably not even make sure that Kabul doesn ’ t fall to the Taliban , ” said Mr. Kagan , who also spoke with The Times before Mr. Obama ’ s announcement .
What ’ s particularly disconcerting , Mr. Sedney said , is the manner in which al Qaeda appears to be recovering from gains made by the 2005-to-2013 drone campaign and the 2011 raid that killed bin Laden .
“ These strikes were just having a dampening effect . They were not permanently degrading or defeating al Qaeda , ” Mr. Sedney said . “ Al Qaeda is an ideology , not a core of individuals . The number of attacks is ramping up again . The flow of recruits never stopped ; the flow of money has not stopped . A lot of the flow has gone to Syria , but much of that is because al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan wanted it there . ”","President Obama’s call to cut the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to 5,000 troops in 18 months will end an era of American drone superiority over the region and jeopardize hard-fought gains against al Qaeda just as the terrorist movement’s original core is rising again, former senior defense officials and national security sources say.

One U.S. official told The Washington Times that Mr. Obama’s plan has prompted frustration in the administration’s national security and intelligence circles and triggered a heated fight inside the Pentagon over what specific units will remain inside Afghanistan, as well as the extent to which they can remain at all “counterterrorism-relevant.”

Iran warned Friday a ""harsh retaliation is waiting"" for the United States after top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani was killed by the Pentagon in an airstrike.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed vengeance.

Khamenei said in a statement published by Iranian state media that the ""cruelest people on earth"" assassinated the ""honorable"" commander who ""courageously fought for years against the evils and bandits of the world.""

Khamenei called for three days of mourning.

""His departure to God does not end his path or his mission,"" the statement said, published by Fars News Agency. ""But a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands.""

Soleimani was killed at Baghdad airport early Friday alongside members of Iran-backed militias operating in Iraq. The airstrike was ordered by President Donald Trump. Soleimani was killed while a convoy he was traveling in was leaving the airport. Iran funds and supports proxy militias across the Middle East.

One of them was that his trade war with China was just about to wrap up .

One of them was that his trade war with China was just about to wrap up. Another was that Americans could kiss their “beautiful” 401(k)s goodbye if Dems flipped just one chamber of the Congress. The most elaborate by far, though, was about a migrant caravan made up of asylum-seekers approaching the U.S.-Mexico border. First, the president claimed, with no evidence, that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed” in with the group. Then he spread the quite obviously false rumor that liberal hedge-fund manager George Soros has been paying these people. Later, he declared that the caravan comprised mostly of women and children fleeing violence and poverty is “actually mostly men” who were “pushing the few kids right up to the front” when the cameras are out, and that a group of people planning to surrender at the border and ask for amnesty through the proper legal channels is no different than a hostile invasion from a foreign country.

WASHINGTON — More than 350 of the 588 soldiers the Army has disqualified from sensitive posts, including sexual assault counselors, had committed offenses ranging from sexual assault to drug abuse to theft, according to Army data obtained by USA TODAY.

They make up the largest group of the soldiers the Army has deemed unfit in the past year to serve as sexual assault counselors and victims' advocates, recruiters and instructors. They were swept up in a screening of troops in sensitive positions ordered by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in light of the military's sexual assault crisis. This is the first time the Army has broken down the offenses that had disqualified them; it did so at the request of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

""We'd be lying if we said we had fully understood this problem,"" Lt. Gen. Howard Bromberg, the Army's personnel chief, told USA TODAY in an interview. ""Now that we understand this problem we're saying we did not always pick the right people in the past. So let's get the people right.""

Among the Army's findings:

• Fewer than 60 soldiers were disqualified because they were being investigated for sexual assault or harassment.

• About 140 soldiers were disqualified ""due to a history of family member or child abuse.""

• About 88 were disqualified ""due to a history of alcohol or drug abuse.""

Gillibrand, who heads the personnel panel on the armed services committee, said she found the Army's account lacking. In a letter to Bromberg on Friday, she pressed for more answers about what disqualified the soldiers, their positions in the Army and whether those kicked out of the Army received honorable discharges. The Army has moved to discharge 79 of the worst-offending soldiers.

""The military has been saying for over two decades 'we got it' and it is clear they dropped the ball,"" Gillibrand said in a statement. ""So now they are saying, 'now we really got it' but continue to be less than fully transparent with data my office has requested on multiple fronts. I will continue to ask questions as there is much more work to be done.""

Most of the soldiers have been reassigned to jobs that do not involve contact with what the Army considers ""vulnerable populations,"" mostly young people being recruited or who recently joined the Army.

The Army screened the backgrounds of about 20,000 soldiers working as recruiters, drill sergeants, sexual assault response coordinators and victims' advocates, said Christine Altendorf, director of the Army's program to prevent and respond to sexual harassment and assault. The 588 who were disqualified represent less than 3% of the total screened.

Soldiers are now screened extensively before being placed in sensitive posts, Bromberg said.

Just as important, Bromberg said, is a change to evaluations of officers and non-commissioned officers that includes an assessment of whether they foster a climate that does not tolerate sexual assault or harassment.

""We used to just evaluate officers by mission readiness,"" said Lt. Col. Geoff Catlett, executive officer for response and prevention office. ""Are you ready to go to combat? Now we're evaluating officers and NCOs on whether you're ready to go to combat and have you created a command climate in which everybody is treated with dignity and respect.""

Combating sexual assault is the top priority of Army Secretary John McHugh and Gen. Raymond Odierno, the chief of staff, Bromberg said.

""This is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive, detailed plan to change a culture over time,"" Bromberg said. ""We're on the path to do that.""

It is widely believed that the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of federal troops for domestic law enforcement, but this isn’t true — it prohibits such use only when there isn’t statutory authorization.

Minnesota called out the National Guard, and Minneapolis, the first city to get hit by these disturbances, has been relatively calm for three straight nights. New York has avoided calling the Guard, and New York City was a shameful festival of rioting and looting Monday night. Cities need to impose early curfews, vigorously enforce them, and call out the National Guard if they have any doubt that the police can’t do the job on their own.

If Trump’s language about “dominating” the streets is inflammatory, the basic point is correct. But the president has failed to rise to the moment with his incendiary tweets and insulting commentary on the performance of local officials.

His performance yesterday was marred by his photo-op in front of St. John’s church. We understand the impulse to show the flag at the historic church after it was set on fire over the weekend, but this jaunt should have been more carefully considered so it involved something more meaningful than waving a Bible in the air.

Friends describe him as a trustworthy and outgoing world traveler who joined the Army in 2008 . How he ended up captive remains a bit of a mystery . U.S. officials have declined to go into detail , but soldiers in his platoon say he was pulling guard duty when he put down his weapons and walked off base . He reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing U.S. activities in Afghanistan , according to 2012 reporting by late Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings .
Bluntly , they resent any talk of Bergdahl as a hero . They say he 's a deserter who should be put on trial , especially in light of the deaths of at least six U.S. soldiers killed while looking for him .
`` I was pissed off then and I am even more so now with everything going on , '' said Matt Vierkant , who was in the same platoon as Bergdahl . `` Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him . ''

He 's in stable condition `` receiving treatment for conditions that require hospitalization , '' Landstuhl Regional Medical Center said in a statement . Beyond saying he requires attention to `` dietary and nutrition needs , '' the hospital did n't elaborate , citing medical privacy requirements .
`` The Landstuhl staff is sensitive to what Sgt . Bergdahl has been through and will proceed with his reintegration at a pace with which he is comfortable , '' the hospital said .
Those in charge of treating Bergdahl are working to build up his confidence in them , a senior Defense Department official said , noting that Bergdahl has n't been able to trust anyone for five years .
Doctors in Germany are evaluating his health and whether he 's ready to be transported , said Arwen Consaul , a spokeswoman for U.S. Army South .
Once doctors give the OK , a receiving team will travel there to facilitate his transport to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas . From there , he 'll head to the San Antonio Military Medical Center , where a room is already ready for Bergdahl and a support team is standing by , Consaul said .

But Kirby said Monday that U.S. officials have received assurances from Qatari officials that the men `` were not going to pose a direct threat to the national security of the United States . ''

So who is this guy, and how did he wind up getting captured, anyway?

Friends describe him as a trustworthy and outgoing world traveler who joined the Army in 2008. How he ended up captive remains a bit of a mystery. U.S. officials have declined to go into detail, but soldiers in his platoon say he was pulling guard duty when he put down his weapons and walked off base. He reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing U.S. activities in Afghanistan, according to 2012 reporting by late Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings.

What are the soldiers who served with him saying?

Bluntly, they resent any talk of Bergdahl as a hero. They say he's a deserter who should be put on trial, especially in light of the deaths of at least six U.S. soldiers killed while looking for him.

""I was pissed off then and I am even more so now with everything going on,"" said Matt Vierkant, who was in the same platoon as Bergdahl. ""Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him.""

""I don't understand why we're trading prisoners at Gitmo for somebody who deserted during a time of war, which is an act of treason,"" Vierkant said.

Are they right? Was he a deserter?

U.S. officials aren't saying that, at least not directly. When asked about the issue Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sidestepped the question. ""Our first priority is assuring his well-being and his health and getting him reunited with his family,"" Hagel said. ""Other circumstances that may develop and questions, those will be dealt with later.""

On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby said U.S. officials ""still don't have a complete picture of what caused him to leave his base that night.""

""But let's not forget, he was held captive as a prisoner for five years. Five years by himself,"" Kirby said. ""That's a pretty high price to pay for whatever impelled him to walk off that base.""

So what's next for him?

He's at an American military hospital in Germany being evaluated by doctors and facing a lengthy repatriation and reintegration process.

He's in stable condition ""receiving treatment for conditions that require hospitalization,"" Landstuhl Regional Medical Center said in a statement. Beyond saying he requires attention to ""dietary and nutrition needs,"" the hospital didn't elaborate, citing medical privacy requirements.

""The Landstuhl staff is sensitive to what Sgt. Bergdahl has been through and will proceed with his reintegration at a pace with which he is comfortable,"" the hospital said.

Those in charge of treating Bergdahl are working to build up his confidence in them, a senior Defense Department official said, noting that Bergdahl hasn't been able to trust anyone for five years.

Doctors in Germany are evaluating his health and whether he's ready to be transported, said Arwen Consaul, a spokeswoman for U.S. Army South.

Once doctors give the OK, a receiving team will travel there to facilitate his transport to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. From there, he'll head to the San Antonio Military Medical Center, where a room is already ready for Bergdahl and a support team is standing by, Consaul said.

He hasn't yet talked to his family, Kirby said.

""That will obviously occur, but it won't occur until I think everybody believes it's the right time,"" he said.

The first meeting between Bergdahl and his parents may only last minutes, Consaul said, depending on what psychologists recommend.

Once in the United States, she said, Bergdahl's daily routine will focus on four key areas: medical care, psychological support, debriefings and family support.

""This is to help a person who has had no control of their own life for years now regain that control step by step,"" she said.

Is it true he's having trouble speaking English? Why?

Yes, according to a senior Defense Department official, but the reasons for it aren't clear.

It may be that he hasn't used English since he was captured, instead speaking to his captors in Pashtun, the local language.

Roy Hallums, a private contractor held by Iraqi insurgents for 10 months, said he didn't have trouble readjusting to English, but said he couldn't talk for a while because he had been forced to stay silent under threat of death.

""It's like your vocal chords are like your muscles in your arms. If they don't get any use, they get out of shape,"" he told CNN's ""New Day.""

What about these detainees the U.S. let go? Should we worry about them?

According to senior U.S. officials, they're mid- to high-level officials from the Taliban regime that ruled Afghanistan when the United States invaded the country. They include figures said to be linked to the late terror leader Osama bin Laden, his al Qaeda terror network and to abuses inside Afghanistan during the Taliban's rule.

But Kirby said Monday that U.S. officials have received assurances from Qatari officials that the men ""were not going to pose a direct threat to the national security of the United States.""

He declined to go into detail, but according to a senior defense official, they will be subject to Qatari supervision and a one-year travel ban.

Should we expect any more prisoner swaps or releases?

There aren't any other U.S. military personnel being held, so there won't be any more swaps involving troops, at least. But it's possible that Bergdahl's release presages a broader release of Afghan citizens from Guantanamo Bay, said CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen.

""At the end of hostilities, both sides typically swap prisoners, and we're coming to the end of conventional hostilities between these two groups,"" he said.

""We look at each case differently,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.

Bergdahl ""is a member of the military who was detained during an armed conflict. That, obviously, is a unique circumstance,"" she said. ""In any case, whether it's Alan Gross or Kenneth Bae or others who are detained American citizens, we take every step possible to make the case and to ... take steps to ensure their return home to the United States.""",www.cnn.com,left,7PISMOSo57jTxmTc

us_military,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/feb/8/no-military-solution-sight-us-forced-talk-peace-ta/,"With 'no military solution' in sight, U.S. forced to talk peace with Taliban despite ongoing attacks",2020-02-08,Ben Wolfgang,"America has exhausted all of its military options in Afghanistan and is left with little choice but to forge ahead in peace talks with the Taliban , Pakistani Ambassador to the U.S. Asad M. Khan said Monday , underscoring the high stakes of grueling negotiations .
In an exclusive interview with The ███ , Mr. Khan said the two sides have reached a crucial moment — despite continued Taliban attacks and a spike in American strikes against the radical Islamist movement ’ s top targets — to solidify a cease-fire agreement that could wind down two decades of conflict and bring to a close the longest war in U.S. history .
President Trump has pressed for a deal with the Taliban and the U.S.-backed government in Kabul that would allow him to draw down the estimated 12,000-plus American combat troops based in the country , but both sides have balked when a deal appeared in sight over the past year .
“ What is the alternative ? ” Mr. Khan said . “ There is no military solution . You have tried it with a much larger military presence there , and that did not result in peace . ”
In a wide-ranging conversation with The Times , Pakistan ’ s top diplomat in Washington slammed India ’ s actions in recent months in Kashmir , warned of a potential refugee crisis if the Kashmir dispute isn ’ t resolved peacefully and urged the U.S. and Iran to cool tensions or risk further destabilization of a fragile region .
Mr. Khan also said Pakistan is thankful for White House efforts to tamp down conflicts between India and Pakistan over Kashmir .
Mr. Trump is set to visit India , but not Pakistan , at the end of the month , and speculation is mounting over what the U.S. president will say to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the long stalemate over Kashmir .
On Afghanistan , Mr. Khan said a deal between the U.S. and Taliban leaders is easier than the next step : formal talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government .
Taliban leaders have refused to recognize the Afghan government and have steadfastly rejected face-to-face talks despite American prodding .
Despite the painfully slow process of reaching an agreement and the Trump administration ’ s clear frustration that the Taliban have not ceased violent attacks , Mr. Khan said this year represents a golden opportunity . The complexities and conflicts among major players in the region will only grow over time , he said .
“ The geopolitical situation , frankly , today is more complicated than it was five years ago , ” he said . “ Who knows in a couple of years what it would be like ? ”
He said Iranian animosity toward the U.S. or its chief regional foe , Saudi Arabia , could spill into Afghanistan and make peace negotiations even more complicated .
“ That , in a way , underpins our desire to see peace and tensions between the U.S. and Iran — and also tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia — defused , ” he said . “ Because if that does not happen , those rivalries play out wherever and whatever places they can play out . ”
Top U.S. officials on Monday expressed optimism but also signaled frustration over peace talks . They said Taliban leaders have yet to fully demonstrate that they are willing to take steps needed to secure a deal , in particular to lower the level of violence .
“ We ’ re working on a peace and reconciliation plan , putting the commas in the right place , getting the sentences right , ” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters while traveling in Uzbekistan . “ We got close once before to having an agreement — a piece of paper that we mutually executed — and the Taliban were unable to demonstrate either their will or capacity or both to deliver on a reduction in violence .
“ So what we are demanding now is demonstrable evidence of their will and capacity to reduce violence , to take down the threat , so the inter-Afghan talks … will have a less-violent context , ” he said . “ We ’ re hopeful we can achieve that , but we ’ re not there yet and work certainly remains . ”
Prospects for a U.S.-Taliban deal seemed imminent in early September . Mr. Trump even invited Taliban leaders to a Camp David summit to announce an agreement , but those plans were scrapped at the last minute after Taliban attacks targeted Americans in Afghanistan .
Mr. Khan said Pakistan , which sees itself as the victim of jihadi violence and instability spilling over its long , porous border with Afghanistan , will do whatever it can to facilitate a U.S.-Taliban deal .
On Kashmir , he said India ’ s leaders are strategically positioning Pakistan as a villain for their domestic political purposes .
“ They use Pakistan as a punching bag , and they want to escalate , ” he said . “ That is now a set pattern . I think that doesn ’ t really bode well for long-term peace and stability . ”
In August , Mr. Modi ’ s government imposed a curfew over much of Indian-controlled Kashmir , and Delhi revoked the Muslim-majority territory ’ s special status as a semi-autonomous state .

Indian officials told The Times last fall that Pakistan has preyed on young Kashmiris and incited violence in the region .","America has exhausted all of its military options in Afghanistan and is left with little choice but to forge ahead in peace talks with the Taliban, Pakistani Ambassador to the U.S. Asad M. Khan said Monday, underscoring the high stakes of grueling negotiations.

In an exclusive interview with The Washington Times, Mr. Khan said the two sides have reached a crucial moment — despite continued Taliban attacks and a spike in American strikes against the radical Islamist movement’s top targets — to solidify a cease-fire agreement that could wind down two decades of conflict and bring to a close the longest war in U.S. history.

President Trump has pressed for a deal with the Taliban and the U.S.-backed government in Kabul that would allow him to draw down the estimated 12,000-plus American combat troops based in the country, but both sides have balked when a deal appeared in sight over the past year.

“What is the alternative?” Mr. Khan said. “There is no military solution. You have tried it with a much larger military presence there, and that did not result in peace.”

In a wide-ranging conversation with The Times, Pakistan’s top diplomat in Washington slammed India’s actions in recent months in Kashmir, warned of a potential refugee crisis if the Kashmir dispute isn’t resolved peacefully and urged the U.S. and Iran to cool tensions or risk further destabilization of a fragile region.

Mr. Khan also said Pakistan is thankful for White House efforts to tamp down conflicts between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.

Mr. Trump is set to visit India, but not Pakistan, at the end of the month, and speculation is mounting over what the U.S. president will say to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the long stalemate over Kashmir.

On Afghanistan, Mr. Khan said a deal between the U.S. and Taliban leaders is easier than the next step: formal talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government.

Taliban leaders have refused to recognize the Afghan government and have steadfastly rejected face-to-face talks despite American prodding.

Despite the painfully slow process of reaching an agreement and the Trump administration’s clear frustration that the Taliban have not ceased violent attacks, Mr. Khan said this year represents a golden opportunity. The complexities and conflicts among major players in the region will only grow over time, he said.

“The geopolitical situation, frankly, today is more complicated than it was five years ago,” he said. “Who knows in a couple of years what it would be like?”

He said Iranian animosity toward the U.S. or its chief regional foe, Saudi Arabia, could spill into Afghanistan and make peace negotiations even more complicated.

“That, in a way, underpins our desire to see peace and tensions between the U.S. and Iran — and also tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia — defused,” he said. “Because if that does not happen, those rivalries play out wherever and whatever places they can play out.”

Optimism and caution

Top U.S. officials on Monday expressed optimism but also signaled frustration over peace talks. They said Taliban leaders have yet to fully demonstrate that they are willing to take steps needed to secure a deal, in particular to lower the level of violence.

“We’re working on a peace and reconciliation plan, putting the commas in the right place, getting the sentences right,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters while traveling in Uzbekistan. “We got close once before to having an agreement — a piece of paper that we mutually executed — and the Taliban were unable to demonstrate either their will or capacity or both to deliver on a reduction in violence.

“So what we are demanding now is demonstrable evidence of their will and capacity to reduce violence, to take down the threat, so the inter-Afghan talks … will have a less-violent context,” he said. “We’re hopeful we can achieve that, but we’re not there yet and work certainly remains.”

Prospects for a U.S.-Taliban deal seemed imminent in early September. Mr. Trump even invited Taliban leaders to a Camp David summit to announce an agreement, but those plans were scrapped at the last minute after Taliban attacks targeted Americans in Afghanistan.

Mr. Khan said Pakistan, which sees itself as the victim of jihadi violence and instability spilling over its long, porous border with Afghanistan, will do whatever it can to facilitate a U.S.-Taliban deal.

On Kashmir, he said India’s leaders are strategically positioning Pakistan as a villain for their domestic political purposes.

“They use Pakistan as a punching bag, and they want to escalate,” he said. “That is now a set pattern. I think that doesn’t really bode well for long-term peace and stability.”

In August, Mr. Modi’s government imposed a curfew over much of Indian-controlled Kashmir, and Delhi revoked the Muslim-majority territory’s special status as a semi-autonomous state.

Mr. Khan and other Pakistani officials have accused the Indian government of keeping out journalists and international observers, crushing the region’s tourism industry, essentially shutting off the area and holding large numbers of Kashmiris hostage in a de facto prison.

“If you are not allowing anyone to come in, the daily wages, those who work in the hospitality industry, all those jobs are gone,” he said. “So there is a serious economic crisis on top of the humanitarian crisis that Indian actions have generated.”

Top Indian officials have vehemently denied those allegations and cast the situation in Kashmir much differently. Indian officials told The Times last fall that Pakistan has preyed on young Kashmiris and incited violence in the region.

‘Protect states in times of violence’

Tracing back to the Magna Carta, the British charter of liberty signed in 1215, there is a longstanding tradition against military involvement in civilian affairs.

However, the U.S. Constitution guarantees that the national government will protect the states in times of violence and permits Congress to enact laws that enable the military to aid in carrying out the law.

Almost immediately after the Constitution’s enactment in 1787, Congress passed a law that allowed the president to use the military to respond to a series of citizen rebellions.

Troops serving as what’s called “posse comitatus,” which translates roughly to “attendants with the capacity to act,” could be called to suppress insurrections and help carry out federal laws.

Following the Civil War, the national government used troops in this capacity to aid in Reconstruction efforts, particularly in states that had been part of the Confederacy.

The use of troops in this manner may even have influenced the outcome of the 1876 presidential election of Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. That happened when, in return for agreeing to withdraw federal troops from the South, Democrats informally agreed to the election of Hayes when the disputed election was thrown to a congressional commission.

Two years later, Hayes signed into law the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibited the use of the military in civilian matters.

The Posse Comitatus Act has not changed much since that time. The law prohibits the use of the military in civilian matters but, over time, Congress has passed at least 26 exemptions to the act that allow the president to send troops into states.

The exemptions range from providing military personnel to protect national parks to helping states in carrying out state quarantine and health laws.

Insurrection Act

What exemption would President Trump use if he wants to send the military to one or more states?

He would likely rely on the Insurrection Act, which governs certain circumstances when the president can use the military. Signed by Thomas Jefferson in 1807, Congress originally passed the law in order to help fight citizen rebellions against federal taxes.

Over time, the law has evolved to allow the use of troops in other circumstances. For example, Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson used the Insurrection Act in the 1950s and 1960s to send the military to enforce court desegregation orders and to protect civil rights marchers.

The Insurrection Act says that the president may use the armed forces to subdue an insurrection or rebellion and take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress violence.

Not only does this strategy enable governors to maintain authority over their states’ responses to the clashes in the wake of George Floyd’s death, but it also keeps things more straightforward legally and politically.

Authority uncertain

Reliance on the Insurrection Act raises a host of political and practical questions about who is in charge when the military sends troops into a state.

For example, despite the fact that the act was invoked in response to the Rodney King riots, the military actually was not used as directed. The Joint Task Force Commander in control of the mission appears to have been confused regarding how the Insurrection Act worked alongside the provisions of the Posse Comitatus Act.

They must document their foreign travel since birth, their financial information and spending habits, a list of all associates “living or dead” who have been connected with any government and detailed information on “all foreign-born associates and relatives” they have ever had contact with, according to the manual for the counterintelligence screenings reviewed by The Post.

“The type of background check they are trying to get the noncitizen soldier to pass is as if he was going to be Jared Kushner working in the White House,” said Zhang’s attorney, Beverly Cutler.

“They are giving them our nation’s highest level of national security testing and to not pass that has nothing to do with whether you are qualified to be a citizen.”

The Pentagon didn’t have information on how many recruits passed the new standards, but it contends that the average ratio of passage is two out of three and that the tougher standards were needed for national security.

“The problem with the MAVNI program [is] we found that it was really vulnerable to insider threats and espionage and terrorism and other criminal activity. When that became apparent, we had to do something,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Carla Gleason.

She said the Pentagon doesn’t tip off immigration officials to newly discharged immigrant recruits to start deportation proceedings.

“No one is being discharged from the military due to their immigration status. They are being discharged due to security suitability,” she said.

New rules also drastically limited citizenship opportunities for all noncitizen recruits.

Previously, one day of military service was sufficient to apply for citizenship. But under the new rules, 180 days of consecutive active duty service or one year in the reserves is required.

The changes shocked Istajab.

“They welcome you. They say you are in our department and you are a US solider. We took an oath of office,” said Istajab, who is working as a dental assistant.

“We were about to ship [to basic training]. And then all of a sudden, the new government came and said, ‘Hey, we don’t know who you guys are . . . You are strangers in our department.’ It’s kind of rough.”

One Chinese MAVNI recruit from New York learned that he didn’t pass an expanded background check — although not why — but hasn’t been officially discharged and is continuing to drill on weekends in his uniform in the hope the Army realizes he poses no threat.

“I don’t have a ship date. I’m just waiting. I’m hoping they change their mind or they made a mistake,” said the recruit, who has been drilling for more than two years.

In China, his decision to serve in the US Army would be viewed as “treason.”

Evidence compiled by Stock in a separate military asylum case shows a string of threats posted on the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo against Chinese MAVNI soldiers.

Ten US Navy sailors are missing and five have been injured after a US destroyer and an oil tanker collided near Singapore, the Navy says.

The guided missile destroyer USS John S McCain was sailing east of Singapore and preparing to stop in the port when the collision with the Liberian-flagged vessel occurred.

A wide-ranging search and rescue operation is under way.

It is the second collision involving a US Navy ship in recent months.

What do we know about the collision?

It was reported before dawn at 05:24 local time on Monday (21:24 GMT on Sunday) and took place east of the Strait of Singapore, as the USS John S McCain prepared to perform a routine port stop in Singapore.

Singapore and US authorities said the destroyer sustained damage to her port side, which is the left-hand side of the vessel facing forward.

The tanker it collided with, Alnic MC, sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship 7m (23ft) above the waterline, but none of its crew were injured and there were no oil spills.

At 182m (600ft), the tanker is slightly longer than the 154m-long US destroyer.

What is happening now?

US military helicopters as well as the Singaporean and Malaysian navies and coast guards are currently conducting search and rescue operations.

Repeat event raises questions

Karishma Vaswani, BBC News, Singapore

The timing of this is awkward for the United States. It's the first day of annual drills between the US and South Korean armies, a show of might in the face of North Korean belligerence.

The USS John McCain is part of the US Navy's 7th Fleet, its largest fleet, but this accident will add to questions about the operations of the navy in the region more widely.

This is the same naval group that saw a similar accident only in June, when seven US sailors lost their lives. Just last week several officers were disciplined in relation to that incident.

This is also thought to be the fourth such collision involving US warships in the past year alone.

Add to this the confusion earlier this year over the whereabouts of another US warship in the Pacific - the USS Carl Vinson - which President Trump said was sailing for North Korea, but was actually headed in the opposite direction for training exercises with the Australian navy.

What's the response so far?

Shortly after news of the collision came out, the US chief of naval operations, John Richardson, tweeted that the first priority was to determine the safety of the ship and the crew.

US senator John McCain tweeted that he and his wife were praying for the sailors.

The vessel was named after his father and grandfather, both admirals in the Navy.

US president Donald Trump has also put out a tweet about the accident.

Has this happened before?

This is thought to be the fourth time in a year that a US navy vessel has been involved in an accident.

Just two months ago, seven US sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship in Japanese waters near the port city of Yokosuka.

Those who died were found in flooded berths on board the ship after the collision caused a gash under the warship's waterline.

The US Navy said last week that about a dozen sailors would be disciplined, and the commanding officer and other senior crew would be taken off the ship.

In May, a guided missile cruiser collided with a South Korean fishing vessel, while in August last year a submarine collided with an offshore support vessel.

us_military,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/26/trump-announces-ban-on-transgender-individuals-serving-in-military.html,Trump announces ban on transgender individuals serving in military,2017-07-26,Barnini Chakraborty,"President Trump touched off a firestorm Wednesday after tweeting that he wants to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military in any capacity -- citing advice from his `` generals '' and medical costs .
`` After consultation with my Generals and military experts , please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow ... Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military . Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming .. victory and can not be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail . Thank you . ''
The president ’ s tweets came only a few weeks after Defense Secretary James Mattis said he would give military chiefs another six months to conduct a review to determine if allowing transgender individuals to enlist in the armed services will affect the “ readiness or lethality ” of the force . The deadline for that review was Dec. 1 , 2017 .
“ This is worse than don ’ t ask don ’ t tell , this is don ’ t serve , don ’ t serve , ” The National Center for Transgender Equality said in a written statement . “ This is an appalling attack on our service members ; it is about bigotry rather than military readiness , reason or science . It is indefensible and can not stand . ”
“ I applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to return to military priorities – and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nation ’ s military , ” FRC President Tony Perkins said in a statement . “ The military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda . ”
Rep. Steve King , R-Iowa , said `` we do n't need to be experimenting with the military . Plus there 's no reason to take on that kind of financial burden . ''
But Trump himself tweeted during the campaign season that he would `` fight '' for the LGBTQ community while his opponent `` Hillary ( Clinton ) brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs . ''
During his confirmation hearing in January , Mattis was asked whether he believed that allowing LGBT Americans to serve in the military or women in combat would undermine the military ’ s lethality .
“ Frankly , senator , I ’ ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with , ” Mattis testified .
Abbie Goldberg , professor of psychology at Clark University who has researched and written about the LGBTQ community , told Fox News “ no one wins under Trump ’ s plan . ”
“ Some people will not serve , which is a loss to the military and the country , ” Goldberg said . “ Others will serve , but not openly , and thus they will be at risk for discharge or verbal , physical and sexual abuse . ”
The Pentagon has refused to release any data on the number of transgender troops currently serving . A RAND study found that there are between 2,500 and 7,000 transgender service members in the active-duty military , and another 1,500 to 4,000 in the reserves .

They were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations publicly , so spoke on condition of anonymity .","President Trump touched off a firestorm Wednesday after tweeting that he wants to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military in any capacity -- citing advice from his ""generals"" and medical costs.

In a series of tweets, he wrote:

""After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming..victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.""

The president’s tweets came only a few weeks after Defense Secretary James Mattis said he would give military chiefs another six months to conduct a review to determine if allowing transgender individuals to enlist in the armed services will affect the “readiness or lethality” of the force. The deadline for that review was Dec. 1, 2017.

“This is worse than don’t ask don’t tell, this is don’t serve, don’t serve,” The National Center for Transgender Equality said in a written statement. “This is an appalling attack on our service members; it is about bigotry rather than military readiness, reason or science. It is indefensible and cannot stand.”

The Family Research Council praised Trump’s action.

“I applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to return to military priorities – and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nation’s military,” FRC President Tony Perkins said in a statement. “The military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda.”

Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said ""we don't need to be experimenting with the military. Plus there's no reason to take on that kind of financial burden.""

But Trump himself tweeted during the campaign season that he would ""fight"" for the LGBTQ community while his opponent ""Hillary (Clinton) brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.""

During his confirmation hearing in January, Mattis was asked whether he believed that allowing LGBT Americans to serve in the military or women in combat would undermine the military’s lethality.

“Frankly, senator, I’ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with,” Mattis testified.

Abbie Goldberg, professor of psychology at Clark University who has researched and written about the LGBTQ community, told Fox News “no one wins under Trump’s plan.”

“Some people will not serve, which is a loss to the military and the country,” Goldberg said. “Others will serve, but not openly, and thus they will be at risk for discharge or verbal, physical and sexual abuse.”

The Pentagon has refused to release any data on the number of transgender troops currently serving. A RAND study found that there are between 2,500 and 7,000 transgender service members in the active-duty military, and another 1,500 to 4,000 in the reserves.

The study also found that allowing transgender people to serve in the military would have a ""minimal impact"" on the health care costs.

The Pentagon announced it would “continue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the commander in chief on transgender individuals serving in the military.”

“We will provide revised guidance to the Department in the near future,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in statement.

Trump’s announcement comes as lawmakers on Capitol Hill debate the current practice of requiring the Pentagon to pay for medical treatment for gender transition.

M4 critics have long pointed to the Afghanistan battle on July 13 , 2008 , as evidence that the rifle ’ s design was flawed . They cite reports from soldiers on the ground that their guns overheated and jammed that day .
But the gun ’ s supporters have pointed to a single sentence in the official Wanat history issued in 2010 by the Army ’ s Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth , Kan . It blamed the gun ’ s sustained rapid fire that day , not its design , for the malfunctions .
“ This , not weapons maintenance deficiencies or inherent weaknesses in weapons design , was the reason a number of weapons jammed during the battle , ” the sentence read .
Higher-ups inside Army command edited that sentence into the history , the report ’ s author says .
“ That was not my conclusion , ” said Douglas R. Cubbison , a former Army artillery officer and principal Wanat history author . “ That was the Combat Studies Institute management that was driven from the chief of staff ’ s office to modify findings of that report to basically CYA [ cover your ass ] for the Army . You know how that works .
“ Other soldiers have informally told me of similar problems they had with the M4 at high rates of fire , ” said Mr. Cubbison , who is now curator of the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum .
Higher-ups made other changes , such as removing much of the historian ’ s criticism of senior officers for not better preparing the outpost for an attack .
“ The Army tried to manipulate that study after it was basically done . They significantly changed things to a classic CYA , ” Mr. Cubbison said .
Lt. Col. James Lowe , a spokesman at Fort Leavenworth , said the Army sticks by the changes it has made .
“ The way that our studies are done , it ’ s a staff process , ” he said . “ And they disagreed with some of his conclusions about the weapons , and they firmly believe that the analysis supports what ’ s actually in the report . ”
M4 critics say exonerating the M4 at Wanat follows a pattern : The Army vigorously defends its front-line rifle in public ; behind the scenes , it works to correct its flaws .
The Times reported Thursday that documents it obtained show the Pentagon was warned as early as 2001 and 2002 that the M4A1 carbine — the commando version — had flaws that made it more likely to jam in desert conditions .
The editing to absolve the M4 was important because Sen. Tom Coburn , Oklahoma Republican , was waging a campaign to convince the Army that the gun was faulty and needed replacing .
Critics said Mr. Cubbison ’ s history showed the gun was not designed for America ’ s longest war , in which triggers , magazines and pistons must withstand sand and be called on to unleash rapid fire .
An interesting footnote is that , until the history was first leaked in 2009 and published a year later , no one had reported publicly that multiple M4s failed soldiers that day . A lengthy TV documentary on Wanat never broached the subject .
Mr. Cubbison said the history spoke for itself and did not need changes by managers .
“ It was also not the assessment of numerous soldiers at Wanat , ” he said .
Unlike Desert Storm , a war fought mostly with planes and armor , counterinsurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan put rifles to the ultimate test in a series of fire fights , year in , year out , making the M4 the soldier ’ s most important weapon .
The history recounts in detail the day a Taliban force assaulted a combat outpost in Wanat in the Nuristan province of northeastern Afghanistan . Manned by 49 U.S. soldiers , including 40 paratroopers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team , the outpost sat in a bowl surrounded by mountains from which the soldiers predicted in homemade videos that they would be attacked one day like sitting ducks .
Staff Sgt . Erich Phillips , a seasoned combatant who had been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross , burned out three M4s trying to defend a mortar position .
“ In particular , the M4s experienced difficulty maintaining such a rate after the barrels got excessively hot . When that occurred , the weapons would jam , as happened to Phillips , ” the history said .
These soldiers were experiencing the types of weapon failures found by testers in 2001 and 2002 .
“ Six years later , we can ’ t fix a known problem in the middle of a war , ” Mr. Cubbison told The Times .
Spc . Chris McKaig told of firing from a crow ’ s nest as a comrade , its only other inhabitant , was gunned down .
“ My weapon was overheating , ” he said . “ I had shot about 12 magazines by this point already and it had only been about a half-hour or so into the fight . I couldn ’ t charge my weapon and put another round in because it was too hot , so I got mad and threw my weapon down . ”
The historians wrote that “ most of the weapons that jammed at Wanat were M4 carbines . ”
In the official Army history , the full management edit — not performed by the authors — reads : “ The M4 was the basic individual weapon carried by U.S . Soldiers in Afghanistan and was not designed to fire at the maximum or cyclic rate for extended periods . Enemy action and weapons dispositions forced the defenders to use their M4s in uncharacteristic roles . This , not weapons maintenance deficiencies or inherent weaknesses in weapons design , was the reason a number of weapons jammed during the battle . ”
Scott Traudt , a small-arms specialist whose company , Green Mountain Defense Industries , is manufacturing its own assault rifle , called the finding a whitewash .
“ Fielding a battle rifle whose barrel blows up in sustained fire after only 490 rounds is criminal negligence , ” he said . “ [ The ] weapons failed because they were designed around some arbitrary , ‘ average ’ combat situation by somebody oblivious to the present and future high consumptive , mobile , asymmetric wars and insurgencies we face . ”
Mr. Cubbison said there was talk inside and outside the Army that the soldiers were to blame for not maintaining their M4s .
“ I can tell you , I guarantee you , weapons were cleaned in that platoon , ” he said . “ I ’ ve talked to just about every guy who was there . They knew it was a bad location . They expected to get hit and get hit hard . Nobody was going to neglect weapons maintenance when they ’ re expecting to be in the soup at any moment . Weapons cleaning wasn ’ t an issue . ”
Mr. Cubbison said he has a contact inside a small-arms unit of Program Executive Office Soldier , the Army command that equips warriors .
“ I know that those guys have done a lot of work on reviewing and evaluating the weapon and trying to figure out what the problem is with it , ” he said .
Retired Army Col. David Brostrom lost his son , 1st Lt. Jonathan Brostrom , that day in Wanat village . After reading early post-action reports , he became convinced those soldiers were let down by superiors who failed to take basic steps to protect the outpost and heed intelligence reports . He pushed for further investigation , which led to an extensive U.S. Central Command report in June 2010 .
It found that the company , battalion and brigade commanders were derelict in their duties . A four-star general disciplined three officers but withdrew the punishment after they provided additional information .
Col. Brostrom says today he should have pushed the inquiry to focus more attention on performance of the M4 .
“ Maybe it was my mistake . I didn ’ t focus on the jamming , ” he said . “ I knew about the gun , and I knew it wasn ’ t great . It took a lot of fire discipline among your soldiers to keep the gun working .
“ Because they were so close to the enemy , some were just sticking their weapons above the sandbags and spraying and praying . Putting the weapons on automatic and letting it go .
“ A little bit of dirt in that thing , it won ’ t sustain that high rate of fire at all . The barrel gets hot and everything melts in the dang thing . They were firing their weapons trying to save their lives and just about everything jammed . ”
Col. Brostrom said he does not know whether some M4s jammed after limited fire while others quit after rapid automatic rounds . He does know that by the time his son made his way to the outpost under intense fire , virtually all the weapons had shut down . A corporal had no working gun when Lt. Brostrom arrived .
The corporal “ jumped down to the lower step and tried to go after them with his bare hands . They shot him point-blank in the chest , ” he said .
“ I know now if the weapons were better and they would not have jammed , there would be more soldiers alive , maybe even my son , ” Col. Brostrom said .
Chief Warrant Officer Tyler Stafford knew the M4 had drawbacks months before a wave of rocket-propelled grenades hit the Wanat outpost that day .
Then-Spc . Stafford had experienced two gunbattles during which his M4 jammed because of what he considers a substandard 30-round magazine .
He contends that , while Army higher-ups say soldiers pushed the carbines beyond their firing capacity that day and burned out the barrels , faulty magazines could be the culprit in some of the stoppages .
“ The Army never looked at the type of magazines that were used , ” he said . “ That ’ s what we found would cause a lot of failures . If you used the standard old Army tin magazines that had been used in a couple of deployments , they really wore down and would cause a lot of jams just because of failure to feed and the springs were worn out in them .
“ They just don ’ t get replaced readily , and when they do , they still get replaced by a standard-issue magazine that just isn ’ t a very good magazine at all . ”
To improve the M4 on the run , Chief Warrant Officer Stafford said , “ A lot of us went out and bought our own magazines . They worked far better . ”
Chief Warrant Officer Stafford has left the gritty job of infantryman for the world of Army aviation , flying AH-64 Apache helicopters .
Since the 2008 battle , he took the time to research the M4 ’ s history — the spotty tests , the soldier surveys , the attempts to improve it — and compared the data with his own experiences .
His assessment : “ It is my personal belief that the M4 is a substandard front-line weapon and lacks the reliability and firepower that many infantrymen are in need of .
“ Everybody ’ s biggest problem with the M4 is that it ’ s such a high-maintenance weapon , that continually you have to keep it very , very clean , very well-oiled , ” he said . “ In the infantry world , that ’ s tough to do , especially when you ’ re living in the dirt and fighting every other day . ”
Whatever the internal discussions , the Army has defended the rifle in public for more than a decade .
Lt. Col. Donald Peters , a spokesman at the Pentagon , said the service has made 41 improvements since 2001 that were among 90 engineering changes to the M4 and commando M4A1 since the gun was in development in the early 1990s .
The plan now is to revamp M4s into higher-performance M4A1s beginning this winter .
“ The M4A1 the Army is currently producing has a slightly heavier barrel than the M4 , which increases the weapons system ’ s ability to withstand heat and therefore gives it a greater sustained rate of fire , ” Col. Peters said . “ The M4A1 also has full auto capability and more consistent trigger pull , along with ambidextrous fire control . ”
The Army often cites surveys to defend the M4 . It questions every unit that returns from combat and finds that eight out of 10 like the gun .
The Center for Naval Analysis found the same results in a 2006 independent survey of 2,600 soldiers who had been in Afghanistan and Iraq .
But soldiers did complain about a lack of lethality . One of the major gripes was from retired Army Maj. Gen. Robert Scales , a highly decorated artillery officer .
Perhaps more important , 20 percent reported that the M4 had jammed during a firefight . Of those , 18 percent said the stoppage had a “ large impact ” in battle .
Gen. Scales said the problem with such surveys is that they do not focus on the soldiers who engaged in the most intense combat during which the M4 is fired and relied on the most .
“ The people who use the M4 seriously , the close-combat soldiers , when they use it seriously for a Wanat , their vote is the same in these surveys as the kid who is a computer operator at Camp Victory , ” he said . “ So when you lump it all together , the whole thing seems to be perfectly fine . ”
As for Chief Warrant Officer Stafford ’ s firsthand experience with M4 magazines , Gen. Scales said : “ If my son were in the infantry , for his birthday I would buy him about 50 [ German ] Heckler and Koch magazines , not just for him , but for his buds . Why do we die for a dollar-and-seventy-cent item when a fighter plane costs $ 550 million ? ”
Exactly one year after Wanat , the Army began fielding what it said was an improved M4 magazine .
The survey numbers on jamming alarmed Mr. Coburn . He took on a large group of Army supporters — its huge following of lawmakers and staffers in Congress and retired top brass who sit on the boards of various munitions manufacturers — to advocate a better rifle .
By December 2007 , the Army was testing the M4 against competitors at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland .
The competition matched the M4 against three European-designed assault rifles , all firing 6,000 rounds in sandstorm conditions . The three interlopers recorded 233 or fewer stoppages . The M4 racked up more than three times as many : 882 , according to the Congressional Research Service .
The Army and manufacturer Colt Defense LLC later said the M4 had much fewer shutdowns and blamed the high count on M4s that were not combat-ready .
Next came the Army ’ s most extensive M4 review to date : a small-arms capabilities-based assessment . By January 2009 , the Army was telling Congress that its rifles and machine guns , including the M4 , had 25 “ capability gaps , ” including a need for greater lethality and for a gun that did not need constant cleaning and lubrication — in other words , what critics had been saying about the M4 .
With the report completed , the Army embarked on a major M4 upgrade , though it contended the gun ’ s basic design remained sound .
Critics persisted . One was Sgt . Charles Perales , at the time stationed at Fort Bragg , N.C .
“ My unit — B Company , 2nd Battalion , 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment — was deployed to Afghanistan from April 2005 to March 2006 . While there , we were attached to Special Forces at Camp Tillman on the Afghan border . I saw first-hand what happens when your weapon jams up because of the harsh environments we have to call home there . An 18B weapons sergeant was shot in the face due directly to his weapon jamming . I just can ’ t believe that after things like this happen , the Army is still buying more M4s . Soldiers ’ lives are on the line . Why is it a hassle to make an improvement that could save lives ? The M4 isn ’ t a bad weapon ; it just needs improvements . It ’ s about time people stop fighting to keep things the same and start moving toward a better weapon system . ”
Green Berets have a method to prevent a “ Wanat ” from happening : They upgrade the rifle themselves .
Senior Warrant Officer Russton B. Kramer , a 20-year Green Beret , said he realized during training that the M4 was subject to malfunctions . Shells would not extract . Overheating . The gun got too dirty .
“ It ’ s a maintenance queen , ” he said . “ It ’ s an incredibly finicky gun . You have to run it with the right amount of lubrication . You have to keep it clean . You ’ ve got to be kind of delicate with it to make it function right . ”
But he never experienced jamming in battle because he took precautions — by performing unauthorized upgrades on the gun himself .
Senior Warrant Officer Kramer recalled the five-day battle of Operation Siege Engine . The military dropped five Special Forces teams into Afghanistan ’ s Helmand province in 2008 to take down a Taliban opium lab . While one group destroyed components , the others defended a perimeter against waves of Taliban .
“ I don ’ t have time to perform maintenance , ” he said . “ I don ’ t have time to pull back to a safe perimeter and clean my gun . I may not have time to pull a little bottle of oil out of my pocket and fix my gun .
“ If we don ’ t make these changes to our guns out there , I don ’ t feel like it ’ s going to be a reliable weapon , ” he added .
Gen. Scales said he wants to see a debate in Washington on “ Why does the world ’ s greatest superpower have less capable small arms than the enemy ? For whatever reasons , we are perfectly happy to give soldiers and Marines crappy small arms and not pay any attention to it . ”
Mr. Coburn tried to spark such a debate . He sent letters , gave interviews and delayed Pentagon appointments — all over the M4 . The Army appeared to be on the edge of moving toward a more advanced carbine .
To find the next light , short-barreled rifle , the Army started a grand shootout in 2011 pitting some of the world ’ s most renowned rifle makers : Colt , which designed the M4 , along with Beretta , Fabrique Nationale , Adcor Defense , Heckler & Koch , Remington and Lewis Machine & Tool .
By March 2103 , the Army got a blunt warning from the Pentagon ’ s top fraud and waste investigator . Lynne Halbrooks , principal deputy inspector general , told a House panel that the Army could not guarantee the gun would be any better than the M4 . She also said the service wanted to buy thousands of new rifles as its soldier force was shrinking .
The Army apparently got the message . When the smoke cleared in June , it scheduled a press conference to update the competition . The winner : no one . The M4 remained the champ , by default .
After the Army called off the competition , the Defense Department inspector general scolded the Army again — this time in a written report — for conducting the shootout . It said the service ’ s 2009 small-arms assessment did not identify a need for a new carbine , just an improved one .
“ The final report stated that none of the solutions for meeting small-unit effectiveness , lethality , and survivability start with replacing the M4 , ” the report said . “ As a result , the Army wasted $ 14 million on a competition to identify a source to supply new carbines it does not need . ”
In the end , Mr. Coburn , who declined to be interviewed for this report , did not get soldiers a new gun . But he did prod the Pentagon to improve what it had .
“ The senator fought a long battle to get the soldiers a better gun , ” said Mr. Traudt . “ The Army is powerful . It can close bases and send jobs elsewhere . ”","Second of two parts. Read first part here.

A former Army historian who chronicled the infamous Battle of Wanat in Afghanistan, where nine U.S. soldiers died after their M4 carbines jammed, tells The Washington Times that his official account was altered by higher-ups to absolve the weapons and senior officers.

M4 critics have long pointed to the Afghanistan battle on July 13, 2008, as evidence that the rifle’s design was flawed. They cite reports from soldiers on the ground that their guns overheated and jammed that day.

“This, not weapons maintenance deficiencies or inherent weaknesses in weapons design, was the reason a number of weapons jammed during the battle,” the sentence read.

Higher-ups inside Army command edited that sentence into the history, the report’s author says.

“That was not my conclusion,” said Douglas R. Cubbison, a former Army artillery officer and principal Wanat history author. “That was the Combat Studies Institute management that was driven from the chief of staff’s office to modify findings of that report to basically CYA [cover your ass] for the Army. You know how that works.

“Other soldiers have informally told me of similar problems they had with the M4 at high rates of fire,” said Mr. Cubbison, who is now curator of the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum.

Higher-ups made other changes, such as removing much of the historian’s criticism of senior officers for not better preparing the outpost for an attack.

“The Army tried to manipulate that study after it was basically done. They significantly changed things to a classic CYA,” Mr. Cubbison said.

Lt. Col. James Lowe, a spokesman at Fort Leavenworth, said the Army sticks by the changes it has made.

“The way that our studies are done, it’s a staff process,” he said. “And they disagreed with some of his conclusions about the weapons, and they firmly believe that the analysis supports what’s actually in the report.”

Mr. Cubbison said the history spoke for itself and did not need changes by managers.

“It was also not the assessment of numerous soldiers at Wanat,” he said.

Unlike Desert Storm, a war fought mostly with planes and armor, counterinsurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan put rifles to the ultimate test in a series of fire fights, year in, year out, making the M4 the soldier’s most important weapon.

Failure in the heat of battle

The history recounts in detail the day a Taliban force assaulted a combat outpost in Wanat in the Nuristan province of northeastern Afghanistan. Manned by 49 U.S. soldiers, including 40 paratroopers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, the outpost sat in a bowl surrounded by mountains from which the soldiers predicted in homemade videos that they would be attacked one day like sitting ducks.

Staff Sgt. Erich Phillips, a seasoned combatant who had been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, burned out three M4s trying to defend a mortar position.

“In particular, the M4s experienced difficulty maintaining such a rate after the barrels got excessively hot. When that occurred, the weapons would jam, as happened to Phillips,” the history said.

These soldiers were experiencing the types of weapon failures found by testers in 2001 and 2002.

“Six years later, we can’t fix a known problem in the middle of a war,” Mr. Cubbison told The Times.

Spc. Chris McKaig told of firing from a crow’s nest as a comrade, its only other inhabitant, was gunned down.

“My weapon was overheating,” he said. “I had shot about 12 magazines by this point already and it had only been about a half-hour or so into the fight. I couldn’t charge my weapon and put another round in because it was too hot, so I got mad and threw my weapon down.”

The historians wrote that “most of the weapons that jammed at Wanat were M4 carbines.”

Still, they concluded it was not the M4’s fault.

In the official Army history, the full management edit — not performed by the authors — reads: “The M4 was the basic individual weapon carried by U.S. Soldiers in Afghanistan and was not designed to fire at the maximum or cyclic rate for extended periods. Enemy action and weapons dispositions forced the defenders to use their M4s in uncharacteristic roles. This, not weapons maintenance deficiencies or inherent weaknesses in weapons design, was the reason a number of weapons jammed during the battle.”

Rescinded punishments

Scott Traudt, a small-arms specialist whose company, Green Mountain Defense Industries, is manufacturing its own assault rifle, called the finding a whitewash.

“Fielding a battle rifle whose barrel blows up in sustained fire after only 490 rounds is criminal negligence,” he said. “[The] weapons failed because they were designed around some arbitrary, ‘average’ combat situation by somebody oblivious to the present and future high consumptive, mobile, asymmetric wars and insurgencies we face.”

Mr. Cubbison said there was talk inside and outside the Army that the soldiers were to blame for not maintaining their M4s.

“I can tell you, I guarantee you, weapons were cleaned in that platoon,” he said. “I’ve talked to just about every guy who was there. They knew it was a bad location. They expected to get hit and get hit hard. Nobody was going to neglect weapons maintenance when they’re expecting to be in the soup at any moment. Weapons cleaning wasn’t an issue.”

Mr. Cubbison said he has a contact inside a small-arms unit of Program Executive Office Soldier, the Army command that equips warriors.

“I know that those guys have done a lot of work on reviewing and evaluating the weapon and trying to figure out what the problem is with it,” he said.

Retired Army Col. David Brostrom lost his son, 1st Lt. Jonathan Brostrom, that day in Wanat village. After reading early post-action reports, he became convinced those soldiers were let down by superiors who failed to take basic steps to protect the outpost and heed intelligence reports. He pushed for further investigation, which led to an extensive U.S. Central Command report in June 2010.

Col. Brostrom says today he should have pushed the inquiry to focus more attention on performance of the M4.

“Maybe it was my mistake. I didn’t focus on the jamming,” he said. “I knew about the gun, and I knew it wasn’t great. It took a lot of fire discipline among your soldiers to keep the gun working.

“Because they were so close to the enemy, some were just sticking their weapons above the sandbags and spraying and praying. Putting the weapons on automatic and letting it go.

“A little bit of dirt in that thing, it won’t sustain that high rate of fire at all. The barrel gets hot and everything melts in the dang thing. They were firing their weapons trying to save their lives and just about everything jammed.”

Magazine malfunctions

Col. Brostrom said he does not know whether some M4s jammed after limited fire while others quit after rapid automatic rounds. He does know that by the time his son made his way to the outpost under intense fire, virtually all the weapons had shut down. A corporal had no working gun when Lt. Brostrom arrived.

The corporal “jumped down to the lower step and tried to go after them with his bare hands. They shot him point-blank in the chest,” he said.

The Taliban shot his son multiple times.

“I know now if the weapons were better and they would not have jammed, there would be more soldiers alive, maybe even my son,” Col. Brostrom said.

Chief Warrant Officer Tyler Stafford knew the M4 had drawbacks months before a wave of rocket-propelled grenades hit the Wanat outpost that day.

Then-Spc. Stafford had experienced two gunbattles during which his M4 jammed because of what he considers a substandard 30-round magazine.

He contends that, while Army higher-ups say soldiers pushed the carbines beyond their firing capacity that day and burned out the barrels, faulty magazines could be the culprit in some of the stoppages.

“The Army never looked at the type of magazines that were used,” he said. “That’s what we found would cause a lot of failures. If you used the standard old Army tin magazines that had been used in a couple of deployments, they really wore down and would cause a lot of jams just because of failure to feed and the springs were worn out in them.

“They just don’t get replaced readily, and when they do, they still get replaced by a standard-issue magazine that just isn’t a very good magazine at all.”

To improve the M4 on the run, Chief Warrant Officer Stafford said, “A lot of us went out and bought our own magazines. They worked far better.”

Defending the carbine

Chief Warrant Officer Stafford has left the gritty job of infantryman for the world of Army aviation, flying AH-64 Apache helicopters.

Since the 2008 battle, he took the time to research the M4’s history — the spotty tests, the soldier surveys, the attempts to improve it — and compared the data with his own experiences.

His assessment: “It is my personal belief that the M4 is a substandard front-line weapon and lacks the reliability and firepower that many infantrymen are in need of.

“Everybody’s biggest problem with the M4 is that it’s such a high-maintenance weapon, that continually you have to keep it very, very clean, very well-oiled,” he said. “In the infantry world, that’s tough to do, especially when you’re living in the dirt and fighting every other day.”

Whatever the internal discussions, the Army has defended the rifle in public for more than a decade.

Lt. Col. Donald Peters, a spokesman at the Pentagon, said the service has made 41 improvements since 2001 that were among 90 engineering changes to the M4 and commando M4A1 since the gun was in development in the early 1990s.

The plan now is to revamp M4s into higher-performance M4A1s beginning this winter.

“The M4A1 the Army is currently producing has a slightly heavier barrel than the M4, which increases the weapons system’s ability to withstand heat and therefore gives it a greater sustained rate of fire,” Col. Peters said. “The M4A1 also has full auto capability and more consistent trigger pull, along with ambidextrous fire control.”

The Army often cites surveys to defend the M4. It questions every unit that returns from combat and finds that eight out of 10 like the gun.

The Center for Naval Analysis found the same results in a 2006 independent survey of 2,600 soldiers who had been in Afghanistan and Iraq.

But soldiers did complain about a lack of lethality. One of the major gripes was from retired Army Maj. Gen. Robert Scales, a highly decorated artillery officer.

Perhaps more important, 20 percent reported that the M4 had jammed during a firefight. Of those, 18 percent said the stoppage had a “large impact” in battle.

Put to the test

Gen. Scales said the problem with such surveys is that they do not focus on the soldiers who engaged in the most intense combat during which the M4 is fired and relied on the most.

“The people who use the M4 seriously, the close-combat soldiers, when they use it seriously for a Wanat, their vote is the same in these surveys as the kid who is a computer operator at Camp Victory,” he said. “So when you lump it all together, the whole thing seems to be perfectly fine.”

As for Chief Warrant Officer Stafford’s firsthand experience with M4 magazines, Gen. Scales said: “If my son were in the infantry, for his birthday I would buy him about 50 [German] Heckler and Koch magazines, not just for him, but for his buds. Why do we die for a dollar-and-seventy-cent item when a fighter plane costs $550 million?”

Exactly one year after Wanat, the Army began fielding what it said was an improved M4 magazine.

The survey numbers on jamming alarmed Mr. Coburn. He took on a large group of Army supporters — its huge following of lawmakers and staffers in Congress and retired top brass who sit on the boards of various munitions manufacturers — to advocate a better rifle.

By December 2007, the Army was testing the M4 against competitors at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.

The competition matched the M4 against three European-designed assault rifles, all firing 6,000 rounds in sandstorm conditions. The three interlopers recorded 233 or fewer stoppages. The M4 racked up more than three times as many: 882, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The Army and manufacturer Colt Defense LLC later said the M4 had much fewer shutdowns and blamed the high count on M4s that were not combat-ready.

Next came the Army’s most extensive M4 review to date: a small-arms capabilities-based assessment. By January 2009, the Army was telling Congress that its rifles and machine guns, including the M4, had 25 “capability gaps,” including a need for greater lethality and for a gun that did not need constant cleaning and lubrication — in other words, what critics had been saying about the M4.

With the report completed, the Army embarked on a major M4 upgrade, though it contended the gun’s basic design remained sound.

Critics persisted. One was Sgt. Charles Perales, at the time stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C.

He wrote a letter published in Defense News:

“My unit — B Company, 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment — was deployed to Afghanistan from April 2005 to March 2006. While there, we were attached to Special Forces at Camp Tillman on the Afghan border. I saw first-hand what happens when your weapon jams up because of the harsh environments we have to call home there. An 18B weapons sergeant was shot in the face due directly to his weapon jamming. I just can’t believe that after things like this happen, the Army is still buying more M4s. Soldiers’ lives are on the line. Why is it a hassle to make an improvement that could save lives? The M4 isn’t a bad weapon; it just needs improvements. It’s about time people stop fighting to keep things the same and start moving toward a better weapon system.”

After the shootout

Green Berets have a method to prevent a “Wanat” from happening: They upgrade the rifle themselves.

Senior Warrant Officer Russton B. Kramer, a 20-year Green Beret, said he realized during training that the M4 was subject to malfunctions. Shells would not extract. Overheating. The gun got too dirty.

“It’s a maintenance queen,” he said. “It’s an incredibly finicky gun. You have to run it with the right amount of lubrication. You have to keep it clean. You’ve got to be kind of delicate with it to make it function right.”

But he never experienced jamming in battle because he took precautions — by performing unauthorized upgrades on the gun himself.

Senior Warrant Officer Kramer recalled the five-day battle of Operation Siege Engine. The military dropped five Special Forces teams into Afghanistan’s Helmand province in 2008 to take down a Taliban opium lab. While one group destroyed components, the others defended a perimeter against waves of Taliban.

“I don’t have time to perform maintenance,” he said. “I don’t have time to pull back to a safe perimeter and clean my gun. I may not have time to pull a little bottle of oil out of my pocket and fix my gun.

“If we don’t make these changes to our guns out there, I don’t feel like it’s going to be a reliable weapon,” he added.

Gen. Scales said he wants to see a debate in Washington on “Why does the world’s greatest superpower have less capable small arms than the enemy? For whatever reasons, we are perfectly happy to give soldiers and Marines crappy small arms and not pay any attention to it.”

Mr. Coburn tried to spark such a debate. He sent letters, gave interviews and delayed Pentagon appointments — all over the M4. The Army appeared to be on the edge of moving toward a more advanced carbine.

To find the next light, short-barreled rifle, the Army started a grand shootout in 2011 pitting some of the world’s most renowned rifle makers: Colt, which designed the M4, along with Beretta, Fabrique Nationale, Adcor Defense, Heckler & Koch, Remington and Lewis Machine & Tool.

By March 2103, the Army got a blunt warning from the Pentagon’s top fraud and waste investigator. Lynne Halbrooks, principal deputy inspector general, told a House panel that the Army could not guarantee the gun would be any better than the M4. She also said the service wanted to buy thousands of new rifles as its soldier force was shrinking.

The Army apparently got the message. When the smoke cleared in June, it scheduled a press conference to update the competition. The winner: no one. The M4 remained the champ, by default.

After the Army called off the competition, the Defense Department inspector general scolded the Army again — this time in a written report — for conducting the shootout. It said the service’s 2009 small-arms assessment did not identify a need for a new carbine, just an improved one.

“The final report stated that none of the solutions for meeting small-unit effectiveness, lethality, and survivability start with replacing the M4,” the report said. “As a result, the Army wasted $14 million on a competition to identify a source to supply new carbines it does not need.”

In the end, Mr. Coburn, who declined to be interviewed for this report, did not get soldiers a new gun. But he did prod the Pentagon to improve what it had.

“The senator fought a long battle to get the soldiers a better gun,” said Mr. Traudt. “The Army is powerful. It can close bases and send jobs elsewhere.”

In the case of Afghanistan , hundreds of insiders offered blunt criticism of how the US became mired in almost two decades of warfare , offering a mix of pent-up grievances , frustrations and confessions , as well as second-guessing and backbiting .
“ We were devoid of a fundamental understanding of Afghanistan — we didn ’ t know what we were doing , ” Douglas Lute , a three-star Army general who was the White House ’ s Afghan war czar during the Bush and Obama administrations , told government interviewers in 2015 .

Since 2001 , more than 775,000 American service members have deployed to Afghanistan . Of those , 2,300 were killed and 20,589 were wounded in action , according to the Defense Department .
US officials acknowledged in the interviews that their military strategies were fatally flawed and that Washington wasted huge amounts of money trying to remake Afghanistan into a modern nation .
They also shed light on the US government ’ s failed attempts to curtail runaway corruption , build a functional Afghan army and police force , and control Afghanistan ’ s lucrative opium trade .
Thought the costs incurred in the war in Afghanistan are staggering , the US government has not carried out a comprehensive accounting of how much it has spent , the report said .
The Defense Department , State Department and US Agency for International Development have spent or allocated between $ 934 billion and $ 978 billion , according to an inflation-adjusted estimate from Neta Crawford , co-director of the Costs of War Project at Brown University .
“ What did we get for this $ 1 trillion effort ? Was it worth $ 1 trillion ? ” Jeffrey Eggers , a retired Navy SEAL and White House staffer for Bush and Obama , told interviewers .
“ After the killing of Osama bin Laden , I said that Osama was probably laughing in his watery grave considering how much we have spent on Afghanistan , ” he added .
The documents also contradict the longstanding narrative from US presidents , military commanders and diplomats who assured the public that they were making progress in Afghanistan and that the war was worth fighting .
Several of the interviewees described efforts by government and military officials to deliberately mislead the public , distorting statistics to make it appear the US was winning the war when it was not .
“ Every data point was altered to present the best picture possible , ” Bob Crowley , a US Army colonel who served as a senior counterinsurgency adviser in 2013 and 2014 , told the government interviewers .
“ Surveys , for instance , were totally unreliable but reinforced that everything we were doing was right and we became a self-licking ice cream cone , ” he said .
John Sopko , head of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction , which conducted the interviews , told the newspaper that the documents demonstrate “ the American people have constantly been lied to ” on Afghanistan .
The agency , known as SIGAR , was created by Congress in 2008 to investigate waste and fraud in the war zone .
In 2014 , SIGAR conducted more than 600 interviews for an initiative titled “ Lessons Learned , ” an $ 11 million project that was meant to diagnose policy failures in Afghanistan so the US would not repeat the errors the next time it invaded a country .
Most of the interviewees were Americans , but SIGAR officials also traveled to London , Brussels and Berlin to interview NATO allies . They also interviewed about 20 Afghan officials , discussing reconstruction and development programs in the country .
The Washington Post said it had to sue SIGAR twice in federal court to forces it to release the documents .
The agency eventually disclosed more than 2,000 pages of unpublished notes and transcripts from 428 of the interviews , in addition to several audio recordings .
The documents identify 62 of the interviewees , but SIGAR blacked out the names of 366 others , arguing that those people should be seen as whistleblowers and informants whose identities should be protected .
Sopko , the inspector general , told the paper that he did not suppress the scathing criticisms and doubts about the war that officials mentioned in the interviews .
He said it took his office three years to release the materials because he has a small staff and because other federal agencies had to review the documents to prevent government secrets from being released .
“ We didn ’ t sit on it , ” he insisted . “ We ’ re firm believers in openness and transparency , but we ’ ve got to follow the law . … I think of any inspector general , I ’ ve probably been the most forthcoming on information . ”","Senior US officials failed to tell the truth about the war in Afghanistan throughout the 18-year campaign — and hid evidence that it was unwinnable, according to a damning report by the Washington Post.

Since 2001, more than 775,000 American service members have deployed to Afghanistan. Of those, 2,300 were killed and 20,589 were wounded in action, according to the Defense Department.

US officials acknowledged in the interviews that their military strategies were fatally flawed and that Washington wasted huge amounts of money trying to remake Afghanistan into a modern nation.

They also shed light on the US government’s failed attempts to curtail runaway corruption, build a functional Afghan army and police force, and control Afghanistan’s lucrative opium trade.

Thought the costs incurred in the war in Afghanistan are staggering, the US government has not carried out a comprehensive accounting of how much it has spent, the report said.

The Defense Department, State Department and US Agency for International Development have spent or allocated between $934 billion and $978 billion, according to an inflation-adjusted estimate from Neta Crawford, co-director of the Costs of War Project at Brown University.

“What did we get for this $1 trillion effort? Was it worth $1 trillion?” Jeffrey Eggers, a retired Navy SEAL and White House staffer for Bush and Obama, told interviewers.

“After the killing of Osama bin Laden, I said that Osama was probably laughing in his watery grave considering how much we have spent on Afghanistan,” he added.

The documents also contradict the longstanding narrative from US presidents, military commanders and diplomats who assured the public that they were making progress in Afghanistan and that the war was worth fighting.

Several of the interviewees described efforts by government and military officials to deliberately mislead the public, distorting statistics to make it appear the US was winning the war when it was not.

“Every data point was altered to present the best picture possible,” Bob Crowley, a US Army colonel who served as a senior counterinsurgency adviser in 2013 and 2014, told the government interviewers.

“Surveys, for instance, were totally unreliable but reinforced that everything we were doing was right and we became a self-licking ice cream cone,” he said.

John Sopko, head of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which conducted the interviews, told the newspaper that the documents demonstrate “the American people have constantly been lied to” on Afghanistan.

The agency, known as SIGAR, was created by Congress in 2008 to investigate waste and fraud in the war zone.

In 2014, SIGAR conducted more than 600 interviews for an initiative titled “Lessons Learned,” an $11 million project that was meant to diagnose policy failures in Afghanistan so the US would not repeat the errors the next time it invaded a country.

Most of the interviewees were Americans, but SIGAR officials also traveled to London, Brussels and Berlin to interview NATO allies. They also interviewed about 20 Afghan officials, discussing reconstruction and development programs in the country.

The Washington Post said it had to sue SIGAR twice in federal court to forces it to release the documents.

The agency eventually disclosed more than 2,000 pages of unpublished notes and transcripts from 428 of the interviews, in addition to several audio recordings.

The documents identify 62 of the interviewees, but SIGAR blacked out the names of 366 others, arguing that those people should be seen as whistleblowers and informants whose identities should be protected.

Sopko, the inspector general, told the paper that he did not suppress the scathing criticisms and doubts about the war that officials mentioned in the interviews.

He said it took his office three years to release the materials because he has a small staff and because other federal agencies had to review the documents to prevent government secrets from being released.

“We didn’t sit on it,” he insisted. “We’re firm believers in openness and transparency, but we’ve got to follow the law. … I think of any inspector general, I’ve probably been the most forthcoming on information.”",www.nypost.com,right,ewMBZG2fINuEpcAB

Consultants told the military that , by now , California would be flooded by inland seas , The Hague would be unlivable , polar ice would be mostly gone in summer , and global temperatures would rise at an accelerated rate as high as 0.5 degrees a year .
Yet the 2003 report , “ An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security , ” is credited with kick-starting the movement that , to this day and perhaps with more vigor than ever , links climate change to national security .
The report also became gospel to climate change doomsayers , who predicted pervasive and more intense hurricanes , tornadoes , floods and droughts .
“ The release of this report is what likely sparked the ‘ modern era ’ of security interest in climate affairs , ” said Jeff Kueter , president of the George C. Marshall Institute , a nonprofit that examines scientific issues that affect public policy .

“ I think it did have an impact , for sure , in getting people talking and seeing the connection , which at that time was harder for some people than it is today , ” said Mr. Randall , who heads the consulting firm Monitor 360 .
Some critics say such alarmist reports are causing the Pentagon to shift money that could be used for weapons and readiness . It is making big investments in biofuels , for example , and is working climate change into high-level strategic planning .
There is no exact budget line for climate change . The Government Accountability Office in 2011 documented a big increase in federal spending , from $ 4.6 billion in 2003 to nearly $ 9 billion in 2010 .

“ The president ’ s misguided priorities with our national security can be seen in the $ 1 trillion defense cuts he has put into motion since taking office and then using the limited defense budget to support his green agenda , ” Mr. Inhofe said in a statement to The ███ . “ His green spending in the defense budget is based on the belief that climate change is the ‘ new weapon of mass destruction. ’ In the meantime the president has loosened sanctions on Iran , [ which ] has maintained their resources to develop and launch a nuclear weapon — the real weapon of mass destruction . ”
The 2003 report was produced by a consulting firm , then called the Global Business Network , for the Pentagon ’ s office of net assessment . It is a driving force to allocate money to counter global threats — in this case , climate change .
Under the section “ Warming up to 2010 , ” here are some of the report ’ s key scenarios , compared with what has transpired :
• By 2005 , “ more severe storms and typhoons bring about higher storm surges and floods . ”
Today : The most recent U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report said it has “ low confidence ” of an increase in hurricanes or tornadoes . The U.S. is likely experiencing fewer tornadoes compared with 50 years ago , according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . This year ’ s tornado season was historically low .
The U.N. report said : “ No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms , hurricanes and major hurricane counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin . ”
In December , Roger Pielke , a scientist who has conducted extensive analysis of storm history , told a Senate panel : “ There exists exceedingly little scientific support for claims found in the media and political debate that hurricanes , tornadoes , floods and droughts have increased in frequency or intensity on climate timescales either in the United States or globally . ”
The U.S. has not experienced a major hurricane in nearly 10 years .
• Global temperatures will increase by 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit per decade and , in some areas , 0.5 degrees per year .
Today : Scientists skeptical of man-made climate change say satellite data show there has been no increase in 17 years . The Environmental Protection Agency , a strong climate change advocate , puts the decade increase at 0.3 degrees .
• There will be more floods , making coastal cities such as The Hague “ unlivable ” by 2007 .
The United Nations said this year : “ There continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale . ”
• “ Floating ice in the northern polar seas is mostly gone during the summer by 2010 . ”
Today : Arctic sea ice remains . Warming in the polar region has reduced the ice extent , from 2.8 million square miles at its yearly summer minimum in 1979 , when satellite measuring began , to 2.1 million square miles in 2013 , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center .
• Sacramento River levees will fail , creating “ an inland sea ” in California that “ disrupts the aqueduct system transporting water . ”
Mr. Randall ’ s consultant ’ s report called on the Department of Defense to act , calling the scenarios “ not implausible . ”
“ There appears to be general agreement in the scientific community that an extreme case like the one depicted below is not implausible , ” the report said . “ Many scientists would regard this scenario as extreme both in how soon it develops [ and ] how large , rapid and ubiquitous the climate changes are . But history tells us that sometimes the extreme cases do occur and it is DOD ’ s job to consider such scenarios . ”
Asked about his scenarios for the 2003-2010 period , Mr. Randall said in an interview : “ The report was really looking at worst-case . And when you are looking at worst-case 10 years out , you are not trying to predict precisely what ’ s going to happen but instead trying to get people to understand what could happen to motivate strategic decision-making and wake people up . But whether the actual specifics came true , of course not . That never was the main intent . ”
Skeptics say the problem with such alarmist reports is that they become the playbook for the aggressive global warming movement , which repeats the scenarios as fact . President Obama last week predicted the world will experience more intense storms more frequently , even though U.N. scientists have not found that it is happening .
Said the Marshall Institute ’ s Mr. Kueter : “ The real danger is that it bestows a sense of urgency that is not warranted and can lead to the dangerous expansion of U.S. security concerns , inappropriately applied resources and diversion of attention from more effective responses to known environmental challenges . ”
The Pentagon ’ s latest Quadrennial Defense Review , its policy paper on threats and how to deal with them , cites increased storms as a danger .
The QDR stated : “ As greenhouse gas emissions increase , sea levels are rising , average global temperatures are increasing , and severe weather patterns are accelerating . ”
The QDR said this supposed trend , coupled with “ more affluent populations and substantial economic growth will devastate homes , land and infrastructure . ”
On Tuesday , the Pentagon issued a press article with the headline , “ Climate Change Affects National Defense Decisions , Official Says . ”
It quoted Daniel Y. Chiu , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy , who told a Senate panel , “ We ’ re working to take into consideration the impacts of climate change in our longer-term planning scenarios . ”
As for the 2010-2020 decade , the Randall report says , in part : “ The effects of the drought are more devastating than the unpleasantness of temperature decreases in the agricultural and populated areas . With the persistent reduction of precipitation in these areas , lakes dry up , river flow decreases , and freshwater supply is squeezed , overwhelming available conservation options and depleting freshwater reserves . ”
The Times asked the Pentagon whether it is basing climate change spending on alarmist reports .
A spokesman said : “ The Department is incorporating consideration of likely future scenarios in planning to mitigate risk . Its responses to climate change range from the DOD Arctic Strategy — which is focused on increased engagement and stability in a region that is already seeing increased activity — to a new floodplain-management policy that directs minimization of new construction in floodplains . Even our approach to energy efficiency is focused on mission benefits and monetary savings , with carbon reductions as a side effect . ”","Ten years ago, the Pentagon paid for a climate study that put forth many scary scenarios.

Weapons Sales
The Trump administration is in discussions to end a decades-old practice of informally notifying Congress of major arms sales to foreign countries , in a move that reflects mounting tensions between the administration and Capitol Hill , officials and congressional aides tell ███ .
The proposal comes amid mounting frustration from senior administration officials over informal holds from lawmakers on arms sales to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , two close U.S. partners in the Middle East . Lawmakers have tried to block weapons sales to these countries over concerns about human rights issues and the prospect of civilian casualties , particularly with the Saudi-led coalition ’ s war against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen .
The proposal sets the stage for another potential showdown between the Trump administration and lawmakers . It comes amid broader debates on Capitol Hill over the president ’ s ability to wage war without prior congressional approval—centered on U.S. military support for the Saudi coalition in Yemen—and an ongoing congressional investigation into Trump ’ s firing of the State Department inspector general , who was probing the administration ’ s emergency arms sale to Saudi Arabia last year .
If the administration moves forward with the plan , officials and congressional aides said , it would still send formal notifications to Congress for review , giving lawmakers a legal avenue to block sales in a 30-day window of time by passing a joint resolution to oppose the arms sales . ( For close U.S. allies such as NATO members , Israel , Japan , or Australia , that window is 15 days . ) But it would eliminate a practice dating back to the 1970s of informally notifying Congress of planned arms sales well in advance , so that lawmakers and congressional staffers , the State Department , and Pentagon officials can hash out concerns and disagreements about such sales behind closed doors .
“ Putting politics aside for a moment , both sides have a bone to pick , ” said Bilal Saab , a scholar at the Middle East Institute and former Pentagon official . “ Congress doesn ’ t want to be boxed in with pre-cooked arms sales cases and the executive branch is sick and tired of holds that sometimes are made by [ congressional ] staffers … and have adverse effects on ███ and relationships with partners . ”
The United States views foreign military sales as an important diplomatic tool beyond their military value , providing an avenue to deepen ties with foreign governments around the world . President Donald Trump has also cast his efforts to boost U.S. arms sales abroad as a domestic economic boon , claiming at different points that arms sales to Saudi Arabia created anywhere from 450,000 to over “ a million ” jobs . ( An independent study from the Center for International Policy , a think tank , released in May estimated the actual total to be 20,000 to 40,000 jobs . )
While congressional aides were not surprised by the proposed move , which they said the Trump administration has been considering as far back as two years , a decision to end the informal consultation would be seen as a major slight to Capitol Hill ’ s oversight authority .
“ That would be viewed as going nuclear , ” said Juan Pachón , the communications director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ’ s top Democrat , Sen. Bob Menendez .
Current and former officials familiar with the matter say Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has grown frustrated over lengthy informal congressional holds on arms sales he sees as important for U.S. national security and would support this plan . Lower-ranking officials in the State Department and Office of the Secretary of Defense oppose the plan , these officials say , believing that it will worsen relations between the administration and Congress , and it could prompt lawmakers to enact new laws that would give them greater powers in approving arms sales .
When approached for comment , the Pentagon referred ███ to the State Department . The State Department declined to comment .
Some former U.S. officials are concerned doing away with the informal review would allow more American weapons to flood into the Gulf without proper checks and balances .
“ I ’ m concerned that this could facilitate the sale of weapons under less than ideal circumstances and could lead to an almost lackadaisical approach to selling weapons with destructive power around the world , ” said Andrew Miller , a former National Security Council director during the Obama administration and now deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy . “ They ’ re determined to continue flooding the Gulf with weapons . ”
Other current and former officials point out that there are additional avenues for Congress to get advance notice about arms sales , including in classified briefings with administration officials and the so-called Javits Report , a State Department report issued to Congress annually that lists expected sales for the year .
Saab , of the Middle East Institute , said there are other opportunities for the administration and Congress to find compromise in their growing disagreements about foreign arms sales . One compromise is to keep the 30-day peer review process but both sides commit to resolving mutual issues and grievances within that period with no holds afterwards , ” he said .
“ What it comes down to is this : this is a power play that is not inevitable . It could have been rectified with better communication and transparency on both ends . ”
The move comes as the administration has put pressure on Congress to deliver another round of precision-guided munitions to the Saudi Arabia , one congressional aide said , despite a lack of consensus on Capitol Hill that Riyadh actually needs the weapons . “ They haven ’ t finished delivering the ones from last year , ” the aide said . “ They ’ re not urgent operationally for the Saudis . ”
But over the course of the past three years , the White House has become more intent on pushing through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries , seen by the administration as an important check on its top rival in the region , Iran .
Just months into the Trump administration , then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker , a Republican , placed a hold on further clearances of U.S. weapons sales to the Gulf during the informal review period after a Saudi-led coalition of countries imposed a blockade of nearby Qatar . Meanwhile , Saudi Arabia has pursued foreign-policy objectives that have anger both Democratic and Republican lawmakers . This includes a destructive aerial campaign in Yemen that once relied upon American refueling support and the squelching of political dissent against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , after the CIA concluded the Saudi royal ordered the 2018 assassination of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi .
That administration ’ s frustrations over perceived foot-dragging on Capitol Hill came to a head last summer when the Trump administration declared an emergency to push ahead with 22 arms transfers to Saudi Arabia , the UAE , and Jordan , prompting a resolution of disapproval from Congress in a serious rebuke . Democrats began pushing back on the sale in 2018 , and earlier this year they launched an investigation into the firing of the State Department inspector general , who was reviewing the emergency sale .
Heartburn in the executive branch over that informal review process , aides said , helped contribute to the Trump administration ’ s decision to force through the sale in an unprecedented move after attacks by Iranian forces and proxies on Saudi oil facilities and tankers in the Gulf of Oman last year .
Equally concerning to some lawmakers is that the administration is sometimes using channels to grease the wheels for arms sales that aren ’ t visible to authorizers on Capitol Hill , a congressional aide said , including by private communications between Trump ’ s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman , the de-facto leader of the country .
“ That operates in the background on these things , ” the aide said . “ It was MBS ringing Kushner that really brought that stuff to a head last year . ”","Trump Mulls Ending Heads-Up to Congress on U.S. Weapons Sales

The Trump administration is in discussions to end a decades-old practice of informally notifying Congress of major arms sales to foreign countries, in a move that reflects mounting tensions between the administration and Capitol Hill, officials and congressional aides tell Foreign Policy.

“Putting politics aside for a moment, both sides have a bone to pick,” said Bilal Saab, a scholar at the Middle East Institute and former Pentagon official. “Congress doesn’t want to be boxed in with pre-cooked arms sales cases and the executive branch is sick and tired of holds that sometimes are made by [congressional] staffers … and have adverse effects on foreign policy and relationships with partners.”

The United States views foreign military sales as an important diplomatic tool beyond their military value, providing an avenue to deepen ties with foreign governments around the world. President Donald Trump has also cast his efforts to boost U.S. arms sales abroad as a domestic economic boon, claiming at different points that arms sales to Saudi Arabia created anywhere from 450,000 to over “a million” jobs. (An independent study from the Center for International Policy, a think tank, released in May estimated the actual total to be 20,000 to 40,000 jobs.)

While congressional aides were not surprised by the proposed move, which they said the Trump administration has been considering as far back as two years, a decision to end the informal consultation would be seen as a major slight to Capitol Hill’s oversight authority.

“That would be viewed as going nuclear,” said Juan Pachón, the communications director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Bob Menendez.

Current and former officials familiar with the matter say Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has grown frustrated over lengthy informal congressional holds on arms sales he sees as important for U.S. national security and would support this plan. Lower-ranking officials in the State Department and Office of the Secretary of Defense oppose the plan, these officials say, believing that it will worsen relations between the administration and Congress, and it could prompt lawmakers to enact new laws that would give them greater powers in approving arms sales.

When approached for comment, the Pentagon referred Foreign Policy to the State Department. The State Department declined to comment.

Some former U.S. officials are concerned doing away with the informal review would allow more American weapons to flood into the Gulf without proper checks and balances.

“I’m concerned that this could facilitate the sale of weapons under less than ideal circumstances and could lead to an almost lackadaisical approach to selling weapons with destructive power around the world,” said Andrew Miller, a former National Security Council director during the Obama administration and now deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “They’re determined to continue flooding the Gulf with weapons.”

Other current and former officials point out that there are additional avenues for Congress to get advance notice about arms sales, including in classified briefings with administration officials and the so-called Javits Report, a State Department report issued to Congress annually that lists expected sales for the year.

Saab, of the Middle East Institute, said there are other opportunities for the administration and Congress to find compromise in their growing disagreements about foreign arms sales. One compromise is to keep the 30-day peer review process but both sides commit to resolving mutual issues and grievances within that period with no holds afterwards,” he said.

“What it comes down to is this: this is a power play that is not inevitable. It could have been rectified with better communication and transparency on both ends.”

The move comes as the administration has put pressure on Congress to deliver another round of precision-guided munitions to the Saudi Arabia, one congressional aide said, despite a lack of consensus on Capitol Hill that Riyadh actually needs the weapons. “They haven’t finished delivering the ones from last year,” the aide said. “They’re not urgent operationally for the Saudis.”

But over the course of the past three years, the White House has become more intent on pushing through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, seen by the administration as an important check on its top rival in the region, Iran.

Just months into the Trump administration, then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, a Republican, placed a hold on further clearances of U.S. weapons sales to the Gulf during the informal review period after a Saudi-led coalition of countries imposed a blockade of nearby Qatar. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has pursued foreign-policy objectives that have anger both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. This includes a destructive aerial campaign in Yemen that once relied upon American refueling support and the squelching of political dissent against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, after the CIA concluded the Saudi royal ordered the 2018 assassination of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi.

That administration’s frustrations over perceived foot-dragging on Capitol Hill came to a head last summer when the Trump administration declared an emergency to push ahead with 22 arms transfers to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Jordan, prompting a resolution of disapproval from Congress in a serious rebuke. Democrats began pushing back on the sale in 2018, and earlier this year they launched an investigation into the firing of the State Department inspector general, who was reviewing the emergency sale.

Heartburn in the executive branch over that informal review process, aides said, helped contribute to the Trump administration’s decision to force through the sale in an unprecedented move after attacks by Iranian forces and proxies on Saudi oil facilities and tankers in the Gulf of Oman last year.

Equally concerning to some lawmakers is that the administration is sometimes using channels to grease the wheels for arms sales that aren’t visible to authorizers on Capitol Hill, a congressional aide said, including by private communications between Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman, the de-facto leader of the country.

“That operates in the background on these things,” the aide said. “It was MBS ringing Kushner that really brought that stuff to a head last year.”",www.foreignpolicy.com,center,FK6yqROZOS0Kwbqa

A small segment of society bears the burden , and the desire to collectively mourn those lost in service remains powerful . Memorial Day offers an opportunity to celebrate the perseverance of those who have endured such losses and know the real meaning of the holiday all too well .
A half century ago , a family and community gathered to honor the sacrifice of one of the more than 58,000 American soldiers killed in Vietnam . Just after Thanksgiving 1969 , Marine Sgt . Clive Garcia Jr. , who hailed from Morenci , Ariz. , tried to defuse an enemy booby-trap . But , something went wrong , and he died in the blast .
A few weeks later , on Dec. 14 , his family , friends and the Morenci community gathered at the Holy Cross Catholic Church on a dreary day where clouds barely topped the always belching smelter smokestacks . Reporters from ABC News and Time observed the funeral , tying it to five other deaths in a group of nine soldiers including Garcia who left for boot camp in July 1966 .
It was solemn affair , with tears flowing freely . Garcia ’ s parents and three siblings listened as the popular Irish-born Father Cornelius McGrenra talked about sacrifice and grief .
Soon after , at the gravesite , mourners gathered . The family laid Garcia to rest next to his friend , Robert Moncayo , whose body he had accompanied home in June 1968 . At the end , Garcia ’ s mother , Julia , sitting next to his fiancee , Susie Hibbard , rose to say : “ Thank you for being my son . Oh , my dear boy , thank you so much. ” A reporter noted : “ And so Sgt . Garcia , U.S. Marine Corps , was laid to rest in the rocky , red earth he loved so well . ”

Memorial Day is a chance not only to remember the hundreds of thousands who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country , but also their families and friends who continue to grieve . It is a significant burden to bear and Memorial Day has a special meaning for them .","Over the past 50 years, the nature of war and the composition of the military have not changed significantly, despite the ending of the draft and inclusion of women into combat roles. A small segment of society bears the burden, and the desire to collectively mourn those lost in service remains powerful. Memorial Day offers an opportunity to celebrate the perseverance of those who have endured such losses and know the real meaning of the holiday all too well.

A half century ago, a family and community gathered to honor the sacrifice of one of the more than 58,000 American soldiers killed in Vietnam. Just after Thanksgiving 1969, Marine Sgt. Clive Garcia Jr., who hailed from Morenci, Ariz., tried to defuse an enemy booby-trap. But, something went wrong, and he died in the blast.

A few weeks later, on Dec. 14, his family, friends and the Morenci community gathered at the Holy Cross Catholic Church on a dreary day where clouds barely topped the always belching smelter smokestacks. Reporters from ABC News and Time observed the funeral, tying it to five other deaths in a group of nine soldiers including Garcia who left for boot camp in July 1966.

It was solemn affair, with tears flowing freely. Garcia’s parents and three siblings listened as the popular Irish-born Father Cornelius McGrenra talked about sacrifice and grief.

Soon after, at the gravesite, mourners gathered. The family laid Garcia to rest next to his friend, Robert Moncayo, whose body he had accompanied home in June 1968. At the end, Garcia’s mother, Julia, sitting next to his fiancee, Susie Hibbard, rose to say: “Thank you for being my son. Oh, my dear boy, thank you so much.” A reporter noted: “And so Sgt. Garcia, U.S. Marine Corps, was laid to rest in the rocky, red earth he loved so well.”

The following day, Julia Garcia sat down for an interview with ABC, talking about Garcia and his friends who also died in Vietnam. She concluded: “I thank God for lending him to me. I had him so long, 22 years, and now God wants him back.”

After the public scrutiny ended, Garcia’s loss never left his family or friends. Morenci erected memorials to him and his friends who joined together, including one outside the new high school built in the 1980s.

But, he and the others remained frozen in time while family and friends aged. In particular, the three who returned from the group bore survivor’s guilt, trying to understand why they survived when their friends did not. Holidays were especially hard, and even 51 years later, a mix of pride blended with the sorrow of loss.

Garcia’s death was far from unique in American history as highlighted by his name’s place on the Vietnam Memorial (Panel 16W, Line 124) with so many thousands of others.

Trump also tweeted last week , “ Just spoke to Gov . Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. “
It is the responsibility of state and local leaders to ensure that adequate law enforcement resources , including the National Guard where necessary , are deployed on the streets to reestablish law and order . … Federal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest and are engaged in violations of federal law .
Since the military is supposed to fight international conflicts and not be engaged in domestic law enforcement , the use of federal troops has been rare . However , it has happened under several presidents , not just Abraham Lincoln , who had to use the military to stop a full-scale rebellion .
Both Presidents George H.W . and George W. Bush , respectively invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 , sent federal troops to respond to emergencies . President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the act to have federal troops enforce federal civil rights laws . Before that , Presidents Herbert Hoover and Woodrow Wilson used federal troops to respond to emergencies .
Two laws deal primarily with federal troops in domestic matters , according to the Congressional Research Service .
Under the Insurrection Act of 1807 , Congress delegated authority to the president to call the military during an insurrection or civil disturbance . Under one provision of the law , a president can use the military to suppress an insurrection at the request of a state government in order to protect states against “ domestic violence . ”
After the passage of the 14th Amendment , another provision was added to the Insurrection Act that allows the president to use the military without the consent of a state government to suppress any “ insurrection , domestic violence , unlawful combination , or conspiracy . ”
This is only if state law enforcement is unable to protect citizens and the criminal conduct “ obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws . ”
This section was enacted to implement the 14th Amendment , which gave citizenship and other legal rights to African Americans , and does not require a request from or even the permission of the governor of the affected state .
The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 further defined but didn ’ t supplant the Insurrection Act . The law was enacted as post-Civil War reconstruction was winding down in the south , and outlawed the use of the military for law enforcement .
This law made it illegal for civilian law enforcement to use military investigators , prohibits use of the military if it “ pervades the activities ” of the civilian officials and prohibits subjecting citizens to military power that is “ regulatory , prescriptive , or compulsory in nature . ”
After the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , President George W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to place armed soldiers throughout U.S. airports .
His father , President George H.W . Bush , used the insurrection law to send federal troops to Los Angeles in 1992 to restore order in the city after the riots that erupted after a jury acquitted police officers who were caught on camera beating up Rodney King , an African American .
The elder Bush also sent federal troops to St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands , at the request of the territorial government , in 1989 to restore order from civil unrest after Hurricane Hugo .
Among the most dramatic events occurred in 1957 when Arkansas ’ Democrat Gov . Orval Faubus tried to face down Republican President Dwight Eisenhower over desegregation of schools .
In 1957 , the Little Rock , Arkansas , school board voted to comply with the Supreme Court ’ s ruling from three years earlier to desegregate schools . Nine black high school students tried to attend the all-white Central High School in Little Rock .
Faubus announced days before the school year was to begin he would send the National Guard to prevent the black students from entering . The students that became known as the “ Little Rock Nine ” were denied entry to the school by the National Guard troops , who were under state command .
Eisenhower initially sought to defuse the matter peacefully and made what he thought was an agreement with Faubus—the Guard troops at the school to maintain order while keeping the black students safe . Faubus instead removed the Guard troops and put the state police at the school to keep the students out .
In late September , about 1,000 whites formed outside the school and a riot ensued .
So , Eisenhower issued Executive Order 10730 that specifically noted the provision of the Insurrection Act that allows federal troops to take action in lieu of a request from the state government . Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and then sent the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock to quell the riots .
In a televised address , Eisenhower said , “ Our enemies are gloating over this incident and using it everywhere to misrepresent our nation . … Mob rule can not be allowed to override the decisions of the courts . ”
Finally , on Sept. 25 , 1957 , the “ Little Rock Nine ” attended Central High for their first full day of classes , this time protected by the Arkansas National Guard and the other federal troops . The students continued to face threats , but still attended school until the end of the school year .
The defeated Faubus retaliated in September 1958 by closing down Little Rock high schools for the year , but the high schools reopened in August 1959 after a federal court struck down the closing .
Other cases in the 20th century would include notable presidents .
In 1946 , President Harry Truman , a Democrat , sent federal troops to act against striking railroad workers .
In 1932 , an already unpopular Republican President Herbert Hoover sent U.S. troops to disperse a group of 20,000 World War I veterans in the Washington Mall . The unemployed veterans were seeking bonus payments from Congress , and it became known as the “ Bonus March . ”

It is the responsibility of state and local leaders to ensure that adequate law enforcement resources, including the National Guard where necessary, are deployed on the streets to reestablish law and order. … Federal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest and are engaged in violations of federal law.

( ███ ) - U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl on Friday was spared prison for endangering his comrades in arms when he deserted in Afghanistan in 2009 , a sentence swiftly condemned by President Donald Trump , who while seeking election had called for his execution .
“ The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military , ” Trump posted on Twitter from Air Force One as he flew to Asia at the start of a lengthy tour of the region .
A military judge recommended that Bergdahl should be dishonorably discharged from the service , demoted to private and forfeit $ 10,000 in pay . Army Colonel Jeffery Nance took less than a minute to render his decision and made no other comment .
Bergdahl was captured eight years ago by the Taliban after walking off his combat outpost . He endured torture and malnutrition while held prisoner by the insurgent group for nearly five years . His case sparked a national debate over whether he was a victim or a villain .
The soldier , who had pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy , faced a maximum term of life in prison .
Late Friday morning , the 31-year-old Hailey , Idaho , native trembled as he waited to hear his punishment in a courtroom in Fort Bragg , North Carolina .
Defense lawyers , who had urged Nance to show leniency , said after sentencing that Bergdahl was relieved and eager to move on , though they would not discuss his plans . Bergdahl has remained on active duty at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas .
“ This has been a terrible ordeal , ” said one of his lawyers , Eugene Fidell .
Neither Bergdahl nor prosecutors , who had sought a 14-year prison term , commented .
Soldiers who testified about the hardships and injuries suffered in the hunt for Bergdahl after he walked off his post in Paktika province in June 2009 without permission said they were disappointed by the sentence .
“ It ’ s definitely a slap in the face , ” former Army Specialist Jonathan Morita said in a phone interview . Morita ’ s right hand was mangled by a rocket-propelled grenade during a July 2009 raid seeking intelligence on Bergdahl ’ s whereabouts .

(Reuters) - U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl on Friday was spared prison for endangering his comrades in arms when he deserted in Afghanistan in 2009, a sentence swiftly condemned by President Donald Trump, who while seeking election had called for his execution.

“The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,” Trump posted on Twitter from Air Force One as he flew to Asia at the start of a lengthy tour of the region.

A military judge recommended that Bergdahl should be dishonorably discharged from the service, demoted to private and forfeit $10,000 in pay. Army Colonel Jeffery Nance took less than a minute to render his decision and made no other comment.

Bergdahl was captured eight years ago by the Taliban after walking off his combat outpost. He endured torture and malnutrition while held prisoner by the insurgent group for nearly five years. His case sparked a national debate over whether he was a victim or a villain.

The soldier, who had pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, faced a maximum term of life in prison.

Late Friday morning, the 31-year-old Hailey, Idaho, native trembled as he waited to hear his punishment in a courtroom in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Defense lawyers, who had urged Nance to show leniency, said after sentencing that Bergdahl was relieved and eager to move on, though they would not discuss his plans. Bergdahl has remained on active duty at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.

“This has been a terrible ordeal,” said one of his lawyers, Eugene Fidell.

Neither Bergdahl nor prosecutors, who had sought a 14-year prison term, commented.

Soldiers who testified about the hardships and injuries suffered in the hunt for Bergdahl after he walked off his post in Paktika province in June 2009 without permission said they were disappointed by the sentence.

“It’s definitely a slap in the face,” former Army Specialist Jonathan Morita said in a phone interview. Morita’s right hand was mangled by a rocket-propelled grenade during a July 2009 raid seeking intelligence on Bergdahl’s whereabouts.

Along with criticism over the years from U.S. political leaders and fellow soldiers over the dangerous searches prompted by Bergdahl’s actions, the conditions of his release sparked controversy.

In May 2014, Bergdahl was handed over to U.S. special operations troops in Afghanistan in exchange for five Taliban detainees, who were released from the Guantanamo Bay prison and flown to Qatar.

Last year, as a Republican presidential candidate, Trump called Bergdahl “a no-good traitor who should have been executed.”

Responding to a defense motion on Trump’s comments, Colonel Nance ruled they had not influenced him nor affected Bergdahl’s chances of a fair sentence. However, the judge said he would consider them a mitigating factor.

Defense attorney Fidell said on Friday that Americans should be offended by Trump’s behavior.

“President Trump’s unprincipled effort to stoke a lynch-mob atmosphere while seeking our nation’s highest office has cast a dark cloud over the case,” he said.

A dishonorable discharge, issued for the most serious offenses, cuts off all military and veterans benefits, including healthcare from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

That could pose difficulties for Bergdahl, who, according to testimony, suffered significant nerve damage while a Taliban prisoner and has several mental health conditions.

His punishment must be approved by the commanding general of the U.S. Army Forces Command and then will automatically be reviewed on appeal. The discharge will not take effect until an appellate court affirms Bergdahl’s conviction and sentence.

Two portraits of Bergdahl emerged during the sentencing proceedings.

Defense lawyers said he was a young, hardworking soldier who did not understand the full consequences of his actions when he left to report what he said were problems in his unit.

Bergdahl apologized in court this week for the pain he caused fellow service members and admitted he had made “a horrible mistake.”

But prosecutors said Bergdahl knew he would trigger alarm in the war zone. They acknowledged he suffered during his years as a Taliban prisoner, but argued it resulted from his choices and did not diminish the harm he caused others.

Iranian-backed militants have ended a day-long siege of the American embassy in Baghdad following an order from their militia organisation , but the struggle between the US and Iran for influence in Iraq looked set to intensify further in 2020 .
The US defence secretary , Mark Esper , announced that 750 airborne troops would be deployed to the region immediately , with more to follow in the next few days .

The US said the strikes were in retaliation for last week ’ s killing of an American contractor , and the wounding of several US soldiers , in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base , the latest of a string of attacks which the US blamed on the militia .
US officials expressed dismay that Iraqi security forces had made no effort to stop the militiamen and their supporters from entering Baghdad ’ s Green Zone and approaching the US embassy .

The US Navy has said it will re-establish its Second Fleet, as Russia becomes more assertive.

Chief of Naval Operations Adm John Richardson said the fleet, disbanded in 2011, would oversee forces on the US East Coast and North Atlantic.

He said the National Defense Strategy, published earlier this year, made it clear that the era of great power competition had returned.

The strategy makes countering Russia and China a priority.

The fleet, which was disbanded for cost-saving and structural reasons, will be based in its previous home - Norfolk, Virginia.

""Our National Defense Strategy makes clear that we're back in an era of great power competition as the security environment continues to grow more challenging and complex,"" Adm Richardson said in an announcement on board the USS George H W Bush at Norfolk.

Response to Russia

By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent

The re-establishment of the US Second Fleet is part of a wider strategy of re-orientating the US armed forces towards a world of renewed big power competition and away from the counter-insurgency campaigns they have been fighting over recent decades.

In this case the focus is Russia - a response to its stepped up naval activity of recent years. The new headquarters will give more coherent command arrangements for US warships operating in the Atlantic.

Nato is also planning to set up a new Joint Forces Command covering much the same region - the Americans have offered to host this in Norfolk, Virginia.

The existing pattern of US naval operations is also due to change significantly. US Defence Secretary James Mattis insists that he wants less predictable deployments, of shorter duration. Experts say a carrier strike group is likely to be deployed more frequently in European waters.

Adm Richardson added that the fleet would ""exercise operational and administrative authority over assigned ships, aircraft and landing forces"".

The headquarters staff would begin with just 15 personnel, increasing to more than 200.

It has not yet been decided who will command the fleet and what assets it will include.

Norfolk has also been proposed as a host for the new Nato Joint Force Command for the Atlantic.

Nato officials say Russia has increased naval patrols in the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic and the Arctic, and its submarine activity is at its highest level since the Cold War.

Relations between Russia and the West have deteriorated in recent months amid allegations of Russian meddling in US elections, Moscow's support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal, for which the UK blames Russia.

Because that predator is going to go assault someone else , '' McSally told O'Donnell .
During Wednesday 's hearing , McSally said she did not report the crime at the time because she did not trust the system , saying she felt ashamed and confused . She did not name the officer who she said raped her .
`` I stayed silent for many years , but later in my career , as the military grappled with the scandals , and their wholly inadequate responses , I felt the need to let some people know I too was a survivor , '' she said , choking up as she detailed what had happened to her . `` I was horrified at how my attempt to share generally my experiences was handled . I almost separated from the Air Force at 18 years of service over my despair . Like many victims , I felt like the system was raping me all over again . ''
McSally 's revelation comes soon after Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa detailed her own abuse and assault , and at a time of increased awareness of harassment and assault in the armed forces . Reports of sexual assaults across the military jumped nearly 10 percent in 2017 — a year that also saw an online nude-photo sharing scandal rock the Defense Department .
McSally said she shares in the disgust of the failures of the military system and many commanders who have failed to address the problems of sexual misconduct . She said the public must demand that higher-ranking officials be part of the solution .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky addressed McSally 's testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill , calling her experience `` terrible . '' He said he would be open to `` whatever policy prescriptions Sen. McSally or Sen. Ernst may come up with . ''
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also responded to McSally 's story .
`` I just saw the headline , I know that had to be tough and I hope that it helps other people , '' he told reporters on Capitol Hill .

McSally said she shares in the disgust of the failures of the military system and many commanders who have failed to address the problems of sexual misconduct. She said the public must demand that higher-ranking officials be part of the solution.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky addressed McSally's testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill, calling her experience ""terrible."" He said he would be open to ""whatever policy prescriptions Sen. McSally or Sen. Ernst may come up with.""

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also responded to McSally's story.

""I just saw the headline, I know that had to be tough and I hope that it helps other people,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill.

McSally retired as a full colonel in the Air Force in 2014, was deployed six times to the Middle East and Afghanistan, and clocked 325 combat hours, according to her Senate website bio. That earned her a Bronze star and six air medals.

McSally's office released her prepared remarks at Wednesday's hearing:",www.cbsnews.com,left,Hs14eprjHZ3tCOLR

In addition , instructions now tell commanders that collateral damage “ must not be excessive ” in relation to mission goals , according to Public Intelligence , a nonprofit research group that analyzed the military ’ s directives on drone strikes .
“ These subtle but important changes in wording provide insight into the military ’ s attempts to limit expectations in regards to minimizing collateral damage and predicting the lethal effects of military operations , ” Public Intelligence said in a recent report .
The number of civilian casualties caused by U.S. drone strikes is a point of contention among Washington , human rights groups and countries where strikes are conducted , chiefly Afghanistan , Pakistan , Libya , Yemen and Somalia .

Public Intelligence conducted a word-for-word analysis of an instructional document from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff titled “ No-Strike and the Collateral Damage Estimate Methodology , ” which was provided to the American Civil Liberties Union in 2009 , and a version of the document that was updated in October 2012 . The ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the 2009 version , which is posted on its website .
The 2009 version directs military personnel to take reasonable precautions to ensure that civilians are not targeted in attacks ; the 2012 version says service members should “ avoid targeting ” civilians .
“ A requirement to ‘ ensure ’ that civilians are not the subject of attacks is changed to an admonishment to ‘ avoid targeting ’ civilians , ” Mr. Haynes said .
Moreover , commanders had been instructed to “ consider the military necessity for attacking the target , proportionality of the means planned , and reasonableness within the framework of operational objectives. ” The modified language tells leaders that collateral damage “ must not be excessive ” in relation to mission objectives .
What ’ s more , the updated version adds a paragraph that says the process for estimating collateral damage outlined in the document “ does not account for secondary explosions ” caused by the strike , such as of a weapons cache or fuel tank , because those explosions “ can not be consistently measured or predicted . ”
“ The section does say that commanders should be ‘ cognizant of the risks ’ from secondary explosions , but this is fairly weak wording and does not imply necessary compliance , ” Mr. Haynes said .
The earlier version also defines “ collateral concern ” as objects that are “ not considered lawful military targets ” under the Law of Armed Conflict . The updated version defines the term as objects “ located inside the collateral hazard area . ”
The guidance applies only to military drone strikes and not necessarily to those carried out by the CIA , although the military and the CIA work together on some drone operations .
Citing an increase in drone operations last year in Libya , Air Force officials said the number of military drone strikes in 2013 is expected to be lower than in 2012 . Officials said military drones last year led to or helped ground troops kill and/or capture more than 1,850 enemy combatants .
Officials declined to specify how many enemy combatants were killed or captured . Pentagon statistics show that 361 Hellfire missiles and six 500-pound laser-guided bombs were fired in 2012 . In 2011 , 432 Hellfire missiles and 19 500-pound laser-guided bombs were fired .

More On This...

The U.S. Office of Inspector General is investigating the allegations, which come amid problems at other VA hospitals across the country. Patients are being forced to wait weeks and months to see doctors, and in some cases, dying before their appointments. In the past year, VA facilities in South Carolina, Florida, Georgia and Washington state have been linked to delays in patient care or poor oversight.

Also on Thursday, Miller pressed Shinseki to provide a date for when a so-called “interim list” concerning patients was allegedly destroyed, while also asking why the VA did not issue an order prohibiting the destruction of documents until more than a week after a Congressional request.

“I would like to know why it took so long to issue the directive given my public request at a Congressional hearing, the formal request letter to you, and most importantly, the explosive nature of the allegations regarding the deaths of veterans while waiting for care,” he wrote.

The absence of White House action on the suspected bounty program or even engagement on it with Russia at any level is troubling to some . Katrina Mulligan , a former official in the National Security Council , questions why such explosive information about Russian activity would have been kept from the president .
Some say the episode points to a debilitating lack of U.S. consensus over Russia , allowing its longtime ideological and geopolitical adversary to exploit those divisions to achieve its goals . Others say a consensus is , in fact , in place across the U.S. government – everywhere but at the very top .
President Donald Trump has had very little to say about reports Russia was paying a bounty to the Taliban to kill U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan , other than that he was never briefed on the issue . White House officials do not deny that the intelligence reached the Oval Office , but say it was not confirmed and so was not discussed directly with the president .
In early May a classified CIA update for officers across U.S. intelligence agencies and others with security clearance reportedly cited evidence of a Russian program suspected of paying Taliban-linked militias to kill American and coalition troops in Afghanistan .
The military and intelligence agencies were investigating whether the bounty program might have played a part in an April 2019 roadside bombing near Bagram Air Base in which three Marine reservists were killed . The United States had evidence – in the form of a half-million dollars in cash found in a Seal Team 6 raid of a Taliban hideout – that bounties had already been paid .
And intelligence from captured Taliban fighters spurred the U.S. to investigate a funding channel connecting money handlers in Afghanistan with sources in Russia .
Information on the alleged Russian bounty program had already been included in a President ’ s Daily Brief , or PDB , in late February , according to reporting this week in The New York Times .
But the inclusion of Russia ’ s bounty plan more than two months later in the CIA update , called the Wire , is raising questions among some former intelligence officers and national security experts : Was it just bureaucratic issues that caused the delay ? Did new and better sourcing materialize over those two months to warrant the broader dissemination ?
And why was the CIA , which compiles the Wire , acting at that point to disseminate something of such gravity to a broader audience ?
Moreover , the wider dissemination of information on the bounty program along with the hints of sharp differences over it between the Trump administration and parts of the intelligence community reflect what some say is a debilitating lack of consensus in the U.S. government on Russia .

For Mr. Putin , who aims to reassert Russia as a global power , damaging U.S. standing in and commitment to regions where American and Russian interests collide – Eastern Europe , Central Asia , the Middle East , and Afghanistan – remains a top priority .
But others say that a broad consensus on Russia that goes back to the Cold War is , in fact , still in place – everywhere but at the very top .
“ There is actually a fairly large consensus about the challenge Russia poses and the way the U.S. should respond , and I would say that consensus stretches from the intelligence community and many national security officials to much of Congress , ” says Andrea Kendall-Taylor , a former deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia in the National Intelligence Council .

Susan Walsh/AP/File President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk to participate in a group photo at the G20 summit in Osaka , Japan , June 28 , 2019 . The administration has careered between President Trump 's attempts to curry favor and friendship with Mr. Putin and longstanding deep-seated concerns over his intentions .
Some of the House Republicans who were invited to the White House Monday to be briefed on the Russian bounty program intelligence suggested they were not fully satisfied with the explanations they received . They also hinted at a higher degree of alarm over Russian activities , specifically in Afghanistan , than what they have seen emanating from the administration .
“ It has been clear for some time that Russia does not wish us well in Afghanistan , ” two of those Republicans – Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Mac Thornberry of Texas – said in a joint statement following the briefing . “ We believe it is important to vigorously pursue any information related to Russia or any other country targeting our forces . ”
The two prominent hawks said they “ remain concerned about Russian activity in Afghanistan , including reports that they have targeted U.S. forces , ” and said they expect the administration to promptly provide Congress with additional information on the alleged Russian program .
Some Democrats and national security analysts more critical of the administration note that over recent months during which the White House has known about the suspected Russian bounty plan , President Trump has not only refrained from challenging Russia over its activities but has gone out of his way in the other direction . He is known to have had at least four phone conversations with Mr. Putin since late February .
Over that time Mr. Trump has pushed ( ultimately unsuccessfully ) for the G7 group of most advanced economies to readmit Russia to the elite club . He has also taken everyone by surprise , including Germany , by announcing an imminent reduction in U.S. troops stationed in Germany .
Russia has said very little about the suspected bounty program , but officials have seized on the fact that the U.S. never raised it with them to cast the reporting ’ s veracity in doubt . Dmitry Peskov , a spokesman for Mr. Putin , told NBC News Monday that not only were the reports incorrect , but that “ none of the American representatives have ever raised this question ” with their Russian counterparts .
The White House is doubling down on the fact that there was not unanimity on the bounty program ’ s existence across intelligence agencies to explain why it was not taken up directly with the president .
“ There was not a consensus among the intelligence community , ” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday . “ And , in fact , there were dissenting opinions within the intelligence community , and it would not be elevated to the president until it was verified . ”
This left Representative Thornberry stupefied and irate that something “ with even a hint of veracity ” concerning the security of U.S. troops would not be taken to the president .
Indeed former officials with experience in highest-level intelligence briefings say “ dissenting opinions ” would not be a reason to keep information from the president , though the existence of varying assessments would be shared .

“ Dissent has a proud tradition in the intelligence community , and it is protected , ” says Mr. Cardillo . If he were presenting the president with intelligence that another agency wanted to dissent from , that dissent would be presented to the president , he says .
“ The president ’ s staff has to make decisions with or without perfect information , ” says Ms. Mulligan . Waiting for “ consensus , ” particularly when the lives of U.S. service members are involved , she adds , is not an option .","A lack of consensus across intelligence agencies “was never a reason to not tell the president something of this magnitude,” she says. “I really wonder about what motivated people [in the White House] not to prioritize this with the president.”

Question of consensus

Moreover, the wider dissemination of information on the bounty program along with the hints of sharp differences over it between the Trump administration and parts of the intelligence community reflect what some say is a debilitating lack of consensus in the U.S. government on Russia.

As the U.S. squabbles over how to handle relations with America’s longtime ideological and geopolitical adversary, these voices caution, Vladimir Putin is cannily exploiting the divisions to further his goals vis-a-vis the U.S. Those include weakening America’s democratic system and exacerbating social divisions.

A pattern concerning Russia

Still, the absence of White House action on the suspected bounty program or even engagement on it with Russia at any level confirms what some see as a pattern of unwillingness to take to the president any evidence of nefarious Russian activity toward the U.S.

Others who have been directly involved in preparing the PDB agree, finding it unfathomable that such information involving force protection and vulnerability would not have reached the commander-in-chief.

“This [intelligence] reporting is so inflammatory and so egregious, it is incomprehensible to me that senior people wouldn’t bring this to the attention of the president,” says Robert Cardillo, a former deputy director of National Intelligence for Intelligence Integration and a PDB briefer to President Obama.

“It’s even more incomprehensible,” he adds, “that no action would have been taken in response.”

Susan Walsh/AP/File President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk to participate in a group photo at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28, 2019. The administration has careered between President Trump's attempts to curry favor and friendship with Mr. Putin and longstanding deep-seated concerns over his intentions.

Some of the House Republicans who were invited to the White House Monday to be briefed on the Russian bounty program intelligence suggested they were not fully satisfied with the explanations they received. They also hinted at a higher degree of alarm over Russian activities, specifically in Afghanistan, than what they have seen emanating from the administration.

“It has been clear for some time that Russia does not wish us well in Afghanistan,” two of those Republicans – Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Mac Thornberry of Texas – said in a joint statement following the briefing. “We believe it is important to vigorously pursue any information related to Russia or any other country targeting our forces.”

The two prominent hawks said they “remain concerned about Russian activity in Afghanistan, including reports that they have targeted U.S. forces,” and said they expect the administration to promptly provide Congress with additional information on the alleged Russian program.

Trump-Putin phone calls

Some Democrats and national security analysts more critical of the administration note that over recent months during which the White House has known about the suspected Russian bounty plan, President Trump has not only refrained from challenging Russia over its activities but has gone out of his way in the other direction. He is known to have had at least four phone conversations with Mr. Putin since late February.

Over that time Mr. Trump has pushed (ultimately unsuccessfully) for the G7 group of most advanced economies to readmit Russia to the elite club. He has also taken everyone by surprise, including Germany, by announcing an imminent reduction in U.S. troops stationed in Germany.

Russia has said very little about the suspected bounty program, but officials have seized on the fact that the U.S. never raised it with them to cast the reporting’s veracity in doubt. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, told NBC News Monday that not only were the reports incorrect, but that “none of the American representatives have ever raised this question” with their Russian counterparts.

The White House is doubling down on the fact that there was not unanimity on the bounty program’s existence across intelligence agencies to explain why it was not taken up directly with the president.

“There was not a consensus among the intelligence community,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday. “And, in fact, there were dissenting opinions within the intelligence community, and it would not be elevated to the president until it was verified.”

This left Representative Thornberry stupefied and irate that something “with even a hint of veracity” concerning the security of U.S. troops would not be taken to the president.

Indeed former officials with experience in highest-level intelligence briefings say “dissenting opinions” would not be a reason to keep information from the president, though the existence of varying assessments would be shared.

“Dissent has a proud tradition in the intelligence community, and it is protected,” says Mr. Cardillo. If he were presenting the president with intelligence that another agency wanted to dissent from, that dissent would be presented to the president, he says.

“The president’s staff has to make decisions with or without perfect information,” says Ms. Mulligan. Waiting for “consensus,” particularly when the lives of U.S. service members are involved, she adds, is not an option.",www.csmonitor.com,center,lyWha2Dh2viJN0S7

As the Army , Navy and other services contend with a thriving economy and a directive to expand their ranks , there is a growing debate over whether the military should consider lowering the minimum enlistment age from 17 to 16 . More than a dozen countries , including the United Kingdom , already have adopted the policy .
Critics say the idea is deeply flawed and presents a host of societal problems , but supporters argue that the Pentagon needs to think outside the box if it wants to continually overcome one of the toughest recruiting environments in decades .

Mr. McCarthy also has advised military commands on how to better target recruits .
“ Currently , of the 75 % of 17- to 24-year-olds who are ineligible to serve , for example , 10 % are ineligible due to criminal records , ” he wrote in a recent piece for the Military Times . “ And , according to the Department of Justice , there are twice as many arrests of 18- to 20-year-olds as there are arrests of 15- to 17-year-olds . ”
Mr. McCarthy ’ s argument touched off a firestorm , with skeptics saying the move could create more problems than it would solve . Peter Warren Singer , a senior fellow at the Washington think tank New America , countered that lowering the enlistment age to 16 would undermine combat effectiveness and unit cohesion and create other problems .
Mr. Singer , author of the book “ Children at War , ” also said the very idea shows a “ misunderstanding [ of ] the different brain chemistry of youths and their ability to make informed judgment ” and would destroy “ the day-to-day lives of the poor drill instructors and commanders of these teens ’ first unit . ”

In the U.S. , analysts say , there is a lack of data about the issue and it ’ s unclear exactly what effects military services would encounter if they begin admitting younger teens .
“ I think the broader answer about all of this is we really don ’ t know , ” said Beth J. Asch , a senior economist at the Rand Corp. who studies military recruiting . “ There ’ s no current research on what the effects would be , how would it expand the market , their qualifications .

Like other analysts , Ms. Asch said she believes the idea of signing up 16-year-olds has been off the table for decades and remains so today .
But the discussion underscores the armed forces ’ systemic recruiting challenges .
Last year , the Army fell short of its recruiting goal for the first time in a decade . The Army had set a goal of 76,500 recruits and pulled in just under 70,000 , according to Defense Department figures .
The Army and all other branches of the military expect to meet this year ’ s targets , but officials readily acknowledge that the recruiting environment is as difficult as ever , largely because of a soaring economy , a consistently low unemployment rate and more economic opportunities in the private sector for young Americans who otherwise might consider military service .
Analysts say that recruiting 16-year-olds doesn ’ t seem to be the right solution , but they stress that the military can and must improve its outreach to younger teenagers .

The military has taken serious steps in recent years to increase its visibility and engagement in the nation ’ s communities .

Trump made the decision on Syria abruptly last week, against the advice of top aides and commanders, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, who resigned the next day.

Trump said he had told his advisers, “let’s get out of Syria,” but was persuaded to stay, before deciding last week to bring the 2,000 troops home.

“I think a lot of people are going to come around to my way of thinking. It’s time for us to start using our head,” the president told reporters at the Al Asad Air Base west of Baghdad where he and first lady Melania Trump spent a little more than three hours on the ground with U.S. troops.

The base, in Anbar province, became one of the most important bases for U.S. Marines after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Since U.S. forces returned to Iraq in 2014, the base has played an important role in the fight against Islamic State because of its location.

Trump said the United States would remain in Iraq, adding, “In fact, we could use this as the base if we wanted to do something in Syria.”

Reuters reported last week that the Pentagon was considering using special operations teams to target Islamic State militants in Syria, based out of Iraq.

At the time, officials said a final decision had not been made and the option was being considered.

While in Iraq, Trump indicated he would not rush to nominate a new secretary to replace Mattis, the first defense chief in decades to resign over policy differences with the president.

President Donald Trump visited U.S. troops in Iraq for the first time during his presidency, the White House said Wednesday, after he came under criticism for not going earlier and during a tumultuous period for his national security team.

“President Trump and the First Lady traveled to Iraq late on Christmas night to visit with our troops and Senior Military leadership to thank them for their service, their success, and their sacrifice and to wish them a Merry Christmas,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted.

The president had been hinting for weeks that he would soon visit U.S. troops in a combat theater. The trip to Al Asad Air Base, which the White House kept quiet until after the president spoke to troops, comes days after Trump ordered a full withdrawal of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria and pushed for halving the 14,000-strong U.S. military contingent in Afghanistan.

“We’re no longer the suckers, folks,” Trump said during remarks at the base, according to a pool report. “We’re respected again as a nation.”

Trump said he would not withdraw troops from Iraq, The Associated Press reported, although he said the Islamic State militant group is “very nearly defeated. He added that if there is a resurgence by the group, troops in Iraq would be able to combat it.

The president and first lady Melania Trump spent three hours visiting with troops, where he took selfies and signed autographs, according to the pool report.

""Melania and I were honored to visit our incredible troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.!"" he tweeted after the visit. Trump planned to make one additional stop before returning to the U.S. Friday, the White House told reporters, though they didn’t name the location.

The trip comes as the national security establishment is going through a particularly chaotic period.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who sent Trump his resignation letter after failing to persuade the president to reverse course on the Syria pullout, is on the job for just a few more days. He remained in D.C. as the president made his trip. His deputy, former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan, takes over as acting Defense secretary on Jan. 1.

President Trump , in a conference call Monday with the nation 's governors , threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order unless states hit by days of unrest `` put down '' violent demonstrations , urging leaders to `` dominate '' lawbreakers or risk looking like `` a bunch of jerks . ''
The upbraiding from the White House did n't sit well with many governors , who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck .
Trump took a tough line with the governors , saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response . The president said the White House was `` strongly looking for arrests . ''
`` You have to arrest people and you have to try people . And they have to go to jail for long periods of time , '' the president said .
`` If people are running amok , you have to dominate . If you are n't dominating , you 're wasting your time , '' he said . `` They 're going to run over you ; you 're going to look like a bunch of jerks . ''
`` It 's a movement . If you do n't put it down , it will get worse and worse , '' Trump said . `` The only time it 's successful is when you 're weak and most of you are weak . ''
The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest .
`` If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents , then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them , '' he said .
In the nation 's capital , where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers , military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House , Trump said he was already `` dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers , military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting , looting , vandalism , assaults and the wanton destruction of property . ''
While some governors , such as South Carolina 's Henry McMaster , a Republican , praised Trump 's calls for a crackdown , others took umbrage at the president 's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states .
During the conference call , Illinois Gov . J.B. Pritzker , a Democrat , warned the president that the `` rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse , '' to which Trump snapped back , `` I do n't like your rhetoric that much either . ''
`` I had to speak up , and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters , that it 's making things worse , and that we need to call for police reform , '' Pritzker told NPR 's Morning Edition on Tuesday . `` We need to call for calm , that that 's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard . ''
`` He unfortunately — you know , '' the governor added , `` he reacted badly . ''
`` The governor of a state has to ask for federal help . I do n't know any governor that intends to do that , '' he said . `` And secondly , you know , you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator , as if he 's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way . ''
In Michigan , where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful , Gov . Gretchen Whitmer , a Democrat , called the president 's remarks `` dangerous '' and said they should be `` gravely concerning to all Americans . ''
The president 's comments , she said , `` send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division , which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction . ''
`` We must reject this way of thinking . This is a moment that calls for empathy , humanity , and unity , '' Whitmer said in a statement . `` This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation 's history , but as Americans , we must remember our enemy is racial injustice , not one another . ''
The Republican governor of Massachusetts , Charlie Baker , said he was n't surprised by the president 's `` incendiary words . ''
`` At so many times during these last several weeks , when the country needed compassion and leadership the most , it simply was nowhere to be found , '' he said following the phone call with Trump .
`` Instead , we got bitterness , combativeness and self-interest . That 's not what we need in Boston , it 's not what we need right now in Massachusetts , '' he said as his voice cracked with emotion , `` and it 's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either . ''
Washington Gov . Jay Inslee , a Democrat , called the president 's remarks the `` rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism . ''
On the subject of the deploying of federal troops , Democratic New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying , `` Thank you , but no thank you . ''
`` He wants to make this about looting because he does n't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd , '' Cuomo said . `` [ He ] does n't want to really talk about racism and discrimination . ''
Beshear says he was not on the call with President Trump this morning , but instead was talking with Tamika Palmer , Breonna Taylor 's mother .
Trump reportedly urged governors to crack down on protesters , saying `` you have to dominate , '' per @ CBSNews account of obtained audio . — Marcus Green ( @ MarcusGreenWDRB ) June 1 , 2020
Kentucky Democratic Gov . Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president . Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor , a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant .
The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota 's Tim Walz , who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement .
But at another point in the call , Trump called Minnesota `` a laughingstock all over the world . ''
Walz said Monday that he responded by saying : `` No one 's laughing here . We 're in pain . We 're crying . We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust , social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them .

""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak.""

The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest.

""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said.

In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property.""

While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states.

During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either.""

""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard.""

""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly.""

Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal.""

""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way.""

In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans.""

The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction.""

""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another.""

The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words.""

""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump.

""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either.""

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.""

On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you.""

""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination.""

Beshear says he was not on the call with President Trump this morning, but instead was talking with Tamika Palmer, Breonna Taylor's mother.



Trump reportedly urged governors to crack down on protesters, saying ""you have to dominate,"" per @CBSNews account of obtained audio. — Marcus Green (@MarcusGreenWDRB) June 1, 2020

Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant.

The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement.

But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world.""

Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

As I stepped out of a decrepit office building into a perfect sunny day , a member of my team started talking into his radio . “ Say that again , ” he said . “ There ’ s an American soldier missing ? ”
There was . His name was Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl , the only prisoner of war in the Afghan theater of operations . His release from Taliban custody on May 31 marks the end of a nearly five-year-old story for the soldiers of his unit , the 1st Battalion , 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment . I served in the same battalion in Afghanistan and participated in the attempts to retrieve him throughout the summer of 2009 . After we redeployed , every member of my brigade combat team received an order that we were not allowed to discuss what happened to Bergdahl for fear of endangering him . He is safe , and now it is time to speak the truth .
And that the truth is : Bergdahl was a deserter , and soldiers from his own unit died trying to track him down .
On the night prior to his capture , Bergdahl pulled guard duty at OP Mest , a small outpost about two hours south of the provincial capitol . The base resembled a wagon circle of armored vehicles with some razor wire strung around them . A guard tower sat high up on a nearby hill , but the outpost itself was no fortress . Besides the tower , the only hard structure that I saw in July 2009 was a plywood shed filled with bottled water . Soldiers either slept in poncho tents or inside their vehicles .
The next morning , Bergdahl failed to show for the morning roll call . The soldiers in 2nd Platoon , Blackfoot Company discovered his rifle , helmet , body armor and web gear in a neat stack . He had , however , taken his compass . His fellow soldiers later mentioned his stated desire to walk from Afghanistan to India .
The ███ ’ s Christopher Dickey later wrote that `` [ w ] hether Bergdahl…just walked away from his base or was lagging behind on a patrol at the time of his capture remains an open and fiercely debated question. ” Not to me and the members of my unit . Make no mistake : Bergdahl did not `` lag behind on a patrol , ” as was cited in news reports at the time . There was no patrol that night . Bergdahl was relieved from guard duty , and instead of going to sleep , he fled the outpost on foot . He deserted . I ’ ve talked to members of Bergdahl ’ s platoon—including the last Americans to see him before his capture . I ’ ve reviewed the relevant documents . That ’ s what happened .
Our deployment was hectic and intense in the initial months , but no one could have predicted that a soldier would simply wander off . Looking back on those first 12 weeks , our slice of the war in the vicinity of Sharana resembles a perfectly still snow-globe—a diorama in miniature of all the dust-coated outposts , treeless brown mountains and adobe castles in Paktika province—and between June 25 and June 30 , all the forces of nature conspired to turn it over and shake it . On June 25 , we suffered our battalion ’ s first fatality , a platoon leader named First Lieutenant Brian Bradshaw . Five days later , Bergdahl walked away .
His disappearance translated into daily search missions across the entire Afghanistan theater of operations , particularly ours . The combat platoons in our battalion spent the next month on daily helicopter-insertion search missions ( called `` air assaults ” ) trying to scour villages for signs of him . Each operations would send multiple platoons and every enabler available in pursuit : radio intercept teams , military working dogs , professional anthropologists used as intelligence gathering teams , Afghan sources in disguise . They would be out for at least 24 hours . I know of some who were on mission for 10 days at a stretch . In July , the temperature was well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit each day .
These cobbled-together units ’ task was to search villages one after another . They often took rifle and mortar fire from insurgents , or perhaps just angry locals . They intermittently received resupply from soot-coated Mi-17s piloted by Russian contractors , many of whom were Soviet veterans of Afghanistan . It was hard , dirty and dangerous work . The searches enraged the local civilian population and derailed the counterinsurgency operations taking place at the time . At every juncture I remember the soldiers involved asking why we were burning so much gasoline trying to find a guy who had abandoned his unit in the first place . The war was already absurd and quixotic , but the hunt for Bergdahl was even more infuriating because it was all the result of some kid doing something unnecessary by his own volition .
On July 4 , 2009 , a human wave of insurgents attacked the joint U.S./Afghan outpost at Zerok . It was in east Paktika province , the domain of our sister infantry battalion ( 3rd Battalion , 509th Infantry ) . Two Americans died and many more received wounds . Hundreds of insurgents attacked and were only repelled by teams of Apache helicopters . Zerok was very close to the Pakistan border , which put it into the same category as outposts now infamous—places like COP Keating or Wanat , places where insurgents could mass on the Pakistani side and then try to overwhelm the outnumbered defenders .
One of my close friends was the company executive officer for the unit at Zerok . He is a mild-mannered and generous guy , not the kind of person prone to fits of pique or rage . But , in his opinion , the attack would not have happened had his company received its normal complement of intelligence aircraft : drones , planes , and the like . Instead , every intelligence aircraft available in theater had received new instructions : find Bergdahl . My friend blames Bergdahl for his soldiers ’ deaths . I know that he is not alone , and that this was not the only instance of it . His soldiers ’ names were Private First Class Aaron Fairbairn and Private First Class Justin Casillas .
Though the 2009 Afghan presidential election slowed the search for Bergdahl , it did not stop it . Our battalion suffered six fatalities in a three-week period . On August 18 , an IED killed Private First Class Morris Walker and Staff Sergeant Clayton Bowen during a reconnaissance mission . On August 26 , while conducting a search for a Taliban shadow sub-governor supposedly affiliated with Bergdahl ’ s captors , Staff Sergeant Kurt Curtiss was shot in the face and killed . On September 4 , during a patrol to a village near the area in which Bergdahl vanished , an insurgent ambush killed Second Lieutenant Darryn Andrews and gravely wounded Private First Class Matthew Martinek , who died of his wounds a week later . On September 5 , while conducting a foot movement toward a village also thought affiliated with Bergdahl ’ s captors , Staff Sergeant Michael Murphrey stepped on an improvised land mine . He died the next day .
It is important to name all these names . For the veterans of the units that lost these men , Bergdahl ’ s capture and the subsequent hunt for him will forever tie to their memories , and to a time in their lives that will define them as people . He has finally returned . Those men will never have the opportunity .
Bergdahl was not the first American soldier in modern history to walk away blindly . As I write this in Seoul , I 'm about 40 miles from where an American sergeant defected to North Korea in 1965 . Charles Robert Jenkins later admitted that he was terrified of being sent to Vietnam , so he got drunk and wandered off on a patrol . He was finally released in 2004 , after almost 40 hellish years of brutal internment . The Army court-martialed him , sentencing him to 30 days ' confinement and a dishonorable discharge . He now lives peacefully with his wife in Japan—they met in captivity in North Korea , where they were both forced to teach foreign languages to DPRK agents . His desertion barely warranted a comment , but he was not hailed as a hero . He was met with sympathy and humanity , and he was allowed to live his life , but he had to answer for what he did .
I believe that Bergdahl also deserves sympathy , but he has much to answer for , some of which is far more damning than simply having walked off . Many have suffered because of his actions : his fellow soldiers , their families , his family , the Afghan military , the unaffiliated Afghan civilians in Paktika , and none of this suffering was inevitable . None of it had to happen . Therefore , while I ’ m pleased that he ’ s safe , I believe there is an explanation due . Reprimanding him might yield horrible press for the Army , making our longest war even less popular than it is today . Retrieving him at least reminds soldiers that we will never abandon them to their fates , right or wrong . In light of the propaganda value , I do not expect the Department of Defense to punish Bergdahl .
He ’ s lucky to have survived . I once saw an insurgent cellphone video of an Afghan National Police enlistee . They had young boys hold him down , boys between the ages of 10 and 15 , all of whom giggled like they were jumping on a trampoline . The prisoner screamed and pleaded for his life . The captors cut this poor man ’ s head off . That ’ s what the Taliban and their allies do to their captives who don ’ t have the bargaining value of an American soldier . That ’ s what they do to their fellow Afghans on a regular basis . No human being deserves that treatment , or to face the threat of that treatment every day for nearly five years .
But that certainly doesn ’ t make Bergdahl a hero , and that doesn ’ t mean that the soldiers he left behind have an obligation to forgive him . I just hope that , with this news , it marks a turning point for the veterans of that mad rescue attempt . It ’ s done . Many of the soldiers from our unit have left the Army , as I have . Many have struggled greatly with life on the outside , and the implicit threat of prosecution if they spoke about Bergdahl made it much harder to explain the absurdity of it all . Our families and friends wanted to understand what we had experienced , but the Army denied us that .
I forgave Bergdahl because it was the only way to move on . I wouldn ’ t wish his fate on anyone . I hope that , in time , my comrades can make peace with him , too . That peace will look different for every person . We may have all come home , but learning to leave the war behind is not a quick or easy thing . Some will struggle with it for the rest of their lives . Some will never have the opportunity .
And Bergdahl , all I can say is this : Welcome back . I ’ m glad it 's over . There was a spot reserved for you on the return flight , but we had to leave without you , man . You ’ re probably going to have to find your own way home .","It was June 30, 2009, and I was in the city of Sharana, the capitol of Paktika province in Afghanistan.

The Marine Corps said earlier they had shifted from a search-and-rescue effort to a recovery operation , which could last several months , and had notified the next-of-kin of the three missing Marines .
“ The transition comes after teams led continuous sustained search efforts supported by aircraft and ships , ” the III Marine Expeditionary Force , based in Okinawa , Japan , said .
“ As the sea state permits , recovery efforts will be conducted to further search , assess and survey the area ... , ” they said in a statement .
The U.S. Marines have described the incident involving the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft as a “ mishap ” and said it was under investigation .
Ospreys have been involved in incidents resulting in deaths or injuries in recent years .
Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne said the Australian government would assist the U.S.-led recovery effort after what she described as an “ extensive search-and-rescue operation ” was called off .
“ Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic event and the Australian Government stands ready to support the U.S. further in any way we can , ” she said in a statement .
Payne said a Royal Australian Navy survey ship was en route to the search area . A navy diving team would be sent soon and army aviation assets were “ at short notice readiness to support any further requirements ” , she said .
Apart from the three missing Marines , 23 other personnel aboard the aircraft had been rescued . Australian emergency officials said one person had been taken to hospital in Rockhampton in northeastern Queensland state but gave no other details .

The Marine Corps said earlier they had shifted from a search-and-rescue effort to a recovery operation, which could last several months, and had notified the next-of-kin of the three missing Marines.

“The transition comes after teams led continuous sustained search efforts supported by aircraft and ships,” the III Marine Expeditionary Force, based in Okinawa, Japan, said.

“As the sea state permits, recovery efforts will be conducted to further search, assess and survey the area ...,” they said in a statement.

The U.S. Marines have described the incident involving the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft as a “mishap” and said it was under investigation.

Ospreys have been involved in incidents resulting in deaths or injuries in recent years.

Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne said the Australian government would assist the U.S.-led recovery effort after what she described as an “extensive search-and-rescue operation” was called off.

“Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic event and the Australian Government stands ready to support the U.S. further in any way we can,” she said in a statement.

Payne said a Royal Australian Navy survey ship was en route to the search area. A navy diving team would be sent soon and army aviation assets were “at short notice readiness to support any further requirements”, she said.

Apart from the three missing Marines, 23 other personnel aboard the aircraft had been rescued. Australian emergency officials said one person had been taken to hospital in Rockhampton in northeastern Queensland state but gave no other details.

“All other personnel are accounted for and safe,” the III Marine Expeditionary Force said on Twitter.

But limiting Iran ’ s influence has not been easy , given the critical role it played against the Islamic State in Iraq .

But when Ayatollah Khamenei called for “ severe revenge ” against the United States , Grand Ayatollah Sistani called on all parties “ to behave with self-restraint . ”
The divergent responses encapsulate one facet of a broader theological contest – newly rejuvenated by months of anti-government protests in Iraq – between the religious rulers of Iraq and Iran , and their two very different worldviews about the role that Shiite clerics should play in politics and daily life .
At stake , analysts note , is leadership of the world ’ s 200 million-plus Shiites . And as Iraq ’ s protests have unfolded since Oct. 1 , the pressure points between these two tectonic plates of Shiite politics are being exposed and redefined like never before .
Ayatollah Sistani articulates a more liberal interpretation that respects a secular state in Iraq . That stands in contrast to the system of absolute clerical rule in Iran , called velayat-e faqih , which is led by Ayatollah Khamenei and has dominated Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
“ He supports our desires , ” says Ali , a young Iraqi in Najaf , where Ayatollah Sistani leads a powerful Islamic seminary . The majority of Iraqis , says Ali , sitting in a protest tent hung with three posters of Ayatollah Sistani that outline his views , “ are waiting for [ his ] call . ”
To be sure , Ayatollah Sistani still wields great political influence . His authority has been on display during months of Friday prayer sermons , where his words have removed a prime minister , eased a violent crackdown that has taken some 460 lives – the worst of the violence reportedly the result of hard-line guidance from Iran – and warned against any foreign intervention in Iraq .
In the recent sermons “ we have seen more liberal , political Shiism being spelled out than in the hundred years before , ” says an Iraqi government analyst , a native of Najaf who asked not to be further identified .
“ If we are to mention a single factor that prevented a totally bloody crackdown against the protests , it would be [ Ayatollah Sistani ’ s ] Friday sermons , ” says the analyst . “ And by doing so , he has put a limit on the Iranian approach . He stopped Iraqis taking Iranian advice . ”
By contrast , in addition to their core demands for political change , Iraqi protesters have burned portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei , sacked Iranian consulates , and attacked Iran-backed Shiite parties and militia groups in their anger over Iran ’ s extensive influence .
“ We are seeing these two schools – at least the Iraqi , Sistani one – taking clearer shape , under pressure of these events , ” says the analyst . “ It seems that [ Sistani ] is shifting away even farther from velayat-e faqih into a different , yet-to-be-clearly-spelled-out Shi ’ i theory of governance , that is definitely more liberal , that does not see instructing people as one of the duties of an ayatollah . ”
Yet in the religious-political construct of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Ayatollah Khamenei is in charge of the perpetual revolution and has final say in all affairs of state . As the personification of the faqih , Ayatollah Khamenei is meant to be the official representative of the infallible 12th Shiite saint , Imam Mahdi , who disappeared centuries ago .
“ It is well-known – this is not a secret – Sistani is more on the side of tolerance and coexistence , ” says Abbas Kadhim , head of the Iraq Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington .
Hadi Mizban/AP Posters honoring Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani adorn bullet-ridden blast walls at the site of the U.S. strike that killed him . Images of revered Shiite religious figures , including Iraq 's Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani , were also put up in tribute , in Baghdad , Iraq , Jan. 16 , 2020 .
“ Khamenei and the velayat-e faqih system is [ based ] more on the exclusive claim to authority , ” says Mr. Kadhim , who is from Najaf . The Iranian system refers to Ayatollah Khamenei as the “ guardian ” of all Muslims , whether they believe they should follow him or not .
“ The only reason they tolerate other voices outside Iran is because they don ’ t have authority over those , ” says Mr. Kadhim . “ So from Sistani ’ s perspective , if velayat-e faqih takes control of Iraq , there will be no Sistani , or there will be Sistani under house arrest . ... These guys in Najaf are fighting for their own very existence . ”
The style of these towering rivals also could not be more different . Ayatollah Sistani has some 600 representatives across Iraq , and a global network beyond . He earned public reverence with careful , infrequent intervention that “ helped Iraq a great deal to save the day every time the country was about to fall apart , ” says Mr. Kadhim .
That respect has been enhanced , he says , by “ not micromanaging the daily public life of Iraqis ... because he ’ s not like what you see in Iran , or a place like Saudi Arabia ... where there is a religious police mentality . ”
In Iran , however , every public and social step is scrutinized and controlled by laws such as mandatory head-covering for women . Every aspect of politics is officially defined by devotion to velayat-e faqih , which was a marginal Shiite concept for centuries until it was put into practice four decades ago by the first leader of Iran ’ s revolution , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
Under Ayatollah Sistani ’ s leadership , the Najaf seminary “ has successfully revived a traditional approach to Shia politics as a rival to velayat-e faqih , ” writes Ali Mamouri , a former seminarian , in a September analysis for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
“ In articulating his own version ... Sistani refers explicitly to velayat-e insan ( state guardianship by the people ) , as opposed to velayat-e faqih ( guardianship of the jurist ) , ” or clerical rule , writes Mr. Mamouri .
As Iraq ’ s protests grew to become the most widespread since the U.S. invasion of 2003 toppled Saddam Hussein , there was an indirect back-and-forth dialogue between the Iranian and Iraqi Shiite schools .
When Ayatollah Khamenei instructed “ those who love Iraq ” to stamp out insecurity , for example , Ayatollah Sistani declared his stance against a violent crackdown . When Ayatollah Khamenei called the Iraqi protests a foreign-backed “ sedition ” – as Iranian officials label any anti-government protests in their own country – Ayatollah Sistani backed the protesters ’ call for change and told the government to “ recalculate ” its decision not to step down .
And clearly irritated by Iran ’ s continuing intrusions , Ayatollah Sistani in December called for the new government to be formed “ without foreign interference . ”
“ With Iran gaining influence across the region , Tehran is eager to claim moral leadership over the more than 200 million Shiites around the world , ” wrote Mr. Mamouri for the Al-Monitor website in April 2018 .
“ With Sistani pushing 90 and facing persistent rumors of ill health , Khamenei and his allies see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take over Najaf , the spiritual capital of the Shiite world , ” he wrote . “ Its most immediate impact will be felt on Iraq ’ s capacity to continue charting its own path in the shadow of the Islamic theocracy next door . ”
Boosting that capacity for Iraq has been an uphill battle for Ayatollah Sistani , despite his vast authority .
“ Let ’ s face it : The style of the Iranian leadership is the style of a state , not a religion or a religious leadership , ” says Mr. Kadhim of the Atlantic Council , noting that states have a monopoly over violence , as does the faqih in Iran .
Ayatollah Sistani , by contrast , “ does not have a claim of monopoly , or even a shared responsibility or right to use violence , ” says Mr. Kadhim . “ He is an absolutely non-violent man . He doesn ’ t believe in coercion . ”
In addition , Ayatollah Sistani has refused to meet “ hard-liners , ” such as figures close to Ayatollah Khamenei , including the Lebanese Hezbollah leader , Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah .
His attempts to integrate Iraq ’ s Iran-backed Shiite militias into the state military – against Ayatollah Khamenei ’ s express wishes – “ have limited Iranian influence , ” writes Mr. Mamouri for the Washington Institute .
Mr. Sistani has also demonstrated restraint in another way , by choosing not to turn Iraq into a clerical-run system like Iran .
“ Sistani could turn Iraq into velayat-e faqih not tomorrow , but this evening , if he wants , ” adds Mr. Kadhim . “ Yet he doesn ’ t , and that is an important distinction . Sistani ’ s lack of inclination to assume a lot of power ... deserves a lot of respect . ”
It ’ s respect he also gets from Iran , despite the dispute .
“ Khamenei respects Sistani very much . He also respects the fatwas of Sistani , even if they are against him , ” says Hisham al-Hashemi , a Baghdad-based security analyst with the European Institute of Peace . “ I know lots of Khamenei ’ s followers . They have very firm instructions not to talk [ negatively ] about Sistani in any way . ”

But for Ayatollah Sistani , limiting Iran ’ s influence has not been easy , given the critical role that Tehran played in 2014 to halt the Islamic State ’ s lightning advance , and in supporting Iraq ’ s Shiite militias .
“ Lots of Iraqis believe in Iran , therefore their beliefs oblige them to work for Iran , ” says Mr. Hashemi . “ They don ’ t believe in Iran as a geography or a neighbor , they believe in it as an Islamic Revolution , and the right for this revolution to cross borders everywhere . ”","“Lots of Iraqis believe in Iran,” says Hisham al-Hashemi, a security analyst with the European Institute of Peace. “They believe in it as an Islamic Revolution, and the right for this revolution to cross borders everywhere.”

“With Sistani pushing 90 and facing persistent rumors of ill health, Khamenei and his allies see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take over Najaf, the spiritual capital of the Shiite world,” he wrote. “Its most immediate impact will be felt on Iraq’s capacity to continue charting its own path in the shadow of the Islamic theocracy next door.”

Boosting that capacity for Iraq has been an uphill battle for Ayatollah Sistani, despite his vast authority.

“Let’s face it: The style of the Iranian leadership is the style of a state, not a religion or a religious leadership,” says Mr. Kadhim of the Atlantic Council, noting that states have a monopoly over violence, as does the faqih in Iran.

Ayatollah Sistani, by contrast, “does not have a claim of monopoly, or even a shared responsibility or right to use violence,” says Mr. Kadhim. “He is an absolutely non-violent man. He doesn’t believe in coercion.”

Restraint and respect

In addition, Ayatollah Sistani has refused to meet “hard-liners,” such as figures close to Ayatollah Khamenei, including the Lebanese Hezbollah leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.

His attempts to integrate Iraq’s Iran-backed Shiite militias into the state military – against Ayatollah Khamenei’s express wishes – “have limited Iranian influence,” writes Mr. Mamouri for the Washington Institute.

Mr. Sistani has also demonstrated restraint in another way, by choosing not to turn Iraq into a clerical-run system like Iran.

“Sistani could turn Iraq into velayat-e faqih not tomorrow, but this evening, if he wants,” adds Mr. Kadhim. “Yet he doesn’t, and that is an important distinction. Sistani’s lack of inclination to assume a lot of power ... deserves a lot of respect.”

It’s respect he also gets from Iran, despite the dispute.

“Khamenei respects Sistani very much. He also respects the fatwas of Sistani, even if they are against him,” says Hisham al-Hashemi, a Baghdad-based security analyst with the European Institute of Peace. “I know lots of Khamenei’s followers. They have very firm instructions not to talk [negatively] about Sistani in any way.”

But for Ayatollah Sistani, limiting Iran’s influence has not been easy, given the critical role that Tehran played in 2014 to halt the Islamic State’s lightning advance, and in supporting Iraq’s Shiite militias.

“Lots of Iraqis believe in Iran, therefore their beliefs oblige them to work for Iran,” says Mr. Hashemi. “They don’t believe in Iran as a geography or a neighbor, they believe in it as an Islamic Revolution, and the right for this revolution to cross borders everywhere.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,YRIgOrtB592rKHKK

Bowe Bergdahl was being held captive at various times — down to how many gunmen were guarding him — but special operations commanders repeatedly shelved rescue missions because they didn ’ t want to risk casualties for a man they believed to be a “ deserter , ” sources familiar with the mission plans said .
Commanders on the ground debated whether to pull the trigger on a rescue several times in recent years , according to one of the sources , a former high-level intelligence official in Afghanistan , who said the conclusion each time was that the prospect of losing highly trained troops was too high a price to pay for rescuing a soldier who walked away from his unit before being captured by the enemy .
A second source told The ███ that the rescue operation plans were “ high risk ” and became even less attractive in recent months when officials in the Pentagon ’ s Joint Special Operations Command grew convinced that the Taliban and the militant Haqqani network , whose operatives were holding Sgt . Bergdahl , were eager to cut a deal for his release .
“ Joint Special Operations Command always had the rescue mission on the table and it was entirely under their ownership , but the big question centered on whether Bergdahl was somebody you risk lives for when you still have time and space to maneuver diplomatically , ” said the source , a high-level congressional aide , who , like the former intelligence official , spoke only on the condition of anonymity .
The aide also said there was frustration among some on Capitol Hill that the Obama administration had botched an opportunity to exert leverage over the Taliban , particularly since the U.S. military could have used force to secure Sgt . Bergdahl ’ s release .
“ The prisoner swap was being built up as the only option that was available . But there ’ s been knowledge of the general vicinity of where Bergdahl was , down to how many guys were guarding him , ” said the aide .
The catch , the aide added , is that special operations commanders and others at the Pentagon never sought approval for the rescue mission from the White House because they believed in the pursuit of a diplomatic deal .
The aide said military officials in Afghanistan spent recent months pushing for a stronger deal than was ultimately struck , but were “ superseded ” by the White House and State Department . The aide would not comment on what the parameters of a “ stronger ” deal may have looked like , beyond saying they would have involved the Pakistani government .
The former intelligence official who spoke with The Times corroborated that assertion but declined to offer further details , saying only that the deal turned out the way it did because “ the administration wanted to close the door on this no matter what the price was . ”
Separately , the former official said , “ Military commanders were loath to risk their people to save this guy . They were loath to pick him up and because of that hesitancy , we wind up trading five Taliban guys for him .

Both of the sources said military officials across the special operations community were appalled by the terms of the deal that ultimately got struck over the weekend between State Department-led negotiators and the Taliban , effectively securing Sgt .

U.S. Special Operations Command declined to comment on the revelations provided to The Times .

Bergdahl in 2009 the military decided against making an extraordinary effort to rescue him , especially after it became clear that he initially was being held in Pakistan under the supervision of the Haqqani network , a Taliban ally with links to Pakistan ’ s intelligence service .
Nonetheless , individual units pursued leads as they came in , according to the AP report , which cited an unidentified Pentagon official as saying : “ I know for a fact that we lost soldiers looking for him . ”
The AP also reported that the U.S. government kept tabs on Bergdahl ’ s whereabouts with spies , drones and satellites , even as it pursued off-and-on negotiations to get him back over the five years of captivity that ended Saturday .
The White House shot back against criticism from Republican lawmakers , several of whom said the administration had set a dangerous precedent of negotiating with terrorists and may have overstepped the bounds of executive authority by failing to alert Congress of the deal before finalizing it with the Taliban .

The AP report on the matter Monday quoted Nabi Jan Mhullhakhil , the provincial police chief of Paktika province in Afghanistan , where Bergdahl was stationed with his unit , as saying that elders in the area had told him Bergdahl “ came out from the U.S. base without a gun and was outside the base when he was arrested by the Taliban . ”

Martha McSally reveals she was raped by a superior officer while in Air Force,2019-03-06,,"A year after saying she was sexually abused in high school , Sen. Martha McSally revealed during a congressional hearing Wednesday that she was raped by a superior officer while she was in the Air Force .
McSally , an Arizona Republican , said only that an attack happened and implied that it occurred early in her military career that spanned more than two decades .
The personal disclosure came during a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel intended to prevent and better respond to sexual assaults in the military in the future . McSally has been a tireless advocate for the military , which she says should include a system that protects women and men who have faced sexual assault and abuse .
It makes her a unique voice among the women on Capitol Hill who have gone public with their experiences surviving sexual assault and harassment in the wake of the national reckoning brought on by the # MeToo movement .
During her time in the Air Force , which stretched from 1988 until 2010 , McSally said she saw weaknesses in how leaders handled the prevention , investigation , and adjudication of reports of sexual assaults . She said she did not report her own because she did not trust leaders would hold her alleged attacker accountable .
McSally , 52 , did not identify her assailant , at what point in her military career the assault took place , where the alleged rape occurred , or the names of the people she later told .
“ So , like you , I also am a survivor , but unlike so many brave survivors , I didn ’ t report being sexually assaulted , ” said McSally , who was reading from prepared remarks , and at times appeared to steel herself by taking deep breaths . “ Like so many women and men , I didn ’ t trust the system at the time . I blamed myself . I was ashamed and confused . I thought I was strong but felt powerless . The perpetrators abused their position of power in profound ways . In one case I was preyed upon and raped by a superior officer .
“ I stayed silent for many years , but later in my career , as the military grappled with the scandals , and their wholly inadequate responses , I felt the need to let some people know I , too , was a survivor . I was horrified at how my attempt to share generally my experiences was handled . I almost separated from the Air Force at 18 years of service over my despair . Like many victims , I felt like the system was raping me all over again . ”
McSally retired as a colonel . Her Senate colleagues applauded her courage in coming forward with her story , which opened the two-hour hearing that included testimony from sexual assault victims who served in the armed forces .

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , D-N.Y. , the ranking Democrat on the personnel subcommittee and a 2020 presidential candidate , said she was moved by McSally 's testimony and emphasis on the need to implement processes that encourage victims of sexual assault to have faith in a process that will treat them fairly .
`` I was very grateful for Sen. McSally 's personal testimony , and I 'm deeply affected by that testimony , '' Gillibrand said .
The military has waged a years-long effort to combat sexual assault and harassment , while U.S. lawmakers have passed laws intended to improve how cases are handled . Even so , Defense Department officials reported an estimated 10 percent increase of reporting of sexual assaults during fiscal year 2017 , and last year reported a 10 percent increase in the number of sexual assaults that were reported in the U.S. military , based on surveys .
There were 6,769 reports of sexual assault involving service members as either victims or subjects of criminal investigation , a 9.7 percent increase over the 6,172 reports made the previous fiscal year , according to the Department of Defense .
McSally kicked off her questioning by thanking fellow survivors for courageously sharing their stories . She said military leaders must fundamentally address an underlying culture that allows the breeding of `` harassment and abuse , and abuse of power , and assault . ''
McSally said commanders should be held accountable for reporting abuse and retaliation by both peers and superiors . McSally said she has seen first-hand retaliation in the ostracization and isolation of those who report abuse , particularly those who work in the same unit .
`` People take a very complex issue and they come down on either , 'He 's a rapist or she 's a liar , ' and everybody has to still go to work together , '' McSally said . `` And then there is this isolation by peers — not just by superiors , that sometimes is the cruelest . ''
McSally alluded to her experience during a 2015 interview with ███ . Back then , she said sexual harassment and sexual assault was `` still a very significant problem , '' that affected men and women , including herself .
`` I 've had my share of experiences along the way , yeah , '' she said during that interview .
And , she seemed to reference it last October , during a radio interview with KTAR-FM ( 92.3 ) . Her comments came against the backdrop of Kavanaugh 's confirmation hearings , and as she was running for the U.S. Senate . At the time , McSally said her heart went out to Kavanaugh 's accuser . She said it was important that people not be susceptible to false allegations .
`` I would hope , as somebody who ’ s dealt with this personally and dealt with it also in the military , that maybe we could have this conversation about ‘ Hey , let ’ s prevent the next assault and abuse from happening , ’ ” McSally told the radio station .
McSally has consistently advocated that those who allege sexual wrongdoing be heard . During Brett Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation hearings for the U.S. Supreme Court , for example , she said the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers should be respectfully heard .
McSally revealed last year to the Wall Street Journal that she herself was sexually abused as a teen by her high school track coach . The abuse came following the death of her father , during a traumatic and defining period of her life that she frequently references when talking to voters . To cope with the pain of losing her dad , she turned to running and other exercise . Her coach took advantage of her through “ emotional manipulation. ” The coach has denied the allegation .
In 2014 , while running for Congress , McSally revealed she had been the victim of a stalker in response to a TV ad intended to help her Democratic rival . At the time , McSally said she had threats made against her , “ and wasn ’ t even safe in my own home or my car where my stalker broke in and held me in a hostage-like situation . ”

Arizona Republic

A year after saying she was sexually abused in high school, Sen. Martha McSally revealed during a congressional hearing Wednesday that she was raped by a superior officer while she was in the Air Force.

McSally, an Arizona Republican, said only that an attack happened and implied that it occurred early in her military career that spanned more than two decades.

The personal disclosure came during a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel intended to prevent and better respond to sexual assaults in the military in the future. McSally has been a tireless advocate for the military, which she says should include a system that protects women and men who have faced sexual assault and abuse.

It makes her a unique voice among the women on Capitol Hill who have gone public with their experiences surviving sexual assault and harassment in the wake of the national reckoning brought on by the #MeToo movement.

During her time in the Air Force, which stretched from 1988 until 2010, McSally said she saw weaknesses in how leaders handled the prevention, investigation, and adjudication of reports of sexual assaults. She said she did not report her own because she did not trust leaders would hold her alleged attacker accountable.

McSally, 52, did not identify her assailant, at what point in her military career the assault took place, where the alleged rape occurred, or the names of the people she later told.

“So, like you, I also am a survivor, but unlike so many brave survivors, I didn’t report being sexually assaulted,” said McSally, who was reading from prepared remarks, and at times appeared to steel herself by taking deep breaths. “Like so many women and men, I didn’t trust the system at the time. I blamed myself. I was ashamed and confused. I thought I was strong but felt powerless. The perpetrators abused their position of power in profound ways. In one case I was preyed upon and raped by a superior officer.

“I stayed silent for many years, but later in my career, as the military grappled with the scandals, and their wholly inadequate responses, I felt the need to let some people know I, too, was a survivor. I was horrified at how my attempt to share generally my experiences was handled. I almost separated from the Air Force at 18 years of service over my despair. Like many victims, I felt like the system was raping me all over again.”

McSally retired as a colonel. Her Senate colleagues applauded her courage in coming forward with her story, which opened the two-hour hearing that included testimony from sexual assault victims who served in the armed forces.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., the ranking Democrat on the personnel subcommittee and a 2020 presidential candidate, said she was moved by McSally's testimony and emphasis on the need to implement processes that encourage victims of sexual assault to have faith in a process that will treat them fairly.

""I was very grateful for Sen. McSally's personal testimony, and I'm deeply affected by that testimony,"" Gillibrand said.

The military has waged a years-long effort to combat sexual assault and harassment, while U.S. lawmakers have passed laws intended to improve how cases are handled. Even so, Defense Department officials reported an estimated 10 percent increase of reporting of sexual assaults during fiscal year 2017, and last year reported a 10 percent increase in the number of sexual assaults that were reported in the U.S. military, based on surveys.

There were 6,769 reports of sexual assault involving service members as either victims or subjects of criminal investigation, a 9.7 percent increase over the 6,172 reports made the previous fiscal year, according to the Department of Defense.

McSally kicked off her questioning by thanking fellow survivors for courageously sharing their stories. She said military leaders must fundamentally address an underlying culture that allows the breeding of ""harassment and abuse, and abuse of power, and assault.""

McSally said commanders should be held accountable for reporting abuse and retaliation by both peers and superiors. McSally said she has seen first-hand retaliation in the ostracization and isolation of those who report abuse, particularly those who work in the same unit.

""People take a very complex issue and they come down on either, 'He's a rapist or she's a liar,' and everybody has to still go to work together,"" McSally said. ""And then there is this isolation by peers — not just by superiors, that sometimes is the cruelest.""

McSally alluded to her experience during a 2015 interview with USA TODAY. Back then, she said sexual harassment and sexual assault was ""still a very significant problem,"" that affected men and women, including herself.

""I've had my share of experiences along the way, yeah,"" she said during that interview.

And, she seemed to reference it last October, during a radio interview with KTAR-FM (92.3). Her comments came against the backdrop of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, and as she was running for the U.S. Senate. At the time, McSally said her heart went out to Kavanaugh's accuser. She said it was important that people not be susceptible to false allegations.

""I would hope, as somebody who’s dealt with this personally and dealt with it also in the military, that maybe we could have this conversation about ‘Hey, let’s prevent the next assault and abuse from happening,’” McSally told the radio station.

McSally has consistently advocated that those who allege sexual wrongdoing be heard. During Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings for the U.S. Supreme Court, for example, she said the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers should be respectfully heard.

McSally revealed last year to the Wall Street Journal that she herself was sexually abused as a teen by her high school track coach. The abuse came following the death of her father, during a traumatic and defining period of her life that she frequently references when talking to voters. To cope with the pain of losing her dad, she turned to running and other exercise. Her coach took advantage of her through “emotional manipulation.” The coach has denied the allegation.

In 2014, while running for Congress, McSally revealed she had been the victim of a stalker in response to a TV ad intended to help her Democratic rival. At the time, McSally said she had threats made against her, “and wasn’t even safe in my own home or my car where my stalker broke in and held me in a hostage-like situation.”

McSally said her personal experience in the Air Force motivated her to make recommendations to leaders to advocate for changes while serving in the military and in Congress.

She said all commanders should be trained and encouraged to prosecute perpetrators.

“And if the commander is the problem or fails in his or her duties, they must be removed and held harshly accountable,” she said. “... We cannot change from the outside alone — it must be deployed within — it must be built, constantly maintained, and expertly managed by commanders who are themselves educated, conditioned and given the tools to ensure what you survived — and what I survived — happens to no warrior under their command.”

McSally’s statement comes weeks after a colleague, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, disclosed in an interview with Bloomberg that she was raped in college. She acknowledged the matter only after her divorce papers claimed her husband had been physically and emotionally abusive.

A Black Hawk helicopter swoops in to pick up Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in a valley in Afghanistan, in a video of the handover of the American prisoner of war that was posted online early Wednesday. The Pentagon says it's reviewing the video; a spokesman says there's no reason to question its authenticity.

The handover reportedly took place in eastern Afghanistan's Khost province, near Pakistan. The video shows Bergdahl sitting in the back of a pickup truck, wearing white clothing. It also shows more than a dozen fighters positioned around the valley.

It broke my heart to watch Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, a West Point graduate who swore the Cadet’s Honor Code to never “lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do,” and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.

Since taking office , Trump has considered several options for Afghanistan , from sending in additional troops to walking away from the war , an unlikely move considering U.S. concerns about thwarting Islamic terrorism .
Solutions for Afghanistan , which include ending the longest war in American history , eluded the Obama administration and have n't come easily to Trump .
The challenge is largely how to step up the fight against terrorism in a way that advances peace prospects -- in large part because the Taliban has been gaining ground and shows no interest in peace negotiations .
Trump met at the presidential retreat , in nearby western Maryland , with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , Defense Secretary Jim Mattis , top intelligence agency officials and other top military and diplomatic aides .
Mattis said earlier this week the administration was `` very close '' to finalizing a new approach and that the talks in the Catoctin Mountains will help the president and his team move toward a decision .
`` We are coming very close , ” he said . “ And I anticipate ( a decision ) in the very near future . ”
Gen. Joseph Votel , the Central Command chief who is responsible for U.S. military operations in the greater Middle East , was not part of the meetings .

He also said he has not talked directly to Trump as part of the months-long review .

The administration has said its Afghanistan strategy will be informed by a review of its approach to the broader region , including Pakistan and India . The Taliban have long used Pakistan as a sanctuary , complicating efforts to defeat the insurgency in Afghanistan and stabilize the country .
The region includes other actors who pose political problems for Washington , including Iran , which has influence in western Afghanistan .
The outlook is clouded by the Afghan government 's struggle to halt Taliban advances on its own . The U.S. special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction has said the Taliban hold sway in almost half the country .
Government forces also are battling an Islamic State affiliate that has carved out a foothold , mostly in the east . Trump has vowed to crush IS , so its expansion in Afghanistan poses an additional challenge with no obvious solution . Just this week , a U.S. soldier was killed and nearly a dozen wounded in combat with IS fighters .
Trump has expressed frustration at the prolonged fighting in Afghanistan . Earlier this summer he raised the idea of firing the top U.S. commander there , Gen. John Nicholson .
Asked this week if Trump has confidence in Nicholson , Mattis demurred . `` Ask the president , '' he answered .
Trump is `` looking at all aspects '' of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan `` as he must in his responsibilities as the commander in chief , '' Mattis said .

The administration has said its Afghanistan strategy will be informed by a review of its approach to the broader region, including Pakistan and India. The Taliban have long used Pakistan as a sanctuary, complicating efforts to defeat the insurgency in Afghanistan and stabilize the country.

The region includes other actors who pose political problems for Washington, including Iran, which has influence in western Afghanistan.

The outlook is clouded by the Afghan government's struggle to halt Taliban advances on its own. The U.S. special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction has said the Taliban hold sway in almost half the country.

Government forces also are battling an Islamic State affiliate that has carved out a foothold, mostly in the east. Trump has vowed to crush IS, so its expansion in Afghanistan poses an additional challenge with no obvious solution. Just this week, a U.S. soldier was killed and nearly a dozen wounded in combat with IS fighters.

Trump has expressed frustration at the prolonged fighting in Afghanistan. Earlier this summer he raised the idea of firing the top U.S. commander there, Gen. John Nicholson.

Asked this week if Trump has confidence in Nicholson, Mattis demurred. ""Ask the president,"" he answered.

Trump is ""looking at all aspects"" of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan ""as he must in his responsibilities as the commander in chief,"" Mattis said.

Nicholson also was not participating in Friday's talks at Camp David.

President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act — a centuries-old law that gives the president the authority to send the US military into US cities and towns to quash domestic unrest — if state governors don ’ t take sufficient action to quell the ongoing protests and unrest happening in cities across the country .
“ If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents , then I will deploy United States military and quickly solve the problem for them , ” Trump said in a short speech delivered from the White House Rose Garden .
As he spoke , loud booms could be sporadically heard in the background as law enforcement officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at peaceful protesters who had gathered near the White House .
For the past three days , Trump has flirted with sending troops into cities around the country to put down the protests and unrest sparked by the death of George Floyd , a 46-year-old black man who was killed last week when a Minneapolis police officer used his knee to pin Floyd ’ s neck to the ground for several minutes while he was handcuffed .
On Saturday , Trump tweeted , “ Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done , and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military and many arrests . ”
Two days later , he tweeted that Republican Sen. Tom Cotton was “ 100 % Correct ” for suggesting violent activists would cower before a US Army presence .
As of Monday , 23 states and the District of Columbia had mobilized thousands of National Guard members to support police officers and firefighters with trying to control the demonstrations and unrest .
Trump , however , is unsatisfied with those efforts . In a private call with governors on Monday , he told them , “ If you don ’ t dominate , you ’ re wasting your time , ” adding that “ we have a wonderful military. ” Hours later , White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president would soon send “ federal assets ” around the nation , and mentioned the Insurrection Act as a possibility .
“ The Insurrection Act , it ’ s one of the tools available , whether the president decides to pursue that , that ’ s his prerogative , “ she said .
However , Trump did say US military police , many of whom have spent part of the past two decades in the Middle East , will deploy to Washington , DC . Importantly , they still don ’ t have the authority to perform law enforcement duties .
But if Trump were to go through with invoking the Insurrection Act , experts say it would be one of the most dramatic law enforcement escalations in decades , certain to inflame tensions between the demonstrators and their government instead of lower them .
An active-duty US Air Force officer who flew warplanes in Afghanistan told me such a decision isn ’ t wise . “ These protests aren ’ t combat and shouldn ’ t be viewed through the same prism , ” the officer said , speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about a sensitive issue . “ Expecting a military response is myopic on the part of the administration , tone-deaf in light of yet another intolerable and unacceptable killing , and a misuse of the military . ”
But Trump hasn ’ t heeded that advice . Instead , he ’ s leaning away from it .
Trump absolutely can send American troops to any part of the United States to deal with the protests . He is the commander in chief , after all . But if he wants them to be able to search , seize assets , and arrest protesters and people who are looting , there are a few legalistic hoops he ’ ll have to jump through first .
You might have heard of “ posse comitatus , ” a longstanding law that bars the US military in most cases from being used to enforce domestic law . However , there is actually a way for federal troops to perform law enforcement functions . Simply put , they have to get special , statutory authorization to allow them to do those duties .
By far the most important of those authorizations — and the one most likely to come into play in this situation — is the Insurrection Act .
“ This is the legal key that unlocks the door to use federal military forces ... to quell civil unrest , ” Mark Nevitt , a military law expert at the US Naval Academy , wrote for the Just Security website last Friday .
Nevitt noted two main ways the Insurrection Act could be invoked for the protests . It ’ s worth going through each in turn .
1 ) Local leaders could ask the president for US military assistance
A state ’ s legislature or its governor could directly request US military support . This actually happened in 1992 : California Gov . Pete Wilson sought assistance from President George H.W . Bush during the Los Angeles protests that erupted after a jury acquitted police officers charged with arresting and beating Rodney King . In response , Bush put California National Guard members under federal command and sent in soldiers and Marines already based in the state .
It ’ s unclear if any governor would actually make such a request of Trump right now . Experts told me governors typically shy away from taking this step because of how controversial it is . Plus , they have National Guard members already under their command who , when authorized , can perform law enforcement functions .
Reports , however , indicate that active-duty troops stationed around the country are on high alert to deploy within 24 hours . “ We have our military ready , willing and able , if they ever want to call our military , ” Trump told reporters on Saturday . “ And we can have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military . ”
2 ) The president could send in US troops to protect federal property or enforce federal law
Trump could invoke the law to send troops even without a state legislature ’ s or governor ’ s consent — but there ’ s a catch .
Trump can only deploy troops within the US “ for certain purposes , ” Lindsay Cohn , a US military expert at the Naval War College , told me . “ Technically and legally , he can send them to protect federal property or enforce federal law . ”

Five years later , President John F.

This allowed the student , James Meredith , to register safely even though a mob tried to stop him .
In both the Eisenhower and Kennedy cases , the president used federal troops to enforce federal laws . That ’ s important , Cohn told me , because the key is that those and other deployments by presidents were to suppress insurrections against US federal laws — not laws of the individual states .
Reading the provision in full helps drive this vital point home :
Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions , combinations , or assemblages or rebellion against authority of United States makes it impracticable to enforce the law of the United States in any State or territory by judicial proceedings , the President may call into Federal service the militia of any State and use the Federal military to enforce the laws or suppress the rebellion .
Importantly , to invoke the act , Trump must first — with the attorney general ’ s help — issue a “ proclamation to disperse. ” Basically , he has to give the people working against federal law a bit of time to stop their actions . If they don ’ t , the president is free to send in the US military .
If Trump were to do this , it would be guaranteed to anger a lot of people , and many would likely contend that Trump is behaving in an authoritarian manner , using the might of the US military to crack down on protesters .

But Trump hasn’t heeded that advice. Instead, he’s leaning away from it.

The Insurrection Act, briefly explained

Trump absolutely can send American troops to any part of the United States to deal with the protests. He is the commander in chief, after all. But if he wants them to be able to search, seize assets, and arrest protesters and people who are looting, there are a few legalistic hoops he’ll have to jump through first.

You might have heard of “posse comitatus,” a longstanding law that bars the US military in most cases from being used to enforce domestic law. However, there is actually a way for federal troops to perform law enforcement functions. Simply put, they have to get special, statutory authorization to allow them to do those duties.

By far the most important of those authorizations — and the one most likely to come into play in this situation — is the Insurrection Act.

“This is the legal key that unlocks the door to use federal military forces ... to quell civil unrest,” Mark Nevitt, a military law expert at the US Naval Academy, wrote for the Just Security website last Friday.

Nevitt noted two main ways the Insurrection Act could be invoked for the protests. It’s worth going through each in turn.

A state’s legislature or its governor could directly request US military support. This actually happened in 1992: California Gov. Pete Wilson sought assistance from President George H.W.

This makes the future of the protests Trump’s responsibility

If Trump wants soldiers and Marines to go into American cities and start shooting, he’ll be wildly disappointed.

As Nevitt explained, there are clear and severe restraints on active-duty troops using force while performing policing duties at home, even under the Insurrection Act:

[F]orce is to be used only as a last resort, and the force used should be the minimum necessary. Further, deadly force is to be used only when all lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably employed.

A March 25 tweet from the department highlighted more than $ 100 million in U.S. medical assistance to foreign countries , including in Africa , as evidence of America ’ s emphasis on mitigating “ endemic and emerging health threats ” and its “ long-term investment in the lives of Africans. ” When it comes to Africa , the messaging suggests , America ’ s focus is on saving lives , not ending them . But a wealth of evidence reveals that the opposite is true in the two African countries of greatest interest to the U.S. military : Libya and Somalia .
Since U.S. Africa Command became fully operational in 2008 , American troops have seen combat in more than a dozen African countries and conducted more than 1,500 air attacks , commando raids , and other ground missions in Libya and Somalia alone . Yet these two countries , where U.S. forces have spent hundreds of millions on airstrikes , have fared especially poorly in terms of direct U.S. health assistance . Libya and Somalia are also the only two African countries where the U.S. stands accused of killing civilians and failing to take responsibility for their deaths . “ This sends an appalling message to the citizens of those countries — namely , that the U.S. cares more about propping up their governments than about helping people suffering on the ground there , ” said Daphne Eviatar , director of the Security with Human Rights program at Amnesty International USA . “ The irony is that message will only encourage ill will toward the United States and U.S. forces , and ultimately fuel support for the armed groups the U.S. is fighting. ” The U.S. military has sought to portray AFRICOM as something more akin to the Peace Corps than a geographic combatant command like Central Command , which oversees U.S. military operations and war-making across the Greater Middle East . A parade of top generals and boosters have promoted the idea that AFRICOM would wield soft power through a “ whole-of-government ” approach , partnering with civilian agencies to “ advance U.S. national interests ” on the African continent . As a “ hybrid ” command , officials vowed , it would stand apart from its war-fighting brethren and approach its corner of the world differently . “ It is , at its heart , a different kind of command with a different orientation , ” said then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates at AFRICOM ’ s inauguration in 2008 , stressing that it would forge “ civilian-military partnerships. ” Earlier this year , in testimony before members of the House Appropriations Committee , AFRICOM ’ s chief , Gen. Stephen Townsend , was still touting the command ’ s “ whole-of-government ” mindset . Problems like Covid-19 “ don ’ t really have military solutions ” and necessitate working with partners like the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development , Townsend said in March . Two weeks later , the State Department ’ s Africa Media Hub tweeted about America ’ s focus on helping , rather than harming , Africans . The tweet was accompanied by a color-coded map showing which African countries have received the most direct “ global health assistance ” from the United States since 2001 .
The U.S. has offered over $ 100 million in medical assistance to foreign countries , incl . # African nations , to combat # COVID19 . @ USAID has invested over $ 1.1 billion dollars since 2009 to prevent , detect , & respond to endemic & emerging health threats . https : //t.co/jZNfi5kn6M pic.twitter.com/1YClIwtLkp — US Africa Media Hub ( @ AfricaMediaHub ) March 25 , 2020
In April , the Africa Media Hub tweeted out an enhanced version of the map that included U.S.-funded national reference laboratories , whose core functions include supporting disease diagnosis and surveillance , as well as investigating outbreaks . The maps demonstrate that when it comes to the most militarily important countries on the continent , America ’ s synergistic whole-of-government approach to wielding soft power to achieve national security goals is more fantasy than reality .
The U.S. Govt is leading the world ’ s humanitarian & health assistance response to the COVID-19 pandemic . U.S. govt agencies are working together to prioritize foreign assistance based on coordination & the potential for impact .

AFRICOM engages in six “ lines of effort ” — primary objectives to be accomplished over years of sustained military operations . Most , such as “ strengthen partner networks , ” relate to general undertakings , but two target individual African nations : “ Develop security in Somalia ” and “ Contain instability in Libya. ” Of at least 13 African countries where U.S. forces have engaged in combat in the last decade , these nations have seen the U.S. military ’ s most intense ( Libya ) and sustained ( Somalia ) attacks . The State Department maps also show that these two countries have received among the least U.S. health aid on the continent : less than $ 500,000 for Libya and between $ 500,000 and $ 99 million for Somalia . Since 9/11 , the U.S. has carried out more attacks in Libya , targeting militants associated with Al Qaeda and the Islamic State , than anywhere but the war zones of the Greater Middle East . The United States has conducted no fewer than 776 airstrikes — and likely far more — in the North African nation from 2011 to the present , according to figures provided to ███ by retired Air Force squadron commander Lt. Col. Gary Peppers and by Airwars , a U.K.-based airstrike monitoring group . The bulk of those attacks occurred during the Obama administration , which launched the first large spate of strikes in 2011 to support the rebels who ultimately ousted then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . That war shattered the Libyan state and turned the country into a haven for Islamist militants , leading to another surge in U.S. strikes in 2016 . That summer , the fledgling post-Gaddafi regime — the Libyan Government of National Accord — asked for American help in dislodging ISIS fighters from Sirte . The Obama administration designated the city an “ area of active hostilities , ” loosening guidelines designed to prevent civilian casualties and allowing the U.S. military a freer hand in carrying out airstrikes . Between August and December 2016 , according to a statement from AFRICOM , the U.S. carried out “ 495 precision airstrikes ” in the city .
In 2011 , President Barack Obama pledged that the United States would “ work with the international community to provide assistance to the people of Libya , who need food for the hungry and medical care for the wounded. ” Almost a decade later , medical care remains a challenge for Libyans because , according to USAID , “ a substantial proportion of health facilities [ are ] only partially operational or closed. ” The State Department ’ s recently tweeted maps highlight one of the reasons : almost nonexistent U.S. support . Libya is one of only two countries to receive so little in direct American health assistance , according to government figures . ( The other is Tunisia , where U.S. troops have also been involved in combat in recent years , but whose relative stability sets it apart from its neighbor Libya . ) While the U.S. military has carried out more airstrikes in Libya , Somalia is the site of America ’ s longest-running air campaign outside the CENTCOM area of operations — and that war is escalating at an exponential rate under the Trump administration . The United States has carried out more than 220 attacks in Somalia since 2007 , primarily aimed at the terrorist group al-Shabab . There have already been more U.S. airstrikes in Somalia in 2020 than there were declared attacks by AFRICOM during the entire Obama presidency . Add ground operations , and the number of total U.S. attacks in Somalia would be even higher , according to retired Brig . Gen. Donald Bolduc , who served as commander of Special Operations Command Africa from April 2015 to June 2017 , and Air Force files obtained by ███ via the Freedom of Information Act . There has been much speculation about U.S. troop drawdowns in Africa , and Covid-19 has paused or curtailed U.S. military deployments around the globe . But the number of troops deployed in Somalia has hovered between 650 and 800 American personnel since last year , Manley said .
To house those forces and support hundreds of ground missions over the years , the U.S. military has built an archipelago of outposts and bases across the country . But experts say that what Somalia really needs are hospitals and clinics . According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , Somalia ’ s “ healthcare system is overburdened , fragmented , under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide lifesaving or preventive services. ” “ Somalia ’ s health indicators are among the worst in the world , ” the World Bank recently observed , “ and Covid-19 cases threaten to stretch a fragile healthcare system. ” “ I urge our donors … to invest in the future of Somalia through the health of its people , ” Dr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari , the World Health Organization regional director for the eastern Mediterranean , said during a late 2019 visit to the country , where 3 million people are in need of health assistance .
Yet the United States has only invested $ 30 million in health assistance to Somalia over the last 19 years — less than it has given to 33 other countries on the continent , including Botswana ( $ 1.1 billion ) ; Eswatini ( $ 490 million ) ; Guinea ( $ 365.5 million ) ; Namibia ( $ 970.5 million ) ; and Zambia ( $ 3.9 billion ) . Those countries have received far less attention from the U.S. military — and no airstrikes . U.S. attacks in Somalia have killed as many as 142 civilians since 2007 and up to 82 in Libya since late 2011 , according to Airwars . Yet AFRICOM has admitted to killing only four civilians on the continent , two each in airstrikes in Somalia in 2018 and 2019 . Despite its whole-of-government rhetoric , AFRICOM ’ s failure to coordinate with the State Department and USAID was likely a key reason that Somali civilians have never received assistance , reparations , or compensation for deaths and injuries caused by U.S. airstrikes , Eviatar noted . “ AFRICOM ’ s minimal presence on the ground in Somalia is also the reason they give for being unable to adequately investigate claims of civilian casualties , and they ’ ve made no effort to coordinate with State or USAID to do so , ” she told ███ . “ We are proud to stand by our partners as we battle this deadly virus in Africa and around the globe , ” U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. James Vechery , AFRICOM ’ s deputy chief , said recently as the command drew attention to training and equipment provided to four African nations to enable them to set up and operate mobile hospitals . “ The effort highlights a whole-of-government approach , aimed at ensuring African partners are educated , resourced , and supported to contain the spread of the virus , ” reads a recent AFRICOM news release . But neither Somalia nor Libya , nor any of the other 11 nations where the U.S. has been engaged in combat in recent years , received any of that assistance .
The second version of the State Department ’ s Global Health Assistance map was accompanied by the claims that that the United States is “ leading the world ’ s humanitarian & health assistance response to the COVID-19 pandemic ” and that U.S. investment in Africa “ increases local access to and delivery of health services. ” This map , too , spotlights the neglect for the “ delivery of health services ” in countries that have borne the brunt of American attacks . Of the 29 national reference laboratories supported by PEPFAR , the President ’ s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , not one is located in either Libya or Somalia . In fact , only five of the 29 labs can be found in countries where the United States has been engaged in combat in recent years : two in Kenya and one each in Cameroon , the Democratic Republic of Congo , and South Sudan . In March , USAID announced an initial commitment of $ 37 million from its Emergency Reserve Fund for Contagious Infectious Diseases for 25 “ high-priority countries. ” Only seven of them were in Africa , and they did not include Libya or Somalia . Only one — Kenya — was the site of recent U.S. combat . Last month , the State Department and USAID announced nearly $ 508 million in emergency health , humanitarian , and economic assistance to “ support critical activities to control the spread ” of the coronavirus . Together , Libya and Somalia are receiving 3.6 percent of the total Covid-19 response funds , or $ 18.6 million . By comparison , Italy — which has a far more robust health care system than either nation and hasn ’ t borne U.S. attacks since the 1940s — will receive $ 50 million . Other contemporary U.S. battlegrounds include Afghanistan ( more than $ 18 million ) ; Iraq ( more than $ 25.6 million ) ; and Syria ( almost $ 18 million ) . All of those countries outpaced Libya ( $ 6 million ) and Somalia ( nearly $ 12.5 million ) . The U.S. has since announced an additional $ 4 million in Covid-19 assistance for Somalia , but seemingly none for Libya .","As Covid-19 began spreading across the African continent in late March, the U.S. State Department took to Twitter to boast about American health assistance there. A March 25 tweet from the department highlighted more than $100 million in U.S. medical assistance to foreign countries, including in Africa, as evidence of America’s emphasis on mitigating “endemic and emerging health threats” and its “long-term investment in the lives of Africans.” When it comes to Africa, the messaging suggests, America’s focus is on saving lives, not ending them. But a wealth of evidence reveals that the opposite is true in the two African countries of greatest interest to the U.S. military: Libya and Somalia.

Since U.S. Africa Command became fully operational in 2008, American troops have seen combat in more than a dozen African countries and conducted more than 1,500 air attacks, commando raids, and other ground missions in Libya and Somalia alone. Yet these two countries, where U.S. forces have spent hundreds of millions on airstrikes, have fared especially poorly in terms of direct U.S. health assistance. Libya and Somalia are also the only two African countries where the U.S. stands accused of killing civilians and failing to take responsibility for their deaths. “This sends an appalling message to the citizens of those countries — namely, that the U.S. cares more about propping up their governments than about helping people suffering on the ground there,” said Daphne Eviatar, director of the Security with Human Rights program at Amnesty International USA. “The irony is that message will only encourage ill will toward the United States and U.S. forces, and ultimately fuel support for the armed groups the U.S. is fighting.” The U.S. military has sought to portray AFRICOM as something more akin to the Peace Corps than a geographic combatant command like Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations and war-making across the Greater Middle East. A parade of top generals and boosters have promoted the idea that AFRICOM would wield soft power through a “whole-of-government” approach, partnering with civilian agencies to “advance U.S. national interests” on the African continent. As a “hybrid” command, officials vowed, it would stand apart from its war-fighting brethren and approach its corner of the world differently. “It is, at its heart, a different kind of command with a different orientation,” said then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates at AFRICOM’s inauguration in 2008, stressing that it would forge “civilian-military partnerships.” Earlier this year, in testimony before members of the House Appropriations Committee, AFRICOM’s chief, Gen. Stephen Townsend, was still touting the command’s “whole-of-government” mindset. Problems like Covid-19 “don’t really have military solutions” and necessitate working with partners like the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, Townsend said in March. Two weeks later, the State Department’s Africa Media Hub tweeted about America’s focus on helping, rather than harming, Africans. The tweet was accompanied by a color-coded map showing which African countries have received the most direct “global health assistance” from the United States since 2001.

The U.S. has offered over $100 million in medical assistance to foreign countries, incl. #African nations, to combat #COVID19. @USAID has invested over $1.1 billion dollars since 2009 to prevent, detect, & respond to endemic & emerging health threats. https://t.co/jZNfi5kn6M pic.twitter.com/1YClIwtLkp — US Africa Media Hub (@AfricaMediaHub) March 25, 2020

In April, the Africa Media Hub tweeted out an enhanced version of the map that included U.S.-funded national reference laboratories, whose core functions include supporting disease diagnosis and surveillance, as well as investigating outbreaks. The maps demonstrate that when it comes to the most militarily important countries on the continent, America’s synergistic whole-of-government approach to wielding soft power to achieve national security goals is more fantasy than reality.

AFRICOM engages in six “lines of effort” — primary objectives to be accomplished over years of sustained military operations. Most, such as “strengthen partner networks,” relate to general undertakings, but two target individual African nations: “Develop security in Somalia” and “Contain instability in Libya.” Of at least 13 African countries where U.S. forces have engaged in combat in the last decade, these nations have seen the U.S. military’s most intense (Libya) and sustained (Somalia) attacks. The State Department maps also show that these two countries have received among the least U.S. health aid on the continent: less than $500,000 for Libya and between $500,000 and $99 million for Somalia. Since 9/11, the U.S. has carried out more attacks in Libya, targeting militants associated with Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, than anywhere but the war zones of the Greater Middle East. The United States has conducted no fewer than 776 airstrikes — and likely far more — in the North African nation from 2011 to the present, according to figures provided to The Intercept by retired Air Force squadron commander Lt. Col. Gary Peppers and by Airwars, a U.K.-based airstrike monitoring group. The bulk of those attacks occurred during the Obama administration, which launched the first large spate of strikes in 2011 to support the rebels who ultimately ousted then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. That war shattered the Libyan state and turned the country into a haven for Islamist militants, leading to another surge in U.S. strikes in 2016. That summer, the fledgling post-Gaddafi regime — the Libyan Government of National Accord — asked for American help in dislodging ISIS fighters from Sirte. The Obama administration designated the city an “area of active hostilities,” loosening guidelines designed to prevent civilian casualties and allowing the U.S. military a freer hand in carrying out airstrikes. Between August and December 2016, according to a statement from AFRICOM, the U.S. carried out “495 precision airstrikes” in the city.

In 2011, President Barack Obama pledged that the United States would “work with the international community to provide assistance to the people of Libya, who need food for the hungry and medical care for the wounded.” Almost a decade later, medical care remains a challenge for Libyans because, according to USAID, “a substantial proportion of health facilities [are] only partially operational or closed.” The State Department’s recently tweeted maps highlight one of the reasons: almost nonexistent U.S. support. Libya is one of only two countries to receive so little in direct American health assistance, according to government figures. (The other is Tunisia, where U.S. troops have also been involved in combat in recent years, but whose relative stability sets it apart from its neighbor Libya.) While the U.S. military has carried out more airstrikes in Libya, Somalia is the site of America’s longest-running air campaign outside the CENTCOM area of operations — and that war is escalating at an exponential rate under the Trump administration. The United States has carried out more than 220 attacks in Somalia since 2007, primarily aimed at the terrorist group al-Shabab. There have already been more U.S. airstrikes in Somalia in 2020 than there were declared attacks by AFRICOM during the entire Obama presidency. Add ground operations, and the number of total U.S. attacks in Somalia would be even higher, according to retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc, who served as commander of Special Operations Command Africa from April 2015 to June 2017, and Air Force files obtained by The Intercept via the Freedom of Information Act. There has been much speculation about U.S. troop drawdowns in Africa, and Covid-19 has paused or curtailed U.S. military deployments around the globe. But the number of troops deployed in Somalia has hovered between 650 and 800 American personnel since last year, Manley said.

To house those forces and support hundreds of ground missions over the years, the U.S. military has built an archipelago of outposts and bases across the country. But experts say that what Somalia really needs are hospitals and clinics. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Somalia’s “healthcare system is overburdened, fragmented, under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide lifesaving or preventive services.” “Somalia’s health indicators are among the worst in the world,” the World Bank recently observed, “and Covid-19 cases threaten to stretch a fragile healthcare system.” “I urge our donors … to invest in the future of Somalia through the health of its people,” Dr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the World Health Organization regional director for the eastern Mediterranean, said during a late 2019 visit to the country, where 3 million people are in need of health assistance.

Yet the United States has only invested $30 million in health assistance to Somalia over the last 19 years — less than it has given to 33 other countries on the continent, including Botswana ($1.1 billion); Eswatini ($490 million); Guinea ($365.5 million); Namibia ($970.5 million); and Zambia ($3.9 billion). Those countries have received far less attention from the U.S. military — and no airstrikes. U.S. attacks in Somalia have killed as many as 142 civilians since 2007 and up to 82 in Libya since late 2011, according to Airwars. Yet AFRICOM has admitted to killing only four civilians on the continent, two each in airstrikes in Somalia in 2018 and 2019. Despite its whole-of-government rhetoric, AFRICOM’s failure to coordinate with the State Department and USAID was likely a key reason that Somali civilians have never received assistance, reparations, or compensation for deaths and injuries caused by U.S. airstrikes, Eviatar noted. “AFRICOM’s minimal presence on the ground in Somalia is also the reason they give for being unable to adequately investigate claims of civilian casualties, and they’ve made no effort to coordinate with State or USAID to do so,” she told The Intercept. “We are proud to stand by our partners as we battle this deadly virus in Africa and around the globe,” U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. James Vechery, AFRICOM’s deputy chief, said recently as the command drew attention to training and equipment provided to four African nations to enable them to set up and operate mobile hospitals. “The effort highlights a whole-of-government approach, aimed at ensuring African partners are educated, resourced, and supported to contain the spread of the virus,” reads a recent AFRICOM news release. But neither Somalia nor Libya, nor any of the other 11 nations where the U.S. has been engaged in combat in recent years, received any of that assistance.

The second version of the State Department’s Global Health Assistance map was accompanied by the claims that that the United States is “leading the world’s humanitarian & health assistance response to the COVID-19 pandemic” and that U.S. investment in Africa “increases local access to and delivery of health services.” This map, too, spotlights the neglect for the “delivery of health services” in countries that have borne the brunt of American attacks. Of the 29 national reference laboratories supported by PEPFAR, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, not one is located in either Libya or Somalia. In fact, only five of the 29 labs can be found in countries where the United States has been engaged in combat in recent years: two in Kenya and one each in Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan. In March, USAID announced an initial commitment of $37 million from its Emergency Reserve Fund for Contagious Infectious Diseases for 25 “high-priority countries.” Only seven of them were in Africa, and they did not include Libya or Somalia. Only one — Kenya — was the site of recent U.S. combat. Last month, the State Department and USAID announced nearly $508 million in emergency health, humanitarian, and economic assistance to “support critical activities to control the spread” of the coronavirus. Together, Libya and Somalia are receiving 3.6 percent of the total Covid-19 response funds, or $18.6 million. By comparison, Italy — which has a far more robust health care system than either nation and hasn’t borne U.S. attacks since the 1940s — will receive $50 million. Other contemporary U.S. battlegrounds include Afghanistan (more than $18 million); Iraq (more than $25.6 million); and Syria (almost $18 million). All of those countries outpaced Libya ($6 million) and Somalia (nearly $12.5 million). The U.S. has since announced an additional $4 million in Covid-19 assistance for Somalia, but seemingly none for Libya.",www.theintercept.com,left,znOalka3TpUvJ35a

Their effort faced steep odds . The compound , which was located in a remote , hilly area , surrounded by scrub , was guarded by about half a dozen gunmen , already jittery about a possible repeat of the previous rescue attempt .

It remained to be seen whether the killings represented a larger shift in the tactics of Al Qaeda, which has largely turned away from executing hostages in recent years in favor of negotiating ransoms — a contrast to the frequent executions carried out by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. When they have faced military raids, Al Qaeda militants have executed hostages.

The operation on Saturday began at about 1 a.m. The SEAL Team 6 commandos, joined by a small number of Yemeni counterterrorism troops, swept toward the village aboard V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft under cover of darkness early Saturday local time. They landed several hundred yards from the compound in an effort to remain undetected.

Their effort faced steep odds. The compound, which was located in a remote, hilly area, surrounded by scrub, was guarded by about half a dozen gunmen, already jittery about a possible repeat of the previous rescue attempt. And the approach to the compound was sufficiently difficult that the commandos had virtually no element of surprise, which they typically plan for and rely on. The commandos were detected when they were less than 100 yards from the compound. It was not clear what alerted the militants.",www.nytimes.com,left,m075Rm8Lz1Q1qkoT

President Barack Obama’s decision to swap long-missing Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay has unleashed a fusillade of criticism from lawmakers, who have blasted the president’s move as both reckless and lawless.

For the White House, it means answering uncomfortable questions about why Congress wasn’t told of the deal before it happened — as federal law demands — and what went into the administration’s media strategy, including fresh scrutiny of comments National Security Adviser Susan Rice made on a Sunday morning talk show.

Story Continued Below

The president on Tuesday defended his administration’s efforts to rescue Bergdahl from captivity.

“Regardless of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an American soldier back if he’s held in captivity. Period. Full stop. We don’t condition that,” he said in Warsaw, on the first leg of this week’s European trip.

His arguments are unlikely to put the questions to rest. There are worries about the deal and the precedent it could set for others in U.S. custody as well as other American service members who could be captured in the future. And the future of Sgt. Bergdahl is anything but certain.

Here’s a look at some of the key questions about the Bergdahl-Taliban trade:

Bigger than Benghazi?

The prison swap is showing signs of becoming a major flashpoint with the staying power, at least within conservative circles, of Benghazi.

Republicans see the prisoner swap as representing all that is wrong with Obama, a go-it-alone president who negotiates with bad foreign actors and flouts the rule of law to achieve his own ends.

( Also on POLITICO: Rogers: 'A price' for U.S. soldiers)

House and Senate Republicans accused Obama of acting illegally, citing laws requiring that the administration provide Congress notice at least 30 days ahead of releasing Guantanamo Bay detainees. House Armed Services Chairman Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) pledged Monday to hold hearings, as Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) pressed for investigations in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Conservatives are also combing through the statements of Bergdahl’s father to cast him as unpatriotic — and his son has been tagged as a deserter by some of his fellow soldiers.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) raised doubts Monday that Bergdahl was even in grave health — the reason provided by administration officials as to why they couldn’t abide by the 30-day notification requirement.

“There’s no indication of that other than what the president says,” Chambliss said, “and I don’t believe a thing this president says now.”

The president’s move to defy Congress also fuels Republican assertions that Obama is guilty of hypocrisy for railing against a raft of signing statements President George W. Bush issued disclaiming his duty to enforce aspects of legislation he considered unconstitutional.

One former administration official said that when Obama issued signing statements in recent years saying he might “interpret” the law to make sure he had flexibility to transfer detainees “swiftly,” he was intentionally preserving his right to act in circumstances like the Bergdahl swap.

“The signing statement was put in for this exact thing,” said one former official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s the strongest conceivable example of a commander-in-chief exercising his authority.”

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday that Obama had never foresworn signing statements entirely, but simply argued that Bush over-relied on them.

“It’s often misreported that [Obama] somehow took a position against all signing statements, which was never the case,” Carney said. “He made clear that there were times when it would be appropriate, but that the authority to issue signing statements should not be overused or abused, and that a president should exercise restraint. And I think if you look at his record in office — now five and a half years in office you’ll see that restraint demonstrated.”

What did Congress know and when did it know it?

Over the weekend the administration seemed to flaunt the fact that they had not complied with legislation requiring the president to give Congress 30-days notice before transferring prisoners out of Guantanamo. In a statement issued Saturday night, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he had just notified Congress of the transfer.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — America ’ s longest war may finally be nearing an end .
The United States and the Islamists it toppled from power in Afghanistan are poised to sign a peace deal Saturday after a conflict that outlasted two U.S. commanders in chief and is now led by a third eager to fulfill a campaign promise to extricate America from “ endless wars . ”
More than 18 years since President George W. Bush ordered bombing in response to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , the agreement will set the stage for the withdrawal of U.S. troops , some of whom were not yet born when the World Trade Center collapsed on that crisp , sunny morning that changed how Americans see the world .
Saturday ’ s ceremony also signals the potential end of a tremendous investment of blood and treasure . The U.S. spent more than $ 750 billion , and on all sides the war cost tens of thousands of lives lost , permanently scarred and indelibly interrupted . Yet it ’ s also a conflict that is frequently ignored by U.S. politicians and the American public .

It will likely be an uncomfortable appearance for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , who privately told a conference of U.S. ambassadors at the State Department this week that he was going only because President Donald Trump had insisted on his participation , according to two people present .
A statement from Trump on Friday said Pompeo will “ witness ” the signing of the agreement , leaving unclear if he will personally sign it on behalf of the United States , or if he will shake hands with Taliban representatives .
U.S. troops are to be withdrawn to 8,600 from about 13,000 in the weeks following Saturday ’ s signing . Further drawdowns are to depend on the Taliban meeting certain counter-terrorism conditions , compliance that will be assessed by the United States . But officials say soldiers will be coming home .
Trump , as he seeks re-election this year , is looking to make good on his campaign promise to bring troops home from the Middle East . Still , he has approached the Taliban agreement cautiously , steering clear of the crowing surrounding other major foreign policy actions , such as his talks with North Korea .
Last September , on short notice , he called off what was to be a signing ceremony with the Taliban at Camp David after a series of new Taliban attacks . But he has since been supportive of the talks led by his special envoy , Zalmay Khalilzad .
In a statement released by the White House , Trump said Friday that if the Taliban and Afghan governments live up to the commitments in the agreement , “ we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home , ”
“ These commitments represent an important step to a lasting peace in a new Afghanistan , free from al-Qaida , ISIS and any other terrorist group that would seek to bring us harm , ” Trump said .
Under the agreement , the Taliban promise not to let extremists use the country as a staging ground for attacking the U.S. or its allies . But U.S. officials are loath to trust the Taliban to fulfill their obligations .
Pompeo did not mention the Afghan agreement as he touted Trump administration foreign policy achievements in a speech to a conservative group Friday . He has expressed doubts about the prospects . Yet , he will give his imprimatur to an agreement which he also has said represents “ a historic opportunity for peace ” after years and pain and suffering .
“ We are now on the cusp of having an opportunity which may not succeed , but an opportunity for the first time to let the Afghan peoples ’ voices be heard , ” he told reporters this week .
If the agreement is successful , Afghanistan , the “ graveyard of empires ” that has repeatedly repelled foreign invaders from imperial Britain and Russia to the Soviet Union , will have once again successfully turned away a world power from its landlocked borders .
But prospects for Afghanistan ’ s future are uncertain . The agreement sets the stage for peace talks involving Afghani factions , which are likely to be complicated . Under the agreement , 5,000 Taliban are to be released from Afghan-run jails , but it ’ s not known if the Afghan government will do that . There are also questions about whether Taliban fighters loyal to various warlords will be willing to disarm .
It ’ s not clear what will become of gains made in women ’ s rights since the toppling of the Taliban , which had repressed women and girls under a strict brand of Sharia law . Women ’ s rights in Afghanistan had been a top concern of both the Bush and Obama administration .
In a sign of “ the international community ’ s commitment to Afghanistan , ” a separate ceremony will be held Saturday in the Afghan capital of Kabul , with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg , said Sediq Sediqqui , spokesman for Afghanistan ’ s President Ashraf Ghani .

Pompeo said , “ We ’ re proud of our gains , but our generals have determined that this war is unlikely to be won militarily without tremendous additional resources . All sides are tired of fighting . ”
On this , he is in rare agreement with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , who said this week in a Democratic presidential debate that the government has “ a sacred responsibility to ” American soldiers . “ That is not to use our military to solve problems that can not be solved militarily .

WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s longest war may finally be nearing an end.

The United States and the Islamists it toppled from power in Afghanistan are poised to sign a peace deal Saturday after a conflict that outlasted two U.S. commanders in chief and is now led by a third eager to fulfill a campaign promise to extricate America from “endless wars.”

More than 18 years since President George W. Bush ordered bombing in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the agreement will set the stage for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, some of whom were not yet born when the World Trade Center collapsed on that crisp, sunny morning that changed how Americans see the world.

Saturday’s ceremony also signals the potential end of a tremendous investment of blood and treasure. The U.S. spent more than $750 billion, and on all sides the war cost tens of thousands of lives lost, permanently scarred and indelibly interrupted. Yet it’s also a conflict that is frequently ignored by U.S. politicians and the American public.

In the Qatari capital of Doha, America’s top diplomat will stand with leaders of the Taliban, Afghanistan’s former rulers who harbored Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network as they plotted, and then celebrated, the hijackings of four airliners that were crashed into lower Manhattan, the Pentagon and a field in western Pennsylvania, killing almost 3,000 people.

It will likely be an uncomfortable appearance for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who privately told a conference of U.S. ambassadors at the State Department this week that he was going only because President Donald Trump had insisted on his participation, according to two people present.

A statement from Trump on Friday said Pompeo will “witness” the signing of the agreement, leaving unclear if he will personally sign it on behalf of the United States, or if he will shake hands with Taliban representatives.

U.S. troops are to be withdrawn to 8,600 from about 13,000 in the weeks following Saturday’s signing. Further drawdowns are to depend on the Taliban meeting certain counter-terrorism conditions, compliance that will be assessed by the United States. But officials say soldiers will be coming home.

Trump, as he seeks re-election this year, is looking to make good on his campaign promise to bring troops home from the Middle East. Still, he has approached the Taliban agreement cautiously, steering clear of the crowing surrounding other major foreign policy actions, such as his talks with North Korea.

Last September, on short notice, he called off what was to be a signing ceremony with the Taliban at Camp David after a series of new Taliban attacks. But he has since been supportive of the talks led by his special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad.

In a statement released by the White House, Trump said Friday that if the Taliban and Afghan governments live up to the commitments in the agreement, “we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home,”

“These commitments represent an important step to a lasting peace in a new Afghanistan, free from al-Qaida, ISIS and any other terrorist group that would seek to bring us harm,” Trump said.

Under the agreement, the Taliban promise not to let extremists use the country as a staging ground for attacking the U.S. or its allies. But U.S. officials are loath to trust the Taliban to fulfill their obligations.

Pompeo did not mention the Afghan agreement as he touted Trump administration foreign policy achievements in a speech to a conservative group Friday. He has expressed doubts about the prospects. Yet, he will give his imprimatur to an agreement which he also has said represents “a historic opportunity for peace” after years and pain and suffering.

“We are now on the cusp of having an opportunity which may not succeed, but an opportunity for the first time to let the Afghan peoples’ voices be heard,” he told reporters this week.

If the agreement is successful, Afghanistan, the “graveyard of empires” that has repeatedly repelled foreign invaders from imperial Britain and Russia to the Soviet Union, will have once again successfully turned away a world power from its landlocked borders.

But prospects for Afghanistan’s future are uncertain. The agreement sets the stage for peace talks involving Afghani factions, which are likely to be complicated . Under the agreement, 5,000 Taliban are to be released from Afghan-run jails, but it’s not known if the Afghan government will do that. There are also questions about whether Taliban fighters loyal to various warlords will be willing to disarm.

It’s not clear what will become of gains made in women’s rights since the toppling of the Taliban, which had repressed women and girls under a strict brand of Sharia law. Women’s rights in Afghanistan had been a top concern of both the Bush and Obama administration.

In a sign of “the international community’s commitment to Afghanistan,” a separate ceremony will be held Saturday in the Afghan capital of Kabul, with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, said Sediq Sediqqui, spokesman for Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani.

Already, some U.S. lawmakers and veterans of the conflict have raised red flags about any agreement with the Taliban.

Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming led 21 Republican legislators in demanding that the administration not concede anything to the Taliban that would allow them to once again harbor those who seek to harm U.S. citizens and interests. Cheney, the daughter of former President Bush’s vice president, Dick Cheney, urged Pompeo and Esper in a letter to reject any commitment to a full withdrawal of American troops.

Pompeo said, “We’re proud of our gains, but our generals have determined that this war is unlikely to be won militarily without tremendous additional resources. All sides are tired of fighting.”

On this, he is in rare agreement with Sen.

Mcmaster, Charles King, Alexander Cooley, Daniel H. Nexon, Aaron David Miller, Francis Fukuyama, Jennifer Lind, Daryl G. Press, Stephen Wertheim","In the decades after the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam , the simplistic but widely held belief that the war had been unjustified and unwinnable gave way to “ the Vietnam syndrome ” —a conviction that the United States should avoid all military interventions abroad . The mantra of “ no more Vietnams ” dominated foreign policy , muting more concrete discussions of what should be learned from that experience . Instead , the analogy was applied indiscriminately ; U.S. military operations in the Balkans , the Horn of Africa , Latin America , and the Middle East prompted assertions that the use of force would lead to “ another Vietnam. ” It was not until the United States won a lopsided victory over the military of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the 1990–91 Gulf War that President George H. W. Bush could declare that the United States had finally “ kicked the Vietnam syndrome . ”
Nearly three decades later , however , a new mantra of “ ending endless wars ” has emerged from frustrations over indecisive , protracted , and costly military interventions abroad . These frustrations have reproduced the Vietnam syndrome in a new guise : the Afghanistan-Iraq syndrome . Across the political spectrum , many Americans have come to believe that retrenchment would not only avoid the costs of military operations overseas but also improve U.S. security . They have found support for this belief in analyses like those that appeared in this magazine ’ s lead package for its March/April 2020 issue , titled “ Come Home , America ? ”
The authors of the articles in that package offered different variations on the retrenchment theme . But what some of the articles have in common is an appeal that reflects strong emotions rather than an accurate understanding of what went wrong in the wars that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks . Proponents of a U.S. withdrawal from its military commitments play to visceral feelings of war weariness and argue that the difficulties of those wars were the inevitable consequence of the United States ’ misguided pursuit of armed domination . Some retrenchers depict U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War as a fool ’ s errand , impelled by a naive crusade to remake the world in the United States ’ image . And although advocates of retrenchment often identify as realists , they subscribe to the romantic view that restraint abroad is almost always an unmitigated good . In fact , disengagement from competitions overseas would increase dangers to the United States ; the paltry savings realized would be dwarfed by the eventual cost of responding to unchecked and undeterred threats to American security , prosperity , and influence .
In their critiques of the post-9/11 wars , retrenchers fail to acknowledge the hidden costs of their recommendations . Although a majority of Americans now agree that the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 was a mistake , retrenchment advocates ignore the consequences of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011 and of the broader disengagement from the Middle East that accompanied it . Those steps ceded space to jihadi terrorists and Iranian proxies , thereby creating an ideal environment for the return of sectarian violence and the establishment of the self-declared caliphate of the Islamic State ( or ISIS ) . The Obama administration made similar mistakes in Libya earlier in 2011 , after pushing for a NATO air campaign that helped depose the dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi . Although it was determined to avoid the mistakes of the George W. Bush administration ’ s war in Iraq , the Obama administration paradoxically exceeded them , failing to shape Libya ’ s political environment in the wake of Qaddafi ’ s demise ; nearly a decade later , the Libyan civil war rages on , and the country remains a source and a transit point for millions seeking escape from turmoil in northern Africa and the Sahel .
Retrenchers ignore the fact that the risks and costs of inaction are sometimes higher than those of engagement . In August 2013 , the Syrian regime used poison gas to kill more than 1,400 innocent civilians , including hundreds of children . Despite U.S. President Barack Obama ’ s declaration in 2012 that the use of these heinous weapons to murder civilians would cross a redline , the United States did not respond with military force . U.S. inaction enabled the regime ’ s brutality , emboldening Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian and Russian supporters to intensify their mass homicide . In 2017–18 , U.S. President Donald Trump finally enforced the Obama administration ’ s redline , retaliating against the use of chemical weapons by Assad with strikes against the Syrian military . But Trump ’ s decision in 2019 to withdraw U.S. forces from eastern Syria complicated efforts to eliminate ISIS and bolstered the influence of Assad and his sponsors in an area whose control would give them a significant advantage in the war . Almost nine years since the Syrian civil war began , a humanitarian catastrophe continues in Idlib Province , which , at the end of 2019 , generated over a million more refugees , many of whom succumbed to extreme cold or the novel coronavirus .
Retrenchers ignore the fact that the risks and costs of inaction are sometimes higher than those of engagement .
Despite evidence that U.S. disengagement can make a bad situation worse , retrenchers have pushed for a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan . The agreement signed between the United States and the Taliban in February 2020 will allow the Taliban , al Qaeda , and various other jihadi terrorists to claim victory , recruit more young people to their cause , gain control of more territory , and inflict suffering through the imposition of draconian sharia . Just as the Syrian civil war and the rise of ISIS generated a refugee crisis that reached into Europe , the establishment of an Islamic emirate in a large portion of Afghanistan would generate another wave of refugees and further destabilize Pakistan , a nuclear-armed nation of over 220 million people . Terrorist organizations that already enjoy safe haven in the Afghan-Pakistani border region will increase their profits from illicit activities such as the narcotics trade and apply those resources to intensify and expand their murderous campaigns . Retrenchers do not acknowledge that U.S. withdrawal often leaves a vacuum that enemies and adversaries are eager to fill .
Retrenchment advocates are relatively unconcerned about enemies gaining strength overseas because they assume that the United States ’ geographic blessings—including its natural resources and the vast oceans that separate it from the rest of the world—will keep Americans safe . But in today ’ s interconnected world , threats from transnational terrorists ( or viruses , for that matter ) do not remain confined to particular regions . The humanitarian , security , and political consequences of the conflicts in Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , Syria , and Yemen have reached well beyond the Middle East and South Asia . Just as China ’ s concealment of the coronavirus forestalled actions that might have prevented a global catastrophe , the United States ’ withdrawal of support for its partners on the frontlines against jihadi terrorists could generate staggering costs if the terrorists succeed in penetrating U.S. borders as they did on September 11 , 2001 . And a reduction of U.S. support for allies and partners along the frontiers of hostile states , such as Iran and North Korea , or revisionist powers , such as China and Russia , could result in a shift in the balance of power and influence away from the United States . Retrenchment could also result in a failure to deter aggression and prevent a disastrous war .
Retrenchers also overlook the trend that the security associated with the United States ’ geographic advantages has been diminishing . In 1960 , the historian C. Vann Woodward observed that technologies such as the conventional aircraft , jet propulsion , the ballistic missile , and the atomic-powered submarine marked “ the end of the era of free security. ” Those technologies overtook “ Americans so suddenly and swiftly that they have not brought themselves to face its practical implications. ” Retrenchers are out of step with history and way behind the times .
Even the most compelling arguments for sustained engagement overseas are unlikely to convince hardcore retrenchers , because they believe that an overly powerful United States is the principal cause of the world ’ s problems . Their pleas for disengagement are profoundly narcissistic , as they perceive geopolitical actors only in relation to the United States . In their view , other actors—whether friends or foes—possess no aspirations and no agency , except in reaction to U.S. policies and actions . Retrenchers ignore the fact that sometimes wars choose you rather than the other way around : only after the most devastating terrorist attack in history did the United States invade Afghanistan .
In the “ Come Home , America ? ” package , Jennifer Lind and Daryl Press argue in “ Reality Check ” that abandoning what they describe as Washington ’ s pursuit of primacy would quell China and Russia while providing opportunities for cooperation on issues of climate change , terrorism , and nuclear proliferation . And in “ The Price of Primacy , ” Stephen Wertheim asserts that a less threatening United States could “ transform globalization into a governable and sustainable force ” and bring about a reduction in jihadi terrorism , a less aggressive China , a curtailment of Russian interference , the cessation of Iran ’ s proxy wars , the termination of North Korea ’ s threat to U.S. and regional security and human rights , and even progress against the threat from climate change .
If these promises seem too good to be true , it ’ s because they are . Retrenchment hard-liners are confident in such claims because they assume that the United States has preponderant control over future global security and prosperity . In reality , adversaries have the power to act based on their own aspirations and goals : American behavior did not cause jihadi terrorism , Chinese economic aggression , Russian political subversion , or the hostility of Iran and North Korea . And U.S. disengagement would not attenuate those challenges or make them easier to overcome .
The movement in favor of retrenchment is in part a reaction to the overoptimism that animated U.S. foreign policy in the 1990s . When the Soviet Union collapsed and the Cold War ended , some thinkers and policymakers assumed that the process of democratization that was unfolding in eastern Europe would be replicable in Africa , Asia , and the Middle East . But they failed to give due consideration to local contexts and to political , social , cultural , and religious dynamics that make liberal democracy and the rule of law hard to reach . Similarly , after the United States ’ lopsided military victory in the Gulf War , some assumed that future wars could be won quickly and decisively because U.S. technology had produced a “ revolution in military affairs. ” But this presumption ignored continuities in the nature of war , such as the enemy ’ s say in a war ’ s course of events and its political , human , and psychological complexities . Excessive optimism soon grew into hubris , setting the United States up for unanticipated difficulties in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The best antidote to such overconfidence , however , is not the excessive pessimism offered by retrenchers . Policymakers should instead adopt what the historian Zachary Shore calls “ strategic empathy ” : an understanding of the ideology , emotions , and aspirations that drive and constrain other actors . Strategic empathy might help at least some advocates of retrenchment qualify their adamant opposition to democracy promotion and human rights advocacy abroad and might allow them to accept that the United States can not determine , but can influence , the evolution of a world in which free and open societies flourish . In recent years , protests against authoritarian rule and corruption have flared up all over the world . In Baghdad , Beirut , Caracas , Hong Kong , Khartoum , Moscow , and Tehran , people have made clear that they want a say in how they are governed . Support for those who strive for freedom is in the United States ’ interest , because a world in which liberty , democracy , and the rule of law are strengthened will be safer and more prosperous . Disengagement from competitions overseas would cede influence to others , such as the Chinese Communist Party , which is already redoubling efforts to promote its authoritarian model . Retrenchment may hold emotional appeal for Americans tired of protracted military commitments abroad , but blind adherence to an orthodoxy based on emotion rather than reason would make Americans less safe and put the United States further in the red .","In the decades after the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, the simplistic but widely held belief that the war had been unjustified and unwinnable gave way to “the Vietnam syndrome”—a conviction that the United States should avoid all military interventions abroad.

He walked into Iran's trap.,2020-01-02,,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year . He was forced to postpone his trip to Kyiv , Ukraine , this week to attend to the new crisis in Iraq . As fraught as Pompeo ’ s visit to Kyiv was going to be , in the shadow of the impeachment battle , Iraq trumped Kyiv after the New Year ’ s Eve attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad .
It is President Donald Trump ’ s failed policy toward Iran that has brought us to this combustible moment .
Iraq is a tough country under any circumstances , made more so after the 2003 U.S. invasion that upended the Middle East and cost so much in U.S. lives and treasure . But Iraq also created strange bedfellows . The U.S. troops worked alongside Iraqi and Iranian militia to destroy a common enemy , the Islamic State terrorism group . And even as Washington was confronting Iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere , we maintained an uneasy coexistence in Iraq , where Tehran holds considerable sway .
That uneasy balance was destroyed when Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , better known as the Iran nuclear deal . Like other critics of the agreement , Trump believed it should have resolved all of America ’ s issues with Iran . Trump believed we were giving Tehran benefits without a requisite return . He thought a `` maximum pressure '' campaign would ultimately bring Iran to its knees , or incite a popular uprising against its theocratic regime .
Like much of Trump ’ s national security and foreign policy , his Iran approach is tactical and not strategic . The results have been devastating to U.S. interests . Iran ’ s most extreme hard-liners , the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) and Quds force , which never wanted the nuclear deal , have gained more power , arguing that the United States couldn ’ t be trusted to honor any agreement .
Iran ’ s nefarious activities in the region have increased , because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions . Indeed , the IRGC has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under Trump ’ s sanctions . And Iran , after complying with the deal for nearly three years , now confronted with `` maximum pressure '' and no diplomatic track , has begun to unwind its compliance .
Learning to manage conflict : As Iraq violence flares , how do we stop wars from happening in the 2020s ?
In Iraq , Iranian-backed militia , led by Kataeb Hezbollah , have worked to increase their power as the Iraq central government has nearly collapsed under the weight of months of popular protests against government corruption . A rocket attack by the Kataeb Hezbollah militia last Friday killed an American contractor and injured many . The Trump administration retaliated with airstrikes two days later , leading to the New Year 's Eve attack on our embassy .
Most would agree that the United States had to respond in some way to the death of an American , but whether the airstrike was the right and proportionate measure is debatable .
Regardless , if the Trump administration really understood the dynamics of Iraq , it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the U.S. Embassy . Administration officials might have worked more closely with the Iraq government to think through the best way forward . Instead , in essence , Trump walked into Iran ’ s trap .
For many Americans , the Baghdad militia chants of `` Death to America '' echoed the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 , raising the specter of another hostage crisis .
The immediate emergency at our embassy in Baghdad has subsided . Kataeb Hezbollah has withdrawn its militia from outside the compound , declaring that they have delivered the necessary message to America . They want the 5,000 U.S. troops out of Iraq .
Nonetheless , perhaps even Pompeo understands that a longer-term challenge remains , and thus his change of travel plans .
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw American troops from just about everywhere . But a withdrawal from Iraq at this moment only serves Iran ’ s desire to exert greater control over Iraq . To much of the world , it would signal U.S. disengagement and weakness — not strength .

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year. He was forced to postpone his trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, this week to attend to the new crisis in Iraq. As fraught as Pompeo’s visit to Kyiv was going to be, in the shadow of the impeachment battle, Iraq trumped Kyiv after the New Year’s Eve attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

It is President Donald Trump’s failed policy toward Iran that has brought us to this combustible moment.

Iraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 U.S. invasion that upended the Middle East and cost so much in U.S. lives and treasure. But Iraq also created strange bedfellows. The U.S. troops worked alongside Iraqi and Iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the Islamic State terrorism group. And even as Washington was confronting Iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in Iraq, where Tehran holds considerable sway.

That uneasy balance was destroyed when Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal. Like other critics of the agreement, Trump believed it should have resolved all of America’s issues with Iran. Trump believed we were giving Tehran benefits without a requisite return. He thought a ""maximum pressure"" campaign would ultimately bring Iran to its knees, or incite a popular uprising against its theocratic regime.

Trump policies devastate US interests

Like much of Trump’s national security and foreign policy, his Iran approach is tactical and not strategic. The results have been devastating to U.S. interests. Iran’s most extreme hard-liners, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Quds force, which never wanted the nuclear deal, have gained more power, arguing that the United States couldn’t be trusted to honor any agreement.

Iran’s nefarious activities in the region have increased, because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions. Indeed, the IRGC has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under Trump’s sanctions. And Iran, after complying with the deal for nearly three years, now confronted with ""maximum pressure"" and no diplomatic track, has begun to unwind its compliance.

Learning to manage conflict:As Iraq violence flares, how do we stop wars from happening in the 2020s?

In Iraq, Iranian-backed militia, led by Kataeb Hezbollah, have worked to increase their power as the Iraq central government has nearly collapsed under the weight of months of popular protests against government corruption. A rocket attack by the Kataeb Hezbollah militia last Friday killed an American contractor and injured many. The Trump administration retaliated with airstrikes two days later, leading to the New Year's Eve attack on our embassy.

Most would agree that the United States had to respond in some way to the death of an American, but whether the airstrike was the right and proportionate measure is debatable.

Regardless, if the Trump administration really understood the dynamics of Iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the U.S. Embassy. Administration officials might have worked more closely with the Iraq government to think through the best way forward. Instead, in essence, Trump walked into Iran’s trap.

For many Americans, the Baghdad militia chants of ""Death to America"" echoed the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, raising the specter of another hostage crisis.

Iran nuclear deal was solid progress

The immediate emergency at our embassy in Baghdad has subsided. Kataeb Hezbollah has withdrawn its militia from outside the compound, declaring that they have delivered the necessary message to America. They want the 5,000 U.S. troops out of Iraq.

Nonetheless, perhaps even Pompeo understands that a longer-term challenge remains, and thus his change of travel plans.

Trump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw American troops from just about everywhere. But a withdrawal from Iraq at this moment only serves Iran’s desire to exert greater control over Iraq. To much of the world, it would signal U.S. disengagement and weakness — not strength.

Even some of the harshest critics of the Iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. The Iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. Such a capability would project even greater Iranian power in the Middle East and deter the ability of Washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.

us_military,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/27/politics/isis-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-operation-donald-trump/index.html,President Trump: ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead,2019-10-27,"Maegan Vazquez, Zachary Cohen, Kevin Liptak","Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump declared Sunday morning that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dead after a US military raid in northwest Syria over the weekend .
The President said a US special operations forces mission went after the ISIS leader and there were no US deaths during the operation .
Several ISIS fighters and companions of Baghdadi were killed , including two women wearing suicide vests and three children . Trump would not provide a specific number of casualties , only describing those targeted on scene as `` more dead than alive . '' Eleven children were moved out of the house and are uninjured , the President said .
The death of Baghdadi marks the culmination of a years-long hunt to find one of the most wanted terrorists in the world and the man who declared a so-called Islamic caliphate in Iraq and Syria in 2014 . But it also comes as the US military is pulling back in Syria , a move analysts warn could allow for an ISIS resurgence
But Trump insisted Baghdadi 's demise had nothing to do with the US 's recent decision to pull out of northern Syria . `` No , the pullout had nothing to do with this . In fact we found this out at a very similar time , '' Trump said . `` No , we 're after these leaders , and we have others in site . ''

Trump said Baghdadi was chased to the end of a dead end tunnel by dogs ,
bringing three children with him . At the end of the tunnel , he detonated a suicide vest , killing himself and the children with him .
The President said `` immediate '' and `` totally positive '' test results proved it was Baghdadi , saying a lab technician on the scene of the raid confirmed the ISIS leader 's death .
`` He died like a dog . He died like a coward . The world is now a much safer place , '' Trump said .
Trump described the situation , saying the ISIS leader `` spent his last moments in utter fear , in total panic and dread , terrified of the American forces bearing down on him . ''
The President said US forces obtained `` highly sensitive material and information from the raid , much having to do with ISIS — origins , future plans , things that we very much want . ''
Trump told reporters Baghdadi was under surveillance for a couple of weeks and that two to three planned missions were scrapped before the successful one was launched .
The US flew over certain Russian airspace during the mission , he said .
The President said he watched the operation from the White House Situation Room beginning at 5 p.m . The mission , he said , began shortly thereafter and went on for about two hours . He was accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence , National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien , Secretary of Defense Mark Esper , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark A. Milley , and Brig . Gen. Marcus Evans , Deputy Director for Special Operations , according to Assistant to the President Dan Scavino .
CIA Director Gina Haspel did play a role in the operation on Saturday , according to a source familiar with the matter . She would have been monitoring from CIA headquarters and in touch with the Situation Room , similar to how then-CIA Director Leon Panetta was positioned during the Osama bin Laden operation .
Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was not in the Situation Room either , but an ODNI spokesperson said Maguire was `` fully aware and engaged in the planning . For the operation itself , he was out of town due to a pre-arranged engagement but watched with the CENTCOM commander . ''
`` Last night was a great night for United States and for the world , '' the President said . He described in sometimes brutal terms how al-Baghdadi died .
He said the leader , `` spent his last moments in utter fear ... terrified of the American forces bearing down on him . '' He described Baghdadi as , `` crying , whimpering , screaming , and bringing three kids with him . To die . Certain death . ''
Baghdadi 's body may be disposed at sea , a source familiar with the matter told CNN . O'Brien told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' Sunday that he expected the US to follow the same protocol as Bin Laden , who was killed in a 2011 raid in Pakistan by US Navy SEALs and was buried at sea .
Baghdadi 's body , O'Brien said , `` will be disposed of properly . '' When asked if the US would follow the same protocol as Bin Laden , O'Brien said , `` I would expect that to be the case . ''
The President said he informed a few members of Congress of the raid ahead of his announcement , including Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee , and Republican Sen. Richard Burr , who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee . Trump said he did not inform key Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . Trump said a leak of the raid could have cost American lives .
Pelosi 's office confirmed to CNN 's Manu Raju there was no notice given ahead of the raid to it .
`` This month , the House passed a joint resolution on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 354-60 basis which rejects President Trump 's green-lighting of Turkish aggression into Syria against our Kurdish partners , and calls on him to present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS , '' Pelosi said in a statement issued Sunday . `` The House must be briefed on this raid , which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance , and on the Administration 's overall strategy in the region . Our military and allies deserve strong , smart and strategic leadership from Washington . ''
Schumer said at an unrelated press conference in New York City Sunday that he learned about Baghdadi 's death by seeing it on television .
`` I did n't know . I saw it on TV , '' Schumer said . When asked for his reaction to the news , Schumer added , `` My reaction ? Look , it 's great that we 've gotten al-Baghdadi and killed him . He 's a dangerous man , an evil man . The fight against ISIS has to continue . ''
Trump said it was a `` very dangerous mission , '' regarding flying in and flying out . He thanked Russia , Turkey , Syria , Iraq and Syrian Kurds for helping in the mission .
But the Russian military on Sunday questioned the official US account of the raid , saying it was not aware of any US military operations in the region .
During the mission , he said , US service members were met with local gunfire , which was eliminated .

Trump also said the raid does not impact his decision to withdraw troops from Syria .
`` We do n't want to keep soldiers between Syria and Turkey for the next 100 years . They 've been fights for hundreds of years . We 're out but we are leaving soldiers to secure the oil . Now we may have to fight for the oil . That 's OK , '' Trump said .
The statement is a shift from what Esper said Friday , that the `` core mission '' in Syria `` remains what the mission in Syria began with , it 's always been about defeating the ISIS coalition . ''
O'Brien told `` Meet the Press '' that the raid , which led to Baghdadi 's death , was named after Kayla Mueller , an American who was killed in 2015 while being held hostage by ISIS .
Vice President Mike Pence told CBS 's `` Face the Nation '' that Baghdadi 's possible location was discussed `` earlier this week . ''
On Thursday , Trump and Pence were told there was a high probability he was in the compound , Pence said . Trump then directed his military commanders to develop options . Options were presented at a Friday morning meeting . Actionable intelligence allowed the President to make the decision to move forward with the raid on Saturday morning , Pence said .
Esper told CNN 's `` State of the Union '' Sunday morning that the President approved the raid `` late last week '' after being presented with different options . The objective , Esper said , was capturing Baghdadi or if necessary , killing him .
`` He reviewed them , asked some great questions , chose the option that we thought gave us the highest probability of success and confirmation that the head of ISIS would be there and either captured and killed and then we executed from there , '' Esper said .
The defense secretary also relayed that US forces told Baghdadi to surrender during the raid but he refused , disappearing down into a subterranean area .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also described Baghdadi 's death as an important development in the fight against ISIS , saying in a Sunday tweet that it `` marks a turning point '' in the effort .
`` Turkey will continue to support anti-terror efforts -- as it has done in the past , '' Erdogan said . `` I am confident that a decisive struggle against terrorism , in line with the spirit of alliance , will bring peace to all of humanity . ''
Esper added that `` we 're going to watch carefully next steps . And as a new leader and leaders pop up we 'll go after them as well . ''
Esper described the death of the ISIS leader as a `` devastating blow '' to ISIS . `` This is not just their leader , it 's their founder . He was an inspirational leader in many ways , '' Esper told Tapper . Esper also ABC News ' `` This Week '' on Sunday that `` less than 100 '' troops were on the ground for the raid on Baghdadi though , `` these are always much bigger operations , the tail of which stretches back deep into the intelligence community . ''
White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was not present in the Situation Room while Trump and top officials monitored the raid .
Mulvaney was out of town due to a family matter , the official said .
Diane Foley , the mother of the late James Foley , an American journalist who was abducted in 2012 by ISIS and later brutally murdered by the group , welcomed the news of Baghdadi 's death , saying Sunday that she 's `` grateful '' to Trump and the US military .
`` I hope this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups and pray that captured ISIS fighters will be brought to trial and held accountable , '' Foley , who serves as the president and founder of the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation , said in a statement .
CNN reported early Sunday morning that Baghdadi was believed to have been killed in the raid , according to a senior US defense official and a source with knowledge . The final confirmation was pending while DNA and biometric testing is conducted , both sources told CNN . The CIA assisted in locating the ISIS leader , the defense official said .
Baghdadi became the leader of Islamic State of Iraq ( ISI ) in 2010 . In 2013 , ISI declared its absorption of an al Qaeda-backed militant group in Syria and Baghdadi said that his group would now be known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL or ISIS ) .
Baghdadi has been in hiding for the last five years . In April , a video published by the ISIS media wing al-Furqan showed a man purporting to be Baghdadi . It was the first time he had been seen since July 2014 , when he spoke at the Great Mosque in Mosul .","Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump declared Sunday morning that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dead after a US military raid in northwest Syria over the weekend.

Bergdahl 's attorney , Eugene Fidell of Yale Law School , said the Army had scheduled an Article 32 investigation hearing on April 22 to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to proceed with a court-martial .
The Army said the investigation , similar to a civilian grand jury proceeding , would take place at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas .
Bergdahl , 28 , was released from Taliban custody last summer in a controversial prisoner swap that saw five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , transferred to Qatar , where they were required to remain for a year .
Bergdahl disappeared on June 30 , 2009 , from Combat Outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province in eastern Afghanistan and was subsequently captured . He disappeared from the outpost early one morning after doing guard duty , leaving behind his gun , ammunition and body armor .
An initial wave of euphoria over Bergdahl 's release was followed by a backlash among U.S. lawmakers angry because they were not given 30 days notice before the transfer of the Guantanamo prisoners , as required by law .
Some of Bergdahl 's former Army comrades also came forward and said they believed he deserted his post .
Former Army Sergeant Evan Buetow , who served with Bergdahl , said on Wednesday that the former war prisoner had been treated fairly by the Army and needed `` to answer for what he did . ''
`` He put all of our lives in danger , '' Buetow said . `` Men from our company died , when I do n't believe they would have if he would n't have left . ''
Republican lawmakers also backed the Army 's decision to move ahead with the charges . Senator John McCain , head of the Senate Armed Services Committee and himself a Vietnam War prisoner , said it was an `` important step '' toward determining Bergdahl 's accountability .
Representative Mac Thornberry , head of the House Armed Services Committee , accused the administration of making the case more difficult by failing `` to follow the law surrounding the release of the Taliban 5 . ''
Bergdahl 's case has been under review by General Mark Milley , head of U.S. Army Forces Command , who was asked to look at the circumstance surrounding Bergdahl 's capture .
As a result of the review , Bergdahl was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command , unit or place , said an Army spokesman at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , where Milley is based .
The desertion charge carries a maximum prison term of five years , while the misbehavior count carries a maximum term of life in prison , he said . The charges also carry a number of other potential punishments , including a dishonorable discharge , reduction in rank to private and forfeiture of all pay .
Bergdahl 's parents declined to comment on the Army 's decision to charge their son . Some residents in his hometown of Hailey , Idaho , also expressed reluctance to comment on the developments , citing anger at the community that came after it showed support for him following his release .
A rally for Bergdahl was abruptly canceled last summer amid the political uproar . The family and several supporters received threats by email and telephone , Hailey officials said .
Debbie O'Neill , one of the co-organizers of the canceled rally , said she thought people were shocked by the Army 's decision on Wednesday .
`` Other than that , I think we have to wait for the military justice system to play out , '' she said . `` I 'm sure the military has enough evidence to back up the charges , but my heart breaks for him ( Bergdahl ) . ''
After a period of rehabilitation following his release , Bergdahl was reassigned to military duties . He currently has an administrative role in an office at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio .
A spokeswoman at the base said it would be up to the lawyers to determine what would happen to Bergdahl now that he has been charged .","U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, a former Taliban prisoner in Afghanistan, was formally charged on Wednesday with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of the most serious count, the Army said.

The Army said the investigation, similar to a civilian grand jury proceeding, would take place at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.

Bergdahl, 28, was released from Taliban custody last summer in a controversial prisoner swap that saw five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, transferred to Qatar, where they were required to remain for a year.

Bergdahl disappeared on June 30, 2009, from Combat Outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province in eastern Afghanistan and was subsequently captured. He disappeared from the outpost early one morning after doing guard duty, leaving behind his gun, ammunition and body armor.

An initial wave of euphoria over Bergdahl's release was followed by a backlash among U.S. lawmakers angry because they were not given 30 days notice before the transfer of the Guantanamo prisoners, as required by law.

Some of Bergdahl's former Army comrades also came forward and said they believed he deserted his post.

Former Army Sergeant Evan Buetow, who served with Bergdahl, said on Wednesday that the former war prisoner had been treated fairly by the Army and needed ""to answer for what he did.""

""He put all of our lives in danger,"" Buetow said. ""Men from our company died, when I don't believe they would have if he wouldn't have left.""

Republican lawmakers also backed the Army's decision to move ahead with the charges. Senator John McCain, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee and himself a Vietnam War prisoner, said it was an ""important step"" toward determining Bergdahl's accountability.

Representative Mac Thornberry, head of the House Armed Services Committee, accused the administration of making the case more difficult by failing ""to follow the law surrounding the release of the Taliban 5.""

Bergdahl's case has been under review by General Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command, who was asked to look at the circumstance surrounding Bergdahl's capture.

As a result of the review, Bergdahl was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command, unit or place, said an Army spokesman at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where Milley is based.

The desertion charge carries a maximum prison term of five years, while the misbehavior count carries a maximum term of life in prison, he said. The charges also carry a number of other potential punishments, including a dishonorable discharge, reduction in rank to private and forfeiture of all pay.

Bergdahl's parents declined to comment on the Army's decision to charge their son. Some residents in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, also expressed reluctance to comment on the developments, citing anger at the community that came after it showed support for him following his release.

A rally for Bergdahl was abruptly canceled last summer amid the political uproar. The family and several supporters received threats by email and telephone, Hailey officials said.

Debbie O'Neill, one of the co-organizers of the canceled rally, said she thought people were shocked by the Army's decision on Wednesday.

""Other than that, I think we have to wait for the military justice system to play out,"" she said. ""I'm sure the military has enough evidence to back up the charges, but my heart breaks for him (Bergdahl).""

After a period of rehabilitation following his release, Bergdahl was reassigned to military duties. He currently has an administrative role in an office at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.

A draft of the plan obtained by The ███ shows that the Air Force is aiming to consolidate support operations under the umbrella of a single center , known as the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center .
The tricky endeavor would shuffle day-to-day base management issues — such as construction , maintenance and procurement of equipment and supplies — from under the authority of the senior generals who command the bases to the leadership of a two-star general who would run the support center , according to the draft proposal .
The plan was born out of a directive from Air Force leadership last year to reduce headquarters operations costs at least 20 percent by 2019 . It cites reductions contained in the Budget Control Act that were implemented by the Obama administration in 2011 .
The consolidation would affect the service ’ s 10 major commands , each of which specializes in areas such as technical training , management of non-nuclear combat air power and global air mobility .
The generals who oversee those commands function as senior executives , ensuring that core programs and missions run efficiently and effectively , said Army Col. Steve Warren , a Pentagon spokesman . Base management has included a measure of autonomy .
The proposal is similar to the way the Army and Navy are organized , but the Air Force has long resisted consolidation of support services , noting that bases are more integral parts of their operations than they are to other military branches .
Douglas Birkey , executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies , said budget pressure is so extreme that Air Force officials have had “ to come down very quickly on certain ramps to attain certain goals. ” That pressure , he said , drives “ some pretty aggressive moves ” that achieve short-term objectives but “ can undermine things in the long haul . ”
Senior Air Force officials say the plan will save money by eliminating redundancies in areas such as personnel . They say in the document that the shuffle will provide the Air Force with “ a once in a lifetime opportunity to more effectively and efficiently manage installation resources . ”
But one Pentagon official with knowledge of the plan and its potential implementation said it could cause rifts between generals who command the bases and the two-star generals who would be charged with overseeing the assigned resources .
The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation , speculated that such a move could create communications issues capable of obstructing day-to-day operations such as base repairs , training and finance decisions .
Space planning , engineering programs , cyberforce training management and readiness training are just a few of the dozens of the capabilities that will be ripped from the control of the major commanders and realigned under support center management , according to the draft plan .
“ I personally don ’ t think it ’ s going to work , ” the official said , pointing out that the Army ’ s version of the support service is a command-level unit while in the Air Force it would be placed under an existing command — a structure that could create potential bureaucratic conflicts of interest .
Air Force top brass are reviewing the draft plan . If all goes well , they should approve it within the next several days , the official said . At the end of the month , Air Force officials will regroup and decide how to move forward .
It remains to be seen how the plan will be received . The official said the three- and four-star generals who run the major commands were not receptive to an earlier version in which they would have been required to cede a greater measure of authority to the support center ’ s control .
The “ concept of operations ” document — or initial draft — shows that the support center would have control of services such as fuel distribution , vehicle and support equipment , material management , small-arms training and ammunition allocation . Although the official said some of that framework was altered after the generals reviewed and rebuked the proposal , it is unclear how much of the framework was carried forward to the revised plan .
Retired Gen. Charles F. Wald , former deputy commander of U.S. European Command , said the Air Force has to implement structural changes because it can not afford to chew through its budget at the current rate . Gen. Wald , who is now vice chairman and federal practice advisory partner for Deloitte , said the plan to consolidate base operations authority under the umbrella of a single support center on the surface “ makes perfect business sense . ”
“ I think we should have done this 20 years ago , ” he said . “ Here ’ s the problem : I would have done it if I had known how to do it . I didn ’ t . ”
Gen. Wald said Air Force generals who have resisted the plan probably are concerned that the support center will cost them power and prestige .
“ The majority of people , when they think they ’ re losing oversight or authority or the size of their command or whatever , they don ’ t want to do that because — to a lot of people — how big you are what your footprint is , is indicative of how important you are , ” he said .
The Pentagon official said the Air Force has experienced difficulty nailing down an expected amount of savings , but that might not hinder the progress the Air Force is making toward getting lawmakers to embrace the plan , Gen. Wald said .
Gen. Wald said Air Force officials likely have informed House and Senate staffers of their intentions , paving the way for a receptive conversation .
A Senate Armed Services committee staffer said Monday that the Air Force draft document has not made its way to the top echelon of congressional staff .
Air Force officials originally wanted to begin implementing the plan in October and staff the support center with 350 people . The draft document shows that although some personnel would be allowed to continue work for the major commands , they could function only as liaisons or specialists .
Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said the service is determining whether that 350 number will stick and how much personnel will be reduced out of each major command . The numbers , she said , are still fluid .

Within months , DoD will start standing up a new combatant command , a new space-procurement agency , and a new Space Operations Force .
The U.S. Defense Department this week will take the first steps to create the Space Force , a new branch of the military ordered up by President Trump but not yet fully backed by Congress .
In coming months , Defense Department leaders plan to stand up three of the four components of the new Space Force : a new combatant command for space , a new joint agency to buy satellites for the military , and a new warfighting community that draws space operators from all service branches . These sweeping changes — on par with the past decade ’ s establishment of cyber forces — are the part the Pentagon can do without lawmakers ’ approval .
Creating the fourth component — an entirely new branch of the military with services and support functions such as financial management and facilities construction — will require congressional action . Defense officials plan to spend the rest of 2018 building a “ legislative proposal for the authorities necessary to fully establish the Space Force. ” That would go to Congress early next year as part of the Trump administration ’ s 2020 budget proposal .
This plan , developed for execution by Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan , the Pentagon ’ s No . 2 civilian , is laid out in a 14-page draft report slated to go to lawmakers on Wednesday . ███ reviewed a draft of the report dated July 30 .

The Pentagon declined to comment on the report in advance of its formal release later this week .
The draft report says the Pentagon will , by year ’ s end , establish an eleventh unified combatant command : U.S. Space Command . Like U.S. Special Operations Command , which oversees special forces composed of servicemembers and organizations drawn from various service branches , the four-star Space Command will oversee space forces from across the military . The proposal goes even further than lawmakers demanded in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act , which orders the Pentagon to create a space command under U.S. Strategic Command .
“ The Department will recommend that the President revise the Unified Campaign Plan to create the new U.S. Space Command by the end of 2018 and evaluate the need for any additional personnel , responsibilities and authorities , ” the draft report says .

Space liaisons will be installed in the geographic combatant commands , starting with U.S. European Command .
The draft report says the Pentagon will also stand up a Space Operations Force , made up of uniformed and civilian space personnel from the four military services and the National Guard and Reserve .
“ Similar to Special Forces personnel provided by all military services , the Space Operations Force will be composed of the space personnel from all Military Services , but developed and managed as one community , ” it says .
This force would come together quickly : the goal is to deploy “ teams of space experts ” to U.S. European Command and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command by next summer .
The draft report heralds seismic changes in how the Pentagon buys , launches , and develops new technology for its satellites , including organizational and cultural shifts to emphasize speed and experimentation . It also plans a bigger role for private-sector space companies “ as commercial and government entities ‘ move toward the center ’ on requirements , regulation and compliance . ”
The centerpiece of this effort is a new joint office , dubbed the Space Development Agency , to oversee new satellite-development and space-launch contracts .
“ Major existing space acquisition programs will remain in current service organizations , and aggressively pursue improved performance , while the Space Development Agency develops and fields the capabilities outlined in the DoD Space Vision , ” the draft report says . “ Over time , as current programs complete , resources will shift from service space acquisition organizations to the Space Development Agency . ”
The biggest impact will be on the Air Force . The move clouds the future of the service ’ s Space and Missile Systems Center , the 6,000-person organization in Los Angeles that currently oversees about 85 percent of DoD ’ s space procurement budget — and which was recently restructured to speed the purchase and launch of satellites . The report calls this overhaul “ the start . ”
Like the Missile Defense Agency , the Space Development Agency would oversee acquisition projects across the various military services . Its size will be determined by a “ DoD governance committee in partnership with the intelligence community , ” the report said . Its location will be determined through “ an accelerated process that considers locations that best enable the Agency to attract talent , leverage commercial expertise and develop new capabilities at speed and scale . ”
Currently , the Air Force has hubs for space in Colorado , California , and Florida . The Army and Missile Defense Agency have a large presence in Huntsville , Alabama , an area nicknamed “ Rocket City ” for its large role in NASA and military space projects . The city is also known as “ Pentagon South ” due to the high concentration of Defense Department civilians there .
The report , which responds to a congressional mandate in the 2018 Defense Authorization Act , was largely written by Shanahan ’ s office and by Stephen Kitay , deputy assistant defense secretary for space policy , according to a senior defense official . Air Force officials were largely cut out of the review process several weeks ago , the official — and another source with knowledge of the decision — said on the condition of anonymity to speak about the yet-to-be-released report .
The idea of creating a new service-level organization to handle the military ’ s space operations has been contentious since lawmakers last year proposed to attach a space corps to the Air Force , along the lines of the Marine Corps and the Navy . Pentagon leaders , including Trump ’ s own Air Force Secretary , largely opposed that move . But in recent months , the president has mulled , and then stated his desire for , a Space Force . If it becomes reality , it would be the first new branch of the military since the Air Force was born out of the Army Air Corps in 1947 .
“ Both the chief of staff and I are actually very glad that … people are becoming more aware and having a debate about what we do about this as a nation . That just wasn ’ t really there before , ” Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said during a Washington Post event on July 25 .
“ I think the most important thing is to say focused on the warfighter and maintaining the lethality of the service , no matter how the org-chart boxes go , ” Wilson said . “ It ’ s all about the ability to fight . If we keep focused on that and not on which boxes move around which place in the Pentagon , then we ’ ll do the right thing for the nation . ”
Wilson ’ s predecessor , Deborah Lee James — who served as Air Force secretary during the Obama administration — said Monday that she opposes a Space Force , but supports the creation of a combatant command , like the one discussed in Shanahan ’ s report . She made her comments at a Brookings Institution event in Washington .
In recent years , the Air Force made numerous changes within its space arm to defend against Russian and Chinese interference . This week , the Pentagon is poised to announce a shift from “ few independent ” satellite constellations to a “ a proliferated low-Earth orbit architecture enabled by lower-cost commercial pace technology and access. ” Air Force officials hinted at these changes earlier this year when Shanahan visited Air Force Space Command in Colorado .
The Air Force operates 77 satellites in orbit while the Navy has 12 communications satellites , Wilson said .
“ Satellites are really pretty fragile things and so we have to think now about how do we defend a constellation . It not always just direct defense , ” she said . “ It may be that we distribute a network . If you have multiple nodes it ’ s inherently more resilient than if you ’ re relying on one thing . Some it may be maneuverability . Some of it may be deception . There ’ s a lot of ways to make sure the United States can take a punch and keep on operating . ”","A United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket carrying the third Mobile User Objective System satellite for the U.S. Navy creates a light trail as it lifts off on Jan. 20, 2015.

The report calls this overhaul “the start.”

Like the Missile Defense Agency, the Space Development Agency would oversee acquisition projects across the various military services. Its size will be determined by a “DoD governance committee in partnership with the intelligence community,” the report said. Its location will be determined through “an accelerated process that considers locations that best enable the Agency to attract talent, leverage commercial expertise and develop new capabilities at speed and scale.”

Currently, the Air Force has hubs for space in Colorado, California, and Florida. The Army and Missile Defense Agency have a large presence in Huntsville, Alabama, an area nicknamed “Rocket City” for its large role in NASA and military space projects. The city is also known as “Pentagon South” due to the high concentration of Defense Department civilians there.

The report, which responds to a congressional mandate in the 2018 Defense Authorization Act, was largely written by Shanahan’s office and by Stephen Kitay, deputy assistant defense secretary for space policy, according to a senior defense official. Air Force officials were largely cut out of the review process several weeks ago, the official — and another source with knowledge of the decision — said on the condition of anonymity to speak about the yet-to-be-released report.

From Idea to Plan

The idea of creating a new service-level organization to handle the military’s space operations has been contentious since lawmakers last year proposed to attach a space corps to the Air Force, along the lines of the Marine Corps and the Navy. Pentagon leaders, including Trump’s own Air Force Secretary, largely opposed that move. But in recent months, the president has mulled, and then stated his desire for, a Space Force. If it becomes reality, it would be the first new branch of the military since the Air Force was born out of the Army Air Corps in 1947.

“Both the chief of staff and I are actually very glad that … people are becoming more aware and having a debate about what we do about this as a nation. That just wasn’t really there before,” Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said during a Washington Post event on July 25.

“I think the most important thing is to say focused on the warfighter and maintaining the lethality of the service, no matter how the org-chart boxes go,” Wilson said. “It’s all about the ability to fight. If we keep focused on that and not on which boxes move around which place in the Pentagon, then we’ll do the right thing for the nation.”

Wilson’s predecessor, Deborah Lee James — who served as Air Force secretary during the Obama administration — said Monday that she opposes a Space Force, but supports the creation of a combatant command, like the one discussed in Shanahan’s report. She made her comments at a Brookings Institution event in Washington.

In recent years, the Air Force made numerous changes within its space arm to defend against Russian and Chinese interference. This week, the Pentagon is poised to announce a shift from “few independent” satellite constellations to a “a proliferated low-Earth orbit architecture enabled by lower-cost commercial pace technology and access.” Air Force officials hinted at these changes earlier this year when Shanahan visited Air Force Space Command in Colorado.

The Air Force operates 77 satellites in orbit while the Navy has 12 communications satellites, Wilson said.

“Satellites are really pretty fragile things and so we have to think now about how do we defend a constellation. It not always just direct defense,” she said. “It may be that we distribute a network. If you have multiple nodes it’s inherently more resilient than if you’re relying on one thing. Some it may be maneuverability. Some of it may be deception. There’s a lot of ways to make sure the United States can take a punch and keep on operating.”",www.defenseone.com,center,AVQjCBJbXcpo98QI

The case for doing what Trump did revolves around the United States’ need to punish those who inflict death and damage on its people, hopefully while achieving tactical or strategic ends that are greater than the costs of action. Soleimani was Iran’s indispensable man, whose Quds Force and its proxies were constantly harassing American clients and even Americans in the region. In recently leaked Iranian cables, high-level sources in the Iranian government are shown worrying about Soleimani’s aggressive methods and whether they were keeping the Americans more engaged in Iraq and focused on Iran than Tehran wished.

There are problems with this case, of course. First, Trump has proven almost unwilling to put an exit into America’s exit strategy. Second, the collateral damage to our relationship with Iraq is already coming in, with members of the Iraqi parliament already threatening to withdraw their consent for our continued presence. That would be a shameful exit for us, though one we should take. There’s also the notorious unreliability of America’s intelligence in the Middle East (or anywhere).

The desire , she said , arose during an exercise at Hurlburt Field , Florida . Wilder was giving an intel briefing to a Green Beret team . The soldiers were to be inserted and move overland for a reconnaissance mission on a notional enemy position .

Naval Special Warfare Command has found no barriers to integrating women into all-male SEAL teams , a finding that greatly increases the chances that Defense Secretary Ashton Carter will open the units to females by January .
The command has completed studies ordered in 2013 , including one that examined the physical standards for becoming a SEAL as well as study of the unit that killed Osama bin Laden and has conducted hundreds of other counterterrorism missions against Islamic extremists .
The Navy validated that each demanding standard remains relevant to the occupation of a SEAL and that none should be lowered , a special operations source told The ███ .
Furthermore , commanders do not see the standards , or other issues , such as mixed-sex teams in isolated austere locations , as a barrier if women have what it takes to pass the physical challenges .
“ We don ’ t see anything that will prevent us from moving forward with our integration , ” the source said . “ We don ’ t see any barriers to being able to integrate females into Navy special warfare . ”
The final approval process will play out this year . In the fall , Army Gen. Joseph Votel , commander of U.S. Special Operations Command , will make recommendations to Mr. Carter on now-closed SEAL positions , as well as other exclusively male units such as the Army ’ s Green Berets , Rangers and Delta Force .

According to timelines set up by then-Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta , who revoked the ban on women in direct ground combat , Mr. Carter will make a final decision by January .

In March 2013 , retired Adm. William McRaven , a SEAL and then-chief of Special Operations Command , sent an upbeat memo to the Joint Chiefs .

An Army press release said the success rate — 48 percent for men and 42 percent for women — is “ within historic norms for the Ranger course . ”

Grueling training ahead

The Special Warfare Command completed several studies before concluding that there are no barriers to admitting women.

‘Days of Rambo are over’

Will the red-blooded SEAL community accept women?

House GOP : '80 to 90 ' told of Bergdahl before us
The Obama administration had its first chance to convince House lawmakers it made the right call to trade five Taliban detainees for Army Sgt . Bowe Bergdahl .
House Republicans came out of a more than hourlong classified briefing by top national security officials on Monday complaining they ’ d learned nothing new about the incident that hasn ’ t already been disclosed in the news media .
GOP lawmakers , in particular , were upset that an estimated 80 to 90 executive branch officials in the Pentagon , White House and the intelligence agencies , but no members of Congress , were informed beforehand , including the chairs of the House and Senate intelligence panels .
“ It strikes me as unfortunate that they could have 80 to 90 people in the administration and not be able to trust a single Republican or Democrat in the House or the Senate , ” said Rep. Greg Walden ( R-Ore. ) .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) has publicly stated that he was informed the day before the Bergdahl exchange took place , but administration officials now claim that was not the case .
The conflicting public viewpoints are rare between the administration and its chief partner on Capitol Hill .
After ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl tweeted on June 3 that a senior administration official said Reid was told of the swap on Saturday , Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson tweeted back : “ This is mildly awkward but someone at the WH must be confused … ”
Jentleson added : “ We were alerted earlier in the week that a significant notification was imminent & learned on Fri that Bergdahl op was going fwd . ”
But it appears Reid was the only lawmaker who knew of the controversial trade ahead of time .
Former House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King ( R-N.Y. ) said the administration briefers offered few details on who specifically in the Obama administration knew about the swap beforehand but said the officials were in logistical roles .
“ They weren ’ t precise , but the number they gave was 80 to 90 , and they said they would get back to us . The implication to me was that those 80 to 90 all knew more than anybody in the Congress knew , ” he said .
King said the officials were likely from the State and Defense departments , the National Security Council and the White House .
Rank-and-file Republicans were exasperated by what they see as more stonewalling by the Obama administration as the White House tries to ride out yet another furor .
“ They [ administration officials ] made abundantly clear from the stage that we received no classified information , ” said Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R-Minn. ) , a longtime critic of President Barack Obama who also serves on the House Intelligence Committee . “ I asked them why in the world they didn ’ t turn this into a press conference . ”
The members — who had to remove all their electronic devices before entering a secure room in the basement of the Capitol — were shown a so-called proof of life video of Bergdahl from January made by his Taliban captors to prove to U.S. officials that he was still alive , according to several lawmakers at the briefing . Bergdahl reportedly told American military officials that he was held in a cage in total darkness for weeks at a time , according to The New York Times .
While expressing sympathy for Bergdahl and his family — and still professing to adhere to the code of “ leaving no one behind ” — Republican lawmakers blasted the swap as improper and possibly illegal , since Obama was supposed to consult with Congress 30 days before making such a move . Some administration officials have privately claimed that if word of the U.S.-Taliban talks leaked , Bergdahl ’ s life would have been in jeopardy .
Rep. Adam Kinzinger ( R-Ill. ) — a major in the Air National Guard who has served in Afghanistan and Iraq — said people asked about assurances that the Taliban detainees couldn ’ t return to the battlefield and the briefers skipped over the question .
Some Democrats sought to defend the White House handling of the Bergdahl incident , saying they understood why the administration wouldn ’ t share info with Capitol Hill about such a sensitive matter .","Some Democrats sought to defend the White House handling of the Bergdahl incident.

( Also on POLITICO: Feinstein: No threat to Bergdahl)

But it appears Reid was the only lawmaker who knew of the controversial trade ahead of time.

Former House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King (R-N.Y.) said the administration briefers offered few details on who specifically in the Obama administration knew about the swap beforehand but said the officials were in logistical roles.

“They weren’t precise, but the number they gave was 80 to 90, and they said they would get back to us. The implication to me was that those 80 to 90 all knew more than anybody in the Congress knew,” he said.

King said the officials were likely from the State and Defense departments, the National Security Council and the White House.

Rank-and-file Republicans were exasperated by what they see as more stonewalling by the Obama administration as the White House tries to ride out yet another furor.

“They [administration officials] made abundantly clear from the stage that we received no classified information,” said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), a longtime critic of President Barack Obama who also serves on the House Intelligence Committee. “I asked them why in the world they didn’t turn this into a press conference.”

The members — who had to remove all their electronic devices before entering a secure room in the basement of the Capitol — were shown a so-called proof of life video of Bergdahl from January made by his Taliban captors to prove to U.S. officials that he was still alive, according to several lawmakers at the briefing. Bergdahl reportedly told American military officials that he was held in a cage in total darkness for weeks at a time, according to The New York Times.

While expressing sympathy for Bergdahl and his family — and still professing to adhere to the code of “leaving no one behind” — Republican lawmakers blasted the swap as improper and possibly illegal, since Obama was supposed to consult with Congress 30 days before making such a move. Some administration officials have privately claimed that if word of the U.S.-Taliban talks leaked, Bergdahl’s life would have been in jeopardy.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) — a major in the Air National Guard who has served in Afghanistan and Iraq — said people asked about assurances that the Taliban detainees couldn’t return to the battlefield and the briefers skipped over the question.

Some Democrats sought to defend the White House handling of the Bergdahl incident, saying they understood why the administration wouldn’t share info with Capitol Hill about such a sensitive matter.",www.politico.com,left,n7WfyGlLmWwiaH0g

This directive — which apparently blindsided allies and lawmakers and national security officials alike — leaves the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) , largely made up of Kurdish civilians and Kurdish troops who led the fight against ISIS on the ground in Syria , at the mercy of Turkish forces .
“ Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria , ’ ” the White House said in a statement . “ The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation , and United States forces , having defeated the ISIS territorial ‘ Caliphate , ’ will no longer be in the immediate area . ”
This is an extraordinary move by President Donald Trump , who apparently made the decision after a phone call with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday .
The extent of the US pullout from the region and what comes next has gotten a bit confused in the hours after it was first announced . It received serious pushback from bipartisan lawmakers and even Trump ’ s own Department of Defense , which said it opposed a Turkish incursion .
After Trump defended his decision , he took to Twitter to warn Turkey that if it did anything “ off limits ” he would destroy its economy . Later , on a call with reporters , a White House senior administration official said the president did not endorse or support such an operation , but that about 50 to 100 special operators in the area of the expected incursion would move to other locations . The senior White House administration official also said the troops were being relocated and this wasn ’ t a formal pullout from Syria .
Still , Monday ’ s announcement looks a bit like a repeat of what happened in December 2018 , when Trump abruptly announced he was pulling all troops out of Syria over the objections of the Pentagon , including his then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis , who ultimately resigned over the decision . Trump , in that instance , partially walked back his pronouncement , leaving a troop contingent in the country , in part because of Turkey ’ s threat to the Kurds across the border .
The whiplash around Trump ’ s decision rattled allies and badly damaged US credibility . That ’ s now happening again , with the president offering different messages than those from US lawmakers and , at least at first , his own Department of Defense . In doing so , the US is jeopardizing its partners on the ground and unleashing unpredictable consequences for Syria , now in its eighth year of war .
What the heck is happening in Syria is a question a lot of people are asking right now
Turkey has long wanted to move across the border into northern Syria , where it sees the Syrian Kurdish forces ( specifically the People ’ s Protection Unit , or YPG , which forms the bulk of the Syrian Democratic Forces ) as tied to to the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) , separatists that Turkey considers a terrorist group . The PKK has waged an insurgency against Turkey for decades , and it ’ s allied with the Syrian Kurdish forces across the border — which has long put Turkey on edge .
Erdogan also wants to create a “ safe zone ” for Syrian refugees , which would extend about 20 miles into northeastern Syria . An economic downturn in Turkey is increasing domestic pressure on Erdogan to resettle 2 million of the 3.6 million people the country has taken in .
But the Kurds that Turkey sees as a threat are Washington ’ s most critical partner on the ground in Syria . Kurdish fighters fought on the front lines against ISIS ; they ’ ve received backing for years , including US technical and intelligence assistance and air support .
This put the US in an awkward position from the start — between a NATO ally in Turkey on the one hand and its most reliable partners in fighting ( and detaining ) the Islamic State on the other .
As ISIS was routed from the cities and territory it once controlled in the region , Erdogan has gotten a lot more antsy about the Kurds establishing a de facto state in northeastern Syria .
In response , in August , the US and Turkey agreed to a security mechanism designed to ease tensions between Turkey and the Syrian Kurds . In Starting in September , the US and Turkey began running joint patrols and the US helped push back some Syrian Kurdish forces from the Turkish border , including destroying their fortifications , to help create a smaller buffer zone in Syria . Basically , it was establishing a “ safe zone ” step by step , and without the potential violence that a Turkish invasion would unleash . The Pentagon promoted these efforts as recently as this Saturday .

The Department of Defense will be transparent as each phase of the security mechanism is implemented . # WorkingTogether # Allies pic.twitter.com/6xOHhlpL0f — U.S European Command ( @ US_EUCOM ) October 5 , 2019
But Erdogan had evidently started to get a bit impatient with this approach . The Turkish president apparently found a sympathetic partner in Trump , who ’ s notoriously skeptical of US troop commitments overseas and may have his own domestic political reasons for doubling down on a promise to end America ’ s entanglements abroad .
Soner Cagaptay , the head of the Turkish research program at the Washington Institute , said on a call with reporters Monday that this was a “ master stroke ” for Erdogan . “ Erdogan ’ s vision to enter Syria aligned with Trump ’ s vision to leave , ” he said .
In exchange , Turkey agreed to “ be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years , ” according to the White House . It ’ s an arrangement that ’ s extremely troublesome , as it ’ s not clear how or why Turkey would take on this responsibility , which until now has largely fallen to the Kurdish forces in the SDF .
The president defended his decision in a series of tweets on Monday . “ The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days , that was many years ago . We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight , ” Trump wrote , basically saying that Syria wasn ’ t America ’ s problem anymore .
“ WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT , AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN . Turkey , Europe , Syria , Iran , Iraq , Russia and the Kurds will now have to ....... figure the situation out , and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their ‘ neighborhood ’ , ” the president added on Twitter .
But Trump ’ s “ not our problem ” approach quickly seemed to be at odds with his own Department of Defense .
“ The Department of Defense made clear to Turkey — as did the President — that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria . The U.S. Armed Forces will not support , or be involved in any such operation , ” Department of Defense spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said Monday in a statement .
Mark Esper , the secretary of defense , also tweeted Monday — though it ’ s since been deleted — that the “ DOD does not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria ” and the US would work with NATO allies and coalition partners to reiterate to Turkey the possible “ destabilizing consequences of potential actions . ”
DOD does not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria . We will work w/our @ NATO allies & Coalition partners to reiterate to Turkey the possible destabilizing consequences of potential actions to Turkey , the region , & beyond . Full statement here : https : //t.co/NrP10t3cpW — Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark T. Esper ( @ EsperDoD ) October 7 , 2019
Some reports suggested that Trump had once again surprised national security officials , including one source who told Politico that the president had “ gone rogue ” in agreeing to Turkey ’ s request . And just last Friday , Esper told reporters that the US was continuing to work with Turkey on the security mechanism to establish those buffer zones and conduct joint patrols with Turkey .
But Trump ’ s own position appeared to shift during the course of Monday . The president later tweeted that “ if Turkey does anything that I , in my great and unmatched wisdom , consider to be off limits , I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey ( I ’ ve done before ! ) . ”
A White House senior official later clarified that Trump did not endorse or support the invasion , but that Turkey “ appeared intent on some sort of military operation , ” forcing US troops to relocate to other parts of Syria in advance of this Turkish operation .
Though Trump tried to make clear that he would retaliate if Turkey did anything “ off limits , ” that hasn ’ t been clearly defined . And even if the White House now says Trump doesn ’ t support or back a Turkish operation , by removing troops from northeastern Syria , the result is pretty much the same : little is stopping Turkey from launching an invasion , and the Syrian Kurds are largely on their own .
Which is why bipartisan lawmakers on Capitol Hill objected to Trump ’ s decision , with some , including Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) urging him to “ reassess ” and suggested that Congress would impose sanctions on Turkey — and call for its suspension in NATO — if it attacked the Kurds in Syria . Others , including former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Brett McGurk , the former presidential envoy to the coalition fighting ISIS who quit in protest of Trump ’ s troop withdrawal last year , condemned Trump ’ s move .
By abandoning the Kurds we have sent the most dangerous signal possible – America is an unreliable ally and it ’ s just a matter of time before China , Russia , Iran , and North Korea act out in dangerous ways . — Lindsey Graham ( @ LindseyGrahamSC ) October 7 , 2019
Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called on Trump “ to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners . ”
A new conflict , shifting alliances , and a possible ISIS resurgence are among the fears about Trump moving from Syria
The fallout of Trump ’ s decision won ’ t be clear immediately , but it risks war between a NATO ally and the US-backed partner in Syria , a grave humanitarian crisis , and a big win for ISIS .
The Syrian Democratic Forces , made up largely of Kurds , has been America ’ s most reliable and effective partner in the fight against ISIS . And now , with Trump ’ s move , it looks very much as though the US is abandoning them .
Trump argued that “ the Kurds fought with us , but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so . ”
This is not quite right . US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces did most of the fighting on the ground against ISIS , including retaking the one-time capital of the ISIS caliphate in Raqqa . The Syrian Democratic Forces say that , in five years , they ’ ve lost 11,000 troops battling ISIS . The US has never even had close to that many troops in the country , period .
What ’ s more , the Syrian Democratic Forces cooperated with the US as it tried to implement its “ security mechanism ” — the US ’ s attempts to create that incremental “ safe zone ” buffer near the Turkey-Syria border — this summer and fall , removing their military fortifications and withdrawing combat forces , which made the SDF more vulnerable to a Turkish offensive .
“ But Erdogan ’ s threats are aimed to change the security mechanism into a mechanism of death , displace our people & change the stable & secure region into a zone of conflict and permanent war , ” the SDF said in a statement Monday .
In other words , the Kurds cooperated with the US and , in return , that left them even more exposed to Turkish threats . The SDF called Washington ’ s decision “ a stab in the back . ”
And it ’ s not just troops who are at risk if Turkey invades , it ’ s also Kurdish civilians who could be massacred in any assault . About 1.7 million Kurds live in the northeastern region of Syria , though that area is larger than Erdogan ’ s planned 18-20 mile “ safe zone. ” Still , the United Nations has already warned of the possibility of mass displacement and mass slaughter in the wake of such an operation by Turkey . Kurdish forces have established relative peace and security in their region of northeastern Syria after years of fighting ISIS ; Turkey ’ s encroachment threatens to upend it all .
The Kurdish forces have also vowed that , if Turkey invades , it will do what is necessary to protect its people and its troops .
That opens up the possibility that Syrian Kurds will look elsewhere for protection , and that likely ally is Bashar al-Assad , the ruthless Syrian dictator , who with help from Russia and Iran is trying to retake all of Syria . The Kurds , who control a swath of land in northeastern Syria , have not ruled out making a deal with Assad if the US abandons them , which could potentially return a huge chunk of Syria back to the government ’ s control .
And then there ’ s ISIS , whose leadership is likely thrilled by Trump ’ s decision and sensing a possible opportunity . Trump has repeatedly bragged that , under his leadership , the US defeated ISIS ’ s caliphate .
“ The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected , including the capture of 100 % of the ISIS Caliphate , ” Trump declared on Twitter Monday . “ It is time now for others in the region , some of great wealth , to protect their own territory . THE USA IS GREAT ! ”
But that ’ s the problem . Yes , ISIS no longer controls a lot of territory , but it ’ s morphed into an insurgency movement and remains a serious threat to the stability of both Iraq and Syria . The Department of Defense warned in August that a US drawdown of troops risked an ISIS resurgence .
The White House has said that Turkey will be responsible for all ISIS fighters captured in the territory in the past two years , but it ’ s not clear if that will include major prisons , as most are outside the area where Turkey plans to invade . And even if it does , it ’ s not clear Turkey itself has the capacity — or desire — to take on this responsibility , or how that transfer would even work .
That ’ s because , right now , the Syrian Kurdish forces are guarding approximately 11,000 detained ISIS terrorists , including about 2,000 foreign fighters . That does not include the nearly 70,000 people living in the al-Hol refugee camp in northeastern Syria , which contains ISIS families and where the Pentagon says ISIS is actively recruiting new members .
The Department of Defense has previously warned that the SDF has limited capacity to guard these ISIS fighters indefinitely . US officials have also sounded the alarm that ISIS is planning mass prison breaks ; a Turkish invasion and the chaos it could bring might give ISIS fighters the cover and ability to do so .
And dealing with these potential crises may get a lot harder after a day of mixed messages from the Trump administration , with the Pentagon saying it ’ s opposed to a Turkish incursion and Trump saying he ’ ll punish Turkey if it goes too far , without saying where exactly he ’ ll draw the lines .
The confusion over Trump ’ s Syria policy on Monday also damages the US ’ s credibility , revealing it to be an unreliable and disorganized international partner . That will have consequences beyond Syria . Although , for now , the fallout from this decision is about to be keenly felt there .
Turkey is sending troops and tanks to its border with Syria hours after President Trump announced he would be removing US forces from the nation . Syrian Kurds feel betrayed and ISIS is watching .

us_military,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/09/07/iraq-haditha-air-strikes-anbar-islamic-state/15237691/,U.S. military expands airstrikes in western Iraq,2014-09-07,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. military launched airstrikes to protect a dam in western Iraq , the Pentagon announced Sunday , in another expansion of the air campaign against the Islamic State , the militant group that has seized territory throughout Iraq and Syria .
U.S. aircraft launched airstrikes against Islamic State targets around the Haditha Dam , a hydroelectric facility on the Euphrates River , Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby , the Pentagon press secretary , said in a statement . The military said the new strikes are in keeping with the Pentagon 's mission to support humanitarian operations and protect U.S. personnel .
`` We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam , which remains under control of Iraqi security forces , with support from Sunni tribes , '' Kirby said .
National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the dam is the second-largest hydroelectric contributor to the country 's powers system .
`` Destruction of the dam or release of water would create a level of flooding that would potentially pose a catastrophic threat to thousands of Iraqis , '' she said in a statement .
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel , speaking in Georgia where he 's meeting with government and defense officials , however , rejected the suggestion that the strikes open a new front in the war against the Islamic State or that they represent an escalation of U.S. military operations , according to the Associated Press .
The announcement comes after President Obama said Friday the United States was prepared to `` take the fight '' to the militant group , which threatens to destabilize the region and could present a threat to the West .
A mix of fighters and bombers conducted four airstrikes Saturday to help defend the dam , U.S. Central Command said . The strikes destroyed five Humvees , one armed vehicle , a checkpoint and damaged a bunker , according to the command .
The new strikes represent the first shift toward targets in western Iraq , a largely Sunni region that is currently a patchwork of conflicting loyalties .

WASHINGTON — The U.S. military launched airstrikes to protect a dam in western Iraq, the Pentagon announced Sunday, in another expansion of the air campaign against the Islamic State, the militant group that has seized territory throughout Iraq and Syria.

U.S. aircraft launched airstrikes against Islamic State targets around the Haditha Dam, a hydroelectric facility on the Euphrates River, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement. The military said the new strikes are in keeping with the Pentagon's mission to support humanitarian operations and protect U.S. personnel.

""We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces, with support from Sunni tribes,"" Kirby said.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the dam is the second-largest hydroelectric contributor to the country's powers system.

""Destruction of the dam or release of water would create a level of flooding that would potentially pose a catastrophic threat to thousands of Iraqis,"" she said in a statement.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking in Georgia where he's meeting with government and defense officials, however, rejected the suggestion that the strikes open a new front in the war against the Islamic State or that they represent an escalation of U.S. military operations, according to the Associated Press.

The announcement comes after President Obama said Friday the United States was prepared to ""take the fight"" to the militant group, which threatens to destabilize the region and could present a threat to the West.

A mix of fighters and bombers conducted four airstrikes Saturday to help defend the dam, U.S. Central Command said. The strikes destroyed five Humvees, one armed vehicle, a checkpoint and damaged a bunker, according to the command.

The new strikes represent the first shift toward targets in western Iraq, a largely Sunni region that is currently a patchwork of conflicting loyalties.

Some Sunnis have supported the Islamic State as a bulwark against the Shiite-dominated government. But tribes have taken different stands in the face of the militant offensive. Some tribes are fighting against the militants and others are supporting the Islamic State or are remaining neutral.

Tribes in the Haditha dam region have been fighting against the militants for months. The U.S. military said the dam remains in the hands of tribes working in support of the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces.

The U.S. air campaign began Aug. 8 and has slowly expanded as it has taken on more missions. U.S. planes have pounded targets around the Mosul Dam, allowing a combination of Iraqi counterterrorist forces and Kurdish peshmerga fighters to take the facility back from Islamic State militants.

U.S. aircraft also targeted militants around Mount Sinjar, where a religious minority had taken refuge after militants had overrun their community. More recently, U.S. aircraft also helped break the siege of Amerli, a Shiite Turkmen town.

The Trump Administration on Friday urged all American citizens to leave Iraq “ immediately. ” The counter-ISIS battle , which is largely run out of Iraq , has been halted indefinitely .

us_military,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/04/27/pentagon-ammunition-sen-tom-carper-gao-waste/8145729/,Report: Pentagon to destroy $1B in ammunition,2014-04-27,,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon plans to destroy more than $ 1 billion worth of ammunition although some of those bullets and missiles could still be used by troops , according to the Pentagon and congressional sources .
It 's impossible to know what portion of the arsenal slated for destruction — valued at $ 1.2 billion by the Pentagon — remains viable because the Defense Department 's inventory systems ca n't share data effectively , according to a Government Accountability Office report obtained by ███ .
`` There is a huge opportunity to save millions , if not billions of dollars if the ( Pentagon ) can make some common-sense improvements to how it manages ammunition , '' said Sen. Tom Carper , D-Del. , and chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee . `` Despite years of effort , the Army , Navy and Air Force still do n't have an efficient process for doing something as basic as sharing excess bullets . This Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report clearly shows that our military 's antiquated systems lead to millions of dollars in wasteful ammunition purchases . ''
The Army and Pentagon , in a statement , acknowledged `` the need to automate the process '' and will make it a priority in future budgets . In all , the Pentagon manages a stockpile of conventional ammunition worth $ 70 billion .
The effect of inaccurate accounting of ammunition for troops at war was outside the scope of the study . However , there were limited supplies at times of .50-caliber machine gun and 9mm handgun ammunition at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to a senior military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the issue .
`` We simply can not afford this type of waste and ineffectiveness , '' Carper said . `` The ( Pentagon ) has a responsibility to efficiently manage its ammunition stocks , not only because it is important to be fiscally responsible , but also because our antiquated ammunition inventory systems can shortchange our war fighters and compromise their ability to complete their mission . ''
• The services have inventory systems for ammunition that can not share data directly despite working for decades to develop a single database . Only the Army uses the standard Pentagon format ; `` the Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps operate with formats that are obsolete . ''
• The services hold an annual conference to share information about surplus ammunition and swap bullets and other munitions as needed . Data about ammunition left over after the meeting disappears from the books , resulting in an unknown amount of good bullets headed to the scrap heap .
• The Army , although required by regulation , had not reported annually on its missile stockpile until last month , shortly before the GAO study was to be released .
The report illustrates the obsolete nature of the Pentagon 's inventory systems for ammunition . A request for ammunition from the Marine Corps , for example , is e-mailed to the Army . The e-mail is printed out and manually retyped into the Army system because the services can not share data directly . Not only is this time consuming , but it can introduce errors — by an incorrect keystroke , for example .

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon plans to destroy more than $1 billion worth of ammunition although some of those bullets and missiles could still be used by troops, according to the Pentagon and congressional sources.

It's impossible to know what portion of the arsenal slated for destruction — valued at $1.2 billion by the Pentagon — remains viable because the Defense Department's inventory systems can't share data effectively, according to a Government Accountability Office report obtained by USA TODAY.

The result: potential waste of unknown value.

""There is a huge opportunity to save millions, if not billions of dollars if the (Pentagon) can make some common-sense improvements to how it manages ammunition,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., and chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""Despite years of effort, the Army, Navy and Air Force still don't have an efficient process for doing something as basic as sharing excess bullets. This Government Accountability Office (GAO) report clearly shows that our military's antiquated systems lead to millions of dollars in wasteful ammunition purchases.""

The Army and Pentagon, in a statement, acknowledged ""the need to automate the process"" and will make it a priority in future budgets. In all, the Pentagon manages a stockpile of conventional ammunition worth $70 billion.

The effect of inaccurate accounting of ammunition for troops at war was outside the scope of the study. However, there were limited supplies at times of .50-caliber machine gun and 9mm handgun ammunition at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a senior military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the issue.

""We simply cannot afford this type of waste and ineffectiveness,"" Carper said. ""The (Pentagon) has a responsibility to efficiently manage its ammunition stocks, not only because it is important to be fiscally responsible, but also because our antiquated ammunition inventory systems can shortchange our war fighters and compromise their ability to complete their mission.""

Other key findings from the report:

• The services have inventory systems for ammunition that cannot share data directly despite working for decades to develop a single database. Only the Army uses the standard Pentagon format; ""the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps operate with formats that are obsolete.""

• The services hold an annual conference to share information about surplus ammunition and swap bullets and other munitions as needed. Data about ammunition left over after the meeting disappears from the books, resulting in an unknown amount of good bullets headed to the scrap heap.

• The Army, although required by regulation, had not reported annually on its missile stockpile until last month, shortly before the GAO study was to be released.

The report illustrates the obsolete nature of the Pentagon's inventory systems for ammunition. A request for ammunition from the Marine Corps, for example, is e-mailed to the Army. The e-mail is printed out and manually retyped into the Army system because the services cannot share data directly. Not only is this time consuming, but it can introduce errors — by an incorrect keystroke, for example.

Waste, buying new ammunition while usable stockpiles exist, can occur ""because the Army does not report information on all available and usable items,"" the report states. The annual conference among the services — although it saves about $70 million per year, according to the Pentagon — is inadequate. The services, in fiscal year 2012, exchanged 44 million items, including 32 million bullets for machine guns and pistols.

""Specifically, the Army's report does not include information from prior years about usable ammunition that was unclaimed by another service and stored for potential foreign military sales or slated for potential disposal,"" the report says.

Missiles are another source for concern, the report notes. The Army has an inventory of missiles, including Stingers, Javelins and Hellfires, that has totaled more than $14 billion in recent years. Hellfire missiles have been a weapon of choice for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in the CIA-run Predator and Reaper drone missions to kill terrorists in places like Yemen.

The GAO found that the Army and its missile command ""do not contribute to required annual report."" The reason, Army officials told investigators, is that it ""rarely has items to offer for redistribution.""

Without its cooperation, the Army ""risks others services spending additional funds to procure missiles that are already unused and usable in the Army's stockpile.""

The Army, in a statement, said that it began offering that information to the other services last month.

In its recommendations, the GAO urged Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to require the Army to make known information on all available for use by all services.

Congress may take it away.,2018-08-09,"Alex Ward, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer","President Donald Trump is really , really excited about a Space Force — his plan to create an entirely new branch of the US military dedicated to defending American satellites and more in space .
And though it seemed for a while that the Pentagon might try to keep it from happening , it looks like Trump may actually get his wish — that is , unless Congress turns him down .
On Thursday , Vice President Mike Pence delivered a big speech unveiling the Defense Department ’ s official plan to effectively create a Space Force in all but name .
Trump was ecstatic , tweeting “ Space Force all the way ! ” just minutes after Pence ’ s speech ended .
But while the Pentagon can make certain moves without Congress ’ s approval , it ’ s up to lawmakers to actually authorize the new military branch .
“ Congress definitely gets a vote , ” Deborah Lee James , the last Air Force secretary and an open critic of the Space Force idea , told me .
Pence and Trump ’ s argument for creating a Space Force boils down to this : Enemies like China and Russia have , for example , tested technology to shoot down satellites , and the US wants to ensure the US can adequately defend itself against growing threats .
“ What was once peaceful and uncontested is now crowded and adversarial , ” Pence said on Thursday at the Pentagon . “ It ’ s not enough to merely have an American presence in space , we must have American dominance in space . And so we will . ”
The problem for Trump and Pence is that Congress hasn ’ t shown the same desire for a Space Force — in fact , they actually voted down a legislative proposal to create it last November .
But the White House is now hopeful they will receive congressional approval for the new military branch in the fiscal year 2020 defense budget . That ’ s in part because of a seeming change of heart — or at least , a capitulation — from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis .
For much of last year , top Pentagon leaders railed against the idea of a Space Force . “ The Pentagon is complicated enough , ” Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters last summer . “ This will make it more complex , add more boxes to the organization chart. ” Mattis himself even came out against it .
Now , though , Mattis is at least somewhat supportive publicly of the idea . Which means it ’ s possible members of Congress may change their minds in Trump ’ s favor .
Expect Trump and Pence ’ s greatest ally in Congress for a Space Force , Rep. Mike Rogers ( R-AL ) , to lead the way .
Rogers has said that creating the new branch is necessary for US national security , particularly because other countries are catching up to America ’ s power in space . “ Russia and China have become near peers , ” Rogers told NPR in June 2017 . “ They ’ re close to surpassing us . What we ’ re proposing would change that . ”
He ’ s since led the legislative effort to create the new military service . Rogers tweeted his approval during Pence ’ s remarks Thursday :
I am thrilled about the news today . We in the House have been warning for years about the threats to our space assets and the unacceptably slow pace to develop more capable space systems . The report is a step in a multi-year process that will help ensure a safer , stronger America https : //t.co/12SwRkaz1c — Mike Rogers ( @ RepMikeRogersAL ) August 9 , 2018
So what happens now ? Well , in the short term , the Pentagon will do what it always does : makes changes in an extremely bureaucratic , wonky , and boring way .
Here ’ s how the Pentagon will start creating a Space Force
The Pentagon released a report after Pence ’ s speech outlining four main things it will do to begin establishing a Space Force :
Create a new Space Command , which will serve as the main Pentagon hub for all things fighting in space
Establish the Space Operations Force , which will be made up of the military ’ s elite troops focusing on conflict in space
Create the Space Development Agency , which will help the Pentagon acquire weapons to fight in space
Ensure there are the requisite leaders and support staff to manage the day-to-day operations of the Pentagon ’ s operations in space
All of that boils down to the Defense Department making bureaucratic changes to deal with space in the way Trump wants .
The biggest loser in all of this will be the Air Force , which already takes the military lead on defending American items in space — like the satellites that guide your GPS system — with an agency called the Air Force Space Command .
It ’ s unclear as of now , though , if that organization will go away or somehow fold under new Space Force .
That ’ s just one of the many , many questions I and others have about what a Space Force will actually look like . There is one important thing no one questions : that space has become much more dangerous in recent years .
What was once the final frontier could soon become the front line of a future conflict .
“ Space is no longer a peaceful domain , ” James said in an interview in July 2017 . “ There is a real possibility that a conflict on Earth could bleed into space . ”
There are two main reasons for that : Russia and China . According to the Defense Intelligence Agency , Russia wants to gain more power in space because it believes gaining supremacy there will allow it to win future fights on this planet . And in late 2015 , China created the Strategic Support Force , which is meant to streamline and improve its space , cyber , and electronic warfare missions .
The two countries are causing problems with anti-satellite technology , too , noted Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last May — meaning they could mess with the satellites that help the US military do its job . The Pentagon is planning to open a space-war center to counter their threats .
Okay , but , like ... what sort of conflict is actually going on in space ? What are we really talking about here ?
Basically , there is tons of military equipment in space , especially satellites . This kind of equipment helps the US , Russia , and China — and any tech-savvy force — navigate terrain and communicate with one another .
On top of that , assets in space help to track enemy fighters , take pictures for intelligence services , and even help control missiles . Without space support , it would be much harder to fight on Earth ; that ’ s why Russia and China are investing so heavily in it .
But Russia and China aren ’ t space ’ s only threats . The area just outside Earth ’ s orbit has seen an explosion of commercial satellites and other communications equipment since the 1960s , put there first by countries and , as of late , by commercial companies . That equipment is used to help drivers reach their destination , help potential lovers swipe right ( or left ) on dating apps , or simply help people text a friend .
The chart below shows the huge growth in these satellites . The blue line represents their total growth since around 1960 .
The internet , of course , adds a new complication to all the equipment that countries are putting in space . Most notably , equipment can potentially be hacked . For instance , a team of hackers could jam a satellite by messing with its signals so it interrupts the satellite ’ s normal activity , rendering it useless . That could cause problems for all sorts of everyday activities , like credit card transactions and phone calls .
Then , of course , there ’ s space debris threatening all of that commercial and military space equipment , since it could knock into the expensive machines . NASA estimates that there are 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth , about 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger , and many millions of pieces that are too small to register .
All of this is why Trump , Rep. Rogers , and even former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld believe the US needs a Space Force . It would ensure the safety of space equipment by monitoring physical and cyberthreats against US communication and navigation assets . It would be more of a defensive mission than an offensive one — for now . That doesn ’ t mean actual troops in space yet . But down the line , who knows ?
Essentially , if the US military wants to protect life here on Earth , it needs to safeguard US assets in space . But is a Space Force the way to do it ?
The main issue is that Rogers and others — and perhaps Trump himself — believe the Air Force isn ’ t paying enough attention to space . That makes sense to an extent , as the Air Force ’ s main directive is to focus on flying planes here on Earth .
Creating a new service would ensure that there ’ s a segment of the military whose job is to focus on space 100 percent of the time . That would allow the Space Force to counter Russia , China , and other threats while giving space-focused staff more bureaucratic power inside the Pentagon .
But Sean O ’ Keefe , a former NASA leader and Navy secretary , thinks creating a brand new branch of the military is not the right way to go . “ This is a solution in search of a problem , ” he told me in an interview last summer . Basically , he thinks the Air Force is already doing a fine job protecting space — even if it does privilege earthbound pilots . Creating a Space Force would just add another layer of bureaucracy to an already massive organization : the Pentagon .
James , the former Air Force secretary , agrees . She thinks dealing with the current complaints about the Air Force and space — 1 ) that it ’ s not well funded , 2 ) that acquisition takes too long , and 3 ) that there is no one person to call about military space operations — makes more sense .
The first complaint is already being mollified to an extent . The Air Force asked for a 20 percent increase in funds to focus on space in 2018 . As for the third complaint , James feels it ’ s a common refrain heard at DOD that doesn ’ t necessarily just apply to the Air Force and space . “ If you look at any warfare area in the Department of Defense , there ’ s no single bellybutton for anything , ” she told me .
So clearly the Space Force has its detractors — including the current Air Force secretary . And of course , Congress has yet to officially mandate its creation .
But with Trump ’ s endorsement , the conversation has kicked into high gear once again . Time will tell if future US troops will be wearing space helmets .","President Donald Trump is really, really excited about a Space Force — his plan to create an entirely new branch of the US military dedicated to defending American satellites and more in space.

“ Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq . They will be held fully responsible , ” Trump tweeted . “ In addition , we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy , and so notified ! ”
But Trump ’ s critics put the blame on him , accusing him of an erratic Middle East policy that led to Tuesday ’ s scene .
“ The attack on our embassy in Baghdad is horrifying but predictable , ” Sen.

The latest spike in tensions was triggered over the weekend when the Trump administration blamed the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia for an attack that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. service members .
In response , the U.S. carried out airstrikes Sunday against five Kataib Hezbollah targets in Iraq and Syria , killing at least 25 militia fighters .
Thousands of demonstrators stormed the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad early Tuesday in response to the airstrikes , with some in militia uniforms chanting “ Death to America. ” Footage emerged of protesters breaching the compound walls and setting small fires at the facility .

On Tuesday night , Esper said 750 troops would be deployed to the region `` immediately , '' and that additional forces were prepared to deploy in the coming days .
A State Department spokesperson said the U.S. ambassador to Iraq would return to the embassy after a previously scheduled trip .
Iraq has been roiled by anti-government protests over the last few months , fueled in part by opposition to Iranian influence in the country . There have also been broader concerns about all foreign influence , including from the United States , but Tuesday ’ s demonstrators were from different factions than the earlier protests .
Trump , who has spent the last 10 days at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida , briefly addressed the escalating situation on Tuesday night .
“ I think it ’ s been handled very well ... we had some great warriors come in , '' Trump told reporters before attending a New Year 's Eve party at his resort . `` This will not be a Benghazi ... they got in there very quickly . ”
When asked about the possibility of war with Iran , Trump responded : “ I do n't see that happening . ''
Earlier in the day , Trump sent several tweets about the embassy attack .
In addition to the tweet accusing Iran of orchestrating the attack , Trump tweeted an entreaty to “ those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don ’ t want to be dominated and controlled by Iran , ” telling them , “ this is your time ! ”
Trump has met with members of his national security team in recent days . The president spent just under an hour at his golf club in West Palm Beach on Tuesday where he said he had a “ very good meeting on the Middle East , the Military , and Trade . ”

Trump has made confronting Iran a cornerstone of his foreign policy , but has sought to balance his tough rhetoric with his desire to avoid further entanglement in foreign wars .
The past year was marked by several instances of near-conflict , including in June after the U.S. accused Iran of shooting down an American drone and in September after an attack on Saudi oil facilities .
As the embassy was under assault Tuesday , Iran hawks in the United States pointed fingers at Tehran .

The events in Iraq also prompted allusions to the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi , Libya , where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed .
Graham , who said he met with Trump on Tuesday to discuss the situation , pledged there would be “ no more Benghazis . ”
“ President Trump is determined to protect American personnel and expects our Iraqi partners to step up to the plate , ” Graham tweeted .
Iraqi security forces reportedly did nothing to stop the demonstrators from advancing until a commander arrived and ordered them to .
Trump spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi on Tuesday and `` emphasized the need to protect United States personnel and facilities in Iraq , '' according to the White House .
Pompeo also spoke with al-Mahdi and Iraqi President Barham Salih separately by phone after the embassy was breached , making clear to them the United States would “ protect and defend its people . ”
They , in turn , assured Pompeo they “ would guarantee the safety and security of U.S. personnel and property , ” according to a State Department statement about the calls .
On Monday , the Iraqi government issued a blistering statement condemning the U.S. strikes on Kataib Hezbollah , saying the United States violated Iraqi sovereignty by conducting them unilaterally . The government added it would “ review the relationship ” with the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq .
On Tuesday , Iraq continued to condemn the U.S. strikes , but also pledged to respond to “ any act of aggression or harassment ” against an embassy .
“ While we condemn the US air strikes on Iraqi military units , and acknowledge that symbolic funeral marches for the martyrs is a solemn act of remembrance , those taking part must stay away from diplomatic buildings and compounds , ” al-Mahdi said in a statement .

The developments put a question mark on the future of the U.S. presence in Iraq, as lawmakers and others in Washington debated the significance of the crisis and how the United States should respond.

“Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible,” Trump tweeted. “In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!”

But Trump’s critics put the blame on him, accusing him of an erratic Middle East policy that led to Tuesday’s scene.

“The attack on our embassy in Baghdad is horrifying but predictable,” Sen. Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyDemocrats request briefing on intel behind Trump's embassy threat claim US citizen dies in Egyptian prison after hunger strike President Trump's strike of choice MORE (D-Conn.) tweeted. “Trump has rendered America impotent in the Middle East. No one fears us, no one listens to us. America has been reduced to huddling in safe rooms, hoping the bad guys will go away. What a disgrace.”

The latest spike in tensions was triggered over the weekend when the Trump administration blamed the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia for an attack that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. service members.

In response, the U.S. carried out airstrikes Sunday against five Kataib Hezbollah targets in Iraq and Syria, killing at least 25 militia fighters.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad early Tuesday in response to the airstrikes, with some in militia uniforms chanting “Death to America.” Footage emerged of protesters breaching the compound walls and setting small fires at the facility.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: GAO finds administration broke law by withholding Ukraine aid | Senate opens Trump trial | Pentagon to resume training Saudi students soon US military to soon resume training for Saudi students State Department cancels two classified congressional briefings on Iran, embassy security MORE said additional U.S. forces would be deployed to the facility in Baghdad to bolster security, and he called on Iraq to assist in the protection of embassy personnel.

On Tuesday night, Esper said 750 troops would be deployed to the region ""immediately,"" and that additional forces were prepared to deploy in the coming days.

A State Department spokesperson said the U.S. ambassador to Iraq would return to the embassy after a previously scheduled trip.

Iraq has been roiled by anti-government protests over the last few months, fueled in part by opposition to Iranian influence in the country. There have also been broader concerns about all foreign influence, including from the United States, but Tuesday’s demonstrators were from different factions than the earlier protests.

Trump, who has spent the last 10 days at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, briefly addressed the escalating situation on Tuesday night.

“I think it’s been handled very well...we had some great warriors come in,"" Trump told reporters before attending a New Year's Eve party at his resort. ""This will not be a Benghazi...they got in there very quickly.”

When asked about the possibility of war with Iran, Trump responded: “I don't see that happening.""

Earlier in the day, Trump sent several tweets about the embassy attack.

In addition to the tweet accusing Iran of orchestrating the attack, Trump tweeted an entreaty to “those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don’t want to be dominated and controlled by Iran,” telling them, “this is your time!”

Trump has met with members of his national security team in recent days. The president spent just under an hour at his golf club in West Palm Beach on Tuesday where he said he had a “very good meeting on the Middle East, the Military, and Trade.”

Trump has made confronting Iran a cornerstone of his foreign policy, but has sought to balance his tough rhetoric with his desire to avoid further entanglement in foreign wars.

The past year was marked by several instances of near-conflict, including in June after the U.S. accused Iran of shooting down an American drone and in September after an attack on Saudi oil facilities.

As the embassy was under assault Tuesday, Iran hawks in the United States pointed fingers at Tehran.

Tuesday’s storming of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq also elicited historical comparisons.

The events in Iraq also prompted allusions to the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed.

Graham, who said he met with Trump on Tuesday to discuss the situation, pledged there would be “no more Benghazis.”

“President Trump is determined to protect American personnel and expects our Iraqi partners to step up to the plate,” Graham tweeted.

Iraqi security forces reportedly did nothing to stop the demonstrators from advancing until a commander arrived and ordered them to.

Trump spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi on Tuesday and ""emphasized the need to protect United States personnel and facilities in Iraq,"" according to the White House.

Pompeo also spoke with al-Mahdi and Iraqi President Barham Salih separately by phone after the embassy was breached, making clear to them the United States would “protect and defend its people.”

They, in turn, assured Pompeo they “would guarantee the safety and security of U.S. personnel and property,” according to a State Department statement about the calls.

On Monday, the Iraqi government issued a blistering statement condemning the U.S. strikes on Kataib Hezbollah, saying the United States violated Iraqi sovereignty by conducting them unilaterally. The government added it would “review the relationship” with the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq.

On Tuesday, Iraq continued to condemn the U.S. strikes, but also pledged to respond to “any act of aggression or harassment” against an embassy.

“While we condemn the US air strikes on Iraqi military units, and acknowledge that symbolic funeral marches for the martyrs is a solemn act of remembrance, those taking part must stay away from diplomatic buildings and compounds,” al-Mahdi said in a statement.

“Iraqi security forces will respond to any act of aggression or harassment against foreign embassies in Iraq, and those responsible will face the full force of the law,” he added.

With the situation spiraling, Democrats called for tensions to be lowered as they expressed concern about the safety of U.S. personnel.

Wilkie is the son of an Army artillery commander who grew up at Fort Bragg . Today , he is a colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and has more than 20 years of public service in the various national security and defense roles in government . ███ spoke to him about the issues confronting America ’ s veterans and his leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs . A lightly edited transcript is below along with the full audio podcast .
Rob Bluey : Tell us about the mission of Veterans Affairs and what your priorities are as secretary for the department .
Robert Wilkie : The mission is very simple , but it ’ s also sublime . I ’ m sitting underneath the quote from the father of what was first the Veterans Bureau and now Veterans Affairs . That ’ s Mr. Abraham Lincoln .
In his second inaugural , he said that the mission of government was to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan . One of the last acts of his life before he went to the theater was to sign the charters for three soldiers ’ homes in Maine , Ohio , and Wisconsin . And our mission as a result of Mr. Lincoln ’ s mandate is to do just that .
We take care of about nine and a half million of America ’ s veterans . We provide educational benefits and home loans . And we are the other end of the national security continuum . We take care of those who have already borne the battle , and I have always argued that this is probably the noblest mission in government .
Bluey : Thank you for the work that you do . I ’ ve heard you talk about two big challenges confronting our nation ’ s veterans . One of them is the opioid epidemic and the other is suicide , unfortunately . Let ’ s start with opioids . How are you addressing that ?
Wilkie : We ’ ve had to change the culture . We are not immune from things that happen in greater America . Suicide is one . It ’ s a problem that is devastating large swaths of our population . Opioids is another . We all know the stories of how opioid use and abuse spread throughout the Midwest and then to the coasts , but we had to change the culture . We decided to treat the actual source of pain rather than treating the brain .
So what does that mean ? We found in our research that combinations of over-the-counter medicines like aspirin and acetaminophen or aspirin and ibuprofen are just as valuable to the treatment of a malady than an opioid . But in order to enhance those effects , we have introduced veterans across the country to alternative therapies , things like Tai Chi and yoga and art and music .
Why is that important ? I come from the military world . I was born into it . My father was a very decorated combat soldier from Vietnam and a senior officer in the 82nd Airborne Division . I ’ m still a colonel in the Air Force Reserve . Our society , our culture , does not change rapidly , but we ’ ve had to reeducate those that there are other ways of … making themselves feel better , and that ’ s what we ’ re doing with opioids . We ’ ve reduced the prescription numbers by about 51 % . I hope we go even lower than that .
The second thing that you asked about is suicide , and this I tie into mental health , although not all suicides have anything to do with mental illness , but we have never had a national conversation about suicide in life or about mental health .
[ I ’ ll ] tell you how long this has impacted the Army of the United States . The Army started taking statistics on military suicides in the 1890s . It ’ s been steady ever since . There were a couple of spikes right before World War II and spikes right after Vietnam , but it has been steady .
Twenty a day take their lives . Of those 20 , we don ’ t see 14 . Those are primarily my father ’ s era , Vietnam , people who were tossed aside for the most part when they came back from Southeast Asia .
[ I ’ ll ] give you a family example . After my father recovered from his wounds in Cambodia , three years after his recovery was completed , he returned to Fort Bragg , to the All American Division , and even in southern North Carolina , he could not wear his uniform on post .
So we ’ re dealing with people who have those memories of a government that turned them away . We have to find them and we have to bring them into the fold and this is where the free enterprise and the notion that government only works when it ’ s closest to those it ’ s supposed to serve comes in .
So as the head of the president ’ s task force , I am trying to open the aperture so that we can partner with charities , localities , nongovernment organizations to help us find those veterans . We don ’ t see those veterans who have had bad experiences with government .
Last thing I will say , no matter what we do , human life is not linear . We ’ re not going to be able to fully eradicate this problem . People take their lives for a number of reasons . Many of those reasons have nothing to do with their military service , but what we can do is make sure that VA is integrated into all levels of society so that we can find those that we don ’ t see .
Bluey : I was shocked to hear that number of 20 a day . It is truly , truly sad . For those listeners of ours who might have a veteran in their life or know somebody who ’ s struggling with mental illness , what advice do you have for them ? What can they do to help those individuals ?
Wilkie : The first thing I ask anyone who is in distress is to call our crisis line—that ’ s ( 800 ) 273-8255 or you can text 838255 . We get about 1,700 calls a day . We physically act on 200 to 300 of those calls . That line is open to families as well as to veterans .
The other thing that we provide , all of our facilities provide same-day mental health services . If there is a problem , come see us and we will move to help . It goes without saying , we can ’ t help if we don ’ t know and we want families and friends to help us help their family members and their friends by getting in touch with us .
Bluey : Thank you for your leadership on that and sharing those resources with our listeners . We ’ ll make sure that they are aware of them . And again , we pray for those who are in need and hope that they will reach out for help .
Mr. Secretary , as you mentioned , you come from a background of service to our country , both as a member of the Air Force Reserve and also through the various positions you ’ ve held in public service and government . So tell our listeners , what led you down this path ?
Wilkie : I grew up around it . I come from a long line of soldiers and service was part of our family heritage . I was privileged as a child to see and shake hands with people like Audie Murphy or Creighton Abrams , Matthew Ridgway , and James Gavin . Those were my heroes . Those were certainly my father ’ s heroes . And I always wanted to be a part of that world .
And Vietnam cast a large shadow across my life , and I ’ ll give you an example , other than the one that I mentioned about my father being terribly wounded and then not allowed to wear his uniform outside of Fort Bragg .
When I was a child , there was always a chance when one of my classmates in kindergarten or elementary school was called to the principal ’ s office that child wasn ’ t going up there for a doctor ’ s appointment . There was bad news from Vietnam and in 1975 we got bad news in our school .
One of my classmates ’ fathers was a Air Force medic . He volunteered to help the evacuation of all of the orphanages in Saigon prior to the arrival of the North Vietnamese army . The C-5 he was on crashed at Tan Son Nhut Air Base . He was one of 11 airmen killed and well over a hundred children killed . His daughter Denise was my classmate . I remember when she was called to the principal ’ s office .
Just this April , 44 years after that crash , I took the niece to the Vietnam wall and her father ’ s name was there , one of the last to fall in that conflict and she saw it , Section 1W , and that ’ s the kind of thing that animates me , that kind of service , because it is that world that I was raised in and those are the people that I was raised to admire .
Bluey : Thank you for sharing that story . You do get to spend a lot of time with veterans in your capacity and I know President [ Donald ] Trump always seems to enjoy spending time with our troops and veterans as well , but what is it like working with him on some of these issues that you ’ re confronted with ?
Wilkie : It ’ s been wonderful because I ’ m a pretty good historian and I will tell you no president—and you can look this up—ever made veterans the centerpiece of , first , his campaign , and then of his administration .
He has allowed me to expand what you at [ The Heritage Foundation ] and what I believe to be the key to a free society and that is expand choices that our citizens have .
So what does that mean ? We now provide the veteran with the option of going into the private sector , going to a doctor or a clinic closer to that veteran ’ s home , not automatically defaulting to the government .
When we kicked off the Mission Act , which is designed to integrate VA into the wider American health care system , we ’ ve been able to send well over a million and a half just since June 6 into the private sector .
Now , the other side of that is that we ’ ve had 3 million more appointments at VA this year than we had last year . So veterans are voting with their feet both ways . Many are staying with us because they know we speak the language , we understand the culture , but we ’ re also giving those veterans who want to be closer to home the opportunity to stay closer to home , not having to travel , in some cases out West , 500 , 600 , 700 miles round trip . So it is a new day for us .
The other thing that we ’ re doing , we ’ re certainly modernizing our supply chain . We are creating the first electronic health record that follows an American from the time that American walks into the military entrance processing station , at the time that veteran is handed to us . So people like my father do not have to carry around an 800-page paper record for the rest of their post-military lives .
Bluey : It ’ s so good to hear you talk about those initiatives . It wasn ’ t much long ago prior to your arrival that we constantly seem to be hearing about the VA in terms of the scandals that might be happening at the department …
Wilkie : Well , you just hit it , it ’ s “ used to. ” And the problem—I ’ ve got it sitting in this perch—is that most of the stories you read , you have to go all the way down to the bottom of those stories .
There was just one in The Wall Street Journal about things that happened in the last administration . And I think there ’ s an element in the national media that will never be satisfied if there are no scandals at VA . If there are no systemic problems .
In an organization this large , they ’ re going to be bad apples . No question . But what has amazed me is that how many people , particularly in the press and certainly some on Capitol Hill , who were invested in the failure of this department . And I think the president has rejected that mindset , I certainly have , and those things that we saw many years ago , we certainly don ’ t see them now .
Bluey : Mr. Secretary , I wanted to ask you a two-part question : One is , how have you changed the culture there at VA , and what are some of the measures that you ’ ve put in place to ensure that you are having success and meeting the needs of veterans ?
Wilkie : I will tell you , the first thing is our customer satisfaction rate . It ’ s sitting at 90 % . There ’ s no other health care system in the country with that . And our veterans are voting with their feet .
This president has given me the opportunity to bring people into this structure who have an investment in the armed forces in the United States . Everyone around me has significant military experience . That ’ s vital . It doesn ’ t matter that much if in a private hospital setting , but for us if you don ’ t understand the culture and you don ’ t speak the language , you have no credibility with veterans .
The other thing that we are doing is that we are walking the post , we are out there talking . I ’ ve been in just the last year in 43 states and all the territory and you would be amazed how many places I go , big cities in this country , massive cities . … I walk in and they say , “ You are the first secretary we ’ ve ever seen . ”
So getting out of this town and getting out and talking to the people who have served that we have to serve has been key to the change . And just in the last year we ’ ve gone from 17 out of 17 in terms of best places to work in government to No . 6 and I think next year will be higher than that .
Bluey : Showing up can make all the difference . And my final question for you has to do with as you look ahead to the coming year , what is it in 2020 that you hope to achieve ? What are some of the top goals on your mind ?
Wilkie : We want to continue the upward trajectory to make sure veterans know that they now have options when it comes to their own care . We want to continue modernizing , we want to continue , we are going to be fielding the electronic health record ; we ’ ll modernize the supply chain . We will make sure that better ones are educated where they want to be educated .
And I will tell you , that ’ s what Heritage has been preaching for a long time . I ’ ve said , and of course there are opponents on the Hill who go after me , I want a veteran to take advantage of the educational option he or she wants , which means [ if ] that veteran wants to be a mechanic , a master mechanic , or a plumber or electrician , I am not going to force that veteran into a four-year track that leads to an anthropology or sociology degree just because some public university is out there promoting it through its mouthpieces on the Hill .
So choice is the key for our veterans , both on the medical front and on the education front . So I thank you very much for having me .
Bluey : Thank you , Secretary Robert Wilkie . We appreciate your leadership .

A lightly edited transcript is below along with the full audio podcast.

Rob Bluey: Tell us about the mission of Veterans Affairs and what your priorities are as secretary for the department.

Robert Wilkie: The mission is very simple, but it’s also sublime. I’m sitting underneath the quote from the father of what was first the Veterans Bureau and now Veterans Affairs. That’s Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

One of the last acts of his life before he went to the theater was to sign the charters for three soldiers’ homes in Maine, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

Just this April, 44 years after that crash, I took the niece to the Vietnam wall and her father’s name was there, one of the last to fall in that conflict and she saw it, Section 1W, and that’s the kind of thing that animates me, that kind of service, because it is that world that I was raised in and those are the people that I was raised to admire.

Bluey: Thank you for sharing that story. You do get to spend a lot of time with veterans in your capacity and I know President [Donald] Trump always seems to enjoy spending time with our troops and veterans as well, but what is it like working with him on some of these issues that you’re confronted with?

Wilkie: It’s been wonderful because I’m a pretty good historian and I will tell you no president—and you can look this up—ever made veterans the centerpiece of, first, his campaign, and then of his administration.

He has allowed me to expand what you at [The Heritage Foundation] and what I believe to be the key to a free society and that is expand choices that our citizens have.

So what does that mean? We now provide the veteran with the option of going into the private sector, going to a doctor or a clinic closer to that veteran’s home, not automatically defaulting to the government.

When we kicked off the Mission Act, which is designed to integrate VA into the wider American health care system, we’ve been able to send well over a million and a half just since June 6 into the private sector.

Now, the other side of that is that we’ve had 3 million more appointments at VA this year than we had last year. So veterans are voting with their feet both ways. Many are staying with us because they know we speak the language, we understand the culture, but we’re also giving those veterans who want to be closer to home the opportunity to stay closer to home, not having to travel, in some cases out West, 500, 600, 700 miles round trip. So it is a new day for us.

The other thing that we’re doing, we’re certainly modernizing our supply chain. We are creating the first electronic health record that follows an American from the time that American walks into the military entrance processing station, at the time that veteran is handed to us. So people like my father do not have to carry around an 800-page paper record for the rest of their post-military lives.

Bluey: It’s so good to hear you talk about those initiatives. It wasn’t much long ago prior to your arrival that we constantly seem to be hearing about the VA in terms of the scandals that might be happening at the department …

Wilkie: Well, you just hit it, it’s “used to.” And the problem—I’ve got it sitting in this perch—is that most of the stories you read, you have to go all the way down to the bottom of those stories.

There was just one in The Wall Street Journal about things that happened in the last administration. And I think there’s an element in the national media that will never be satisfied if there are no scandals at VA. If there are no systemic problems.

In an organization this large, they’re going to be bad apples. No question. But what has amazed me is that how many people, particularly in the press and certainly some on Capitol Hill, who were invested in the failure of this department. And I think the president has rejected that mindset, I certainly have, and those things that we saw many years ago, we certainly don’t see them now.

Bluey: Mr. Secretary, I wanted to ask you a two-part question: One is, how have you changed the culture there at VA, and what are some of the measures that you’ve put in place to ensure that you are having success and meeting the needs of veterans?

Wilkie: I will tell you, the first thing is our customer satisfaction rate. It’s sitting at 90%. There’s no other health care system in the country with that. And our veterans are voting with their feet.

This president has given me the opportunity to bring people into this structure who have an investment in the armed forces in the United States. Everyone around me has significant military experience. That’s vital. It doesn’t matter that much if in a private hospital setting, but for us if you don’t understand the culture and you don’t speak the language, you have no credibility with veterans.

The other thing that we are doing is that we are walking the post, we are out there talking. I’ve been in just the last year in 43 states and all the territory and you would be amazed how many places I go, big cities in this country, massive cities. … I walk in and they say, “You are the first secretary we’ve ever seen.”

So getting out of this town and getting out and talking to the people who have served that we have to serve has been key to the change. And just in the last year we’ve gone from 17 out of 17 in terms of best places to work in government to No. 6 and I think next year will be higher than that.

Bluey: Showing up can make all the difference. And my final question for you has to do with as you look ahead to the coming year, what is it in 2020 that you hope to achieve? What are some of the top goals on your mind?

Wilkie: We want to continue the upward trajectory to make sure veterans know that they now have options when it comes to their own care. We want to continue modernizing, we want to continue, we are going to be fielding the electronic health record; we’ll modernize the supply chain. We will make sure that better ones are educated where they want to be educated.

And I will tell you, that’s what Heritage has been preaching for a long time. I’ve said, and of course there are opponents on the Hill who go after me, I want a veteran to take advantage of the educational option he or she wants, which means [if] that veteran wants to be a mechanic, a master mechanic, or a plumber or electrician, I am not going to force that veteran into a four-year track that leads to an anthropology or sociology degree just because some public university is out there promoting it through its mouthpieces on the Hill.

So choice is the key for our veterans, both on the medical front and on the education front. So I thank you very much for having me.

Bluey: Thank you, Secretary Robert Wilkie. We appreciate your leadership. Thanks for joining The Daily Signal.

Wilkie: Thanks a lot, Rob.",www.dailysignal.com,right,aAUceCmeAJA7CTfH

Bowe Bergdahl pleaded guilty Monday at Fort Bragg to charges he endangered comrades by walking away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 -- the court case wrapping up three years after a stunning Rose Garden spectacle in which former President Barack Obama , flanked by Bergdahl 's parents , triumphantly announced the soldier 's release from captivity .
`` I understand that leaving was against the law , '' said Bergdahl , whose decision to walk off his remote post in Afghanistan in 2009 prompted intense search and recovery missions , during which some of his comrades were seriously wounded and other soldiers died .
`` At the time , I had no intention of causing search and recovery operations , '' Bergdahl said , but he added he now understand that his decision prompted efforts to find him .
Bergdahl told the judge he left his post because he had issues with his command and was trying to travel to another base to notify them -- a claim that has been disputed in the past by a former platoon mate . He added he got lost after 20 minutes and was captured hours later .
The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison , while the desertion charge is punishable by up to five years behind bars .
Bergdahl also claimed Monday he escaped around 12 to 15 times while he was being held by the Taliban , with one instance lasting eight days , until he was re-captured by his captors .
It was n't immediately clear whether his defense has conceded that he 's responsible for a long chain of events that his desertion prompted , which included many decisions by others on how to conduct the searches . Despite his plea , the prosecution and defense have not agreed to a stipulation of facts , said one of his lawyers , Maj. Oren Gleich , according to The Associated Press .
Another one of Bergdahl 's lawyers , when reached by Fox News , said `` no comment . ''
Bergdahl , 31 , was released in May 2014 after a highly-criticized deal in which five Taliban terrorists were set free . At the time , Obama administration officials said Bergdahl had `` served with honor and distinction . ''
The U.S. Army said Bergdahl asked to enter his plea before the military judge . Obama was criticized by Republicans for the 2014 Taliban prisoner swap that brought Bergdahl home , while President Donald Trump harshly criticized Bergdahl on the campaign trail .
Bergdahl 's punishment wo n't be known until after the judge , Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance , holds the sentencing hearing that 's expected to start on Oct. 23 . Bergdahl , who 's from Hailey , Idaho , previously chose to have his case heard by a judge alone , rather than a jury .
Serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl are expected to play a role in his sentencing . While guilty pleas would allow him to avoid a trial , he 'd still face a sentencing hearing in late October . Bergdahl 's five years of captivity by the Taliban and its allies also will likely play a role in what punishment he receives .
At one point during his captivity , Bergdahl converted to Islam , fraternized openly with his captors and declared himself a `` mujahid , '' or warrior for Islam , Fox News reported in 2014 , citing secret documents prepared on the basis of a purported eyewitness account .
The reports indicate that Bergdahl 's relations with his Haqqani terrorist network captors morphed over time , from periods of hostility , where he was treated very much like a hostage , to periods where , as one source told Fox News , `` he became much more of an accepted fellow '' than is popularly understood . He even reportedly was allowed to carry a gun at times .
Bergdahl also collected contact information and talked about becoming a mercenary in what his squad mates described as behavior that laid the groundwork for his disappearance , Fox News reported a year later .
He was apparently “ high ” with a small group of Afghan soldiers when they were picked up by nomads in 2009 , according to a former CIA operative who was running a network of informants on the ground . The former CIA operative told Fox News Bergdahl was captured along with others , and sold to the Haqqani network in Pakistan within four days .
SEAL , SOLDIER INJURIES IN BERGDAHL HUNT TO BE FOCUS OF HEARING
Legal scholars have said several pretrial rulings against the defense have given prosecutors leverage to pursue stiff punishment against Bergdahl , The Associated Press reported . Perhaps most significant was the judge 's decision in June to allow evidence of serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl at the sentencing phase . The judge ruled a Navy SEAL and an Army National Guard sergeant would n't have wound up in separate firefights that left them wounded if they had n't been searching for Bergdahl .
“ We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs that got what they wanted , ” Bergdahl said to a British filmmaker in 2016 when asked about trials , according to an interview obtained by ABC News . “ The people who want to hang me , you ’ re never going to convince those people . ”

us_military,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2015/0430/Breaking-military-s-ultimate-glass-ceiling-Women-start-Ranger-training,Breaking military's ultimate glass ceiling? Women start Ranger training.,2015-04-30,Anna Mulrine,"FORT BENNING , GA. — At first glance , the scene unfolding here in the rolling Georgia woodlands would appear to be unremarkable .
Two-by-two , bellies in the dirt and hands behind their backs , buddy teams of soldiers with shaved heads snake across the ground under the eye of the attentive instructors .
“ It ’ s an obstacle course – have some fun ! ” yells another to exhausted soldiers ordered to crab-walk to the evocatively-named “ Belly Buster , ” a station that involves running headlong into a stomach-high moving log .
It would seem to be a snapshot like any other in the 63-year history of the Army ’ s elite Ranger School . Except for one thing : For the first time ever , some of these buzz-cut soldiers are women .
You have to look closely to notice . The men have a little less hair , perhaps – their heads were shaved completely as incoming Ranger students . Some of the women wanted to do the same , but the Army decided it would be “ too GI Jane , ” as one official puts it .
Now that the men ’ s bald cuts have grown in , “ I don ’ t even know who I ’ m yelling at , ” says one instructor .
It is high praise for the women , who arrived at Ranger School amid criticism that has been quiet but steady : They can ’ t make the cut . They won ’ t fit in . They will lower the standards of the storied Rangers .
One week into the 62-day course , none of these dire predictions has come to pass .
The challenge for those who remain is stark , however . Between January and April , 113 women tried to qualify for Ranger School , but only 20 did . Of the 19 women who started the course – one had to drop out before school began – eight are still in the running one week later . ( By comparison , 197 of the 381 men were dropped the first week . )
But this historic step has always been about more than just producing the first female Ranger this year . In fact , any women who pass this course won ’ t be allowed to serve as Rangers , since the ban on women in combat remains in effect until January 2016 , when services must lift it or offer a compelling reason why they can not .
But women who succeed will earn the prestigious Ranger tab as well as the respect and , perhaps ultimately , the opportunity that accompanies it . For this reason , the course is being closely watched by Pentagon brass .
What they ’ ve seen has encouraged them . The women here are coming up with creative ways not only to match the men ’ s physical strength but also how to get changed in the woods without freaking out the guys . They ’ re showing they can fight and use their past war experience to fit in at the legendary training ground for the Army ’ s special operations force , officials say .
“ I ’ d be glad to serve with them on the battlefield anywhere , anytime , ” says Brig . Gen. James Rainey , a Ranger who commanded a battalion in the Battle of Fallujah , and is now the Infantry School Commandant . “ They ’ re phenomenal soldiers . ”
Whether the women who remain – with backgrounds as varied as an Apache helicopter pilot and a reservist with two young children – make it to the end of the course remains to be seen .
But they are well-positioned , senior military officials here say , to become part of the elite 3 percent of Army service members who have earned the right to call one another Ranger .
On a sunny late-April day , the scent of blackberry and honeysuckle in the breeze blowing through the canopy of Georgia long leaf pines , the aspiring Rangers sound off cadences :
The course is less than one mile long straight through , but it generally takes students the better part of two hours to complete the 26 obstacles in it . During this time they will be pushed to their physical limits .
As they perform over the next two months , they will be appraised not only by instructors here , but by their fellow soldiers , too .
It ’ s a crucial part of Ranger School , which requires not only outstanding and sustained physical stamina , but also positive peer feedback – as measured by narrative comments that Ranger students must complete .
It ’ s one way the Army can weed out what are known here as “ spotlight Rangers , ” who shine when leaders are watching and slack off when they aren ’ t .
These narrative comments tend to be solicited when Ranger students are exhausted and hungry , and they don ’ t pull punches .
“ I wouldn ’ t trust this guy to water my cactus , ” one Ranger recently wrote . “ He steals food , ” was another bit of feedback .
As the women make their way through the course today , they garner subtle nods in their direction from top Rangers tracking their performance .
“ She ’ s one to watch , ” says a male observer , signaling in the direction of one female contender .
“ She ’ s smoking it , ” another Ranger adds , referring to a second female student ’ s performance .
Col. David Fivecoat , commander of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade and a Ranger who has deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan , arrived here at the Camp Darby Queen course early , to run it himself before observing the students this morning .
The paint on the obstacles is new and the previous night ’ s downpour has made them slick .
He is standing beside the brigade ’ s command sergeant major , Curtis Arnold Jr. , a lanky redhead with a thick Southern twang who has held every infantry position in the Army , from rifleman on up . He has four tours to Iraq and Afghanistan under his belt .
Together , they are connoisseurs of technique , always on the lookout for novel ways that students here are able to surmount the obstacles within the rough parameters provided to them .
Arnold tells Fivecoat that he has spotted a new one today , as he demonstrates a reverse-arm monkey bar grip used by one of the female students . Fivecoat agrees it is a solid innovation .
Adapting is key for all students , officials here say . “ You may not be able to hump the extra weight because you ’ re a small person , but if you can do a great job planning , or going to get the water , or if you ’ re seen as value-added – that ’ s how you do well in peers , ” Fivecoat says .
“ You ’ ve got to figure out what you ’ re good at , ” Arnold adds , “ and you ’ ve got to make that known . ”
Many of the women here have deployment experience and , in part because of that , have scored highly among their peers in operations planning , says Capt . Katie Fichtner .
A West Point graduate , Fichtner is a field artillery specialist , the first-ever female fires platoon leader in her home battalion . With a passion for trajectories and the math that accompanies them , she has become the school ’ s de facto statistics guru .
She is also one of 31 women brought in to be observer advisers , or OAs , for the female Ranger students .
Since pre-training began , the OAs have been called upon to weigh in on matters that men who had never deployed with women seem to “ fixate ” on , they say , like bathroom logistics and changing .
It is a source of great amusement to the women . “ Men seem to have this mythical idea that women need to shower every three days , ” Fichtner says , recalling a time she was tapped out in the field during artillery training to shower .
“ I asked , ‘ Do my [ male ] soldiers get to shower , too ? ’ ” When she was told no , she turned down the offer . It took a perusal of the regulations handbook for her male superiors back then to agree to accept her refusal .
When it came to changing , since the Rangers are living and sleeping together out in the field , the OAs suggested that women could throw on a rain poncho – part of every Ranger ’ s kit – or simply wear a sports bra .
Then there was the slight tussle over birth-control pills . Ranger School regulations say that students can ’ t take any medication with them into the field .
“ It was idiotic , ” says Arnold of the howls of protest that came from places like Facebook saying standards were being compromised .
The women were ultimately allowed to take the pills into the field . This means , Arnold notes , that they have to carry “ an extra two ounces , ” which should earn them more respect for their heavier load , he jokes .
As some soldiers duck-walk to the next obstacle , knees grazing pine needles and thighs no doubt burning , others are told to leap over a thick log about four feet high before tucking head-first into a combat roll – without use of their hands and without touching the log , either .
It is a task that about 1 in 3 of the soldiers who have been passing by are failing to accomplish .
Next up is a female soldier , who digs deep , leaps , and lands hard on her back . “ Do not touch my beam ! ” the instructor yells .
She dusts herself off and tries again . ( All students get three chances . )
This time , her fellow Rangers cheer her on . “ Jump higher ! ” one yells .
She appears to take this under advisement , but grazes the log each time as she lands twice more with a thud . She gets the standard “ spot report ” for failing an obstacle , just like the soldiers before her .
Still , Arnold is impressed by the cheers of her fellow Ranger students . “ That ’ s good , ” he says . “ That ’ s really good. ” Some of the Ranger School classes fail to jell , for whatever reason , he says .
“ All the classes have different dynamics , ” Fivecoat adds . This group appears to be tight .
As he observes the field of soldiers on the course before him , Arnold is reminded of his 8-year-old daughter . He teaches her to maneuver on her older brothers using a Nerf gun , and she tells her dad that she wants to be in the Army , just like him . “ She ’ s really smart , ” he says . “ She could do this . ”
One of the reasons that women have managed to fit in at the school is that they ’ ve learned skills during their war deployments that make them “ value added , ” as they say here .
As an infantry battalion commander in Afghanistan in 2010 , for example , Fivecoat sent two women down to each company to make sure the units could better do their job .
The female soldiers “ had the ability to talk to women when we couldn ’ t , ” he says , adding that they also came back with “ atmospherics ” – Army parlance for intelligence – “ that were very helpful . ”
Staff Sgt . Cynthia Velarde , an OA from Fort Bliss , Texas , has seen the situation from the other side .
Standing at 5 feet , 1 inch with the closely-cropped haircut of the aspiring female Rangers , Velarde has an easy smile and a passion for athletics – her father , a United States Navy veteran who played on the Bolivian national soccer team , was her coach growing up .
She also deployed to Afghanistan with Rangers as part of a Female Engagement Team and frequently went on patrols with soldiers in scout and mortar platoons .
It took some time for them to accept women in their ranks . “ At first , the guys looked at us as , ‘ Great , extra baggage . ’ ”
She recalls the first time she met up with some of the infantrymen in her new unit to work out . “ We all knew , ‘ This is it. ’ They were going to try to kill us , physically , to see if we could hang . ”
She went out hard with the fast group of men . “ I don ’ t think they were expecting that , ” she says . She kept up for a mile .
“ After that it was a dead sprint for them . There was no way , ” she says , smiling as she shakes her head . She couldn ’ t keep up , but she didn ’ t stop running , either . “ I was hurting , but I wasn ’ t going to quit . ”
As the end of her deployment in Afghanistan neared , the company commander sat her down . “ He was like , ‘ I would take you over any guy , any day on a deployment . I really hope that if they ever open up Ranger School that you do it . ”
When the female Ranger training program was announced last year , the phone calls and e-mails started coming in from other Rangers who knew her , urging her to apply . “ It was very humbling for me , ” she says .
She debated signing up as a student or as an OA . She decided on the latter , because she wanted to help shape the program .
“ I didn ’ t look at this as a career opportunity , ” she says . “ I wanted to look at it as this will eventually pave the way for females coming through . ”
Velarde has offered particular reassurance on the hairstyle front . She buzz-cut hers in Afghanistan and never looked back . “ Sand kept getting stuck in there , ” she says , shrugging .
Having women in their ranks has helped ease the concerns of the men , says 1st Sgt . Daniel Moss , a brawny Ranger instructor who appears to have come straight out of central casting .
“ Things that males might be hesitant towards , ” he says . “ A lot of the female advisers have been in situations where they were integrated . They were kind of the ones to be like , ‘ Hey , you don ’ t need to worry about this – we can do this easier than you guys are planning . ’ ”
He cites a funnel-like device that makes it easier for women to use the bathroom standing up in the middle of patrols , say , without removing heavy packs or squatting down with them , which would be particularly hard on the knees .
“ The OAs said we can use those successfully , ” Moss says , adding with a touch of wonder that this has indeed been the case . “ It doesn ’ t single females out at all . ”
Most important , he says , “ They ’ ve been the ones who have helped make sure we haven ’ t changed any standards . ”
Holding the line on standards at the storied school has been the mantra here . The school is one of the toughest in the US military . Only 20 percent of men who attempt it make it through the first time , and the ones who keep at it often require two or three tries .
Maj. Gen. Scott Miller , the commander of the Maneuver Center of Excellence here , was raised in the Special Operations Forces ’ tough mystique .
“ We said up front that the standards won ’ t change – and they haven ’ t , ” says Miller , a former commander in Delta Force , the Army ’ s covert counterterrorism unit , and a veteran of the Battle of Mogadishu , popularized in “ Black Hawk Down. ” “ Ranger School is the toughest mentally and physically – the most demanding course in the US Army . ”
That is clear to the students here , where the weight of the school ’ s history , with its reputation for superior leadership training , is a constant presence , Velarde says .
“ You ’ re going into a tradition that dates back many years , ” she notes . “ Obviously there are going to be some people not on board with the idea . ”
But in practice , instructors and observers say , the transition has been surprisingly smooth .
Some of the Ranger instructors were “ standoff-ish ” for the first week or so that the observers came in back in January , when the first training courses were held .
Now , Velarde says , “ I don ’ t think there is any way that we all don ’ t feel like this is the right thing to do . ”
Ranger instructors have told her they ’ ve been impressed to see how well they ’ re actually doing .
“ It ’ s kind of neat to hear them saying , ‘ She ’ s one to look out for , ’ ” Velarde says . “ You can ’ t help but be proud . ”
If this grand experiment results in the Pentagon making the decision to open Ranger School to women permanently , Velarde says she will be the first to sign up .

“ Honestly , they integrated well – they just blend in , ” says Moss , the Ranger instructor . “ I ’ d say I was even more pleased than I thought we ’ d be . ”
As Velarde walks by , he calls to her . “ There ’ s one of our OA ’ s now , ” he says . “ She ’ s crushing it . ”","Editor's note: What can women in the military do that no one else can? Check out a special Facebook chat with Pentagon correspondent Anna Mulrine on how views of women in the military are changing.

FORT BENNING, GA. — At first glance, the scene unfolding here in the rolling Georgia woodlands would appear to be unremarkable.

Two-by-two, bellies in the dirt and hands behind their backs, buddy teams of soldiers with shaved heads snake across the ground under the eye of the attentive instructors.

“Get your face down, Ranger!” one shouts.

“It’s an obstacle course – have some fun!” yells another to exhausted soldiers ordered to crab-walk to the evocatively-named “Belly Buster,” a station that involves running headlong into a stomach-high moving log.

It would seem to be a snapshot like any other in the 63-year history of the Army’s elite Ranger School. Except for one thing: For the first time ever, some of these buzz-cut soldiers are women.

You have to look closely to notice. The men have a little less hair, perhaps – their heads were shaved completely as incoming Ranger students. Some of the women wanted to do the same, but the Army decided it would be “too GI Jane,” as one official puts it.

Now that the men’s bald cuts have grown in, “I don’t even know who I’m yelling at,” says one instructor.

It is high praise for the women, who arrived at Ranger School amid criticism that has been quiet but steady: They can’t make the cut. They won’t fit in. They will lower the standards of the storied Rangers.

One week into the 62-day course, none of these dire predictions has come to pass.

The challenge for those who remain is stark, however. Between January and April, 113 women tried to qualify for Ranger School, but only 20 did. Of the 19 women who started the course – one had to drop out before school began – eight are still in the running one week later. (By comparison, 197 of the 381 men were dropped the first week.)

But this historic step has always been about more than just producing the first female Ranger this year. In fact, any women who pass this course won’t be allowed to serve as Rangers, since the ban on women in combat remains in effect until January 2016, when services must lift it or offer a compelling reason why they cannot.

But women who succeed will earn the prestigious Ranger tab as well as the respect and, perhaps ultimately, the opportunity that accompanies it. For this reason, the course is being closely watched by Pentagon brass.

What they’ve seen has encouraged them. The women here are coming up with creative ways not only to match the men’s physical strength but also how to get changed in the woods without freaking out the guys. They’re showing they can fight and use their past war experience to fit in at the legendary training ground for the Army’s special operations force, officials say.

“I’d be glad to serve with them on the battlefield anywhere, anytime,” says Brig. Gen. James Rainey, a Ranger who commanded a battalion in the Battle of Fallujah, and is now the Infantry School Commandant. “They’re phenomenal soldiers.”

Whether the women who remain – with backgrounds as varied as an Apache helicopter pilot and a reservist with two young children – make it to the end of the course remains to be seen.

But they are well-positioned, senior military officials here say, to become part of the elite 3 percent of Army service members who have earned the right to call one another Ranger.

Destination unknown

On a sunny late-April day, the scent of blackberry and honeysuckle in the breeze blowing through the canopy of Georgia long leaf pines, the aspiring Rangers sound off cadences:

Top secret location, destination unknown

We don’t care if we’re ever coming home

The course is less than one mile long straight through, but it generally takes students the better part of two hours to complete the 26 obstacles in it. During this time they will be pushed to their physical limits.

As they perform over the next two months, they will be appraised not only by instructors here, but by their fellow soldiers, too.

It’s a crucial part of Ranger School, which requires not only outstanding and sustained physical stamina, but also positive peer feedback – as measured by narrative comments that Ranger students must complete.

It’s one way the Army can weed out what are known here as “spotlight Rangers,” who shine when leaders are watching and slack off when they aren’t.

Rep. John Yarmuth, Kentucky Democrat and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the president “just declared war on millions of Americans and the 1st Amendment. He is the greatest threat to the American way of life in our history.”

Rep. Joe Kennedy III, Massachusetts Democrat, tweeted a photo of Mr. Trump holding a Bible in front of the church and commented, “This egotistical, racist President must go.”

Rep. Val Demings, Florida Democrat who’s a contender to become the running mate for presumptive nominee Joseph R. Biden, said on Twitter, “Donald Trump may not consider himself a fascist. But he’s using every trick in the book.”

District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser objected to the actions surrounding the president’s visit to St. John’s Church.

“I imposed a curfew at 7pm,” she tweeted. “A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!”

She told District residents, “Go home. Be Safe.”

""You've just released five extremely dangerous people, who in my opinion ... will rejoin the battlefield,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told Fox News.

New details are also emerging about Bergdahl's conditions in captivity, offering a complicated portrait of his five years with his Haqqani captors.

According to secret documents prepared on the basis of a purported eyewitness account and obtained by Fox News, Bergdahl at one point during his captivity converted to Islam, fraternized openly with his captors and declared himself a ""mujahid,"" or warrior for Islam.

Yet the documents also show that Bergdahl at one point escaped his captors for five days and was kept, upon his re-capture, in a metal cage, like an animal. In addition, the reports detail discussions of prisoner swaps and other attempts at a negotiated resolution to the case that appear to have commenced as early as the fall of 2009.

us_military,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/5/25/21267541/coronavirus-covid-19-memorial-day-doctors-soldiers-nurses-health-care-workers,The problem with comparing health care workers to soldiers on Memorial Day,2020-05-25,"Arghavan Salles, Jessica Gold, Ezra Klein, Emily Vanderwerff, Aaron Rupar, Charlie Harding, Nate Sloan, Sara Morrison, Aja Romano","Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic , more than 90,000 health care workers have been infected with the virus , and many have died . To name a few , these have included : a beloved doctor who came out of retirement , a patient transporter in Illinois , a pharmacist in upstate New York , and a nursing home worker . And those are just the deaths from physical illness and don ’ t take into account mental health consequences .
If you follow the news , you ’ ll read and hear over and over again that we are at “ war ” with the virus and that physicians like us , along with other essential workers , are soldiers in battle .
The term “ front-line workers , ” which has been used to describe those in health care during this pandemic , comes from the military , describing people putting their bodies at the front of the battalion , facing down the enemy . “ Redeployment ” has been used for physicians and nurses being asked to practice in areas outside of their specialty in response to the demands of the pandemic . Even President Donald Trump has made this comparison , saying health care workers are “ running into death just like soldiers run into bullets in a true sense , I see that with the doctors and the nurses and so many of the people that go into those hospitals , it ’ s incredible to see , it ’ s a beautiful thing to see . ”
Using this analogy is understandable . War metaphors are frequently used to describe diseases . Wartime physicians have compared the actual daily work , the frenetic environment , and the sheer volume of death , code blues , and tragedy we are currently experiencing to the chaos and trauma of combat .
All this makes it tempting , this Memorial Day , to hold front-line workers we ’ ve lost in this pandemic up against the sacrifices of fallen soldiers . But comparing doctors and nurses to troops is not a fair or helpful comparison .
Though both soldiers and health care workers prioritize duty and service to others , health care workers do not enter their jobs with the expectation that they will be asked to put their own lives ( not to mention the lives of their families ) on the line to care for patients . Medical students , who must train in hospitals in order to graduate on time , did not expect that they would risk exposure to Covid-19 as a part of their training ( and even have to waive liability for it ) . This is not business as usual .
Just as it would be unwise to go into war without weapons and appropriate armor , we do not usually go to work without effective treatments for our patients or protection for ourselves . We still do not have enough personal protective equipment ; beyond masks , we also need gloves , gowns , and hair and eye protection . We still do not have enough testing or even hand sanitizer . We also do not have any preventative measures or therapies for a health care worker who contracts the coronavirus , thereby forcing some to isolate from their families and put themselves at risk indefinitely .
There is little guidance as to how to protect people from catching the coronavirus , and we are still sorely lacking reliable data on how best to care for patients who have it . The day-to-day decision-making on the ground as a health care worker is ever-changing as the science is evolving . This leads to significant uncertainty as to what optimal medical care is . Should we place patients on a ventilator early or wait as long as we can ? Should we put them on blood thinners or does that lead to too much bleeding ? Should we treat them with tocilizumab or remdesivir or the latest drug of the week ? Everyone is desperate for a solution but no one knows what to do .
Yet , often the public chooses not to turn to science for guidance . On top of worrying about treating the patients we have in the hospital , we also worry that many people listen to the off-the-cuff recommendations of government officials and either begin taking the wrong medication for the wrong reasons , or inject something like a disinfectant , which is dangerous . This is all happening against the background of an uncoordinated federal public health strategy . Moving forward , we have , at best , vague plans for “ safe ” reopening . Even masks , which are safe and lower risk , are not currently widely accepted , partly because there is no unity among our leaders on their utility . As if this were not already enough to rattle even the most serene among us , many hospitals have also implemented pay cuts and furloughs , even for front-line staff .
While images of health care workers running into death may seem “ beautiful ” to some , frequently hailing health care workers as heroes and praising our sacrifices suggests that our lost colleagues were expected to be human collateral damage in the fight . As if the California nurse who ran into a code blue to save a patient and died from lack of PPE is a martyr whose tragic death should be celebrated . In reality , as we ’ ve argued before , none of us chose to be in this position . Rather , we have been thrust into roles where we have to risk ourselves and our families , largely because leadership has failed , and continues to fail , to protect us .
With stressor after stressor compounding , it feels more useful , in a sense , to compare health care workers instead to the walking wounded . While some have suffered from physical illnesses , not all of our scars are visible . Working without adequate PPE , with few tools at our disposal to treat patients , and feeling unsupported by the government has taken a toll on our mental health .
So has all the tragedy we ’ ve witnessed . Just as you can ’ t see what soldiers have experienced , you don ’ t see a health care worker ’ s memory of a patient ’ s son ’ s crying face as he said goodbye to his unconscious father through the phone . You don ’ t see her memory of being unable to touch her wife or children , even in her own home . And you don ’ t see the images of those patients taking their last breaths before leaving this world . But that is what many of us are carrying with us , everywhere we go . These patients and their families are with us at the grocery store . They are with us when we try to sleep . And they are there , reminding us of our own fragility , when we try to spend time with our own loved ones .
Health care workers may not have enlisted , and we may not be in a real war , but we have served . Like soldiers , we are traumatized by our experiences in a way that those who haven ’ t been on the front lines with us can really understand . And what everyone needs , really , is to be seen and supported for our respective lived experiences .

To name a few, these have included: a beloved doctor who came out of retirement, a patient transporter in Illinois, a pharmacist in upstate New York, and a nursing home worker. And those are just the deaths from physical illness and don’t take into account mental health consequences.

If you follow the news, you’ll read and hear over and over again that we are at “war” with the virus and that physicians like us, along with other essential workers, are soldiers in battle.

The term “front-line workers,” which has been used to describe those in health care during this pandemic, comes from the military, describing people putting their bodies at the front of the battalion, facing down the enemy. “Redeployment” has been used for physicians and nurses being asked to practice in areas outside of their specialty in response to the demands of the pandemic. Even President Donald Trump has made this comparison, saying health care workers are “running into death just like soldiers run into bullets in a true sense, I see that with the doctors and the nurses and so many of the people that go into those hospitals, it’s incredible to see, it’s a beautiful thing to see.”

Using this analogy is understandable. War metaphors are frequently used to describe diseases. Wartime physicians have compared the actual daily work, the frenetic environment, and the sheer volume of death, code blues, and tragedy we are currently experiencing to the chaos and trauma of combat.

All this makes it tempting, this Memorial Day, to hold front-line workers we’ve lost in this pandemic up against the sacrifices of fallen soldiers. But comparing doctors and nurses to troops is not a fair or helpful comparison.

Though both soldiers and health care workers prioritize duty and service to others, health care workers do not enter their jobs with the expectation that they will be asked to put their own lives (not to mention the lives of their families) on the line to care for patients. Medical students, who must train in hospitals in order to graduate on time, did not expect that they would risk exposure to Covid-19 as a part of their training (and even have to waive liability for it). This is not business as usual.

Just as it would be unwise to go into war without weapons and appropriate armor, we do not usually go to work without effective treatments for our patients or protection for ourselves. We still do not have enough personal protective equipment; beyond masks, we also need gloves, gowns, and hair and eye protection. We still do not have enough testing or even hand sanitizer. We also do not have any preventative measures or therapies for a health care worker who contracts the coronavirus, thereby forcing some to isolate from their families and put themselves at risk indefinitely.

There is little guidance as to how to protect people from catching the coronavirus, and we are still sorely lacking reliable data on how best to care for patients who have it. The day-to-day decision-making on the ground as a health care worker is ever-changing as the science is evolving. This leads to significant uncertainty as to what optimal medical care is. Should we place patients on a ventilator early or wait as long as we can? Should we put them on blood thinners or does that lead to too much bleeding? Should we treat them with tocilizumab or remdesivir or the latest drug of the week? Everyone is desperate for a solution but no one knows what to do.

Yet, often the public chooses not to turn to science for guidance. On top of worrying about treating the patients we have in the hospital, we also worry that many people listen to the off-the-cuff recommendations of government officials and either begin taking the wrong medication for the wrong reasons, or inject something like a disinfectant, which is dangerous. This is all happening against the background of an uncoordinated federal public health strategy. Moving forward, we have, at best, vague plans for “safe” reopening. Even masks, which are safe and lower risk, are not currently widely accepted, partly because there is no unity among our leaders on their utility. As if this were not already enough to rattle even the most serene among us, many hospitals have also implemented pay cuts and furloughs, even for front-line staff.

While images of health care workers running into death may seem “beautiful” to some, frequently hailing health care workers as heroes and praising our sacrifices suggests that our lost colleagues were expected to be human collateral damage in the fight. As if the California nurse who ran into a code blue to save a patient and died from lack of PPE is a martyr whose tragic death should be celebrated. In reality, as we’ve argued before, none of us chose to be in this position. Rather, we have been thrust into roles where we have to risk ourselves and our families, largely because leadership has failed, and continues to fail, to protect us.

With stressor after stressor compounding, it feels more useful, in a sense, to compare health care workers instead to the walking wounded. While some have suffered from physical illnesses, not all of our scars are visible. Working without adequate PPE, with few tools at our disposal to treat patients, and feeling unsupported by the government has taken a toll on our mental health.

So has all the tragedy we’ve witnessed. Just as you can’t see what soldiers have experienced, you don’t see a health care worker’s memory of a patient’s son’s crying face as he said goodbye to his unconscious father through the phone. You don’t see her memory of being unable to touch her wife or children, even in her own home. And you don’t see the images of those patients taking their last breaths before leaving this world. But that is what many of us are carrying with us, everywhere we go. These patients and their families are with us at the grocery store. They are with us when we try to sleep. And they are there, reminding us of our own fragility, when we try to spend time with our own loved ones.

Health care workers may not have enlisted, and we may not be in a real war, but we have served. Like soldiers, we are traumatized by our experiences in a way that those who haven’t been on the front lines with us can really understand. And what everyone needs, really, is to be seen and supported for our respective lived experiences. This Memorial Day, instead of praising the sacrifice of essential workers, it would be really nice if we could just protect each other.

The answer is increasingly 'no , ' according to a new Gallup poll . Last year the number of Americans who thought they were protected by the world 's strongest military was 59 percent , but this year that number has dropped to 49 percent – the lowest figure in the 23 years Gallup has recorded the trend .
While America 's military has been stressed by 13 years of war , experts say the poll results are more an indication of how the public – influenced by election year rhetoric – is struggling to come to terms with the enduring threat to the US and what an effective military looks like .
The poll results are , in part , `` a reflection of the changing nature of warfare , '' says David Segal , director of the Center for Research on Military Organization at the University of Maryland .

Yet the sight of America 's protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the downsizing across the Armed Forces ( including an ongoing 40,000-troop drawdown from the US Army ) , and persistent condemnation from Republican presidential nominees of the drop in military spending seem to have convinced more of the public that the country 's military is a shadow of its former self .
In addition , a decade of fighting in the Middle East under the banner of a `` war on terrorism '' has only seemed to make the terrorist threat more dangerous . International terrorism is the leading threat to the US , according to another Gallup poll this month .

`` This really is about perceptions , '' he adds . `` We 've been used to thinking , 'We 'll send the military in to fix everything , ' and now we 're seeing , 'Well , the military can ’ t fix these problems .

A large proportion of the public are still cleaving to a World War II-era notion of what an effective military looks like , Professor Segal says .

That the military that has toiled against insurgencies in the Middle East is effectively being compared to the military that defeated standing armies in World War II is unrealistic , he continues .
`` One has to ask whether military forces are our most effective weapon against international terrorism , '' he says . `` The fact is they don ’ t seem to be . ''
There is some truth to the claim that the US military has been weakened in recent years , just not enough to suggest it 's still not the most skilled and efficient military in the world .
The Armed Forces have been understandably stretched by a decade of war , experts say . The average age of planes in the Air Force is 28 years old , according to Clarence E. McKnight Jr. , a retired US Army general , and some equipment used by the Army is also decades old . USA Today reported in 2010 that nearly 13,000 soldiers had served three to four years in Iraq , over multiple deployments , leading to increased rates of mental illness and marital problems .
`` We have deployed our troops more often , and for longer periods of time , than are optimal for military performance , '' says Segal .

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , unveiled her much-touted “ Green New Deal ” on Thursday -- a package of far-reaching , big-government proposals like health care for all , federal job guarantees and a push to eliminate U.S. carbon emissions -- but it ’ s already receiving shade from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
“ It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive , ” Pelosi told Politico on Wednesday . “ The green dream or whatever they call it , nobody knows what it is , but they ’ re for it right ? ”
Pelosi took a more conciliatory tone on Thursday , saying : “ Quite frankly , I haven ’ t seen it , but I do know it ’ s enthusiastic and we welcome all the enthusiasm that is out there. ” She also named Democratic members to serve on the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis , but Ocasio-Cortez was not one of those members .
SOCIALISM RISING : DEMS TAKE HOUSE PUSHING MASSIVE GOVERNMENT EXPANSION , AS PARTY LURCHES LEFT
The ding by Pelosi comes as Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey , D-Mass. , unveiled the ambitious deal at a Thursday afternoon press conference . The measure is currently in a form of a non-binding resolution -- meaning even if it passes it won ’ t do anything . But it formally outlines the proposal in Congress for the first time and would mark a start on the path toward what Ocasio-Cortez has called “ a wartime-level , just economic mobilization plan to get to 100 % renewable energy. ” Cost estimates for the sprawling proposal range into the trillions .
The resolution , obtained by NPR , says the U.S. “ has historically been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions ” and calls for the U.S. to take a “ leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation . ”
The resolution paints a grim view of present-day America , saying it is “ experiencing several related crises ” including declining life expectancy , economic stagnation , erosion of worker bargaining power , increasing income inequality and the exacerbation of “ systemic racial , regional , social , environmental and economic injustices . ”
It goes on to say that “ a new national social , industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal ” is an opportunity to tackle systemic injustices of minority groups , create millions of high-wage jobs and “ provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States . ”
While the resolution does not get into detailed policy proposals , possibly fueling Pelosi ’ s skepticism about what the nuts and bolts of the plan actually are , it does lay out the aims of the plan . They include “ net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers ; ” job creation ; infrastructure investment ; guarantees of clean water , healthy food and sustainable environment ; and a curiously undefined “ access to nature . ”
It envisions a 10-year mobilization that would upgrade and expand power sources and power grids to meet 100 percent of power demand via clean energy sources , as well as overhauling transport systems to “ eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible . ”
SOCIALISM RISING : PLURALITY OF DEMS WANT US TO MOVE TOWARD SOCIALISM , ACCORDING TO FOX NEWS POLL
On the economic front , the plan bundles together a host of liberal wish-list items . Among the most ambitious components is a plan to guarantee a job “ with a family-sustaining wage , adequate family and medical leave , paid vacations , and retirement security to all people of the United States ” -- and to provide health care , affordable housing , economic security and access to clean water , air , food and nature to all “ people of the United States . ”
In an interview with NPR , Ocasio-Cortez justified the massive scope of the plan by saying : `` Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us . ”
`` It could be part of a larger solution , but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail . And so that 's really what we 're trying to accomplish with the Green New Deal . ''
The proposals may once have been dismissed out of hand , and Pelosi ’ s comments indicate the proposal will face skepticism from not just Republicans , but also a number of Democrats . However , many Democrats including a number of 2020 presidential hopefuls have expressed their support for a “ Green New Deal . ”
An analysis by Fox News last month showed at least eight potential and current Democratic 2020 candidates have voiced support for or touted aspects of the proposal -- including Sens . Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , and Cory Booker , D-N.J .
It also picked up the support Thursday of former Vice President Al Gore , who released a statement saying it marked `` the beginning of a crucial dialogue on climate legislation in the U.S .
`` Mother Nature has awakened so many Americans to the urgent threat of the climate crisis , and this proposal responds to the growing concern and demand for action , '' he said . `` The goals are ambitious and comprehensive – now the work begins to decide the best ways to achieve them , with specific policy solutions tied to timelines . ''

But it formally outlines the proposal in Congress for the first time and would mark a start on the path toward what Ocasio-Cortez has called “a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy.” Cost estimates for the sprawling proposal range into the trillions.

The resolution, obtained by NPR, says the U.S. “has historically been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions” and calls for the U.S. to take a “leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation.”

The resolution paints a grim view of present-day America, saying it is “experiencing several related crises” including declining life expectancy, economic stagnation, erosion of worker bargaining power, increasing income inequality and the exacerbation of “systemic racial, regional, social, environmental and economic injustices.”

It goes on to say that “a new national social, industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal” is an opportunity to tackle systemic injustices of minority groups, create millions of high-wage jobs and “provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States.”

While the resolution does not get into detailed policy proposals, possibly fueling Pelosi’s skepticism about what the nuts and bolts of the plan actually are, it does lay out the aims of the plan. They include “net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers;” job creation; infrastructure investment; guarantees of clean water, healthy food and sustainable environment; and a curiously undefined “access to nature.”

It envisions a 10-year mobilization that would upgrade and expand power sources and power grids to meet 100 percent of power demand via clean energy sources, as well as overhauling transport systems to “eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible.”

SOCIALISM RISING: PLURALITY OF DEMS WANT US TO MOVE TOWARD SOCIALISM, ACCORDING TO FOX NEWS POLL

On the economic front, the plan bundles together a host of liberal wish-list items. Among the most ambitious components is a plan to guarantee a job “with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States” -- and to provide health care, affordable housing, economic security and access to clean water, air, food and nature to all “people of the United States.”

In an interview with NPR, Ocasio-Cortez justified the massive scope of the plan by saying: ""Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us.”

""It could be part of a larger solution, but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish with the Green New Deal.""

The proposals may once have been dismissed out of hand, and Pelosi’s comments indicate the proposal will face skepticism from not just Republicans, but also a number of Democrats. However, many Democrats including a number of 2020 presidential hopefuls have expressed their support for a “Green New Deal.”

An analysis by Fox News last month showed at least eight potential and current Democratic 2020 candidates have voiced support for or touted aspects of the proposal -- including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Booker, D-N.J.

It also picked up the support Thursday of former Vice President Al Gore, who released a statement saying it marked ""the beginning of a crucial dialogue on climate legislation in the U.S.

""Mother Nature has awakened so many Americans to the urgent threat of the climate crisis, and this proposal responds to the growing concern and demand for action,"" he said. ""The goals are ambitious and comprehensive – now the work begins to decide the best ways to achieve them, with specific policy solutions tied to timelines.""

Among Afghans there is skepticism about the true intentions of the Taliban leadership . And even if the leaders are committed to peace , can they control more radical commanders and fighters who are not ?
Taliban leaders have been negotiating in Doha , Qatar , where a deal is to be signed Saturday on a U.S. withdrawal that could lead to the end of America ’ s longest war . But it is moments of illumination among local Taliban that will determine whether peace can be forged .
But the result ? “ Nothing , there was no result , ” says Mr. Roostami – aside from changing his mind to see the futility of continuing the war . “ Now we understand that this , our country , is being damaged , ” he says .
For Taliban Deputy District Chief Suleiman Roostami , his mind-changing moment came last year , after attacking Afghan police posts in Wardak Province . “ We killed them all , ” he says . Nine policemen died , and three of the dozen or so Taliban attackers .
On a stony hillside in Taliban territory southwest of Kabul , a cluster of graves of Afghan security forces killed fighting the Taliban are marked with the red , green , and black flags of Afghanistan .
A stone ’ s throw away , a cluster of graves of Taliban fighters – entombed in the same frozen Afghan soil , and buffeted by the same winter wind as their dead enemies – are marked with the white flags of the jihadist insurgency .
As Afghanistan today nears the end of a seven-day reduction in violence to test the possibilities of peace – and with a U.S. troop withdrawal agreement due for signing Saturday to pave the way for ending America ’ s longest war – the proximity of these graves in Taliban-controlled Wardak Province symbolizes how minds have shifted toward peace among some insurgent fighters .
Taliban leaders have been negotiating with U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Doha , Qatar , where the withdrawal deal is to be signed . But it is moments of illumination among local Taliban in places like this – along the Kabul-Kandahar road , with snow-covered mountains to the east , and citrus groves and farms to the west – that will determine whether peace can be forged .
Just down the road from the graves is where Taliban deputy district chief Suleiman Roostami says his mind changed , after last year attacking Afghan police posts at either end of a bridge .
“ We killed them all , ” says Mr. Roostami , a long-bearded , young-faced Taliban with an ocher skull cap and brown shawl draped over his leather jacket to ward off the chill . Nine policemen died , and three of the dozen or so attackers .
But the result ? “ Nothing , there was no result , ” says Mr. Roostami – aside from changing his mind to see the futility of continuing the war along a road that for years has seen daily battles , is cratered from explosions , and is often besieged by Taliban snipers and kidnappers .
“ Now we understand that this , our country , is being damaged , ” says Mr. Roostami . “ When I heard about these seven days [ of reduced violence ] , I became very happy , because there is 40 years of war in this country .
“ We are human and we want to enjoy a peaceful environment , ” he says . “ There is a good chance for all Afghans , because we are really tired ­– both sides – from the war . ”
Among Afghans , however , there is no shortage of skepticism about the true intentions of the Taliban leadership – about accepting power sharing , and respecting nearly two decades of dramatic social change .
And even if the leaders are committed , can they control more radical commanders and fighters who are not ?
The Taliban have steadily advanced against U.S.- and NATO-backed Afghan security forces , and now control or have influence in more than half the country – more than at any point since the U.S. military ousted the ultra-conservative Taliban in 2001 .
Last year was the sixth in a row that saw more than 10,000 Afghan civilians killed and wounded , with the toll from Taliban attacks up 21 % over 2018 , according to United Nations figures . And with poverty as stultifying as ever , many jihadist fighters are recognizing the need for peace , says Mr. Roostami .
People living in the Taliban-held areas , he adds , “ are still in poverty , still in conflict , and the government does not give services to them . ”
Minds began changing in June 2018 during a three-day cease-fire , he says , when citizens and fighters on both sides crossed front lines and met “ the other. ” The current lull – officially a “ reduction in violence ” and not a cease-fire – only confirmed for many the possibility and desire for national reconciliation . Afghan officials said 21 security force members and 9 civilians were killed this week , less than half the number reported the week before .
There is no way to quantify the scale of change among the Taliban rank-and-file , since such expressions are anecdotal . The Taliban leadership in Doha insist they are today a kinder , gentler movement evolved from the iron-fisted enforcers that ran the “ Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ” in the late 1990s .
“ We were busy with fighting , we never thought that peace would come . Our one purpose was to become a martyr , to go to God ’ s side , ” says Mr. Roostami , tracing his own rethinking . “ Peace is also the way to God . So , we will enjoy the peace , but we will bring some Islamic changes to this new government . ”
Parwiz/Reuters Afghan youth and peace activists celebrate the week-long reduction in violence that was declared to facilitate the signing of a U.S.-Taliban deal , in Jalalabad , Afghanistan , Feb , 28 , 2020 .
The Taliban leadership now says they recognize that women should work , and girls get an education , though under “ Islamic ” guidelines they have not defined . They also say they are ready for the next step – after a U.S. agreement to withdraw forces – to conduct an intra-Afghan dialogue with the Kabul government they long dismissed as a U.S. “ puppet . ”
Such talks are to begin March 10 and meant to eventually lead to a power-sharing deal and permanent cease-fire . But many voice doubts .
Amir Mohammad Malakzai , governor of Saydabad district further south in Wardak Province , plays audio messages issued several times a day from Taliban leaders in Pakistan to fighters , encouraging them to keep shooting Afghan policemen and soldiers – but refrain from killing Americans – despite the reduction in violence .
“ We have some spy intelligence inside the Taliban , and hear what they say , ” says Mr. Malakzai , himself a jihadist who battled the Soviets as a Mujahid in the 1980s . “ They tell their people , ‘ We beat the English , we beat the Russians , this is the third superpower we beat . After the deal is signed , we will create our own government , and kill and eradicate those who worked for the previous [ U.S.-backed ] governments . ’ ”
Another wild card are Taliban fighters who reject what they consider an “ infidel ” government in Kabul , led by President Ashraf Ghani .
One such fighter with piercing eyes gives his first name of Rahmatullah , and nom de guerre of Mullah Sarbakhod , which means one who rushes forward wildly , helter-skelter , without thinking .
“ This peace and this cease-fire are useless , because our Prophet , our fathers , our grandfathers , our leaders were always in jihad , so that ’ s our only way , to continue jihad , ” says the militant with mud on his black , ankle-high shoes – a signature accessory of many Taliban .
He says he doesn ’ t trust Taliban leaders , if they prefer money or promotions to the dangers of the frontline . And he says he kept up the pressure Wednesday – halfway through the reduction in violence and just a day before being interviewed – by helping blow up a nearby bridge .
“ When they ordered me to destroy the bridge , I thought , ‘ This is not jihad , ’ ” says Rahmatullah , whose phone ringtone is a Taliban song . “ Still we don ’ t know who we work for . They tell us , blow up this bridge ... kill this one , kill that one , attack this station , these police .
“ But we don ’ t know who the order is from . Is it from Pakistan ? From Iran ? From India ? From America ? ” the 50-year-old jihadist asks . “ The only reason we are fighting is for our religion , to kill ourselves in this Islamic way , to become a martyr . ”
Still , the war will continue if American troops remain , says Rahmatullah . He says he “ really enjoyed ” one operation in 2017 , in which he helped place roadside bombs that destroyed two U.S. armored vehicles and killed seven or eight Americans .
Rahmat Gul/AP Afghan security personnel gather at the site of an explosion in Kabul , Afghanistan , Feb. 26 , 2020 . Officials says a bomb placed in a motorbike wounded nine people . A reduction in violence starting Feb. 21 sought to set the stage for the United States and Taliban to sign a deal on a U.S. withdrawal aimed at ending America 's longest war .
He ticks off a list of unsubstantiated Taliban talking points , accusing U.S. forces of “ burning our holy Quran ” and setting fire to mosques . He says if the Americans leave , it will be easy to make peace with the Afghan “ brothers ” of the government – unless they reject more Islamic rule .
Taliban negotiators calculate that they can control such radicals in their ranks if they reject the Doha deal .
For some Afghans , the change in Taliban thinking started long ago . Atiqullah Omid is a businessman from Wardak who served the 1990s Taliban regime in its finance department .
When the Taliban began to ratchet up their insurgency a decade ago , they were convinced they would once again seize control of the government .
“ They called me and said , ‘ Choose your house in Kabul , and when we take over we will give it to you , ’ ” says Mr. Omid . “ Now when I am in touch with the Taliban , they say they are paying attention to the reduction in violence . ... I believe if they announce peace , no one will take up weapons , because people are so tired . ”

That is the conclusion of Mr. Roostami , the district official , who now thinks about his children living at peace , as much as fighting . He has two boys and two girls , all under the age of 6 .
“ I want a bright future for them , ” he says . “ First they should be educated in Islamic religion , and second they should be educated in every subject , both my sons and my daughters . ”","One such fighter, who gives a nom de guerre that means one who rushes forward helter-skelter, says he distrusts the leaders. “This peace and this cease-fire are useless, because our prophet, our fathers, our grandfathers, our leaders were always in jihad, so that’s our only way, to continue jihad.”

A stone’s throw away, a cluster of graves of Taliban fighters – entombed in the same frozen Afghan soil, and buffeted by the same winter wind as their dead enemies – are marked with the white flags of the jihadist insurgency.

As Afghanistan today nears the end of a seven-day reduction in violence to test the possibilities of peace – and with a U.S. troop withdrawal agreement due for signing Saturday to pave the way for ending America’s longest war – the proximity of these graves in Taliban-controlled Wardak Province symbolizes how minds have shifted toward peace among some insurgent fighters.

Taliban leaders have been negotiating with U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Doha, Qatar, where the withdrawal deal is to be signed. But it is moments of illumination among local Taliban in places like this – along the Kabul-Kandahar road, with snow-covered mountains to the east, and citrus groves and farms to the west – that will determine whether peace can be forged.

Just down the road from the graves is where Taliban deputy district chief Suleiman Roostami says his mind changed, after last year attacking Afghan police posts at either end of a bridge.

“We killed them all,” says Mr. Roostami, a long-bearded, young-faced Taliban with an ocher skull cap and brown shawl draped over his leather jacket to ward off the chill. Nine policemen died, and three of the dozen or so attackers.

But the result? “Nothing, there was no result,” says Mr. Roostami – aside from changing his mind to see the futility of continuing the war along a road that for years has seen daily battles, is cratered from explosions, and is often besieged by Taliban snipers and kidnappers.

“Now we understand that this, our country, is being damaged,” says Mr. Roostami. “When I heard about these seven days [of reduced violence], I became very happy, because there is 40 years of war in this country.

“We are human and we want to enjoy a peaceful environment,” he says. “There is a good chance for all Afghans, because we are really tired ­– both sides – from the war.”

Shared skepticism

Among Afghans, however, there is no shortage of skepticism about the true intentions of the Taliban leadership – about accepting power sharing, and respecting nearly two decades of dramatic social change.

And even if the leaders are committed, can they control more radical commanders and fighters who are not?

The Taliban have steadily advanced against U.S.- and NATO-backed Afghan security forces, and now control or have influence in more than half the country – more than at any point since the U.S. military ousted the ultra-conservative Taliban in 2001.

Last year was the sixth in a row that saw more than 10,000 Afghan civilians killed and wounded, with the toll from Taliban attacks up 21% over 2018, according to United Nations figures. And with poverty as stultifying as ever, many jihadist fighters are recognizing the need for peace, says Mr. Roostami.

People living in the Taliban-held areas, he adds, “are still in poverty, still in conflict, and the government does not give services to them.”

Minds began changing in June 2018 during a three-day cease-fire, he says, when citizens and fighters on both sides crossed front lines and met “the other.” The current lull – officially a “reduction in violence” and not a cease-fire – only confirmed for many the possibility and desire for national reconciliation. Afghan officials said 21 security force members and 9 civilians were killed this week, less than half the number reported the week before.

A different Taliban?

There is no way to quantify the scale of change among the Taliban rank-and-file, since such expressions are anecdotal. The Taliban leadership in Doha insist they are today a kinder, gentler movement evolved from the iron-fisted enforcers that ran the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” in the late 1990s.

“We were busy with fighting, we never thought that peace would come. Our one purpose was to become a martyr, to go to God’s side,” says Mr. Roostami, tracing his own rethinking. “Peace is also the way to God. So, we will enjoy the peace, but we will bring some Islamic changes to this new government.”

Parwiz/Reuters Afghan youth and peace activists celebrate the week-long reduction in violence that was declared to facilitate the signing of a U.S.-Taliban deal, in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, Feb, 28, 2020.

The Taliban leadership now says they recognize that women should work, and girls get an education, though under “Islamic” guidelines they have not defined. They also say they are ready for the next step – after a U.S. agreement to withdraw forces – to conduct an intra-Afghan dialogue with the Kabul government they long dismissed as a U.S. “puppet.”

Such talks are to begin March 10 and meant to eventually lead to a power-sharing deal and permanent cease-fire. But many voice doubts.

Amir Mohammad Malakzai, governor of Saydabad district further south in Wardak Province, plays audio messages issued several times a day from Taliban leaders in Pakistan to fighters, encouraging them to keep shooting Afghan policemen and soldiers – but refrain from killing Americans – despite the reduction in violence.

“We have some spy intelligence inside the Taliban, and hear what they say,” says Mr. Malakzai, himself a jihadist who battled the Soviets as a Mujahid in the 1980s. “They tell their people, ‘We beat the English, we beat the Russians, this is the third superpower we beat. After the deal is signed, we will create our own government, and kill and eradicate those who worked for the previous [U.S.-backed] governments.’”

Fighting “for our religion”

Another wild card are Taliban fighters who reject what they consider an “infidel” government in Kabul, led by President Ashraf Ghani.

One such fighter with piercing eyes gives his first name of Rahmatullah, and nom de guerre of Mullah Sarbakhod, which means one who rushes forward wildly, helter-skelter, without thinking.

“This peace and this cease-fire are useless, because our Prophet, our fathers, our grandfathers, our leaders were always in jihad, so that’s our only way, to continue jihad,” says the militant with mud on his black, ankle-high shoes – a signature accessory of many Taliban.

He says he doesn’t trust Taliban leaders, if they prefer money or promotions to the dangers of the frontline. And he says he kept up the pressure Wednesday – halfway through the reduction in violence and just a day before being interviewed – by helping blow up a nearby bridge.

“When they ordered me to destroy the bridge, I thought, ‘This is not jihad,’” says Rahmatullah, whose phone ringtone is a Taliban song. “Still we don’t know who we work for. They tell us, blow up this bridge ... kill this one, kill that one, attack this station, these police.

“But we don’t know who the order is from. Is it from Pakistan? From Iran? From India? From America?” the 50-year-old jihadist asks. “The only reason we are fighting is for our religion, to kill ourselves in this Islamic way, to become a martyr.”

Still, the war will continue if American troops remain, says Rahmatullah. He says he “really enjoyed” one operation in 2017, in which he helped place roadside bombs that destroyed two U.S. armored vehicles and killed seven or eight Americans.

Rahmat Gul/AP Afghan security personnel gather at the site of an explosion in Kabul, Afghanistan, Feb. 26, 2020. Officials says a bomb placed in a motorbike wounded nine people. A reduction in violence starting Feb. 21 sought to set the stage for the United States and Taliban to sign a deal on a U.S. withdrawal aimed at ending America's longest war.

He ticks off a list of unsubstantiated Taliban talking points, accusing U.S. forces of “burning our holy Quran” and setting fire to mosques. He says if the Americans leave, it will be easy to make peace with the Afghan “brothers” of the government – unless they reject more Islamic rule.

Taliban negotiators calculate that they can control such radicals in their ranks if they reject the Doha deal.

Seeking a “bright future”

For some Afghans, the change in Taliban thinking started long ago. Atiqullah Omid is a businessman from Wardak who served the 1990s Taliban regime in its finance department.

When the Taliban began to ratchet up their insurgency a decade ago, they were convinced they would once again seize control of the government.

“They called me and said, ‘Choose your house in Kabul, and when we take over we will give it to you,’” says Mr. Omid. “Now when I am in touch with the Taliban, they say they are paying attention to the reduction in violence. ... I believe if they announce peace, no one will take up weapons, because people are so tired.”

That is the conclusion of Mr. Roostami, the district official, who now thinks about his children living at peace, as much as fighting. He has two boys and two girls, all under the age of 6.

“I want a bright future for them,” he says. “First they should be educated in Islamic religion, and second they should be educated in every subject, both my sons and my daughters.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,ZROHxxuJVgtMCWtg

Speaking Tuesday in Warsaw , Poland , President Barack Obama said that Bergdahl had not then been interrogated by U.S. officials because he is still undergoing medical care . Nor had he met yet with his family , according to the President .
Bergdahl -- who was released by his Taliban captors in exchange for five prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba -- is at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany . The five prisoners headed to Qatar as part of the exchange .
Bergdahl will remain at that U.S. Army medical center in Germany until he completes treatment , a U.S. defense official there told CNN . After that , Bergdahl will return to the United States and go to a San Antonio military base , the official said .
In his statement Tuesday , McHugh suggested Bergdahl 's medical treatment will be a driving force in what happens next and when it does .
`` There is no timeline for this , and we will take as long as medically necessary to aid his recovery , '' McHugh said .
The release of Bergdahl , the last American soldier held captive from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts , spurred celebration in many circles .
But others challenged the move -- including some critical because he was let go in exchange for Guantanamo detainees , plus many of those who served with Bergdahl who characterized him as a deserter whose `` selfish act '' ended up costing others ' lives .
According to firsthand accounts from soldiers in his platoon , Bergdahl -- sometime before he was set to go on guard duty -- shed his weapons and walked off an observation post with nothing more than a compass , a knife , water , a digital camera and a diary .
The team leader , Evan Buetow , recalled to CNN 's Jake Tapper that Bergdahl `` did not agree with the war effort in Afghanistan '' and had said various things that , in retrospect , led him to believe the soldier had `` walked away . ''
`` It was a gut feeling I had , '' Buetow said Tuesday . `` ... When he comes up missing and all of his sensitive items are left behind , it just kind of hit us in the head . ''
At least six soldiers were killed in subsequent searches for Bergdahl , according to soldiers involved in operations to find him . The Pentagon was not able to provide details on specific operations in which any soldiers killed during that time were involved .
Also , many soldiers in Bergdahl 's platoon said attacks seemed to increase against the United States in Paktika province in the days and weeks following his disappearance .
Buetow conceded that he and others may never know if this violence was coincidental or if Bergdahl gave his captors information voluntarily or after being tortured . Yet he found it `` incredibly suspicious '' that attacks after Bergdahl disappeared seemed to become `` far more directed . ''
As to those U.S. soldiers who died , Buetow said , `` Those soldiers would not be on those patrols , in those specific areas when they were killed , unless Bergdahl left . And that 's a fact to me . ''
All this said , the exact circumstances of his disappearance are very uncertain .
Published accounts have varied widely , from claims that he walked off the post to claims that he was grabbed from a latrine .
Noting everything that he left behind , an Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his 2009 disappearance concluded that Bergdahl left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report . The official spoke to CNN Tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information .

`` Whatever the circumstances may turn out to be , we still get an American soldier back if he is held in captivity . Period . Full stop , '' Obama said . `` We do n't condition that . ''

Instead , the United States worked through a third party to arrange a prisoner swap . The five Taliban prisoners freed from U.S. custody were transferred to Qatar , where Obama said he 's confident they wo n't endanger the United States on the battlefield or elsewhere .
Several factors help mitigate the risk of the exchange , two senior U.S. officials said . They include :
• They 've been in Guantanamo for a long time and therefore likely do n't have networks as extensive as they once had ;
• Most U.S. troops will out of Afghanistan in a year ;

Trump’s decision has sparked bipartisan backlash on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are openly concerned that the president is blurring the separation of powers and attempting to override Congress’s government funding decisions.

GOP Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsPoll shows Collins displaces McConnell as most unpopular senator Collins says she's 'likely' to support calling witnesses for impeachment trial Democratic group plans mobile billboard targeting Collins on impeachment MORE (Maine) told reporters to “keep in mind the irony” of the president deciding to take money away from military construction projects that were part of his previous budget requests.

“We had military leaders come before us and make the case for each of these projects as being vital to our national security and it seems to me very shortsighted and harmful to our national security … for that money to be used for other purposes,” she said.

Sen. Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderTrump's trial a major test for McConnell, Schumer Trump Jr. to stump for ex-ambassador running for Tennessee Senate seat Hoyer: Democratic chairmen trying to bridge divide on surprise medical bills MORE (R-Tenn.), during a floor speech, also urged Trump to rethink his emergency declaration and reshuffle more money from the Pentagon’s counter-drug accounts rather than military construction.

“Using funds already approved by Congress avoids taking money from military construction projects specifically approved by Congress for such activities as military barracks and hospitals,” he said.

Senators say they are in the dark about where the administration will shuffle money from and if projects in their home states will, at least temporarily, be put on hold. The limbo status comes as the Senate is poised to vote on a resolution this month that would block Trump’s emergency declaration.

Trump has threatened to veto the resolution, potentially setting up a conflict between the president and his party.

“I think it's clear that people want to see the final documentation and they want to know the specific statutory basis,” said Sen. John Kennedy John Neely KennedyMORE (R-La.), who is expected to back Trump.

To pass the resolution blocking the declaration, Democrats would need to flip four Republican senators. So far, three have said they will support the resolution and several from different factions of the caucus remain undecided and have voiced concerns about the administration’s actions.

Republicans raised concerns about tapping military construction accounts, as well as the administration’s broader legal strategy, during a closed-door lunch with Vice President Pence and Justice Department officials this week.

“That was the sentiment generally expressed, that we want to see what it's coming out of,” said Sen. John Cornyn John CornynKoch network could target almost 200 races in 2020, official says Seven things to know about the Trump trial New Parnas evidence escalates impeachment witnesses fight MORE (R-Texas), asked if Republicans need to see details on the military construction funding before the Senate votes.

But the administration is trying to sooth questions from lawmakers by noting the funds could be ""backfilled"" during the upcoming appropriations cycle, if Congress agrees.

Several Republican senators emerged from the closed-door lunch saying the administration was pledging to ask to replenish the military construction accounts as part of the fiscal 2020 funding bills, which need to be passed by Oct. 1.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbyAppropriators fume over reports of Trump plan to reprogram .2 billion for wall The Hill's Morning Report — Impeachment tug-of-war expected to end soon McConnell tells GOP senators to expect impeachment trial next week MORE (R-Ala.) said he stood up during the lunch and told his colleagues that one of his “highest priorities” would be to replace any funding taken from military construction projects.

Robert McMahon, an assistant secretary of Defense, separately told House lawmakers that no military construction projects that had been authorized would be canceled because of the emergency declaration.

“While some may be deferred, the budget request will include a request for funds to replenish these accounts,” he said during a House Appropriations Committee meeting.

He added that to protect military readiness, the Pentagon will look to delay projects that “pose no or minimal operational readiness risks if deferred,” as well as those scheduled to be awarded in the last six months of the fiscal year and “recapitalization projects of existing facilities that can temporarily be deferred for a period of months.”

Pentagon officials have not yet told lawmakers what projects they expect to be impacted. McMahon added that they were still waiting to hear from the Department of Homeland Security on how it would spend the defense dollars. The Defense Department is in the process of identifying what military construction funds could be moved and what projects would be delayed.

The White House announced that along with an emergency declaration, Trump would reshuffle $2.5 billion from the Pentagon’s drug-interdiction programs. But in a potential hurdle, defense officials say there is currently less than $80 million that could be used for the wall from that funding pot.

“We should be prepared for a raid on other accounts or even taking even more from military construction funding. These are military construction funds that Congress already has appropriated for specific projects necessary to support the national security priorities of the United States,” he said.

Udall added that that national emergency could be put funding at risk even in red states, where senators are likely to oppose attempts to block Trump’s declaration. He noted that $210 million in military construction projects could be at risk in Florida, $520 million in Texas, $81 million in Utah “and the list goes on an on.”

Acting U.S. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly ’ s dismissal of a beloved captain who raised concerns about the health of sailors aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt sparked swift and sudden outrage from lawmakers and former service members who saw the move as retribution .

Crozier on March 30 wrote a letter pleading for help in protecting his sailors from a growing coronavirus outbreak on the carrier , sending the four-page missive to dozens of military leaders inside and outside of his chain of command . It was quickly leaked by an anonymous source to the San Francisco Chronicle , whose article on the situation drew worldwide attention . According to Modly , the assistance that Crozier had asked for was already on the way when he wrote the letter , and Crozier ’ s immediate superior officer , the commander of the Roosevelt strike group , was “ berthed 20 or 20 feet down the passageway from him. ” Speaking to the radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Friday , Modly also said that he had given Crozier his personal cellphone number .

From Jennings: Which Democrats have what it takes to beat Trump? Not Biden or Warren

Trump’s illegal immigration policies are draconian! He’s deporting too many, they screamed, forgetting that…Obama deported more. A lot more. And, you know those cages on the southern border? Obama built them, not Trump.

Trump’s defying congressional subpoenas! No president has ever stonewalled Congress, they screamed, forgetting that Obama’s Attorney General, Eric Holder, was held in contempt of Congress for…defying subpoenas related to the Fast and Furious scandal. There were at least eight other times when Obama’s Administration defied congressional oversight, even preventing people from testifying (sound familiar?).

When Trump announced his “America First” policy during his inaugural, Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can.

Now, they howl over Trump’s latest outrage: the airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani, who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the American embassy and, evidently, plotting future hits on American targets.

Washington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent. This, after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.

“When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009, he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency. By his third year in office, Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned in Guantánamo Bay,” Newsweek reported.

Obama practically invented modern push-button warfare, for goodness’ sake! Eventually, the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump’s perfectly precedented decisions.

On Iran, Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren’t going to take the regime’s provocations and hostility anymore. Obama sent them pallets of cash. Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper.

Anyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying. They don’t. But the Commander-in-Chief took out the world’s most notorious terrorist, one with plenty of American blood on his hands. Trump is the good guy here, not the terrorist.

Yet, Democrats couldn’t wait to pounce. How many statements included perfunctory “yeah, Soleimani was a bad guy, but…” construction before hammering Trump?

Here’s a pro-tip: If your statement has a “but” in the middle (I’m looking at you, Elizabeth Warren), just eliminate the throat-clearing, political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean. We get it. Iranian Guy Bad, Orange Man Worse.

An interactive guide: Who is running for president in 2020?

This attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election. Not just on foreign policy, but across the board (they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression). They just can’t give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is, thanks at least in part to the president’s decisions.

It hasn’t always been this way. After the death of Osama bin Laden, Republicans praised Obama’s decision to get him.

“Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, ‘The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.’ New York’s former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, ‘I admire the courage of the president.’ And Donald J. Trump declared, ‘I want to personally congratulate President Obama,’” according to the New York Times.

President Trump said Wednesday that he is willing to send as many as 15,000 troops to the border in anticipation of a caravan of Central American migrants making its way north.

“As far as the caravan is concerned our military is out, we have about 5,000-8 [thousand], we’ll go up to anywhere between 10 [thousand] and 15,000 military personnel on top of border patrol, ICE and everybody else on the border,” he told reporters.

Nancy Pelosi complains that the Trump administration’s decision to assassinate Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani was “provocative and disproportionate” and that it “risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence.” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders also have denounced the killing.

Pelosi further charges that the operation was unauthorized.

Specifically, Pelosi says the action was taken “without an authorization for use of military force against Iran.” But the airstrike happened in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, not in Iran. The Trump administration argues that the Iraq AUMF empowered the president to take this action, a position shared by many critics not ordinarily inclined to view the president with a great deal of indulgence, my friend David French among them.

BAGRAM AIR FIELD , Afghanistan ( AP ) — President Donald Trump paid a surprise Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan , where he announced the U.S. and the Taliban have been engaged in ongoing peace talks and said he believes the Taliban want a cease-fire .
Trump arrived at Bagram Air Field shortly after 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday and spent 3½ hours on the ground during his first trip to the site of America ’ s longest war . He served turkey and thanked the troops , delivered a speech and sat down with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani before leaving just after midnight . He arrived back in Florida , where he is spending the holiday weekend , early Friday morning local time .
As per tradition , reporters were under strict instructions to keep the trip a secret to ensure the president ’ s safety in Afghanistan . About 12,000 U.S. forces remain in the country .
Traveling with Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and a small clutch of aides , including his acting chief of staff , press secretary and national security adviser , Trump appeared in good spirits as he was escorted around the base by heavily armed soldiers , as the smell of burning fuel and garbage wafted through the chilly air . Unlike last year ’ s post-Christmas visit to Iraq — his first to an active combat zone — first lady Melania Trump did not make the trip .
Trump ’ s first stop was a dining hall , where the crowd erupted into cheers when he arrived . There , he served turkey to soldiers dressed in fatigues and sat down for a meal . But he said he only tasted the mashed potatoes before he was pulled away for photos .
“ I never got the turkey , ” he told the troops . “ A gorgeous piece of turkey . ”
During his visit , Trump announced that the U.S. and Taliban have been engaged in peace talks and insisted the Taliban want to make a deal after heavy U.S. fire in recent months .
“ We ’ re meeting with them , ” he said . “ And we ’ re saying it has to be a cease-fire . And they don ’ t want to do a cease-fire , but now they do want to do a cease-fire , I believe ... and we ’ ll see what happens . ”
The trip came after Trump abruptly broke off peace talks with the Taliban in September , canceling a secret meeting with Taliban and Afghan leaders at the Camp David presidential retreat after a particularly deadly spate of violence , capped by a bombing in Kabul that killed 12 people , including an American soldier .
That ended a nearly yearlong effort by the U.S. to reach a political settlement with the Taliban , the group that protected al-Qaida extremists in Afghanistan , prompting U.S. military action after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . U.S. and international forces have been on the ground ever since .
It was not immediately clear how long or substantive the U.S. reengagement with the Taliban has been .
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the Taliban ’ s stance is unchanged . He said the United States broke off talks and when it wants to resume the Taliban are ready .
Trump ran his 2016 campaign promising to end the nation ’ s “ endless wars ” and has been pushing to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and in the Middle East despite protests from top U.S. officials , Trump ’ s Republican allies in Washington and many U.S. allies abroad . For months now , he has described American forces as “ policemen ” and argued that other countries ’ wars should be theirs to wage .
Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and more than 2,400 American service members have been killed since the war began 18 years ago .
Just last week , Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to oversee the transfer of the remains of two Army officers killed when their helicopter crashed as they provided security for troops on the ground in Logar province in eastern Afghanistan . The Taliban still control or hold sway over about half of the country , staging near daily attacks targeting Afghan forces and government officials .
The U.S. and the Taliban in September had been close to an agreement that might have enabled a U.S. troop withdrawal .
Nonetheless , Trump said Thursday that he was proceeding with a plan to reduce U.S. troop levels to about 8,600 , telling reporters we ’ re “ bringing down the number of troops substantially . ”
Still , he said , the U.S. will stay in the country “ until we have a deal or we have total victory . ”
Trump made the announcement as he met with Ghani , the Afghan president . Ghani thanked the Americans who have made the “ ultimate sacrifice ” in Afghanistan and assured the president that Afghan security forces are increasingly leading the fight .
“ In the next three months , it ’ s going to be all Afghanistan ! ” Ghani said .
Ghani also praised Trump for the October mission that killed Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . The Afghan leader also indicated , as Trump himself has , that the al-Baghdadi mission was even more significant than the 2011 mission targeting al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden . The bin Laden mission was ordered by then-President Barack Obama .
“ President Trump , people talked a lot about bin Laden , but what you did to eliminate al-Baghdadi , who was an organizer and not a talker , is a much greater accomplishment , ” said Ghani , in remarks to U.S. troops before Trump ’ s departure .
The trip came a week after the Taliban freed an American and an Australian who had been held hostage since 2016 in exchange for three top Taliban figures , a move that has been widely seen as a possible entree to rekindling peace talks .
The White House took pains to keep the trip a secret after Trump ’ s cover was blown last year when Air Force One was spotted en route to Iraq by an amateur British flight watcher .
Cellphones and other transmitting devices were confiscated for most of the trip from everyone traveling aboard Air Force One . And Thanksgiving-themed tweets were teed up to publish ahead of time from Trump ’ s account to prevent suspicions arising about the president ’ s silence .
A small group of reporters was told to meet Wednesday night on the top floor of a parking garage in Maryland and was transported in black vans to Andrews Air Force Base . Nobody would confirm where he was going . The only guidance : Dress casually and warmly . Meanwhile , the president was secretly flying back from Florida , where reporters had been told he ’ d be spending Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago club .
The plane he ’ d flown to Florida — the modified 747 painted in the iconic white and blue of Air Force One — remained parked on the tarmac at the West Palm Beach airport to avoid revealing the president ’ s movement .
About 9:45 p.m. Wednesday , the president boarded a nearly identical plane concealed in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base , taking off and landing under the cover of darkness , with cabin lights dimmed and window shutters drawn .
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said plans for the visit had been in the works for weeks .
“ It ’ s a dangerous area and he wants to support the troops , ” Grisham told reporters before Trump landed . “ He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there ’ s a lot of people who are away from their families during the holidays , and we thought it ’ d be a nice surprise . ”
The president told the troops he was honored to spend part of his holiday with them .
“ There is nowhere I ’ d rather celebrate this Thanksgiving than right here with the toughest , strongest , best and bravest warriors on the face of the earth , ” Trump said .","President Donald Trump holds up a tray of Thanksgiving dinner during a surprise Thanksgiving Day visit to the troops, Thursday, Nov. 28, 2019, at Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan.

Trump arrived at Bagram Air Field shortly after 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday and spent 3½ hours on the ground during his first trip to the site of America’s longest war. He served turkey and thanked the troops, delivered a speech and sat down with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani before leaving just after midnight. He arrived back in Florida, where he is spending the holiday weekend, early Friday morning local time.

As per tradition, reporters were under strict instructions to keep the trip a secret to ensure the president’s safety in Afghanistan. About 12,000 U.S. forces remain in the country.

Traveling with Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and a small clutch of aides, including his acting chief of staff, press secretary and national security adviser, Trump appeared in good spirits as he was escorted around the base by heavily armed soldiers, as the smell of burning fuel and garbage wafted through the chilly air. Unlike last year’s post-Christmas visit to Iraq — his first to an active combat zone — first lady Melania Trump did not make the trip.

Trump’s first stop was a dining hall, where the crowd erupted into cheers when he arrived. There, he served turkey to soldiers dressed in fatigues and sat down for a meal. But he said he only tasted the mashed potatoes before he was pulled away for photos.

“I never got the turkey,” he told the troops. “A gorgeous piece of turkey.”

During his visit, Trump announced that the U.S. and Taliban have been engaged in peace talks and insisted the Taliban want to make a deal after heavy U.S. fire in recent months.

“We’re meeting with them,” he said. “And we’re saying it has to be a cease-fire. And they don’t want to do a cease-fire, but now they do want to do a cease-fire, I believe ... and we’ll see what happens.”

The trip came after Trump abruptly broke off peace talks with the Taliban in September, canceling a secret meeting with Taliban and Afghan leaders at the Camp David presidential retreat after a particularly deadly spate of violence, capped by a bombing in Kabul that killed 12 people, including an American soldier.

That ended a nearly yearlong effort by the U.S. to reach a political settlement with the Taliban, the group that protected al-Qaida extremists in Afghanistan, prompting U.S. military action after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. U.S. and international forces have been on the ground ever since.

It was not immediately clear how long or substantive the U.S. reengagement with the Taliban has been.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the Taliban’s stance is unchanged. He said the United States broke off talks and when it wants to resume the Taliban are ready.

Trump ran his 2016 campaign promising to end the nation’s “endless wars” and has been pushing to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and in the Middle East despite protests from top U.S. officials, Trump’s Republican allies in Washington and many U.S. allies abroad. For months now, he has described American forces as “policemen” and argued that other countries’ wars should be theirs to wage.

Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and more than 2,400 American service members have been killed since the war began 18 years ago.

Just last week, Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to oversee the transfer of the remains of two Army officers killed when their helicopter crashed as they provided security for troops on the ground in Logar province in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban still control or hold sway over about half of the country, staging near daily attacks targeting Afghan forces and government officials.

The U.S. and the Taliban in September had been close to an agreement that might have enabled a U.S. troop withdrawal.

Nonetheless, Trump said Thursday that he was proceeding with a plan to reduce U.S. troop levels to about 8,600, telling reporters we’re “bringing down the number of troops substantially.”

Still, he said, the U.S. will stay in the country “until we have a deal or we have total victory.”

Trump made the announcement as he met with Ghani, the Afghan president. Ghani thanked the Americans who have made the “ultimate sacrifice” in Afghanistan and assured the president that Afghan security forces are increasingly leading the fight.

“In the next three months, it’s going to be all Afghanistan!” Ghani said.

Ghani also praised Trump for the October mission that killed Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Afghan leader also indicated, as Trump himself has, that the al-Baghdadi mission was even more significant than the 2011 mission targeting al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden. The bin Laden mission was ordered by then-President Barack Obama.

“President Trump, people talked a lot about bin Laden, but what you did to eliminate al-Baghdadi, who was an organizer and not a talker, is a much greater accomplishment,” said Ghani, in remarks to U.S. troops before Trump’s departure.

The trip came a week after the Taliban freed an American and an Australian who had been held hostage since 2016 in exchange for three top Taliban figures, a move that has been widely seen as a possible entree to rekindling peace talks.

The White House took pains to keep the trip a secret after Trump’s cover was blown last year when Air Force One was spotted en route to Iraq by an amateur British flight watcher.

Cellphones and other transmitting devices were confiscated for most of the trip from everyone traveling aboard Air Force One. And Thanksgiving-themed tweets were teed up to publish ahead of time from Trump’s account to prevent suspicions arising about the president’s silence.

A small group of reporters was told to meet Wednesday night on the top floor of a parking garage in Maryland and was transported in black vans to Andrews Air Force Base. Nobody would confirm where he was going. The only guidance: Dress casually and warmly. Meanwhile, the president was secretly flying back from Florida, where reporters had been told he’d be spending Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago club.

The plane he’d flown to Florida — the modified 747 painted in the iconic white and blue of Air Force One — remained parked on the tarmac at the West Palm Beach airport to avoid revealing the president’s movement.

About 9:45 p.m. Wednesday, the president boarded a nearly identical plane concealed in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base, taking off and landing under the cover of darkness, with cabin lights dimmed and window shutters drawn.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said plans for the visit had been in the works for weeks.

“It’s a dangerous area and he wants to support the troops,” Grisham told reporters before Trump landed. “He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there’s a lot of people who are away from their families during the holidays, and we thought it’d be a nice surprise.”

The president told the troops he was honored to spend part of his holiday with them.

“There is nowhere I’d rather celebrate this Thanksgiving than right here with the toughest, strongest, best and bravest warriors on the face of the earth,” Trump said.

“ You ’ ve got to have some balls . The Democrats have no balls , ” said Kirk Mobley , 65 , a retired member of the Boilermakers union and former Democrat who switched parties because of Mr. Trump and vowed never to go back .
Mr. Trump ordered the drone attack that killed Soleimani at the Baghdad airport last week , saying the general was responsible for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq and remained a threat to U.S. personnel .
Ms. Woods said she feared an all-out war after the strike .
“ That stuff scares me , ” she said . “ They should have been more strategic about it . … Why aren ’ t you killing Kim Jong-un and [ Vladimir ] Putin ? ”
Though relieved by Mr. Trump ’ s address , Ms. Woods said there was no chance that she would vote for the president in November . She will opt for the Democratic nominee , whoever it is .
Top contenders for the Democratic nomination spent the last few days criticizing Mr. Trump for his approach to Iran , arguing he is scrambling to sweep up a mess he created by pulling out of the Obama-era nuclear deal and tightening the economic screws on Tehran .
“ We wouldn ’ t be in this situation if Donald Trump hadn ’ t started here years ago , trying to move us toward an ever-escalating conflict with Iran , ” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , a top-tier candidate in the Democratic presidential primary , told MSNBC ’ s “ Morning Joe . ”

The surprise announcement by Trump , who as a presidential candidate last year vowed to fight for lesbians , gays , bisexuals and transgender people , came in a series of morning Twitter posts . It drew condemnation from rights groups and some lawmakers in both parties as politically motivated discrimination but was praised by conservative activists and some Republicans .
The administration has not determined whether transgender individuals already serving in the military would be immediately thrown out , a point the White House and Pentagon have yet to decide , Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said .
A transgender ban would reverse Democratic former President Barack Obama ’ s policy and halts years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service based on sexual orientation or gender identity .

Sanders said Trump had “ extensive discussions with his national security team , ” and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president made the decision on Tuesday .
“ This was about military readiness , ” Sanders told a briefing . “ This was about unit cohesion . This was about resources within the military , and nothing more . ”
The Pentagon earlier referred questions about Trump ’ s decision to the White House .
Critics said the health costs of caring for transgender service members were a tiny portion of the military ’ s healthcare budget and Trump ’ s policy change was based on prejudice .
His action unleashed a torrent of legal threats from civil liberties advocates seeking plaintiffs willing to challenge the ban in court and sparked a protest by hundreds who rallied outside an armed forces recruiting station in Manhattan ’ s Times Square .

A MATTER OF TIMING

Trump’s tweet caught some White House officials by surprise.

A senior administration official said Trump had been determined to act for a while but the question was the timing, with advisers split on whether to conduct reviews before announcing the move.

The announcement at least temporarily changed the subject in Washington, where Trump’s administration faces investigations into his presidential campaign’s contacts with Russia and has struggled to win major legislative victories.

It was not the first time Trump has targeted transgender people since taking office in January. In February, he rescinded protections for transgender students put in place by Obama that had let them use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity.

Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman John McCain - the most prominent military veteran in Congress, who was a Navy pilot and prisoner of war during the Vietnam War - called Trump’s announcement unclear and inappropriate until a Pentagon study on the issue is completed and reviewed by Mattis, the military leadership and lawmakers.

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council advocacy group, was among those praising Trump, saying, “Our troops shouldn’t be forced to endure hours of transgender ‘sensitivity’ classes and politically correct distractions.”

“CHEAP POLITICAL POINTS”

American Civil Liberties Union attorney Joshua Block said Trump had rejected the “basic humanity” of transgender service members.

“There are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with allowing trans people to fight for their country,” Block said. “The president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country.”

The House of Representatives’ top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, noted that a Pentagon-commissioned study determined the cost of providing medically necessary transition-related care involving transgender service members would amount to about one-100th of 1 percent of the military’s healthcare budget.

“Transgender people are serving today knowing that their leader frankly doesn’t trust them,” she said. “The bottom line is that this does great harm to people who simply want to serve their country.”

Transgender celebrity Caitlyn Jenner defended “patriotic transgender Americans” in the military and asked Trump on Twitter, “What happened to your promise to fight for them?”

Canada’s military also took to Twitter on Wednesday to say it welcomes citizens “of all sexual orientations and gender identities,” adding the hashtag #DiversityIsOurStrength.

But Vicky Hartzler, a Republican congresswoman, praised Trump for changing Obama’s “costly and damaging policy.”

The U.S. military’s ban on gays serving openly in the armed forces ended under Obama in 2011 after Congress passed legislation in 2010 reversing a law dubbed “don’t ask, don’t tell” that had forced the ouster of thousands of service members and others to hide their sexual orientation.

Vice President Mike Pence and House Republicans have already taken steps to block funding for transgender surgeries provided by the military , saying the defense budget is already strained .
Adding transgender troops to the Armed Forces had been an initiative in the Obama administration .
The announcement immediately split open America ’ s cultural and political divide .
The American Civil Liberties Union called it an “ outrageous and desperate action , ” and claimed extensive research showed there are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with transgender troops .
“ The president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country , ” said Joshua Block , senior staff attorney with the ACLU ’ s LGBT & HIV Project .
The liberal veterans group Common Defense condemned the president ’ s pronouncement as a “ un-American and morally wrong . ”
“ This statement by this Commander in Chief is a slap in the face to Americans who sacrificed to do what Trump and his children never have : serve their country in uniform , ” said Pam Campos , the group ’ s executive director and an Air Force veteran .
“ Transgender Americans are already serving honorably in our military and continuing to sign up in a time when many Americans are not . Trump ’ s gross attack against our transgender colleagues is an attack on all of us , ” she said . “ He actively weakens our military and public trust in it and our top military leadership . “
On the other side , the move was hailed for ending a “ social experiment ” in the military and returning the Pentagon ’ s focus to national security .
Tony Perkins , president of the conservative Family Research Council , said he applauded Mr. Trump “ for keeping his promise to return to military priorities — and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nation ’ s military . ”
“ The military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda , ” said Mr. Perkins , a Marine veteran . “ The last thing we should be doing is diverting billions of dollars from mission-critical training to something as controversial as gender-reassignment surgery . ”

“Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you,” Mr. Trump wrote in a series of tweets.

Vice President Mike Pence and House Republicans have already taken steps to block funding for transgender surgeries provided by the military, saying the defense budget is already strained.

Adding transgender troops to the Armed Forces had been an initiative in the Obama administration.

The announcement immediately split open America’s cultural and political divide.

The American Civil Liberties Union called it an “outrageous and desperate action,” and claimed extensive research showed there are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with transgender troops.

“The president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country,” said Joshua Block, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project.

The liberal veterans group Common Defense condemned the president’s pronouncement as a “un-American and morally wrong.”

“This statement by this Commander in Chief is a slap in the face to Americans who sacrificed to do what Trump and his children never have: serve their country in uniform,” said Pam Campos, the group’s executive director and an Air Force veteran.

“Transgender Americans are already serving honorably in our military and continuing to sign up in a time when many Americans are not. Trump’s gross attack against our transgender colleagues is an attack on all of us,” she said. “He actively weakens our military and public trust in it and our top military leadership. “

On the other side, the move was hailed for ending a “social experiment” in the military and returning the Pentagon’s focus to national security.

Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said he applauded Mr. Trump “for keeping his promise to return to military priorities — and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nation’s military.”

“The military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda,” said Mr. Perkins, a Marine veteran. “The last thing we should be doing is diverting billions of dollars from mission-critical training to something as controversial as gender-reassignment surgery.”

Rep. Vicky Hartzler, Missouri Republican, spoke to reporters Wednesday about the military.

“Policy of past has rendered soldiers non-deployable, and that’s not fair to those who have to be deployed in their stead,” she said. “We need to ensure these defense dollars are going towards meeting military threats.”

Ms. Hartzler declined to say at this time what her proposal would be for those openly trangender individuals currently serving. She also said she has not heard anyone reconsidering the gay and lesbians military policy as a result of this change.

In response , China 's Foreign Ministry reasserted its claim of sovereignty over the tiny , uninhabited islands and called on the U.S. to cease `` making wrong remarks '' over the issue .

Did the White House violate US policy against negotiating with terrorists in securing Bergdahl’s release? The Afghan Taliban has never been designated as a terrorist organization, either by the United States or the United Nations. It is, instead, an enemy combatant.



Bergdahl was not kidnapped, he was not held hostage; he was a soldier taken prisoner by the other side in an armed conflict, much as the five Taliban released from Guantanamo were. Negotiating with an opponent in an armed conflict is a normal process of war, as is prisoner exchange.

Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said an initial contingent of about 600 troops will head to four countries across Eastern Europe for military exercises over the next month .
First , about 150 soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Vicenza , Italy , are arriving in Poland .
Additional Army companies will head to Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania and are expected to arrive by Monday for similar land-based exercises in those countries .
The show of strength comes as the United States , European allies and Ukraine try to ease tensions with Russia and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine . All sides struck a diplomatic agreement last week , but it remains unclear whether pro-Russian demonstrators , who took over a series of government buildings in the wake of Russia 's annexation of Crimea , will back down .
Under the current plan , U.S. troops would rotate in and out of the four Eastern European countries for additional exercises on a recurring basis .

Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said an initial contingent of about 600 troops will head to four countries across Eastern Europe for military exercises over the next month.

First, about 150 soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Vicenza, Italy, are arriving in Poland.

Additional Army companies will head to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and are expected to arrive by Monday for similar land-based exercises in those countries.

The show of strength comes as the United States, European allies and Ukraine try to ease tensions with Russia and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. All sides struck a diplomatic agreement last week, but it remains unclear whether pro-Russian demonstrators, who took over a series of government buildings in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea, will back down.

Under the current plan, U.S. troops would rotate in and out of the four Eastern European countries for additional exercises on a recurring basis.

""We're looking at trying to keep this rotational presence persistent throughout the rest of this year,"" Kirby told reporters, adding that over time the exercises could expand to other countries.

The exercises are part of an effort announced last week by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel aimed at reassuring NATO allies of America's commitment to the region's defense.

Iraq’s top Shi’ite Muslim cleric condemned the U.S.-Iranian struggle happening on Iraqi soil, saying it risked plunging his country and the wider Middle East into deeper conflict.

CALLS TO LEAVE

“The latest dangerous aggressive acts, which are repeated violations of Iraqi sovereignty, are a part of the deteriorating situation” in the region, Sistani said. “Iraq must govern itself and there must be no role for outsiders in its decision-making.”

Critics have called Soleimani’s killing a reckless action.

But Pompeo said on Friday Washington had specific information about an imminent Iranian threat including to U.S. embassies, adding: “American lives were at risk.”

This scenario – it’s important to note that it has not been confirmed – is based on detailed reporting in 2012 by Rolling Stone magazine, which included interviews with Bergdahl’s fellow soldiers as well as apparently lengthy conversations with his parents in Idaho, who shared e-mails they had exchanged with him up until his disappearance.

Obama on Tuesday defended the operation to rescue Bergdahl, saying the United States was committed to freeing its prisoners of war regardless of how they were captured.

On Monday, the State Department said it considered Bergdahl a member of the military who was detained while in combat. The Pentagon said it was unable to confirm media reports that troops had been killed trying to locate Bergdahl following his June 2009 disappearance.

The Pentagon says Bergdahl is in a stable condition at the U.S. Army's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, where doctors were assessing his condition after five years of captivity. Officials have indicated there is little desire to pursue any disciplinary action against him given what he has been through.

While the country is subsumed by both public health and an unemployment crisis, and is separately focused on a sustained protest movement against police abuses, a massive $740.5 billion military spending package was approved last week by the Democratic-controlled House Armed Services Committee. The GOP-controlled Senate Armed Services Committee will almost certainly send the package with little to no changes to the White House for signing.

An Interview with Iraq’s President,,"Robin Wright, Susan B. Glasser, Erik Agard, Atul Gawande, Colin Nissan, Rachel Syme, Dexter Filkins","The U.S. assassination of Qassem Suleimani , the mastermind of Tehran ’ s foreign military operations , in Baghdad last week , suddenly made Iraq the front line in tensions between the United States and Iran . Barham Salih , a British-educated Kurd who spent years representing his party in Washington , was elected President of Iraq in 2018 . Salih has been increasingly concerned about Iraq ’ s vulnerability since the Trump Administration blamed Iran for an air strike that damaged more than a dozen strategic oil installations in Saudi Arabia , in September . I ’ ve known Salih for more than a quarter century , including when he was in Washington and later when he became the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq . We began a conversation in September , at the U.N. General Assembly , about the danger that Iraq will become a war zone—again—only this time between the United States and Iran . I checked in with him again on Sunday to update our conversation .
Iraq has struggled to balance ties with both Washington and Tehran since the U.S. invasion , in 2003 . “ The United States is our ally . Iran is our neighbor , ” Salih told me . The U.S. attack on Suleimani—which was carried out without informing the government in Baghdad—challenged Iraqi sovereignty and triggered unprecedented political fury at the United States within the country . On Sunday , the parliament of Iraq voted to require the government to “ end any foreign presence on Iraqi soil and prevent the use of Iraqi airspace , soil and water for any reason ” by foreign troops . The United States has more than five thousand troops in Iraq ; it leads a multinational coalition that is still fighting ISIS and training the Iraqi military . The vote in the parliament , which has three hundred and twenty-eight seats , was 170–0 . It was carried largely by Shiite lawmakers ; many Sunnis and Kurds did not vote . The measure will not go into force until signed by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi , but Mahdi drafted its language . And , in any case , he has been only a caretaker of the government since he resigned , in November , after weeks of protests .
Over the weekend , Iran vowed major retaliation for Suleimani ’ s death , which led the United States to suspend diplomatic and military operations in Iraq . On Sunday , the U.S.-led coalition announced that it was at least temporarily halting operations against ISIS . The U.S. Embassy also suspended consular operations . The State Department urged all Americans to leave Iraq . The interview with Salih about current dangers has been edited for length and clarity .
How worried are you about a conflict—openly or covertly—between Iran and the United States after the death of Qassem Suleimani ?
The dynamics are dangerous—and I have to be deeply concerned that Iraq will be embroiled in yet another cycle of conflict . Iraq and its hard-won stability in the aftermath of the war on ISIS could unravel . This would have terrible consequences for Iraq and the region at large . We must do all that is possible to assert restraint and walk back from the brink . When we spoke in September , our focus was economic regeneration , job creation , and governance reforms . Then , in October , protests swept the country demanding reforms , justice , and affirming the sovereignty of Iraq . Now we are talking about the challenge of averting war and conflict . In this context , and out of these dangerous dynamics , Iraq ’ s sovereignty and stability should become the common interest upon which the regional and international actors agree on a way forward .
What lessons did Iraq learn from its own eight-year war with Iran ?
War is devastating . There is absolutely no winner in a war . The human cost has been monumental for Iraq . Certainly , for Iran , too . But , also , the lesson is never start a war because you never know how it ends . And one other important lesson : Iraq should never serve as a gate for others . And Iraq should not fight a war , paid for by Iraqi resources and Iraqi lives , for others .
What specific lessons did you learn about fighting Iran particularly ? If you were looking back on it now , thinking about the current crisis in the Gulf , what were the lessons ?
The last thing the Middle East needs is a terrible war , especially as the last war , against ISIS , is yet to be definitively over . Starting a war may be the easiest of decisions , but the region can not afford , can not tolerate , another conflict . Too much is at stake .
You know that eight-year conflict intimately , and you know what fighting Iran is like . They don ’ t give up easily .
The Middle East has gone through cycles of violence , has literally not known peace and security for a very , very long time . The onset of the Iraq-Iran War was the end of the regional order in the Middle East . For the last forty years , Iraq has been a main domain of conflicts across the Middle East . Everyone had a proxy to fight this war on Iraqi soil , essentially using Iraqi resources and Iraqi lives . I do not want to see my country embroiled in yet another conflict , and I do not want to see another war undermining the hard-won stability that Iraq has achieved . The success in Iraq is real but very fragile . I fear that it can not survive another conflict in the Middle East .

Iraq will be very badly affected by yet another conflict , which could well undermine the hard-won stability that we have achieved after years of conflict , and certainly after the last war , against ISIS . If we are not careful , we may go beyond the brink , God help us all , in the neighborhood and internationally , as well .
You have a senseless conflict in Yemen , with untold humanitarian suffering . You have an unfinished war and conflict in Syria . You have a stable order in Iraq that is still fragile . And you have the security of the Gulf very much in question . You have remnants of ISIS that must not be underestimated . You have the greatest issue of ISIS families and detainees , and you ’ re talking about the monumental legal , moral , security problems . And you have Idlib [ a province in Syria ] , with Nusra and Hurras ad-Deen and many other extremist groups .
The military defeat against ISIS was a significant success , no doubt . But terrorism is yet to be defeated definitively , is yet to be eradicated . There are many terrorist and extremist groups spawning across the Middle East . And , again , the last war is yet to be finished , and we ’ re talking about starting a new war ? It ’ s just madness . We need to be careful . Cool heads to prevail . Restraint . Go back to the negotiating table and get this talked out .
We are now focussing on launching a reconstruction fund for infrastructure and to attract foreign direct investment to Iraq . In a situation of conflict , I can not imagine foreign investment coming to the Middle East .
We have legions of unemployed youth across the neighborhood , and we need to expand our economies , create job opportunities for our youth . If this is true in the United States , when your leaders talk about jobs , jobs , jobs , it ’ s definitely far truer across the Middle East—legions of unemployed youth who can fall prey to extremism and destabilize not only our societies but global security . This has to be the challenge .
Let me posit you the following context . I think the Middle East is probably the last remaining major region in the world that is broken . In the early part of the twentieth century , Europe was totally broken . Two world wars . They fixed it . In the sixties and seventies , East Asia was the main conflict area of the world . It was essentially fixed . And you go to Vietnam , you go to Korea , you go to wherever . In the nineteen-eighties , it was Latin America and Central America . It was somewhat fixed . In the nineteen-nineties , the former Soviet Union and South Africa . Yet the Middle East , throughout the twentieth century and now into the twenty-first century , remains the main source of instability across the world .
This region needs to be fixed , and the way to fix it has to come , the solution has to come , from the neighborhood . And I can not see another alternative but economic integration and creating interdependencies , really moving beyond these senseless dynamics of conflict . We go back to what you started with : the Iraq-Iran War . What have we achieved out of the Iraq-Iran War ? Did this gain us any security ? Did this bring us any stability ? No . A lot of people were killed . A lot of people were maimed . A lot of resources were wasted and squandered . And the conflict can not be resolved by war . Really . The lesson of that , and , for that matter , even of 2003 , is just basically that war should be the very , very last option . That war , at least in the context of our part of the world , has never been proven to be a solution .
You keep going back to the Iran-Iraq War . What did you learn about the Iranians , though ?
I mean , I can tell you that Iran is a major geopolitical actor . Iran is a culture of thousands of years of civilization . If I go back , I would say the following : one can say the Iraq-Iran War marked the collapse of the regional order .
Iraq is at the heart of this region . Iraq ’ s stability , in my view , is a common interest of its neighbors . They should not be able to afford another destabilization of Iraq . They should not be able to afford another terrorist wave sweeping across the region . Instead , we should be focussed on what is vitally important to our societies : creating job opportunities for our children , reforming our education system , and moving on . And , again , to take things in context , this is the last remaining major region that is broken . The region can not afford it .
What might a war look like now ? Would it be different from the war between Iran and Iraq forty years ago ?
I think it would be very different . The scale will be different . The regional implications would be different . Iran is my neighbor . We have fourteen hundred kilometres of borders with Iran . We can ’ t ignore Iran . I want to remind you that the security of Iraq is vital for the security of the neighborhood . People should not think that they can have another conflict , essentially undermining Iraq ’ s stability , and think that they can be immune from it . If you don ’ t respect Iraq ’ s stability and preserve it and protect it , this regional order will not come about .
Look at the geopolitics of Iraq . This is where , every time , Arabia , for millennia—Persia , Anatolia—collided . From Alexander the Great , this is where the regional order is defined , when the British came in the twentieth century , when the Americans came in the twenty-first century . Iraq-Mesopotamia is important geopolitically . We need to preserve this stability in order to create any regional order . But war is not the way . Saddam Hussein tried it and failed miserably . And we paid dearly for it in Iraq . The neighborhood has paid dearly for it . The Iranians have paid dearly for it .
Iraq ’ s interests , national interests , is to have very good neighborly relations with Iran . Never again a war with Iran . We do not want to be in a state of conflict with our neighbor , with any of our neighbors .
What if Iran was responsible for the attack on Saudi Arabia in September ? What does that tell us about Iran ’ s intentions ?
The Iranians have been very clear to all . If you prevent me from selling my oil and acquiring the revenues needed , I ’ m not going to let others do it . Sanctions are a dubious tool , to say the least . I ’ m worried about their consequences for the people of Iran , as a neighbor .

The best line is that the United States is our ally . Iran is our neighbor .","The U.S. assassination of Qassem Suleimani, the mastermind of Tehran’s foreign military operations, in Baghdad last week, suddenly made Iraq the front line in tensions between the United States and Iran. Barham Salih, a British-educated Kurd who spent years representing his party in Washington, was elected President of Iraq in 2018. Salih has been increasingly concerned about Iraq’s vulnerability since the Trump Administration blamed Iran for an air strike that damaged more than a dozen strategic oil installations in Saudi Arabia, in September. I’ve known Salih for more than a quarter century, including when he was in Washington and later when he became the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq. We began a conversation in September, at the U.N. General Assembly, about the danger that Iraq will become a war zone—again—only this time between the United States and Iran. I checked in with him again on Sunday to update our conversation.

Iraq has struggled to balance ties with both Washington and Tehran since the U.S. invasion, in 2003. “The United States is our ally. Iran is our neighbor,” Salih told me. The U.S. attack on Suleimani—which was carried out without informing the government in Baghdad—challenged Iraqi sovereignty and triggered unprecedented political fury at the United States within the country. On Sunday, the parliament of Iraq voted to require the government to “end any foreign presence on Iraqi soil and prevent the use of Iraqi airspace, soil and water for any reason” by foreign troops. The United States has more than five thousand troops in Iraq; it leads a multinational coalition that is still fighting ISIS and training the Iraqi military. The vote in the parliament, which has three hundred and twenty-eight seats, was 170–0. It was carried largely by Shiite lawmakers; many Sunnis and Kurds did not vote. The measure will not go into force until signed by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, but Mahdi drafted its language. And, in any case, he has been only a caretaker of the government since he resigned, in November, after weeks of protests.

Over the weekend, Iran vowed major retaliation for Suleimani’s death, which led the United States to suspend diplomatic and military operations in Iraq. On Sunday, the U.S.-led coalition announced that it was at least temporarily halting operations against ISIS. The U.S. Embassy also suspended consular operations. The State Department urged all Americans to leave Iraq. The interview with Salih about current dangers has been edited for length and clarity.

How worried are you about a conflict—openly or covertly—between Iran and the United States after the death of Qassem Suleimani?

The dynamics are dangerous—and I have to be deeply concerned that Iraq will be embroiled in yet another cycle of conflict. Iraq and its hard-won stability in the aftermath of the war on ISIS could unravel. This would have terrible consequences for Iraq and the region at large. We must do all that is possible to assert restraint and walk back from the brink. When we spoke in September, our focus was economic regeneration, job creation, and governance reforms. Then, in October, protests swept the country demanding reforms, justice, and affirming the sovereignty of Iraq. Now we are talking about the challenge of averting war and conflict. In this context, and out of these dangerous dynamics, Iraq’s sovereignty and stability should become the common interest upon which the regional and international actors agree on a way forward.

What lessons did Iraq learn from its own eight-year war with Iran?

War is devastating. There is absolutely no winner in a war. The human cost has been monumental for Iraq. Certainly, for Iran, too. But, also, the lesson is never start a war because you never know how it ends. And one other important lesson: Iraq should never serve as a gate for others. And Iraq should not fight a war, paid for by Iraqi resources and Iraqi lives, for others.

What specific lessons did you learn about fighting Iran particularly? If you were looking back on it now, thinking about the current crisis in the Gulf, what were the lessons?

The last thing the Middle East needs is a terrible war, especially as the last war, against ISIS, is yet to be definitively over. Starting a war may be the easiest of decisions, but the region cannot afford, cannot tolerate, another conflict. Too much is at stake.

You know that eight-year conflict intimately, and you know what fighting Iran is like. They don’t give up easily.

The Middle East has gone through cycles of violence, has literally not known peace and security for a very, very long time. The onset of the Iraq-Iran War was the end of the regional order in the Middle East. For the last forty years, Iraq has been a main domain of conflicts across the Middle East. Everyone had a proxy to fight this war on Iraqi soil, essentially using Iraqi resources and Iraqi lives. I do not want to see my country embroiled in yet another conflict, and I do not want to see another war undermining the hard-won stability that Iraq has achieved. The success in Iraq is real but very fragile. I fear that it cannot survive another conflict in the Middle East.

Iraq can’t survive? Why?

Iraq will be very badly affected by yet another conflict, which could well undermine the hard-won stability that we have achieved after years of conflict, and certainly after the last war, against ISIS. If we are not careful, we may go beyond the brink, God help us all, in the neighborhood and internationally, as well.

You have a senseless conflict in Yemen, with untold humanitarian suffering. You have an unfinished war and conflict in Syria. You have a stable order in Iraq that is still fragile. And you have the security of the Gulf very much in question. You have remnants of ISIS that must not be underestimated. You have the greatest issue of ISIS families and detainees, and you’re talking about the monumental legal, moral, security problems. And you have Idlib [a province in Syria], with Nusra and Hurras ad-Deen and many other extremist groups.

The military defeat against ISIS was a significant success, no doubt. But terrorism is yet to be defeated definitively, is yet to be eradicated. There are many terrorist and extremist groups spawning across the Middle East. And, again, the last war is yet to be finished, and we’re talking about starting a new war? It’s just madness. We need to be careful. Cool heads to prevail. Restraint. Go back to the negotiating table and get this talked out.

Economically, what would the impact be?

We are now focussing on launching a reconstruction fund for infrastructure and to attract foreign direct investment to Iraq. In a situation of conflict, I cannot imagine foreign investment coming to the Middle East.

We have legions of unemployed youth across the neighborhood, and we need to expand our economies, create job opportunities for our youth. If this is true in the United States, when your leaders talk about jobs, jobs, jobs, it’s definitely far truer across the Middle East—legions of unemployed youth who can fall prey to extremism and destabilize not only our societies but global security. This has to be the challenge.

Let me posit you the following context. I think the Middle East is probably the last remaining major region in the world that is broken. In the early part of the twentieth century, Europe was totally broken. Two world wars. They fixed it. In the sixties and seventies, East Asia was the main conflict area of the world. It was essentially fixed. And you go to Vietnam, you go to Korea, you go to wherever. In the nineteen-eighties, it was Latin America and Central America. It was somewhat fixed. In the nineteen-nineties, the former Soviet Union and South Africa. Yet the Middle East, throughout the twentieth century and now into the twenty-first century, remains the main source of instability across the world.

This region needs to be fixed, and the way to fix it has to come, the solution has to come, from the neighborhood. And I cannot see another alternative but economic integration and creating interdependencies, really moving beyond these senseless dynamics of conflict. We go back to what you started with: the Iraq-Iran War. What have we achieved out of the Iraq-Iran War? Did this gain us any security? Did this bring us any stability? No. A lot of people were killed. A lot of people were maimed. A lot of resources were wasted and squandered. And the conflict cannot be resolved by war. Really. The lesson of that, and, for that matter, even of 2003, is just basically that war should be the very, very last option. That war, at least in the context of our part of the world, has never been proven to be a solution.

You keep going back to the Iran-Iraq War. What did you learn about the Iranians, though?

I mean, I can tell you that Iran is a major geopolitical actor. Iran is a culture of thousands of years of civilization. If I go back, I would say the following: one can say the Iraq-Iran War marked the collapse of the regional order.

Iraq is at the heart of this region. Iraq’s stability, in my view, is a common interest of its neighbors. They should not be able to afford another destabilization of Iraq. They should not be able to afford another terrorist wave sweeping across the region. Instead, we should be focussed on what is vitally important to our societies: creating job opportunities for our children, reforming our education system, and moving on. And, again, to take things in context, this is the last remaining major region that is broken. The region cannot afford it.

What might a war look like now? Would it be different from the war between Iran and Iraq forty years ago?

I think it would be very different. The scale will be different. The regional implications would be different. Iran is my neighbor. We have fourteen hundred kilometres of borders with Iran. We can’t ignore Iran. I want to remind you that the security of Iraq is vital for the security of the neighborhood. People should not think that they can have another conflict, essentially undermining Iraq’s stability, and think that they can be immune from it. If you don’t respect Iraq’s stability and preserve it and protect it, this regional order will not come about.

Look at the geopolitics of Iraq. This is where, every time, Arabia, for millennia—Persia, Anatolia—collided. From Alexander the Great, this is where the regional order is defined, when the British came in the twentieth century, when the Americans came in the twenty-first century. Iraq-Mesopotamia is important geopolitically. We need to preserve this stability in order to create any regional order. But war is not the way. Saddam Hussein tried it and failed miserably. And we paid dearly for it in Iraq. The neighborhood has paid dearly for it. The Iranians have paid dearly for it.

Iraq’s interests, national interests, is to have very good neighborly relations with Iran. Never again a war with Iran. We do not want to be in a state of conflict with our neighbor, with any of our neighbors.

What if Iran was responsible for the attack on Saudi Arabia in September? What does that tell us about Iran’s intentions?

The Iranians have been very clear to all. If you prevent me from selling my oil and acquiring the revenues needed, I’m not going to let others do it. Sanctions are a dubious tool, to say the least. I’m worried about their consequences for the people of Iran, as a neighbor. They’re my neighbors; I have to be concerned for their well-being.

At the end of the day, we need all the key players to sit at a damn table and really discuss it. . . . Aggression and attacks are not things that I would condone. Military action, from wherever it comes—I would not condone it. Again, we have seen too many conflicts and we have seen too many military interventions that meant nothing but destruction to our neighborhood.

Some Americans want to equate it, as if, when Iran says something, Iraq will say, “Yes, sir.” It’s not. Wallah, it’s not. It’s a bit more complicated. And the Americans should learn from their own history in Iraq, when they were telling the Iraqis to do this and that. Did they do it? No. Is that a fair point? Is that a fair point? People have their minds, and there are realities you can look at.

The best line is that the United States is our ally. Iran is our neighbor.

Is that on the record?

Yeah, that’s on the record.",www.newyorker.com,left,DHNMs935LgzkMe5g

WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order Friday allowing the Air Force to recall as many as 1,000 retired pilots to active duty to address a shortage in combat fliers, the White House and Pentagon announced.

By law, only 25 retired officers can be brought back to serve in any one branch. Trump's order removes those caps by expanding a state of national emergency declared by President George W. Bush after 9/11, signaling what could be a significant escalation in the 16-year-old global war on terror.

""We anticipate that the Secretary of Defense will delegate the authority to the Secretary of the Air Force to recall up to 1,000 retired pilots for up to three years,"" Navy Cdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.

But the executive order itself is not specific to the Air Force, and could conceivably be used in the future to call up more officers and in other branches.

The Air Force needs about 1,500 pilots more than it has. Bonus programs and other incentives have not made up the shortfall.

The Air Force has been at the forefront of the Pentagon's battle against the Islamic State, flying most of the combat sorties in Iraq and Syria since 2014.

In June, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., labeled the pilot shortage a crisis that would prevent the Air Force from fulfilling its mission.

“This is a full-blown crisis, and if left unresolved, it will call into question the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission,” said McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee.

Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst and vice president of the Teal Group, said the shortage stemmed from a number of issues.

On Capitol Hill, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a member of Armed Services Committee, said that the fight against Islamic State and al-Qaeda linked terrorists will be expanding. He spoke to reporters while speaking about the four U.S. soldiers killed Oct. 4 in Niger.

Counter-terrorism rules under President Obama had been too restrictive and ineffective, Graham said.

Last month, President Trump became the third president to renew the post-9/11 state of national emergency, which allows the president to call up the national guard, hire and fire officers and delay retirements.

Those extraordinary powers were supposed to be temporary. But even after 16 years, there's been no congressional oversight of the emergency.

“ A major point is that unless we get relief from sequestration , the Army will soon be unable to fully execute Defense Strategic Guidance requirements and we will be on a path to a hollow Army , ” Maj. Gen. Laura Richardson wrote in an Oct. 3 memo to the general-officer community .
Budget caps , or sequestration , are suspended under a bipartisan budget deal but could return in fiscal 2016 , beginning next Oct. 1 , unless an agreement is reached .
Perhaps no other military leader is raising the alarm more forcefully than Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the Army chief of staff and former top commander in Iraq .
He has made several public statements recently warning that another sequestration round will come close to breaking the Army .
The active-duty soldier force peaked at 570,000 during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . It is slated to shrink to about 450,000 , but sequestration threatens to squeeze it to 420,000 .
Gen. Odierno has asserted that the 450,000 level is the absolutely lowest the active force can go and still carry out its strategic responsibilities .
“ Caps on defense spending , ” wrote Gen. Richardson , chief of Army legislative affairs , “ are having a devastating impact on the Army , damaging readiness , cutting manpower and gutting modernization programs . ”
Her memo , a copy of which was obtained by The ███ , said Gen. Odierno “ wants to ensure that all Army [ general officers ] are familiar with the impacts of sequestration so you ’ re prepared to talk with members of Congress and their staffs during your engagements . ”
Recent deployments show a busy U.S. Army . It has sent forces to Europe to war games as a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin , deployed a headquarters element to Baghdad to advise the Iraqi Security Forces , inserted soldiers into West Africa to help stem the spread of the Ebola virus and maintained ground units in Afghanistan .
“ In the past , we maybe focused on one big fight somewhere , ” Gen. Odierno recently told a group of defense reporters , according to the Army Times . “ We believe , with the new Army operating concept , we have to be able to do multiple small-scale things simultaneously . We might have to be able to operate with smaller capability on four different continents at the same time because that ’ s the way the world is developing . ”
In an interview , Gen. Odierno told the Army Times that more budget cuts will take the Army to a “ breaking point . ”
He said he would have to further reduce purchases of weapons systems needed to modernize a war-weary force .
“ As I look at that , it ’ s end strength , it ’ s modernization , it ’ s readiness , ” he said . “ I can ’ t go any faster on end strength , so that means you have to take further reductions in readiness and modernization . ”","The Army is calling on active and retired generals to spread the word in Congress that another spate of automatic budget cuts would cripple America’s largest ground force, an internal memo says.

“A major point is that unless we get relief from sequestration, the Army will soon be unable to fully execute Defense Strategic Guidance requirements and we will be on a path to a hollow Army,” Maj. Gen. Laura Richardson wrote in an Oct. 3 memo to the general-officer community.

Budget caps, or sequestration, are suspended under a bipartisan budget deal but could return in fiscal 2016, beginning next Oct. 1, unless an agreement is reached.

Perhaps no other military leader is raising the alarm more forcefully than Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the Army chief of staff and former top commander in Iraq.

He has made several public statements recently warning that another sequestration round will come close to breaking the Army.

The active-duty soldier force peaked at 570,000 during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It is slated to shrink to about 450,000, but sequestration threatens to squeeze it to 420,000.

Gen. Odierno has asserted that the 450,000 level is the absolutely lowest the active force can go and still carry out its strategic responsibilities.

“Caps on defense spending,” wrote Gen. Richardson, chief of Army legislative affairs, “are having a devastating impact on the Army, damaging readiness, cutting manpower and gutting modernization programs.”

Her memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times, said Gen. Odierno “wants to ensure that all Army [general officers] are familiar with the impacts of sequestration so you’re prepared to talk with members of Congress and their staffs during your engagements.”

Recent deployments show a busy U.S. Army. It has sent forces to Europe to war games as a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, deployed a headquarters element to Baghdad to advise the Iraqi Security Forces, inserted soldiers into West Africa to help stem the spread of the Ebola virus and maintained ground units in Afghanistan.

“In the past, we maybe focused on one big fight somewhere,” Gen. Odierno recently told a group of defense reporters, according to the Army Times. “We believe, with the new Army operating concept, we have to be able to do multiple small-scale things simultaneously. We might have to be able to operate with smaller capability on four different continents at the same time because that’s the way the world is developing.”

In an interview, Gen. Odierno told the Army Times that more budget cuts will take the Army to a “breaking point.”

He said he would have to further reduce purchases of weapons systems needed to modernize a war-weary force.

“As I look at that, it’s end strength, it’s modernization, it’s readiness,” he said. “I can’t go any faster on end strength, so that means you have to take further reductions in readiness and modernization.”

Hawley ’ s push could put some Republicans in a bind , particularly those who supported the measure behind closed doors , even though Warren ’ s amendment was adopted by voice vote , meaning there ’ s no official record of which GOP members voted for it .
Hawley said he raised his objections in the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing room last week and asked for a roll-call vote but had his request denied .

Inhofe said he ’ s spoken extensively to Trump and that the president favors removing the mandate to change base names , effectively tying the Defense secretary ’ s hands .
Asked how Republicans would resolve the issue , Inhofe replied : “ I wish I had that answer . ”
He said there are several ways to change Warren ’ s amendment from stating the Defense secretary “ shall ” implement a plan to change base and installation names submitted by a special commission to “ may , ” providing significant latitude .
“ You could do an amendment on the floor , you could do it in conference . There ’ s a lot of doing that . It ’ s not insurmountable , ” he said .
Other Republicans , however , are warning that it could be very difficult to change Warren ’ s language , setting up a standoff with Trump . White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters last week that Trump would veto the $ 740 billion defense authorization bill if it required the renaming of bases .
