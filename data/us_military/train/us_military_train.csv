The fraught debate on firearms and a political stalemate that has blocked almost all public funding for gun violence research have made clinicians reluctant to bring up gun safety with suicidal patients . But suicide rates for veterans and the overall population have climbed over the past 20 years , giving impetus to the push to encourage everything from trigger locks to off-site gun storage .
Former Marine Brian Vargas was desperately rummaging through a box to find the key to unlock his gun and take his own life when he ran across photos of his wife and pieces of shrapnel that nearly killed him in Iraq . His despair lessened . He put down his gun and went on , instead , to found a suicide prevention program for veterans in the San Francisco Bay Area , emphasizing gun safety . The Department of Veterans Affairs is using a similar emphasis as part of its suicide prevention efforts .
The depression that settled over Tyler Solorio after his combat tour in Afghanistan gave rise to dark thoughts . He attended counseling at a Veterans Affairs clinic in his hometown of Modesto , California , where he had returned in 2012 following a yearlong deployment with the Army National Guard . Therapists prescribed medication to level out his moods and subdue his suicidal impulses , yet as he recalls , none of them ever asked if he owned a firearm .
“ That ’ s a difficult conversation that a lot of clinicians don ’ t necessarily want to have , ” Mr. Solorio says . “ But I wish someone had brought it up because I was a risk to myself at times . ”
The polarized tenor of the country ’ s gun debate complicates the question of how – or whether – private clinicians and those at the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) discuss firearms with patients struggling with a mental health crisis . Raising the topic with combat veterans poses a thornier dilemma for therapists because of the life-or-death bond that troops form with their weapons in a war zone .
“ It ’ s like a security blanket – it ’ s always with you , ” says Mr. Solorio , who belonged to an infantry unit . After coming home , he found that keeping a gun close at hand offered solace as he coped with panic attacks that provoked fear of imaginary threats . “ It took the edge off because I knew I could protect myself . ”
Guns rank as the most lethal method of suicide , with 9 in 10 attempts proving fatal . Almost 70 % of veterans who take their own lives use a firearm – compared with about half of civilians who die by suicide – and one-third of former service members store guns loaded and unlocked in their homes .
In response , the VA has sought to promote firearm safety as part of its campaign to reduce suicide risk , urging veterans to consider precautions that include gun locks , removing a gun ’ s firing pin , or storing firearms outside the home .
The safety measures can slow a person ’ s ability to follow through on suicidal thoughts and preempt an irrevocable choice , explains Matt Miller , the VA ’ s acting director for suicide prevention . Research shows that 70 % of suicide attempts occur within an hour of a person deciding to act on the idea ; a quarter occur in less than five minutes .
“ We know that creating more time and space within those impulsive periods can allow for a change of heart , ” he says . “ If we can buy some time , that can be life-saving . ”
Suicide rates for veterans and the overall population have climbed over the past 20 years , and more than 6,100 former service members died by their own hand in 2017 . Mental health researchers suggest that , given the public ’ s esteem for veterans , the VA campaign holds potential to influence civilian attitudes about lethal means safety as a deterrent to suicide .
“ Veterans are venerated in our society , ” says Dr. Joseph Simonetti , an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who has studied gun storage habits among veterans and civilians . “ To the extent that they make changes in their approach to gun safety , that could have an effect on the rest of the country . ”
A survey last year of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans with mental health needs revealed that 20 % worried that seeking care from the VA could result in confiscation of their firearms .
The concern arises from the agency ’ s authority to provide a veteran ’ s records to the FBI for inclusion in its system of national background checks for gun purchases . Federal reports show that such referrals , based on a finding of “ mental incompetency , ” occur in less than 1 % of patient cases .
The misgivings among veterans hinder the VA ’ s efforts to persuade more of them to receive treatment and add to the complexity of discussing firearms with those in crisis . Clinicians work to defuse their wariness by framing gun safety as a self-preservation tactic that aligns with the military training principle of injury prevention . Several studies link unsafe gun storage to elevated suicide risk across demographic groups , including active-duty soldiers .
“ We ’ re not talking about restrictions , ” Mr. Miller says . “ We ’ re talking about safety . ”
A firearm can represent something akin to a fifth limb to veterans . The sense of attachment presents a chance for therapists to discuss secure storage practices as one element in a regimen of practical self-care . Dr. Simonetti likens the decision to apply a gun lock or stow a firearm outside the home to choosing to take medication or attend counseling .
“ We ’ ve been treating gun safety as a separate issue , ” he says . “ But it should be integrated into an overall course of care . ”
Broaching guns in the context of injury prevention enables behavioral health providers to learn about the storage habits of their patients . Craig Bryan , who leads the National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah , advises his team of clinicians to pose open-ended inquiries to elicit relevant details .
“ We often ask questions like ‘ How do you typically store your guns ? ’ and ‘ Why do you store your guns that way ? ’ ” says Mr. Bryan , an Air Force veteran who deployed to Iraq in 2009 . Contrary to the common assumption that veterans will recoil from considering precautions , he adds , “ I ’ ve found that , on the whole , they ’ re open to the idea . ”
In a recent VA study , three-quarters of veterans receiving mental health care at its medical facilities endorsed at least one of four voluntary options for limiting access to their firearms . The choices ranged from clinicians providing guidance to a veteran ’ s family members on safe storage to VA programs for storing or disposing of guns .
The agency ’ s growing emphasis on firearm safety draws support from Mr. Solorio , a policy analyst with Swords to Plowshares , a veterans advocacy organization based in San Francisco . His generation has borne much of the burden of the country ’ s 21st-century wars , and he falls within the age group – 18 to 34 – that had the highest suicide rate among veterans in 2017 .
“ Guns are such a delicate topic . But they need to be talked about , ” he says . “ Too many of us are being lost here at home . ”
Researchers with the American College of Physicians estimate that 4 in 5 doctors never raise gun safety measures with patients at risk of suicide . Their reluctance stems from the country ’ s fraught debate on firearms and the political stalemate that has blocked almost all public funding for gun violence research since the mid-1990s .
The excess of rancor and lack of fresh data have sown uncertainty among doctors about how to identify and treat patients who present a threat to themselves . As Dr. Simonetti says , “ We learned a lot about diabetes prevention in medical school . We didn ’ t hear anything about gun violence prevention . ”
Between 1999 and 2017 , suicides by firearm rose 44 % nationwide , increasing from 16,599 to 23,854 . In the view of mental health clinicians , the VA ’ s advocacy for lethal means safety – an effort that extends to disposal of surplus and unneeded medication – could prove vital to reversing the trend .
Mr. Bryan suggests that the lofty perch veterans occupy in American culture , coupled with evidence-based studies showing a correlation between gun safety and lower suicide risk , creates an opportunity for a more enlightened , less combative national discussion about firearms and suicide prevention .
“ Military personnel and veterans are perceived to be especially knowledgeable about these issues , ” he says . An embrace of secure storage practices by more veterans “ could catalyze a much needed shift in our broader society that could save a lot of lives . ”
The example set by former service members could ease the trepidation of doctors who hesitate to ask patients in crisis about their access to guns at home . Dr. Christopher Barsotti has confronted that scenario as an emergency physician at hospitals in western Massachusetts and southern Vermont .
“ Veterans can bring credibility to the idea of being safe and responsible with guns , ” says Dr. Barsotti , co-founder of the American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine , or AFFIRM . The Massachusetts nonprofit is one of several research groups formed by physicians in recent years that approach gun violence as a public health crisis . “ That could open up the conversation around firearms and preventing suicide , ” he says .
The scourge of suicide almost claimed Brian Vargas . His combat tour in Iraq with the Marine Corps ended in 2007 when he suffered nearly fatal gunshot and shrapnel wounds during a firefight with insurgents . A desire to escape his enduring physical and mental trauma fueled persistent thoughts of taking his life .
The ordeal moved Mr. Vargas , who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area , to help launch a suicide prevention program called Warrior Box Project . The concept involves a veteran filling a small storage case with photos of loved ones , military medals , and other mementos that serve as reminders of life ’ s worth .
Mr. Vargas encourages veterans who own firearms to store another item in the box . A few years ago , in a suicidal spiral , he rummaged through his own box searching for the key to his gun lock .

His work to bring attention to veteran suicide has taught Mr. Vargas that he and others who wore the uniform can change civilian perceptions about gun safety . “ Everybody struggles – everybody , ” he says . “ So as veterans , because of how we ’ re seen by the country , we have a chance to make a difference .

us_military,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/26/trump-no-transgender-individuals-military/511858001/,Trump bans transgender people from serving in U.S. military 'in any capacity',2017-07-26,,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. military will not accept transgender troops into its ranks or allow them to serve in any capacity , reversing a policy that began under the Obama administration – and triggering intense criticism from lawmakers and civil libertarians .
In a series of morning tweets , Trump said that , after consulting `` with my generals and military experts , '' the U.S. government `` will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S . Military . ''
The U.S. military , he said , `` must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and can not be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail . ''
Trump 's decision was made Tuesday , and he informed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis later in the day , White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Wednesday . The policy allowing transgender troops to serve was `` expensive and disruptive '' and affected military readiness , she said .
Democrats disagreed . Rep. Adam Smith , D-Wash. , ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee , called Trump 's announcement `` an unwarranted and disgraceful attack on men and women who have been bravely serving their country . ''
Chelsea Manning , progressive and LGBTQ groups slam President Trump 's transgender ban
Accept transgender troops , allow them medical treatment , Adm. Mike Mullen tells Congress
It ’ s unclear how Trump 's tweets will affect the estimated 6,000 transgender troops who are already in the military . Under the policy announced in July 2016 , those troops were allowed to serve openly . Prior to that , the military discharged them for medical reasons .
It 's also uncertain whether a series of tweets constitute a presidential directive , and whether Trump must sign documents to make the new policy effective .
After the tweets , the Pentagon issued a statement saying only that it would work with the White House `` to address the new guidance '' provided by the president .
Brad Carson , the former chief of Pentagon personnel issues and an architect of the policy , said Trump 's sudden announcement appeared to catch the Pentagon `` flat-footed , '' and he predicted the renewed ban will be challenged in court .
`` This will be devastating to those service members , but it will also hurt national security , as we have transgender people in many mission-critical occupations , '' Carson told ███ .
Joshua Block , a lead attorney on the issue with the ACLU , said the group most certainly will mount a legal challenge .
But he noted that Pentagon regulations allowing transgender troops to serve openly remain in effect . `` Even the president ca n't eliminate regulations by tweet , '' Block said .
The method of Trump 's notice by Twitter also drew ire .
Noting that Trump 's statements are unclear , and that the Pentagon is already complying with parts of the Obama transgender policy , Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , said the sudden news `` is yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter . ''
McCain , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , also noted that many transgender troops are serving honorably and that anybody who meets medical and readiness standards should be allowed in the military .
Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , issued a brief , pointed statement criticizing Trump 's announcement , saying discrimination in any form is wrong and that he needs clarity from the military about what the tweeted policy means .
`` Transgender people are people , and deserve the best we can do for them , '' Hatch said .
Meanwhile , former Obama administration officials , prominent Democrats and civil rights advocates condemned Trump 's announcement .
Ashton Carter , who instituted the policy that would allow transgender troops to serve as President Obama 's defense secretary , said the only thing that matters in choosing service members is that they are qualified .
`` There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably , '' Carter said . `` This action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about military service . ''

WASHINGTON — President Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. military will not accept transgender troops into its ranks or allow them to serve in any capacity, reversing a policy that began under the Obama administration – and triggering intense criticism from lawmakers and civil libertarians.

In a series of morning tweets, Trump said that, after consulting ""with my generals and military experts,"" the U.S. government ""will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.""

The U.S. military, he said, ""must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.""

Trump's decision was made Tuesday, and he informed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis later in the day, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Wednesday. The policy allowing transgender troops to serve was ""expensive and disruptive"" and affected military readiness, she said.

Democrats disagreed. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, called Trump's announcement ""an unwarranted and disgraceful attack on men and women who have been bravely serving their country.""

Accept transgender troops, allow them medical treatment, Adm. Mike Mullen tells Congress

It’s unclear how Trump's tweets will affect the estimated 6,000 transgender troops who are already in the military. Under the policy announced in July 2016, those troops were allowed to serve openly. Prior to that, the military discharged them for medical reasons.

It's also uncertain whether a series of tweets constitute a presidential directive, and whether Trump must sign documents to make the new policy effective.

After the tweets, the Pentagon issued a statement saying only that it would work with the White House ""to address the new guidance"" provided by the president.

Brad Carson, the former chief of Pentagon personnel issues and an architect of the policy, said Trump's sudden announcement appeared to catch the Pentagon ""flat-footed,"" and he predicted the renewed ban will be challenged in court.

""This will be devastating to those service members, but it will also hurt national security, as we have transgender people in many mission-critical occupations,"" Carson told USA TODAY.

Joshua Block, a lead attorney on the issue with the ACLU, said the group most certainly will mount a legal challenge.

But he noted that Pentagon regulations allowing transgender troops to serve openly remain in effect. ""Even the president can't eliminate regulations by tweet,"" Block said.

The method of Trump's notice by Twitter also drew ire.

Noting that Trump's statements are unclear, and that the Pentagon is already complying with parts of the Obama transgender policy, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the sudden news ""is yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter.""

McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also noted that many transgender troops are serving honorably and that anybody who meets medical and readiness standards should be allowed in the military.

Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, issued a brief, pointed statement criticizing Trump's announcement, saying discrimination in any form is wrong and that he needs clarity from the military about what the tweeted policy means.

""Transgender people are people, and deserve the best we can do for them,"" Hatch said.

Meanwhile, former Obama administration officials, prominent Democrats and civil rights advocates condemned Trump's announcement.

Ashton Carter, who instituted the policy that would allow transgender troops to serve as President Obama's defense secretary, said the only thing that matters in choosing service members is that they are qualified.

""There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably,"" Carter said. ""This action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about military service.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted that ""every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop.""

In a tweet of her own, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told Trump that ""this fight is not over,"" and ""hatred will never defeat #pride.""

The advocacy organization GLAAD called it ""another example of the Trump administration attempting to make LGBTQ people invisible."" And some Democrats used the opportunity to slam Trump's own lack of military service. In its statement, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called the president a ""draft dodger.""

Some Republicans also criticized the policy reversal. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted that ""no American, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be prohibited from honor + privilege of serving our nation #LGBT.""

Many Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, had criticized the transgender policy, and applauded Trump's move.

Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., said on Twitter that she was pleased to see that Trump ""shares my readiness and cost concerns,"" and ""will be changing this costly and damaging policy."" The issue, she said, comes down to military readiness. She sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that was narrowly defeated on July 13 that would have prohibited funding medical treatment for transgender troops.

However, the Pentagon commissioned a report last year by the non-partisan RAND Corp. on transgender troops that found medical treatment would cost no more than $8 million per year and have a negligible impact on the military’s readiness to fight.

Under Trump and Mattis, the Pentagon delayed implementation of a key portion of the Obama administration's plan: requiring the services to begin accepting and recruiting new officers and enlisted troops. The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps requested more time to implement the policy, saying they needed time to study the effects of accepting transgender troops.

The Army has compulsory sensitivity training for soldiers and civilian employees.

Some members of Congress have also tried to limit spending on transgender troops in this year’s legislation authorizing military spending.

On Tuesday, in a statement to USA TODAY, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen urged the acceptance of transgender troops by the military, saying that previous policies that prevented gay and lesbian troops from serving damaged the military.

During his six months in office, Trump has reversed a number of Obama policies, from environmental regulations to U.S. membership in the Paris climate change agreement.

The transgender announcement is the latest example, and it's a decision that is likely to have political implications.

Trump sought the support of LGBT voters during last year's election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In tweet sent in June of 2016, he told the LGBT community that ""I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.""

Yet social conservatives applauded the decision. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said that, ""as our nation faces serious national security threats, our troops shouldn’t be forced to endure hours of transgender ‘sensitivity’ classes and politically-correct distractions like this one.""

With Trump struggling in public opinion polls, Mair said the decision ""won't improve his approval rating but might actually help stop some bleeding.""

Dakota Bordeaux had rarely traveled outside his home state of Oklahoma before he joined the Navy in February 2017 . He ’ d certainly never seen the ocean .
But only four months later , Bordeaux was standing at the helm of the USS John S. McCain , steering the 8,300-ton destroyer through the western Pacific . Part of the Navy ’ s famed 7th Fleet , the McCain was responsible for patrolling global hot spots , shadowing Chinese warships in the South China Sea and tracking North Korean missile launches .
“ Not many people of my age can say , ‘ Hey , I just drove a giant-ass battleship , ’ ” said Bordeaux , 23 .
To guide the McCain , Bordeaux relied upon a navigation system the Navy considered a triumph of technology and thrift . It featured slick black touch screens to operate the ship ’ s wheel and propellers . It knit together information from radars and digital maps . It would save money by requiring fewer sailors to safely steer the ship .
Bordeaux felt confident using the system to control the speed and heading of the ship . But there were many things he did not understand about the array of dials , arrows and data that filled the touch screen .
“ There was actually a lot of functions on there that I had no clue what on earth they did , ” Bordeaux said of the system .
███ reconstructed the McCain 's Ship Control Console based on the system ’ s technical manual , confidential Navy reports , a safety review by the National Transportation Safety Board and interviews with a former Navy technician who worked on the system . Screens reflect ship parameters just before time of crash from the NTSB and internal Navy report .

Bordeaux , one of the newest sailors on the ship , was joined in uncertainty by one of the most seasoned , Cmdr . Alfredo Sanchez , captain of the McCain .
A 19-year Navy veteran , Sanchez had watched as technicians replaced the ship ’ s traditional steering controls a year earlier with the new navigation system . Almost from the start , it caused him headaches . The system constantly indicated problems with steering . They were mostly false alarms , quickly fixed , but by March 2017 , Sanchez ’ s engineers were calling the system “ unstable , ” with “ multiple and cascading failures regularly . ”
Sanchez grew to distrust the navigation system , especially for use in delicate operations . He often ordered it to run in backup manual mode , which eliminated some of the automated functions but also created new risks .
In August 2017 , Sanchez and his crew steered the ship toward a naval base in Singapore , where technicians were waiting . The navigation system had indicated more than 60 “ major steering faults ” during the month .
“ We were going to have the programmers , ” Sanchez said , “ give the system a full , a full check , a full clean bill of health . ”

In the early hours of Aug. 21 , 2017 , the McCain was 20 miles from Singapore , navigating one of the world ’ s busiest shipping lanes . Sanchez was on the bridge to assist in the complex maneuvers ahead . He ordered Bordeaux to take over steering the warship while another sailor controlled its speed . The idea was to avoid distractions by having each man focus on a single task in the heavy maritime traffic .
To check that he had control , Bordeaux tugged the ship ’ s wheel slightly to the left . The McCain did not alter its course . Bordeaux rotated it slightly to starboard . Again , the McCain maintained its track . Bordeaux suddenly realized that the McCain was steaming uncontrolled toward the cargo ships sailing through the Singapore Strait .
The McCain began turning mysteriously to the left , slowly at first , and then faster . The ship drew closer and closer to the vessels plying the strait .
As Bordeaux remained glued to the screen before him , there was quiet in the dark of the bridge as sailors darted around , staring at gauges , flipping buttons , trying in one way or another to figure out what was happening . Sanchez ’ s eyes flew across the ship ’ s banks of screens in his own desperate attempt to avert disaster .
Three minutes and 19 seconds after Bordeaux ’ s cry , the McCain collided violently with a 30,000-ton Liberian-flagged oil tanker . Ten Navy sailors were killed and scores more were injured . It was the Navy ’ s worst accident at sea in 40 years .
Investigations by the Navy and the National Transportation Safety Board , or NTSB , concluded that the navigation system itself had not malfunctioned . The ship ’ s hard turn to the left and the inability to correct it was the result of a series of mistakes by Bordeaux and fellow sailors .
Immediate responsibility , the Navy ruled , rested with Sanchez , his officers and senior sailors . They had been lax , even complacent , in their training of the sailors steering the ship . Sanchez had made a critical error in not adding more sailors to stand watch as the McCain navigated the treacherous strait . Sanchez was charged with homicide . A chief petty officer , responsible for training the sailors to use the navigation system , was charged with dereliction of duty . The chief petty officer had himself received less than an hour of instruction .
But a ███ examination shows that the Navy pursued prosecutions of the two men even as its investigators and those with the NTSB were learning that the navigation system , if it hadn ’ t technically malfunctioned , had played a critical role in the deadly outcome in the Pacific .
Its very design , investigators determined , left sailors dangerously vulnerable to making the kinds of operational mistakes that doomed the McCain . The Integrated Bridge and Navigation System , or IBNS , as it was known , was no technical marvel . It was a welter of buttons , gauges and software that , poorly understood and not surprisingly misused , helped guide 10 sailors to their deaths .
Despite its issues , the IBNS operated for years without major incident . Navy sailors did what they have always done : They found ways to make do with an imperfect technology .
The NTSB put it plainly : “ The design of the John S McCain ’ s touch-screen steering and thrust control system , ” the board found , “ increased the likelihood of the operator errors that led to the collision . ”
The Navy investigators , for their part , determined that the system ’ s “ known vulnerabilities ” and risks had not been “ clearly communicated to the operators on ships with these systems . ”
The Navy , while publicly blaming the McCain ’ s crew , also took steps to make sure other sailors were better equipped to avoid similar disasters . Commanders issued new instructions to the Navy ’ s entire fleet of destroyers on how to properly use the navigation system to avoid the kinds of mistakes that could lead to “ inadvertent ” loss of control .

In the end , though , the Navy punished its own sailors for failing to master a flawed system that they had been inadequately trained on and that the Navy itself came to admit it did not fully understand .
Just before Sanchez ’ s trial , the Navy dropped a homicide charge and he pleaded guilty to dereliction of duty . The chief petty officer responsible for training also pleaded guilty and has since left the Navy .
In response to emailed questions , Navy officials said they had taken steps to fix the “ complex touch-screen controls ” of the navigation system . They said they had improved training on the system throughout the fleet .
Over the next seven years , the Navy will install physical throttles and simplified touch screens on newly built Navy destroyers and retrofit 32 existing destroyers with the improved design .
Cmdr . Clay Doss , a Navy spokesman , stood by the assertion that the navigation system did not play a major role in the accident . “ There was no single cause , ” he said in a written response to emailed questions . He cited human error compounded by “ complacency , indifference , non-compliance , overconfidence and disregard for watchstanding requirements . ”
“ The Navy found these issues , we are addressing them and we are confident in our sailors to sail our ships safely , ” he added .
Northrop Grumman , the Virginia-based defense contracting giant that developed the navigation system , defended it . The Navy has selected the company to carry out installation of the improved version across the destroyer fleet .
“ We continue to work closely with the Navy to provide our advanced navigation capabilities to our warfighters , ” said Tim Paynter , the company ’ s vice president for strategic communications .

In examining the Navy ’ s handling of the McCain crash , ███ interviewed current and former Navy officials and reviewed a confidential Navy report on the incident , court records , previously unreported transcripts and government reports . That examination shows that the Navy ’ s response to the loss of life on the McCain closely mirrored how it dealt with a deadly accident involving another 7th Fleet destroyer , the USS Fitzgerald . Two months before the McCain accident , the Fitzgerald collided with a cargo tanker off the coast of Japan , killing seven sailors .
The Fitzgerald did not have the new navigation system , but then , as with the McCain , the Navy laid blame on sailors and officers while downplaying the role of decisions made at the very highest levels of the service . The Navy disciplined several admirals in charge of the 7th Fleet , but it stopped short of senior leadership , including the former chief of naval operations , John Richardson , who allowed ships to sail without having enough time to conduct training or repairs . Now retired , Richardson told ███ this year that the two disasters were “ avoidable tragedies ” and that commanders “ own ” the outcome of their decisions .
The Navy has committed almost half a billion dollars to build the navigation system and install it on more than 60 destroyers by the end of the next decade — the entire fleet of the tough , stalwart warships that form the backbone of the modern Navy . Yet no one responsible for the development or deployment of the technology has faced any known consequences for the McCain disaster .
A number of current and former Navy officials remain convinced the navigation system should never have been put to use . And they worry about the Navy ’ s slow pace in installing a new , improved version .
“ The IBNS has no place on the bridge of a U.S. destroyer , ” said one former senior Navy officer with direct knowledge of the McCain accident . “ It ’ s not designed to have the control that you need to navigate a warship . ”
In the early 2000s , the Navy was seeking to modernize its aging destroyers and trim the number of sailors needed to man its fleet of ships .
One of the more modest efforts , almost unremarked upon at the time , was the IBNS . Up to a dozen or more sailors could crowd a bridge , issuing orders , steering , keeping lookout and even training there . The IBNS would allow as few as three sailors standing watch on the bridge to navigate a destroyer .
“ The key benefit is the ability for operating with fewer watchstanders , reduced watch standard workloads and improved safety of navigation , ” the Navy told Congress .
In July 2008 , the Navy announced its first contract with Northrop Grumman for an initial payment of just under $ 7 million . Three years later , the USS John Paul Jones was the first Navy destroyer to sail out of harbor with the new system in place .
“ The way of the future , ” declared a young sailor in a Navy press release .
It did not take long for troubles to develop . Each retrofit took months . Contractors had to string more than three miles of cables and fiber optics throughout each ship . The Navy could only modernize three or four ships a year , as they rotated through previously planned long-term maintenance periods .
As the years passed , Northrop Grumman continued to make improvements to the system . That meant that controls on one ship might not look exactly like controls on another . It was like hopping from the driver ’ s seat of a Ford truck into a Mercedes-Benz roadster . Sailors could adjust . But it took a while to get a feel for the different controls — and on a fully armed warship , no less .
The IBNS was so complex that it overwhelmed the junior sailors who used it . Navy technicians would even disable the touch screen to avoid rudder changes caused by accidental taps , forcing sailors to use the manual wheel instead , according to a former Navy technician who worked on the system .

In 2014 , Navy officials discovered a flaw in the IBNS . One component could not keep track of more than 150 ships at a time without malfunctioning , according to Navy investigators . The Navy ’ s solution ? Sailors were told to delete tracked ships before the total hit the magic number .
The navigation system could also become overloaded if too much information streamed in from a ship tracking database used worldwide to prevent maritime collisions . The Navy ’ s second solution was similar to the first : Drop the feed when it became too much .
They were patches on top of patches that left the Navy ’ s destroyers without a full picture of the seas around them . But none of the problems was serious enough to attract high-level attention . A Navy system designed to track problems in major ship systems did not contain any reports that mentioned the IBNS until last year , according to a Navy official .
In 2016 , the McCain became the first ship in the 7th Fleet to receive the new system . Based in Japan , the 7th Fleet was a strange choice to test out the newest version . Unlike U.S.-based ships , 7th Fleet ships — the largest armada in the world — were constantly responding to real-world crises .
It didn ’ t take long for the McCain to experience problems with the new system . The IBNS had started to crash when it tried to integrate images from the radars and the ship ’ s navigation computer . Navy technicians who boarded the McCain in January 2017 could not reproduce the error .
But they told Sanchez that the “ potential for these types of failures is inherent . ”
By March , senior officers aboard the McCain had designated the IBNS as a major problem . In August alone , the navigation system issued alerts on 63 different occasions — most of them related to the steering system , and most of them quickly fixed .
The McCain ’ s crew could do little to find a permanent solution to the constant alarms , however . Because of staffing shortfalls , higher-ups had waived a requirement to have a technician on board with specialized training to maintain the IBNS .
Instead , the McCain relied on a workaround familiar to anybody who has ever called a help desk for problems with their computer . The McCain ’ s second in command , Cmdr . Jesse Sanchez , told investigators that few of the technicians on the McCain understood the “ complex ” system .
“ Usually when we have a fault with that system , ” Sanchez said , “ their resolution is to reboot the system . ”
Alfredo Sanchez , the McCain ’ s captain and no relation to Jesse , knew that the trip to Singapore to get the navigation system examined in August 2017 would be difficult , passing near Singapore Strait and the Straits of Malacca .
“ The Straits of Malacca , that ’ s the place where you ’ re gon na see the supertanker , the fishing vessel and a guy in a canoe , ” Sanchez had told his crew . “ Everybody and their mother is going to be on the Straits of Malacca . ”
Despite the peril , Sanchez ignored the advice of his navigator and his second in command to add extra crew for the approach . The Fitzgerald was on his mind . Word had spread that some of its sailors had been working 100-hour weeks before the collision . Sanchez wanted his men to get an extra hour of rest before awakening to pilot through the strait itself .
Sanchez got up a little after midnight to make sure he was on the bridge in case anyone needed help . In those early dark morning hours , he made two decisions about the IBNS that had fateful consequences .
At around 4:35 a.m. , with the lights of the Malaysian coast in view , the navigation system suffered a problem . It was yet another false alarm . But after months of such hiccups , Sanchez had lost faith in the technology .
Sanchez had discussed the IBNS with two other captains in Japan , he told investigators . All three agreed that the system ’ s automated functions were too complex to use when navigating crowded waters .
In the next minute , Sanchez ordered the helmsman to place the IBNS into backup mode . In that configuration , Sanchez had more direct control over navigation .
“ I ’ m a dinosaur , maybe , but that ’ s why I do it , ” Sanchez told investigators . “ When the system got installed and we went out for sea trial , we were comfortable in that configuration . ”
But placing the system in backup mode also put the steering system into an emergency setting that removed some of the system ’ s built-in safeguards .
That danger , though , was not clear to Sanchez , or even the Navy . The Navy ’ s instruction manual did not contain details on how to implement some navigation maneuvers with the IBNS . And the manual on board the McCain was three years out of date .
About 45 minutes later , Sanchez made another fateful decision . Bordeaux was on the bridge acting as a lookout . But when the acting helmsman wanted to grab a meal , Bordeaux volunteered to take over for a few minutes . He had only steered the ship by himself six times previously .
Sanchez quickly noticed that his new helmsman seemed flustered by the difficulty of having to control the ship ’ s steering and speed at the same time . He decided to split the helm , giving Bordeaux control over the ship ’ s wheel . While Bordeaux remained at his station , Dontrius Mitchell , a second sailor on the bridge , was assigned to take control of the speed of the McCain at a neighboring station known as the lee helm .
Sanchez ’ s order was unexpected — he had not discussed the possibility in meetings with the crew before entering the straits . Nor had the crew practiced the maneuver much . Bordeaux could only remember doing it once or twice before .
“ They were kind of rusty trying to follow those procedures , ” said Jesse Sanchez , the executive officer .
When Bordeaux went to transfer the thrust to Mitchell , something went wrong . It was the night ’ s first mistake : Mitchell wound up with control of steering instead of Bordeaux .
Despite three separate reports examining the collisions , the Navy has never determined what , exactly , caused this .
In separate interviews weeks after the collision , Bordeaux , Mitchell and a third sailor present all denied touching any controls that could have transferred steering .
But two reports , one by the Navy and one by the NTSB , both ruled out a malfunction of the IBNS as a cause of the steering transfer mistake . They based their conclusion on digital logs kept by the navigation system that did not indicate any such error .
“ Although the helmsman perceived a loss of steering , there was no malfunction of the John S McCain steering system , ” NTSB investigators ruled .
The confidential Navy report concludes simply that a “ watchstander had to have performed this action ” — in other words , somebody pushed the wrong button .
The IBNS , however , indisputably played a role in the confusion that unfolded from the initial mistake .
In its normal , computer-assisted mode , the navigation system requires that both sailors press buttons to acknowledge a switch in steering before it happens .
The top-left corner of both screens shows current steering location at all times . The top-left corner of both screens shows current steering location at all times . Normally the rudder moves with the wheel . This station : HELM Normally the rudder moves with the wheel . This station : HELM LONG HU SAN USS MCCAIN GUANG ZHOU WAN Team Oslo HYNDAI GLOBAL ALNIC MC But in the backup mode preferred by Sanchez , no such protection existed . Instead , the IBNS software makes “ automatic offers ” to other steering stations on the ship allowing them to take unilateral control . The reason ? In cases of emergency , such as if the bridge is destroyed during an attack , sailors from other parts of the ship need to be able to take control without waiting for additional approval . Whatever the exact cause , neither Bordeaux nor Mitchell realized during the emergency that Mitchell had control of steering . Each man had an indicator on screen displaying the name of the station with control . But it wasn ’ t prominent — just a small box with green text a little larger than the 12-point font typically used in word processor programs . When Bordeaux tried to turn the ship , he thought the McCain ’ s steering had malfunctioned . As trained , he called out loss of steering . It was 5:20:39 a.m .
A second mistake , made at almost exactly the same instant , actually drove the McCain into the path of the oil tanker , the Alnic MC .
For propulsion , the McCain has two main shafts connected to propellers . The two shafts can operate independently , moving at different speeds if needed for sailing or maneuvering .
A third , more experienced sailor was standing near Bordeaux and Mitchell . Anthony Gillilan , the boatswain ’ s mate of the watch , was in charge of both sailors .
Gillilan and Mitchell had begun the year as sailors on the USS Antietam , but the ship ran aground in an embarrassing incident as it departed Yokosuka Harbor in Japan . The Antietam returned to the yards for repairs . Gillilan and Mitchell were sent to the McCain to fill manpower shortages . Neither Gillilan nor Mitchell returned requests for comment .
The Antietam , a cruiser , did not have an IBNS . Gillilan , a helmsman on the Antietam , received no formal training when he joined the McCain . Fellow chief petty officers “ just kind of went through it a little bit ” with him , he told investigators .
When Sanchez ordered the split helm , Gillilan leaned over the console to transfer control of the McCain ’ s speed to the lee helm . It was a two-step process that required Gillilan to transfer control of each of the McCain ’ s two main shafts .
First , Gillilan used a drop-down menu on Bordeaux ’ s screen to transfer control of the ship ’ s port thrust to Mitchell .
But before he could do the same with the starboard shaft , Bordeaux called out loss of steering . Ordered to broadcast the emergency over the ship intercom , Gillilan was distracted and did not complete the transfer .

He leaned over to Bordeaux ’ s computer screen and completed the transfer himself . ( Bordeaux ’ s memory is different : He said he completed the transfer with Gillilan advising him on how to do it . ) “ I hurried up and did it real quick , ” he told investigators . The transfer resulted in the third , and most serious , error . When Bordeaux had control of the speed , the McCain ’ s two propeller shafts were working together . If you slid the touch screen ’ s buttons to speed up one shaft , the other shaft automatically sped up as well . But during the transfer , control over the two shafts separated . Each began to operate independently . Mitchell told investigators that he remembered checking a small box marked to join the shafts together again — a process known as ganging . But the Navy and the NTSB analysis found that they continued to act separately . As the McCain drew closer to the Alnic , a ship officer ordered a decrease in speed to 10 knots . Mitchell adjusted the touch-screen controls to lower the speed of the propellers . He did not notice , but since the propellers were no longer operating together , only the port side shaft began to slow . The starboard propellers continued to churn , moving at around 20 knots , the Navy ’ s logs showed . Like a rowboat being pulled harder on one side than the other , the McCain began to veer sharply to the left — changing its course by more than 45 degrees over the next minute and 19 seconds .
To the officers trying to figure out what was going on , nothing made sense . The captain , Alfredo Sanchez , would later tell investigators that he recalled staring at an instrument panel in confusion . An indicator told him that the McCain ’ s rudders were set to 0 degrees — moving neither right nor left . But his warship was careening to the left .
“ Why are we turning ? Why are we turning ? ” his No . 2 , Jesse Sanchez , remembered wondering .
Both men focused on the steering controls . They had failed so often before . They decided to try a last-ditch emergency procedure to regain steering .
Once again , the IBNS was at the center of the confusion that followed .
The McCain can be controlled from the IBNS stations on the bridge and from a backup station in the rear of the ship .
The helm and aft stations featured a fail-safe device known as the big red button . Once pressed , the big red button overrides all other stations and returns control to its own location .
But numerous sailors on the McCain believed that the function of the big red button was to send steering control to the rear of the ship . It is unclear how this misunderstanding developed , or why it was so widespread among the crew . Mitchell told investigators that the instruction booklet on the bridge had not been updated to match the most current version of the IBNS .
Bridge Aft station has steering Bridge has steering Aft station The confusion over the big red button was the center of the fourth , and final , mistake of the night . With the steering seeming to malfunction , a ship ’ s officer ordered the sailors in the aft station to take control . At 5:23:01 a.m. , a sailor pressed the big red button at the aft steering station . For the first time in more than two minutes , someone had control of the McCain ’ s steering . It did not last long . Up on the bridge , another sailor responded to the officer ’ s order by hitting the big red button there in the mistaken belief that it sent control to the aft station . Just seconds after sailors in the rear of the ship seized control , it returned to Bordeaux ’ s station on the bridge . After a few seconds of hurried conversation , the aft station finally regained control of the ship at 5:23:27 a.m. All told , steering of the McCain changed hands three times in 16 seconds . During one of the transfers , the ship ’ s rudders mysteriously turned the McCain briefly and sharply left , hastening the turn toward the shipping lanes . The aft watchstanders made one last effort to steer the McCain to the right and away from the collision . It was too late . At 5:23:58 a.m. , the Alnic drove its bow into the port side of the McCain .
Sailors remember a sharp , powerful blow that knocked them off their feet . The force of the collision locked the two ships together so that they lurched ahead , stuck to each other , for almost 10 minutes , before slowly separating .
The Alnic ’ s prow gouged a 28-foot-wide hole into two sleeping quarters , known as Berthing 3 and Berthing 5 . Berthing 5 , which sat below the waterline , flooded in under a minute . There were 12 sailors there . Just two escaped .
In Berthing 3 , which held 71 men , sailors woke to find water filling the spaces around them . Two were trapped in the twisted metal of their bunks , unable to flee .
Bordeaux joined the crew that went to rescue them . Sailors hacked at debris with an ax , crowbars and a pulley to free the two men . In total , 48 sailors were injured in the crash .
Over the next nine hours , the sailors of the McCain fought back flooding throughout the ship , filling holes and using pumps to clear water . Rescue ships from Singapore and Malaysia , as well as the USS America , an amphibious assault ship , helped get the vessel to port . Fifty sailors were recognized for their bravery during the incident .
Bordeaux mourned the dead . But he and the other sailors took pride in saving most of their shipmates and the ship itself . They had stood in water filled with diesel fuel and chemicals and human waste , pumping it into the ocean .
The McCain sustained hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and was in such bad shape that it took two months to tow the warship back to Yokosuka . It would take another two years before it was fixed .
On May 24 , 2018 , in a courtroom perched above a food court in the historic Washington Naval Yard , Chief Petty Officer Jeffery D. Butler sat alone at a desk before a judge .
Butler was the only enlisted man to face a formal court-martial in connection with the McCain disaster . He was charged with dereliction of duty — partly because he had failed to “ gain a proper understanding ” of the navigation system in order to train his sailors .
Butler was a fireplug of man , with glasses and a thick neck , wearing a sharply creased dress white uniform that seemed to almost gleam under the courtroom ’ s fluorescent lights . He had been a standout among petty officers , the sailors who form the core of the Navy ’ s enlisted leadership . He was selected as sailor of the year on a previous ship .
As a senior enlisted officer , it had been his job to train Bordeaux and other young sailors on the McCain in the use of the IBNS . Some of the crew had joined the McCain from the USS Antietam and needed to be schooled in how their new ship functioned .
Butler told the judge that he himself had only received about 30 minutes to an hour of training on the system . And he had cleared the Antietam sailors without putting them through proper training . Given the sailors ’ previous qualifications , and the McCain ’ s heavy workload , it was his attempt to put them to work as soon as possible .
“ I should have paid more attention to the training , ” Butler told Judge William Weiland , a Navy commander . “ I could have told my junior sailors how to better operate their systems . ”

Still , the evidence suggests that the Navy prosecuted Butler for failing to understand the operation of the IBNS even as it grew clear that the Navy itself did not understand it .
In October and November , the Navy sanctioned Butler and other crew members in a first round of discipline known as an admiral ’ s mast . Butler had to forfeit pay and received a letter of reprimand that all but guaranteed a halt to further career advancement . Alfredo Sanchez , the captain , and Jesse Sanchez , the executive officer , were both fired from their commands . Bordeaux was docked pay , demoted and put on probation .
A few weeks later , the Navy released its comprehensive review of the collisions in the 7th Fleet . Mentions of the IBNS were scattered throughout the document . Pieced together , with acronyms untangled , they offer a damning portrait of the system .
The review found that the “ designed responses of the IBNS ” featured “ known vulnerabilities ” in shifting steering and thrust .
The Navy ’ s training schools do “ not address the depth of knowledge and skills needed to properly maintain complex electronic navigation systems on ships , specifically the Integrated Bridge Navigation System . ”
The review offered a critique of the Navy ’ s drive to save money by installing new technology rather than investing in training for its sailors .
“ There is a tendency of designers to add automation based on economic benefits ( e.g. , reducing manning , consolidating discrete controls , using networked systems to manage obsolescence ) , ” the report said , “ without considering the effect to operators who are trained and proficient in operating legacy equipment . ”
Adm. Phil Davidson , then the head of training and manpower for the Navy , led the review . The Navy fired or forced out five senior commanding officers above Sanchez , the McCain ’ s captain , including four admirals . Davidson was promoted to his current position , the head of Indo-Pacific Command , one of the most powerful posts in the military .
Later that fall , the Navy appointed four-star Adm. Frank Caldwell , who reported directly to the chief of the Navy , Adm. John Richardson , to investigate whether the McCain sailors deserved additional punishment .
As Caldwell launched his investigation of the McCain crew , the Navy ’ s engineering division conducted its own investigation of how best to operate the IBNS .
The inquiry resulted in a set of instructions issued to every destroyer in the Navy . The Navy decided not to abandon the system , so the instructions were an effort to better educate sailors about its flaws and known vulnerabilities , a choice that remains in effect today .
Called class advisories , the Navy instructions noted that the IBNS allowed control of the ship from four different locations on the bridge : “ This flexibility in control provides the potential for inadvertent transfer of control or loss of awareness of control location . ”
The new guidelines warned that IBNS instructions available on the bridge of the McCain and dozens of other destroyers did not include clear procedures for transferring steering and thrust .
And they required every destroyer captain to do exactly what Sanchez had done : Split the helm whenever using the IBNS , directing one sailor to steer and a second to control speed , in order to “ maximize confidence ” in the modernized system .
( Nearly a year later , in fall 2018 , the Navy issued a second set of instructions . Now , ship captains have to certify that their crews know how to transfer IBNS controls to different stations . )
Despite these new instructions , Caldwell announced in January 2018 that he was recommending Butler and Sanchez for court-martial .
To the consternation of many of his fellow officers , Sanchez was charged with homicide . He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of dereliction of duty . He received a letter of reprimand and had to forfeit $ 6,000 in pay .
Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment on the navigation system , the Navy ’ s findings on the accident involving the McCain or his punishment .
Butler , like Sanchez , decided against risking trial . The Navy wanted personal accountability . Butler would give it to them .
At the May 2018 hearing , Weiland glanced down at the sheaves of exhibits before him . He seemed sympathetic to the idea that the steering console had problems .
“ It can be , Your Honor , ” Butler responded in a low voice .
Still , he told the judge he was guilty as charged .
Before Weiland pronounced sentence , Butler turned to face rows of people filled with grief . Wives in black , young boys in suits and teenage girls in dark dresses had all come to the courtroom to give testimony about their loved ones .
Butler wept and his voice broke as he apologized : “ I am truly sorry for your loss . They were more than just my shipmates . They were family . ”
Butler asked Weiland for one small mercy . The prosecution wanted to knock him down a rank . Butler pleaded to keep his position , which meant an additional $ 200,000 in retirement pay . It was money , he said , that he hoped to use for his daughters ’ college educations .
“ I may not have been a perfect chief , but I have put my heart and soul into that title , ” he told Weiland .

When Dakota Bordeaux entered bootcamp on Valentine ’ s Day 2017 , it was the fulfillment of a promise . His grandfather had served as a sailor during the Vietnam War . He ’ d helped Bordeaux through a childhood pocked by many moves and school fights . Bordeaux enlisted in the Navy as soon as he could after graduating high school , and he had , he said , planned to spend his life in the service — “ until I ’ m too old and they tell me and they kick me out because of my age . ”
Today , Bordeaux is back home in Oklahoma , out of the Navy after a year and a half . After the accident , he had been taken with the rest of the McCain ’ s sailors back to Japan . There , he stayed in an old supply ship that had been converted into a sleeping quarters .
Bordeaux had trouble falling asleep in the bunks , which were similar to the ones on the McCain . And when he did , he had nightmares .
“ I ’ m walking through everything that happened that night . I could hear the screams from the sailors who died during the collision , ” he said .
Bordeaux believed that he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress , a mental disorder marked by nightmares , anxiety , flashbacks and startled reactions to loud noises .
A doctor he saw in Japan , however , diagnosed him with insomnia , he said . She gave him a book with tips to help him sleep , he said . It didn ’ t help much . Bordeaux began to drink heavily , going through as much as $ 500 of alcohol in a week .
As the months passed , Bordeaux noticed that he was having difficulty bringing enthusiasm to the job he had once loved . And he was confronted by a series of personal losses .

One day , after a sleepless night , Bordeaux fell asleep at his post — a serious offense . The Navy busted him down to its lowest rank and dismissed him from service , he said .
Asked about his brief stint as a helmsman on a Navy warship , Bordeaux still feels both the excitement and the bewilderment .

Dakota Bordeaux had rarely traveled outside his home state of Oklahoma before he joined the Navy in February 2017. He’d certainly never seen the ocean.

But only four months later, Bordeaux was standing at the helm of the USS John S. McCain, steering the 8,300-ton destroyer through the western Pacific. Part of the Navy’s famed 7th Fleet, the McCain was responsible for patrolling global hot spots, shadowing Chinese warships in the South China Sea and tracking North Korean missile launches.

It filled the high school graduate with pride.

“Not many people of my age can say, ‘Hey, I just drove a giant-ass battleship,’” said Bordeaux, 23.

To guide the McCain, Bordeaux relied upon a navigation system the Navy considered a triumph of technology and thrift. It featured slick black touch screens to operate the ship’s wheel and propellers. It knit together information from radars and digital maps. It would save money by requiring fewer sailors to safely steer the ship.

Bordeaux felt confident using the system to control the speed and heading of the ship. But there were many things he did not understand about the array of dials, arrows and data that filled the touch screen.

“There was actually a lot of functions on there that I had no clue what on earth they did,” Bordeaux said of the system.

ProPublica reconstructed the McCain's Ship Control Console based on the system’s technical manual, confidential Navy reports, a safety review by the National Transportation Safety Board and interviews with a former Navy technician who worked on the system. Screens reflect ship parameters just before time of crash from the NTSB and internal Navy report.

Bordeaux, one of the newest sailors on the ship, was joined in uncertainty by one of the most seasoned, Cmdr. Alfredo Sanchez, captain of the McCain.

A 19-year Navy veteran, Sanchez had watched as technicians replaced the ship’s traditional steering controls a year earlier with the new navigation system. Almost from the start, it caused him headaches. The system constantly indicated problems with steering. They were mostly false alarms, quickly fixed, but by March 2017, Sanchez’s engineers were calling the system “unstable,” with “multiple and cascading failures regularly.”

Sanchez grew to distrust the navigation system, especially for use in delicate operations. He often ordered it to run in backup manual mode, which eliminated some of the automated functions but also created new risks.

In August 2017, Sanchez and his crew steered the ship toward a naval base in Singapore, where technicians were waiting. The navigation system had indicated more than 60 “major steering faults” during the month.

“We were going to have the programmers,” Sanchez said, “give the system a full, a full check, a full clean bill of health.”

The McCain never reached its destination.

In the early hours of Aug. 21, 2017, the McCain was 20 miles from Singapore, navigating one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. Sanchez was on the bridge to assist in the complex maneuvers ahead. He ordered Bordeaux to take over steering the warship while another sailor controlled its speed. The idea was to avoid distractions by having each man focus on a single task in the heavy maritime traffic.

To check that he had control, Bordeaux tugged the ship’s wheel slightly to the left. The McCain did not alter its course. Bordeaux rotated it slightly to starboard. Again, the McCain maintained its track. Bordeaux suddenly realized that the McCain was steaming uncontrolled toward the cargo ships sailing through the Singapore Strait.

“Loss of steering,” he called out.

The McCain began turning mysteriously to the left, slowly at first, and then faster. The ship drew closer and closer to the vessels plying the strait.

As Bordeaux remained glued to the screen before him, there was quiet in the dark of the bridge as sailors darted around, staring at gauges, flipping buttons, trying in one way or another to figure out what was happening. Sanchez’s eyes flew across the ship’s banks of screens in his own desperate attempt to avert disaster.

Three minutes and 19 seconds after Bordeaux’s cry, the McCain collided violently with a 30,000-ton Liberian-flagged oil tanker. Ten Navy sailors were killed and scores more were injured. It was the Navy’s worst accident at sea in 40 years.

Investigations by the Navy and the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, concluded that the navigation system itself had not malfunctioned. The ship’s hard turn to the left and the inability to correct it was the result of a series of mistakes by Bordeaux and fellow sailors.

Immediate responsibility, the Navy ruled, rested with Sanchez, his officers and senior sailors. They had been lax, even complacent, in their training of the sailors steering the ship. Sanchez had made a critical error in not adding more sailors to stand watch as the McCain navigated the treacherous strait. Sanchez was charged with homicide. A chief petty officer, responsible for training the sailors to use the navigation system, was charged with dereliction of duty. The chief petty officer had himself received less than an hour of instruction.

But a ProPublica examination shows that the Navy pursued prosecutions of the two men even as its investigators and those with the NTSB were learning that the navigation system, if it hadn’t technically malfunctioned, had played a critical role in the deadly outcome in the Pacific.

Its very design, investigators determined, left sailors dangerously vulnerable to making the kinds of operational mistakes that doomed the McCain. The Integrated Bridge and Navigation System, or IBNS, as it was known, was no technical marvel. It was a welter of buttons, gauges and software that, poorly understood and not surprisingly misused, helped guide 10 sailors to their deaths.

Despite its issues, the IBNS operated for years without major incident. Navy sailors did what they have always done: They found ways to make do with an imperfect technology.

The NTSB put it plainly: “The design of the John S McCain’s touch-screen steering and thrust control system,” the board found, “increased the likelihood of the operator errors that led to the collision.”

The Navy investigators, for their part, determined that the system’s “known vulnerabilities” and risks had not been “clearly communicated to the operators on ships with these systems.”

The Navy, while publicly blaming the McCain’s crew, also took steps to make sure other sailors were better equipped to avoid similar disasters. Commanders issued new instructions to the Navy’s entire fleet of destroyers on how to properly use the navigation system to avoid the kinds of mistakes that could lead to “inadvertent” loss of control.

In the end, though, the Navy punished its own sailors for failing to master a flawed system that they had been inadequately trained on and that the Navy itself came to admit it did not fully understand.

Just before Sanchez’s trial, the Navy dropped a homicide charge and he pleaded guilty to dereliction of duty. The chief petty officer responsible for training also pleaded guilty and has since left the Navy.

In response to emailed questions, Navy officials said they had taken steps to fix the “complex touch-screen controls” of the navigation system. They said they had improved training on the system throughout the fleet.

Over the next seven years, the Navy will install physical throttles and simplified touch screens on newly built Navy destroyers and retrofit 32 existing destroyers with the improved design.

Cmdr. Clay Doss, a Navy spokesman, stood by the assertion that the navigation system did not play a major role in the accident. “There was no single cause,” he said in a written response to emailed questions. He cited human error compounded by “complacency, indifference, non-compliance, overconfidence and disregard for watchstanding requirements.”

“The Navy found these issues, we are addressing them and we are confident in our sailors to sail our ships safely,” he added.

Northrop Grumman, the Virginia-based defense contracting giant that developed the navigation system, defended it. The Navy has selected the company to carry out installation of the improved version across the destroyer fleet.

“We continue to work closely with the Navy to provide our advanced navigation capabilities to our warfighters,” said Tim Paynter, the company’s vice president for strategic communications.

In examining the Navy’s handling of the McCain crash, ProPublica interviewed current and former Navy officials and reviewed a confidential Navy report on the incident, court records, previously unreported transcripts and government reports. That examination shows that the Navy’s response to the loss of life on the McCain closely mirrored how it dealt with a deadly accident involving another 7th Fleet destroyer, the USS Fitzgerald. Two months before the McCain accident, the Fitzgerald collided with a cargo tanker off the coast of Japan, killing seven sailors.

The Fitzgerald did not have the new navigation system, but then, as with the McCain, the Navy laid blame on sailors and officers while downplaying the role of decisions made at the very highest levels of the service. The Navy disciplined several admirals in charge of the 7th Fleet, but it stopped short of senior leadership, including the former chief of naval operations, John Richardson, who allowed ships to sail without having enough time to conduct training or repairs. Now retired, Richardson told ProPublica this year that the two disasters were “avoidable tragedies” and that commanders “own” the outcome of their decisions.

The Navy has committed almost half a billion dollars to build the navigation system and install it on more than 60 destroyers by the end of the next decade — the entire fleet of the tough, stalwart warships that form the backbone of the modern Navy. Yet no one responsible for the development or deployment of the technology has faced any known consequences for the McCain disaster.

A number of current and former Navy officials remain convinced the navigation system should never have been put to use. And they worry about the Navy’s slow pace in installing a new, improved version.

“The IBNS has no place on the bridge of a U.S. destroyer,” said one former senior Navy officer with direct knowledge of the McCain accident. “It’s not designed to have the control that you need to navigate a warship.”

Chapter 1

“The Way of the Future”

In the early 2000s, the Navy was seeking to modernize its aging destroyers and trim the number of sailors needed to man its fleet of ships.

One of the more modest efforts, almost unremarked upon at the time, was the IBNS. Up to a dozen or more sailors could crowd a bridge, issuing orders, steering, keeping lookout and even training there. The IBNS would allow as few as three sailors standing watch on the bridge to navigate a destroyer.

“The key benefit is the ability for operating with fewer watchstanders, reduced watch standard workloads and improved safety of navigation,” the Navy told Congress.

In July 2008, the Navy announced its first contract with Northrop Grumman for an initial payment of just under $7 million. Three years later, the USS John Paul Jones was the first Navy destroyer to sail out of harbor with the new system in place.

“The way of the future,” declared a young sailor in a Navy press release.

It did not take long for troubles to develop. Each retrofit took months. Contractors had to string more than three miles of cables and fiber optics throughout each ship. The Navy could only modernize three or four ships a year, as they rotated through previously planned long-term maintenance periods.

As the years passed, Northrop Grumman continued to make improvements to the system. That meant that controls on one ship might not look exactly like controls on another. It was like hopping from the driver’s seat of a Ford truck into a Mercedes-Benz roadster. Sailors could adjust. But it took a while to get a feel for the different controls — and on a fully armed warship, no less.

The IBNS was so complex that it overwhelmed the junior sailors who used it. Navy technicians would even disable the touch screen to avoid rudder changes caused by accidental taps, forcing sailors to use the manual wheel instead, according to a former Navy technician who worked on the system.

Heading Steering Rudder Thrust System Functions Status and Notifications The control screen was supposed to make it easier to navigate a ship. But many sailors found the system’s arrows and buttons confusing. The large section labels above were added by ProPublica (Source: IBNS Tech Manual)

In 2014, Navy officials discovered a flaw in the IBNS. One component could not keep track of more than 150 ships at a time without malfunctioning, according to Navy investigators. The Navy’s solution? Sailors were told to delete tracked ships before the total hit the magic number.

The navigation system could also become overloaded if too much information streamed in from a ship tracking database used worldwide to prevent maritime collisions. The Navy’s second solution was similar to the first: Drop the feed when it became too much.

They were patches on top of patches that left the Navy’s destroyers without a full picture of the seas around them. But none of the problems was serious enough to attract high-level attention. A Navy system designed to track problems in major ship systems did not contain any reports that mentioned the IBNS until last year, according to a Navy official.

In 2016, the McCain became the first ship in the 7th Fleet to receive the new system. Based in Japan, the 7th Fleet was a strange choice to test out the newest version. Unlike U.S.-based ships, 7th Fleet ships — the largest armada in the world — were constantly responding to real-world crises.

It didn’t take long for the McCain to experience problems with the new system. The IBNS had started to crash when it tried to integrate images from the radars and the ship’s navigation computer. Navy technicians who boarded the McCain in January 2017 could not reproduce the error.

But they told Sanchez that the “potential for these types of failures is inherent.”

By March, senior officers aboard the McCain had designated the IBNS as a major problem. In August alone, the navigation system issued alerts on 63 different occasions — most of them related to the steering system, and most of them quickly fixed.

The McCain’s crew could do little to find a permanent solution to the constant alarms, however. Because of staffing shortfalls, higher-ups had waived a requirement to have a technician on board with specialized training to maintain the IBNS.

Instead, the McCain relied on a workaround familiar to anybody who has ever called a help desk for problems with their computer. The McCain’s second in command, Cmdr. Jesse Sanchez, told investigators that few of the technicians on the McCain understood the “complex” system.

“Usually when we have a fault with that system,” Sanchez said, “their resolution is to reboot the system.”

Chapter 2

“I’m a Dinosaur, Maybe”

Alfredo Sanchez, the McCain’s captain and no relation to Jesse, knew that the trip to Singapore to get the navigation system examined in August 2017 would be difficult, passing near Singapore Strait and the Straits of Malacca.

“The Straits of Malacca, that’s the place where you’re gonna see the supertanker, the fishing vessel and a guy in a canoe,” Sanchez had told his crew. “Everybody and their mother is going to be on the Straits of Malacca.”

Despite the peril, Sanchez ignored the advice of his navigator and his second in command to add extra crew for the approach. The Fitzgerald was on his mind. Word had spread that some of its sailors had been working 100-hour weeks before the collision. Sanchez wanted his men to get an extra hour of rest before awakening to pilot through the strait itself.

Sanchez got up a little after midnight to make sure he was on the bridge in case anyone needed help. In those early dark morning hours, he made two decisions about the IBNS that had fateful consequences.

At around 4:35 a.m., with the lights of the Malaysian coast in view, the navigation system suffered a problem. It was yet another false alarm. But after months of such hiccups, Sanchez had lost faith in the technology.

Sanchez had discussed the IBNS with two other captains in Japan, he told investigators. All three agreed that the system’s automated functions were too complex to use when navigating crowded waters.

In the next minute, Sanchez ordered the helmsman to place the IBNS into backup mode. In that configuration, Sanchez had more direct control over navigation.

“I’m a dinosaur, maybe, but that’s why I do it,” Sanchez told investigators. “When the system got installed and we went out for sea trial, we were comfortable in that configuration.”

But placing the system in backup mode also put the steering system into an emergency setting that removed some of the system’s built-in safeguards.

That danger, though, was not clear to Sanchez, or even the Navy. The Navy’s instruction manual did not contain details on how to implement some navigation maneuvers with the IBNS. And the manual on board the McCain was three years out of date.

About 45 minutes later, Sanchez made another fateful decision. Bordeaux was on the bridge acting as a lookout. But when the acting helmsman wanted to grab a meal, Bordeaux volunteered to take over for a few minutes. He had only steered the ship by himself six times previously.

Sanchez quickly noticed that his new helmsman seemed flustered by the difficulty of having to control the ship’s steering and speed at the same time. He decided to split the helm, giving Bordeaux control over the ship’s wheel. While Bordeaux remained at his station, Dontrius Mitchell, a second sailor on the bridge, was assigned to take control of the speed of the McCain at a neighboring station known as the lee helm.

Sanchez’s order was unexpected — he had not discussed the possibility in meetings with the crew before entering the straits. Nor had the crew practiced the maneuver much. Bordeaux could only remember doing it once or twice before.

“They were kind of rusty trying to follow those procedures,” said Jesse Sanchez, the executive officer.

When Bordeaux went to transfer the thrust to Mitchell, something went wrong. It was the night’s first mistake: Mitchell wound up with control of steering instead of Bordeaux.

Despite three separate reports examining the collisions, the Navy has never determined what, exactly, caused this.

In separate interviews weeks after the collision, Bordeaux, Mitchell and a third sailor present all denied touching any controls that could have transferred steering.

But two reports, one by the Navy and one by the NTSB, both ruled out a malfunction of the IBNS as a cause of the steering transfer mistake. They based their conclusion on digital logs kept by the navigation system that did not indicate any such error.

“Although the helmsman perceived a loss of steering, there was no malfunction of the John S McCain steering system,” NTSB investigators ruled.

The confidential Navy report concludes simply that a “watchstander had to have performed this action” — in other words, somebody pushed the wrong button.

The IBNS, however, indisputably played a role in the confusion that unfolded from the initial mistake.

In its normal, computer-assisted mode, the navigation system requires that both sailors press buttons to acknowledge a switch in steering before it happens.

The top-left corner of both screens shows current steering location at all times. The top-left corner of both screens shows current steering location at all times.

This station: HELM LONG HU SAN USS MCCAIN GUANG ZHOU WAN Team Oslo HYNDAI GLOBAL ALNIC MC But in the backup mode preferred by Sanchez, no such protection existed. Instead, the IBNS software makes “automatic offers” to other steering stations on the ship allowing them to take unilateral control. The reason? In cases of emergency, such as if the bridge is destroyed during an attack, sailors from other parts of the ship need to be able to take control without waiting for additional approval. Whatever the exact cause, neither Bordeaux nor Mitchell realized during the emergency that Mitchell had control of steering. Each man had an indicator on screen displaying the name of the station with control. But it wasn’t prominent — just a small box with green text a little larger than the 12-point font typically used in word processor programs. When Bordeaux tried to turn the ship, he thought the McCain’s steering had malfunctioned. As trained, he called out loss of steering. It was 5:20:39 a.m.

Chapter 3

“Why Are We Turning?”

A second mistake, made at almost exactly the same instant, actually drove the McCain into the path of the oil tanker, the Alnic MC.

For propulsion, the McCain has two main shafts connected to propellers. The two shafts can operate independently, moving at different speeds if needed for sailing or maneuvering.

A third, more experienced sailor was standing near Bordeaux and Mitchell. Anthony Gillilan, the boatswain’s mate of the watch, was in charge of both sailors.

Gillilan and Mitchell had begun the year as sailors on the USS Antietam, but the ship ran aground in an embarrassing incident as it departed Yokosuka Harbor in Japan. The Antietam returned to the yards for repairs. Gillilan and Mitchell were sent to the McCain to fill manpower shortages. Neither Gillilan nor Mitchell returned requests for comment.

The Antietam, a cruiser, did not have an IBNS. Gillilan, a helmsman on the Antietam, received no formal training when he joined the McCain. Fellow chief petty officers “just kind of went through it a little bit” with him, he told investigators.

When Sanchez ordered the split helm, Gillilan leaned over the console to transfer control of the McCain’s speed to the lee helm. It was a two-step process that required Gillilan to transfer control of each of the McCain’s two main shafts.

First, Gillilan used a drop-down menu on Bordeaux’s screen to transfer control of the ship’s port thrust to Mitchell.

But before he could do the same with the starboard shaft, Bordeaux called out loss of steering. Ordered to broadcast the emergency over the ship intercom, Gillilan was distracted and did not complete the transfer.

On his own station, Mitchell taps: 1. “LEE HELM” 2. “Accept” This station: LEE HELM On his own station, Mitchell taps: 1. “LEE HELM” 2. “Accept” This station: LEE HELM throttle-SLIDER-overlay-port.png throttle-SLIDER-overlay-stbd.png Prior to the transfer, moving one slider controlled both shafts.

He leaned over to Bordeaux’s computer screen and completed the transfer himself. (Bordeaux’s memory is different: He said he completed the transfer with Gillilan advising him on how to do it.) “I hurried up and did it real quick,” he told investigators. The transfer resulted in the third, and most serious, error. When Bordeaux had control of the speed, the McCain’s two propeller shafts were working together. If you slid the touch screen’s buttons to speed up one shaft, the other shaft automatically sped up as well. But during the transfer, control over the two shafts separated. Each began to operate independently. Mitchell told investigators that he remembered checking a small box marked to join the shafts together again — a process known as ganging. But the Navy and the NTSB analysis found that they continued to act separately. As the McCain drew closer to the Alnic, a ship officer ordered a decrease in speed to 10 knots. Mitchell adjusted the touch-screen controls to lower the speed of the propellers. He did not notice, but since the propellers were no longer operating together, only the port side shaft began to slow. The starboard propellers continued to churn, moving at around 20 knots, the Navy’s logs showed. Like a rowboat being pulled harder on one side than the other, the McCain began to veer sharply to the left — changing its course by more than 45 degrees over the next minute and 19 seconds.

To the officers trying to figure out what was going on, nothing made sense. The captain, Alfredo Sanchez, would later tell investigators that he recalled staring at an instrument panel in confusion. An indicator told him that the McCain’s rudders were set to 0 degrees — moving neither right nor left. But his warship was careening to the left.

“Why are we turning? Why are we turning?” his No. 2, Jesse Sanchez, remembered wondering.

Both men focused on the steering controls. They had failed so often before. They decided to try a last-ditch emergency procedure to regain steering.

Once again, the IBNS was at the center of the confusion that followed.

Chapter 4

“We Saved Our Ship”

The McCain can be controlled from the IBNS stations on the bridge and from a backup station in the rear of the ship.

The helm and aft stations featured a fail-safe device known as the big red button. Once pressed, the big red button overrides all other stations and returns control to its own location.

But numerous sailors on the McCain believed that the function of the big red button was to send steering control to the rear of the ship. It is unclear how this misunderstanding developed, or why it was so widespread among the crew. Mitchell told investigators that the instruction booklet on the bridge had not been updated to match the most current version of the IBNS.

Bridge Aft station has steering Bridge has steering Aft station The confusion over the big red button was the center of the fourth, and final, mistake of the night. With the steering seeming to malfunction, a ship’s officer ordered the sailors in the aft station to take control. At 5:23:01 a.m., a sailor pressed the big red button at the aft steering station. For the first time in more than two minutes, someone had control of the McCain’s steering. It did not last long. Up on the bridge, another sailor responded to the officer’s order by hitting the big red button there in the mistaken belief that it sent control to the aft station. Just seconds after sailors in the rear of the ship seized control, it returned to Bordeaux’s station on the bridge. After a few seconds of hurried conversation, the aft station finally regained control of the ship at 5:23:27 a.m. All told, steering of the McCain changed hands three times in 16 seconds. During one of the transfers, the ship’s rudders mysteriously turned the McCain briefly and sharply left, hastening the turn toward the shipping lanes. The aft watchstanders made one last effort to steer the McCain to the right and away from the collision. It was too late. At 5:23:58 a.m., the Alnic drove its bow into the port side of the McCain.

Sailors remember a sharp, powerful blow that knocked them off their feet. The force of the collision locked the two ships together so that they lurched ahead, stuck to each other, for almost 10 minutes, before slowly separating.

The Alnic’s prow gouged a 28-foot-wide hole into two sleeping quarters, known as Berthing 3 and Berthing 5. Berthing 5, which sat below the waterline, flooded in under a minute. There were 12 sailors there. Just two escaped.

In Berthing 3, which held 71 men, sailors woke to find water filling the spaces around them. Two were trapped in the twisted metal of their bunks, unable to flee.

Bordeaux joined the crew that went to rescue them. Sailors hacked at debris with an ax, crowbars and a pulley to free the two men. In total, 48 sailors were injured in the crash.

Over the next nine hours, the sailors of the McCain fought back flooding throughout the ship, filling holes and using pumps to clear water. Rescue ships from Singapore and Malaysia, as well as the USS America, an amphibious assault ship, helped get the vessel to port. Fifty sailors were recognized for their bravery during the incident.

Bordeaux mourned the dead. But he and the other sailors took pride in saving most of their shipmates and the ship itself. They had stood in water filled with diesel fuel and chemicals and human waste, pumping it into the ocean.

“We saved our ship,” he said.

The McCain sustained hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and was in such bad shape that it took two months to tow the warship back to Yokosuka. It would take another two years before it was fixed.

Chapter 5

“I May Not Have Been a Perfect Chief”

On May 24, 2018, in a courtroom perched above a food court in the historic Washington Naval Yard, Chief Petty Officer Jeffery D. Butler sat alone at a desk before a judge.

Butler was the only enlisted man to face a formal court-martial in connection with the McCain disaster. He was charged with dereliction of duty — partly because he had failed to “gain a proper understanding” of the navigation system in order to train his sailors.

Butler was a fireplug of man, with glasses and a thick neck, wearing a sharply creased dress white uniform that seemed to almost gleam under the courtroom’s fluorescent lights. He had been a standout among petty officers, the sailors who form the core of the Navy’s enlisted leadership. He was selected as sailor of the year on a previous ship.

As a senior enlisted officer, it had been his job to train Bordeaux and other young sailors on the McCain in the use of the IBNS. Some of the crew had joined the McCain from the USS Antietam and needed to be schooled in how their new ship functioned.

Butler told the judge that he himself had only received about 30 minutes to an hour of training on the system. And he had cleared the Antietam sailors without putting them through proper training. Given the sailors’ previous qualifications, and the McCain’s heavy workload, it was his attempt to put them to work as soon as possible.

He was not making any excuses, though, he said.

“I should have paid more attention to the training,” Butler told Judge William Weiland, a Navy commander. “I could have told my junior sailors how to better operate their systems.”

Read More Death and Valor on an American Warship Doomed by its Own Navy Our investigation into the Fitzgerald accident finds officials ignored warnings for years before one of the deadliest crashes in decades.

Still, the evidence suggests that the Navy prosecuted Butler for failing to understand the operation of the IBNS even as it grew clear that the Navy itself did not understand it.

In October and November, the Navy sanctioned Butler and other crew members in a first round of discipline known as an admiral’s mast. Butler had to forfeit pay and received a letter of reprimand that all but guaranteed a halt to further career advancement. Alfredo Sanchez, the captain, and Jesse Sanchez, the executive officer, were both fired from their commands. Bordeaux was docked pay, demoted and put on probation.

A few weeks later, the Navy released its comprehensive review of the collisions in the 7th Fleet. Mentions of the IBNS were scattered throughout the document. Pieced together, with acronyms untangled, they offer a damning portrait of the system.

The review found that the “designed responses of the IBNS” featured “known vulnerabilities” in shifting steering and thrust.

The Navy’s training schools do “not address the depth of knowledge and skills needed to properly maintain complex electronic navigation systems on ships, specifically the Integrated Bridge Navigation System.”

The review offered a critique of the Navy’s drive to save money by installing new technology rather than investing in training for its sailors.

“There is a tendency of designers to add automation based on economic benefits (e.g., reducing manning, consolidating discrete controls, using networked systems to manage obsolescence),” the report said, “without considering the effect to operators who are trained and proficient in operating legacy equipment.”

Adm. Phil Davidson, then the head of training and manpower for the Navy, led the review. The Navy fired or forced out five senior commanding officers above Sanchez, the McCain’s captain, including four admirals. Davidson was promoted to his current position, the head of Indo-Pacific Command, one of the most powerful posts in the military.

Later that fall, the Navy appointed four-star Adm. Frank Caldwell, who reported directly to the chief of the Navy, Adm. John Richardson, to investigate whether the McCain sailors deserved additional punishment.

As Caldwell launched his investigation of the McCain crew, the Navy’s engineering division conducted its own investigation of how best to operate the IBNS.

The inquiry resulted in a set of instructions issued to every destroyer in the Navy. The Navy decided not to abandon the system, so the instructions were an effort to better educate sailors about its flaws and known vulnerabilities, a choice that remains in effect today.

Called class advisories, the Navy instructions noted that the IBNS allowed control of the ship from four different locations on the bridge: “This flexibility in control provides the potential for inadvertent transfer of control or loss of awareness of control location.”

The new guidelines warned that IBNS instructions available on the bridge of the McCain and dozens of other destroyers did not include clear procedures for transferring steering and thrust.

And they required every destroyer captain to do exactly what Sanchez had done: Split the helm whenever using the IBNS, directing one sailor to steer and a second to control speed, in order to “maximize confidence” in the modernized system.

(Nearly a year later, in fall 2018, the Navy issued a second set of instructions. Now, ship captains have to certify that their crews know how to transfer IBNS controls to different stations.)

Despite these new instructions, Caldwell announced in January 2018 that he was recommending Butler and Sanchez for court-martial.

To the consternation of many of his fellow officers, Sanchez was charged with homicide. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of dereliction of duty. He received a letter of reprimand and had to forfeit $6,000 in pay.

Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment on the navigation system, the Navy’s findings on the accident involving the McCain or his punishment.

Butler, like Sanchez, decided against risking trial. The Navy wanted personal accountability. Butler would give it to them.

At the May 2018 hearing, Weiland glanced down at the sheaves of exhibits before him. He seemed sympathetic to the idea that the steering console had problems.

“It seems relatively complex,” he observed to Butler.

“It can be, Your Honor,” Butler responded in a low voice.

Still, he told the judge he was guilty as charged.

Before Weiland pronounced sentence, Butler turned to face rows of people filled with grief. Wives in black, young boys in suits and teenage girls in dark dresses had all come to the courtroom to give testimony about their loved ones.

Butler wept and his voice broke as he apologized: “I am truly sorry for your loss. They were more than just my shipmates. They were family.”

Butler asked Weiland for one small mercy. The prosecution wanted to knock him down a rank. Butler pleaded to keep his position, which meant an additional $200,000 in retirement pay. It was money, he said, that he hoped to use for his daughters’ college educations.

“I may not have been a perfect chief, but I have put my heart and soul into that title,” he told Weiland.

Weiland turned down the request.

“It Hurt Because I Always Wanted to Make My Grandfather Proud”

Dakota Bordeaux at his apartment in Oklahoma City. (Nick Oxford for ProPublica)

When Dakota Bordeaux entered bootcamp on Valentine’s Day 2017, it was the fulfillment of a promise. His grandfather had served as a sailor during the Vietnam War. He’d helped Bordeaux through a childhood pocked by many moves and school fights. Bordeaux enlisted in the Navy as soon as he could after graduating high school, and he had, he said, planned to spend his life in the service — “until I’m too old and they tell me and they kick me out because of my age.”

Today, Bordeaux is back home in Oklahoma, out of the Navy after a year and a half. After the accident, he had been taken with the rest of the McCain’s sailors back to Japan. There, he stayed in an old supply ship that had been converted into a sleeping quarters.

Bordeaux had trouble falling asleep in the bunks, which were similar to the ones on the McCain. And when he did, he had nightmares.

“I’m walking through everything that happened that night. I could hear the screams from the sailors who died during the collision,” he said.

Bordeaux believed that he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress, a mental disorder marked by nightmares, anxiety, flashbacks and startled reactions to loud noises.

A doctor he saw in Japan, however, diagnosed him with insomnia, he said. She gave him a book with tips to help him sleep, he said. It didn’t help much. Bordeaux began to drink heavily, going through as much as $500 of alcohol in a week.

As the months passed, Bordeaux noticed that he was having difficulty bringing enthusiasm to the job he had once loved. And he was confronted by a series of personal losses. The grandfather who had inspired his entry into the Navy passed away. So, too, did his other grandfather and grandmother. A woman he was dating dumped him.

One day, after a sleepless night, Bordeaux fell asleep at his post — a serious offense. The Navy busted him down to its lowest rank and dismissed him from service, he said.

Asked about his brief stint as a helmsman on a Navy warship, Bordeaux still feels both the excitement and the bewilderment.

“All I did was I kept the ship on course, did the adjusting of speed that I was ordered to,” he said. “I always made sure I wasn’t touching anything else.”

Today he works in a factory with his father. He makes plastic sheets for use in garbage bags.

On a recent day off in Oklahoma City, he wore a baseball cap, work pants and a U.S. Navy sweatshirt. His dismissal from the service is a dull pain he can’t get over.

“It hurt because I always wanted to make my grandfather proud,” he said. “I finally was able to join the Navy.”",www.features.propublica.org,center,IynYPkUsUBYLKVtn

There was no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted , because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials could n't do without talking to the soldier .

`` This is a young man whose circumstances we are still going to learn about , '' she said . `` He is , as all Americans , innocent until proven guilty . He 's now being tried in the court of public opinion after having gone through enormously traumatic five years of captivity . ''

An Army-led investigation, which was conducted in the months after Bergdahl disappeared in 2009, found he left the outpost deliberately and on his own free will, according to a military official who was briefed on the report.

There was no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted, because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't do without talking to the soldier.

The military said it is investigating the matter further.

Rice said Friday that it was essential for the military to hear Bergdahl's side of the story before coming to conclusions about what prompted his capture by the Taliban.

""This is a young man whose circumstances we are still going to learn about,"" she said. ""He is, as all Americans, innocent until proven guilty. He's now being tried in the court of public opinion after having gone through enormously traumatic five years of captivity.""

If the military finds reason to believe Bergdahl deserted his Army comrades, consequences will be delivered, Rice said.

""But in the meantime, let's remember this is a young man who volunteered to serve his country. He was taken as a prisoner of war. He suffered in captivity,"" she continued. ""He's now trying to begin the process of recovery. Let's let that happen. And then let's know the facts including his side of the story, and then we can make a judgment.""

Rice's comments last weekend weren't the first time she prompted criticism over an appearance on one of Washington's Sunday talk shows. In September 2012, she appeared on several programs following the attack on the American diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya -- and asserted the incident was prompted by a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video made in the United States.

The administration later acknowledged the attack was a terrorist assault on the U.S. compound.

The ""Susan Rice talking points"" have become a political flashpoint, spurring congressional investigations, administration explanations, and -- potentially -- a major headache for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she runs for president in 2016.

Rice has said she was simply providing the best information the administration had at the time -- and on Friday, she contended that just because the information she provided that day turned out to be inaccurate doesn't mean she's willfully misleading Americans.

""I'm upfront with the American people and I always do my best on behalf of my country and I do my best to tell the facts as I know them,"" she said.

In the case of Benghazi, Rice said she ""provided the best information that the U.S. government had at the time.

""Parts of it turned out to be wrong,"" she said. ""I regret that the information I was provided was wrong, that I delivered to the American people. That doesn't make me a liar. That makes me a public servant trying to say what we knew at the time.""",www.cnn.com,left,e8J9VBuHZzOG34XN

In an interview that aired Sunday on CNN, Secretary of State John Kerry defended the transfer of five Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, but even a leading Democratic senator raised questions about the administration’s handling of the case.

Nearly five years after he disappeared in Afghanistan, Bergdahl has ignited a political controversy, with some members of Congress in an uproar over the terms of his release by the Taliban and the secrecy surrounding it.

Kerry responds: In an interview with CNN’s Elise Labott from a seaside French village near Normandy, Kerry stood by the release of the five members of the Taliban, which some lawmakers say puts Americans overseas at risk and legitimizes the group.

Kerry said the United States has received assurances that the released detainees, who are staying in Qatar and have been given a one-year travel ban, will be closely monitored.

The United States will have the “ability to be able to do things” to ensure the former Guantanamo Bay prisoners are kept at bay, said Kerry, not elaborating on what those options may be.

But his assurances weren’t enough to placate senior members of the House and Senate intelligence committees.

Lawmakers appear doubtful: “We’ll see” was Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s skeptical response to Kerry on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”

“You can’t help but worry about them in Doha,” said the California Democrat, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Kerry insisted that the United States would act if the freed Taliban members attempted to endanger American lives.

“I’m not telling you that they don’t have some ability at some point to go back and get involved (in fighting), but they also have an ability to get killed doing that,” he said, adding that the former detainees put themselves at “enormous risk” should they rejoin the battlefield.

When asked if the United States would kill them, Kerry deflected, saying simply, “No one should doubt the capacity of America to protect Americans.”

McCain: ‘At what cost:’ Sen. John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, agreed the United States has an “obligation” to bring captured soldiers home. “But the question is at what cost,” the Arizona Republican said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

McCain said the Obama administration should have released different detainees.

“What we’re doing here is reconstituting the Taliban government, the same guys that are mass murderers,” he said.

Feinstein said she is also worried about the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, especially as the U.S. presence winds down and the country undergoes a transfer of power with President Hamid Karzai stepping down.

“Some of us worry very much that when we pull out, the Taliban finds its way back into power, and that would be tragic,” she said.

Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that after the one-year travel ban expires for former detainees, he is “absolutely convinced” that at least four of the five Taliban will “join the fight against what Americans are left in Afghanistan.”

Kerry dismissed that concern, saying that the U.S. combat mission is coming to an end and pronouncements by the Taliban vowing to rejoin the fight are nothing but “propaganda.”

But Rogers said that “hostilities haven’t stopped.”

“This was the wrong message at the wrong time, and we are going to pay for this decision for years,” the Alabama Republican said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Obama: 'I make absolutely no apologies' for Bergdahl swap

Left in the dark?: Some lawmakers are miffed that they weren’t consulted or notified about the prisoner exchange. Legislators from both parties accuse the administration of failing to provide 30 days' advance notice to Congress of a transfer of Guantanamo detainees.

In response to Kerry’s remarks that the released detainees will be monitored, Feinstein said, “It’s hard to be comfortable when you really haven’t been briefed on the intricacies of carrying out this agreement.”

“I think this whole sort of deal has been one that the administration has kept very close, and in the eyes of many of us, too close,” she said.

The administration originally said time was of the essence with Bergdahl’s health quickly deteriorating, but the latest reason for sidestepping Congress is concern that details would be leaked.

Celebrated at first, Bergdahl's release raises questions

Also on “Face the Nation,” Sen. Saxby Chambliss, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the administration’s fear of leaks odd. He said he and Feinstein were briefed for months about the mission on Osama bin Laden.

“Those types of things are briefed to us on a regular basis,” said Chambliss, a Georgia Republican.

“This administration has acted very strangely about this,” he said.

Also Sunday, Rogers pointed to Hillary Clinton, citing her briefing to Congress in 2011 about a possible prisoner swap on Bergdahl: “The Secretary of State at that time, Hillary Clinton, said that if all of our conditions aren't met, then none of them will be met.”

In book, Clinton raised concern about any Taliban talks for Bergdahl

“We got none of that,” Rogers said.

Clinton's hard choice: Meanwhile, Clinton’s book “Hard Choices” is officially set to be released this week - even though some members of the media have already obtained copies – and she has begun a round of interviews in which she will inevitably face questions about whether she has made up her mind about a presidential run in 2016.

ABC’s Diane Sawyer asked Clinton several different ways if she will jump in the race.

“I’m going to decide when it feels right for me to decide,” Clinton said in an excerpt that aired on ABC’s “This Week.”

What Clinton’s book may tell us about 2016

“I just want to kind of get through this year, travel around the country, sign books, help in the midterm elections in the fall and then take a deep breath and kind of go through my pluses and minuses about what I will and will not be thinking about as I make the decision,” Clinton said.

Republicans have raised questions about Clinton’s health and age should she be a presidential candidate.

Clinton called her concussion in late 2012 “serious” but insists she is in good health and would release her medical records as “other candidates have done” should she chose to run in 2016.

Clinton was noncommittal about appearing before a special House committee on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, if she asked, saying it depends on “how they conduct themselves.”

Despite surviving five years in a Taliban cage , Bergdahl , Trump said in several campaign speeches as a presidential candidate , was a `` traitor '' who should be executed .
In an on-camera interview shot last year by a British filmmaker , obtained exclusively by ███ and airing today on `` Good Morning America , '' `` World News Tonight With David Muir '' and `` Nightline , '' Bergdahl says the words of the man who is now his commander in chief would have made a fair trial impossible .
`` We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs that got what they wanted , '' Bergdahl says . `` The people who want to hang me — you 're never going to convince those people . ''
Bergdahl , a 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment trooper , walked off his combat outpost in Afghanistan in June 2009 and was quickly captured by the Taliban . During his five years in captivity with the Haqqani Network — the same Taliban faction that held American Caitlan Coleman and her family hostage for five years until they were freed last Wednesday — he endured what one U.S. official called the worst case of prisoner abuse since the Vietnam War .
He was released in 2014 in exchange for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay — a deal that was harshly criticized on the campaign trail by then-candidate Trump , who called Bergdahl `` garbage '' and even suggested that he should have been summarily executed .

Speaking to British war filmmaker Sean Langan , who was held captive by the same Taliban group in 2008 , Bergdahl says he wants to fight back against what he calls a false narrative fueled by conservative outlets like Fox News that sought to portray him as a traitor and jihadi sympathizer who had been persuaded to fight against the United States alongside his captors .
`` You know , it 's just insulting , frankly , '' Bergdahl tells Langan . `` It 's very insulting , the idea that they would think I did that . ''
In 2014 , then–Fox News correspondents Megyn Kelly and James Rosen reported on `` secret documents '' obtained by the network that purported to show Bergdahl had `` shown affection '' for his captors , converted to Islam and become a `` mujahid , '' or jihadi .
According to Bergdahl , however , he thought the conditions in captivity might kill him before his captors could .
`` It was getting so bad that I was literally looking at myself , you know , looking at joints , looking my ribs and just going , ' I 'm going to die here from sickness , or I can die escaping , ' '' he says . `` You know , it did n't really matter . ''
He attempted to escape twice , according to military officials , and he was severely punished after being recaptured . Terrence Russell , a military official who debriefs former U.S. captives for the U.S. Joint Personnel Recovery Agency , says Bergdahl was tortured in a way reminiscent of the brutality visited upon prisoners of war in Vietnam decades ago .
`` When they recaptured him and brought him back , the next day they spread-eagled and secured him to a metal bed frame , '' Russell says to Langan in another video . `` They took a plastic pipe … and they started beating his feet and his legs repeatedly with this plastic pipe … The idea was to just beat him and injure his legs and his feet so that he could not walk away again .

Bergdahl also says he was confined for more than four years to a cage that was only 7 feet by 6 feet .

U.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices . But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action , apparently fearing a wider conflict .
The U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression .

The militiamen and their supporters , however , were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy , with little if any resistance from authorities . Iraq 's government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia , saying it violated national sovereignty .
But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of diverting attention from the anti-government protests . `` Iran has been trying to provoke the U.S. into helping it solve its Iraq problem , '' the Crisis Group , an international think tank , said in a briefing on the crisis . `` The Trump administration , by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere with airstrikes , has obliged . ''","Iran-backed militiamen withdrew from the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Wednesday after two days of clashes with American security forces, but U.S.-Iran tensions remain high and could spill over into further violence. The withdrawal followed calls from the government and senior militia leaders.

It ended a high-stakes two-day crisis and practical siege of the largest and one of the most heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic missions in the world. The attack prompted the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East.

In an orchestrated assault, hundreds of militiamen and their supporters broke into the embassy compound, destroying a reception area, smashing windows and spraying graffiti on walls to protest U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia over the weekend that killed 25 fighters. The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk last week that killed a U.S. contractor.

WASHINGTON — Troops who have reported sexual assaults are 12 times more likely to be retaliated against than to see their attacker convicted of sex crimes, according to a report on the fallout of filing a military sexual assault report by Human Rights Watch.

The report, to be released Monday, found that troops reporting sexual assaults have endured retaliation ranging from vile insults to social isolation and death threats. It is based on interviews with more than 150 victims of sexual assault and a review of military documents.

The Pentagon reported earlier this month that 62% of those troops reporting sexual assault in 2014 indicated that they had been subjected to some form of retaliation.

Punishment for those who retaliate, however, appears to be a rarity. Since 2012, the Pentagon inspector general, one of the military's main offices to investigate the offenses, has closed two cases without substantiating the charges. It has three open cases, according to Bridget Serchak, a spokeswoman for the inspector general.

Retaliation is a ""significant issue for victims,"" said Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Snow, who leads the Pentagon's sexual-assault prevention and response programs, adding that military leaders are drafting a strategy to deal with it. Among the proposed tactics: encouraging greater reporting of retaliation through a confidential tip line.

""The first thing in addressing any issue is to acknowledge you have got a problem,"" Snow said in an interview with USA TODAY. ""And clearly we have done that and have taken steps. And we'll stay after it.""

The U.S. military carried out air strikes on Sunday against the Kataib Hezbollah militia in response to the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base , officials said .
At least 25 militia fighters were killed and 55 wounded .
“ The prime minister described the American attack on the Iraqi armed forces as an unacceptable vicious assault that will have dangerous consequences , ” his office said .

The Syrian government also denounced the air strikes .","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi on Monday condemned U.S. air strikes on bases of Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, a move that could plunge Iraq further into the heart of a proxy conflict between the United States and Iran.

The U.S. military carried out air strikes on Sunday against the Kataib Hezbollah militia in response to the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, officials said.

At least 25 militia fighters were killed and 55 wounded.

“The prime minister described the American attack on the Iraqi armed forces as an unacceptable vicious assault that will have dangerous consequences,” his office said.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a call with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the U.S. strikes “were aimed at deterring Iran,” the State Department said in a statement.

The air strikes will force Iraq to reconsider working with the U.S.-led international coalition against Islamic State, the Iraqi National Security Council said in a statement.

Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it would summon the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad to voice Baghdad’s disapproval.

Tensions have risen between Iran and the United States - Iraq’s two main allies - since last year when President Donald Trump pulled out of world powers’ 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

Iran denies involvement in attacks on U.S. forces and has condemned the air raids as “terrorism”.

“This claim without any evidence cannot justify bombing and killing people in violation of international law,” Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei said.

‘NATURAL RIGHT’

The strikes come as thousands take to the streets in Iraq to condemn, among other things, militias such as Kataib Hezbollah and their Iranian patrons that support Abdul Mahdi’s government.

They also demand an overhaul of a political system they see as corrupt and keeping most Iraqis in poverty.

At least 450 people have been killed as security forces and militias have sought to quell the protests, which forced Abdul Mahdi to resign. He remains in a caretaker capacity.

About 400 people in Basra protested against the air strikes, demonstrating in support of the militias.

The raids brought threats of reprisal. “Our response will be very tough on the American forces in Iraq,” militia commander Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, also known as Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes, said on Sunday.

Mohandes is a senior commander of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella grouping of paramilitary organizations mostly consisting of Iranian-backed Shi’ite Muslim militias that were integrated into Iraq’s armed forces.

He is also one of Iran’s most powerful allies in Iraq and formerly headed Kataib Hezbollah, which he founded.

His threat was met positively by his Iranian backers.

The Iraqi government is in control of the militias in “95% of cases”, Abdul Mahdi said at a televised Cabinet meeting.

He said was told about the air strikes hours before in a phone call with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and tried to warn the militia.

REGIONAL RIVALRIES

The Iraqi government cannot do much because of its caretaker status and has to take its lead from parliament, Abdul Mahdi told his ministers.

Iraq’s Fatih alliance, a political bloc representing the militias that holds the second largest number of seats in parliament, condemned the air strikes.

Their main rival, populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who leads parliament’s largest grouping, said he was willing to work with them to end the U.S. military presence in Iraq. But he also called on them to reign in their militias so as not to provide an excuse for further U.S. attacks.

Iraq’s influential top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the strikes, but his office also denounced alleged attacks by Iranian-backed militias on U.S. personnel.

He urged Iraqi authorities to prevent such attacks and “ensure Iraq does not become a field for settling regional and international scores and that others do not interfere in its internal affairs”.

Members of the House Armed Services Committee rejected the proposal , which was put forward by Rep. Vicky Hartzler ( R-Mo . ) as an amendment to a Pentagon spending bill .
But supporters of the provision are now working to attach it to another piece of appropriations legislation that is headed to the House floor in the coming days .
The revival of the amendment comes over the objections of some House Republicans — particularly in the moderate GOP ’ s Tuesday Group — and Defense Secretary James Mattis .
Hartzler put forward the provision on care for transgender troops as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) ; it failed by a 214-209 vote .
Two-dozen Republicans came together with 190 Democrats to vote against the package , but things could shift if it comes up again : six GOP members abstained or didn ’ t vote on the NDAA amendments .
Many Republicans were shocked that the package failed , an aide said , and lobbyists who had worked on the issue also told ███ that the outcome was far from certain — even in the moments before the vote .
“ We had been working this issue for weeks . At each point , we just had hurdles we had to get over , ” said one lobbyist advocating against the Hartzler amendment , who asked for anonymity in order to speak about the process . “ Going into that vote that morning that day , my anxiety level was so high because we were so close and it was going to be so tight . ”
Mattis called Hartzler at least once , including the day of the NDAA vote , to urge her to withdraw the amendment . Two sources told ███ that the Defense secretary also spoke with Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks ' to Romney 's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC 's liaison to rock ' n ' roll MORE ( R-Wis. ) last week .
And now the lobbying process is beginning all over again , as the House prepares to vote on the legislation to fund the Defense Department .
███ spoke with seven Capitol Hill staffers and lobbyists about the issue , all of whom asked to remain off the record to protect their clients , employers or associates .
Some Republican lawmakers are angry with leaders for allowing the initial amendment to go to a vote last week , and are now fighting to keep it off the table again .
“ There are many members who voted in favor of the amendment the first time but are advocating that the amendment not be made in order the second time , ” said a Republican aide , mentioning an effort to push leaders . Conservative members are also reportedly pushing hard in favor of the measure .
The House Rules Committee , which is tightly controlled by GOP leadership , will meet Monday and Tuesday to decide which amendments make it into the Defense Department ’ s appropriations bill , including discussion on the Hartzler amendment .
The Family Research Council , Heritage Action and Alliance Defending Freedom have been among those urging members to support the amendment .
Hartzler and the amendment ’ s supporters ague that paying for transgender-related healthcare is too high a cost for the government — putting the projected figure above $ 1 billion over the next decade .
“ The job of Congress is to ensure that our military is the most effective , efficient and well-funded fighting force in the world . With the challenges we are facing across the globe , we are asking the American people to invest their hard-earned money in national defense , '' Hartzler said in a statement . `` Each dollar needs to be spent to address threats facing us . ''
Critics say Hartzler 's figure is `` fake , '' pointing two studies from the New England Journal of Medicine and the RAND Corporation that show projected costs of between roughly $ 2.4 million and $ 8.4 million .
Last year , the Obama administration ended the prohibition on transgender people serving openly in the military , but set a transition to occur in stages .
The Defense Department is currently reviewing whether to accept new soldiers who identify as transgender .
Opponents of the amendment are pushing back on a number of fronts , including on the basis of LGBT rights and the belief that the Pentagon should be setting military priorities .
“ The job of our Armed Forces is to defend our country , and the DoD should be given more leeway than other parts of the executive branch with respect to personnel decisions , ” wrote Rep. Justin Amash Justin AmashTrump allies assail impeachment on process while House Democrats promise open hearings soon Hoyer : We are going to move as fast 'as the facts and truth dictate ' on open hearings Conway spars with Wallace on whether White House will cooperate with impeachment inquiry after formal vote MORE ( R-Mich. ) in a Facebook post explaining his “ no ” vote on the Hartzler amendment .
“ Those who serve in our Armed Forces deserve the best medical care . … . With respect to transgender persons , we should focus on the best science , not the political or philosophical opinions of partisans , ” he said .
The Paul Singer-funded Republican LGBT advocacy group American Unity Fund — joined by the Palm Center and OutServe , two organizations that focus on LGBT individuals serving in the military , and Human Rights Campaign — led the charge on marshaling forces on Capitol Hill and the Pentagon against the amendment .
`` The politics of these issues should have evolved to a point where leadership isn ’ t putting members in this position unnecessarily . You have a lot of prominent Republicans who have come a long way on this , '' said a Republican lobbyist who advocated against the amendment .
While public views on LGBT issues like same-sex marriage have shifted in recent years , transgender advocates say winning support from some Republicans would be an important milestone .
“ To have a couple dozen house Republicans and a unified Democratic caucus take that vote to protect the transgender community , I think that ’ s a watershed moment ” for transgender issues , said another Republican lobbyist who worked the issue .
“ People are sick of toxic social issues . They ’ re sick of people playing political games and bully them to use must-pass legislation — in the NDAA or spending bills — to get these victories they otherwise wouldn ’ t have , ” the lobbyist added .
It harkens back to an amendment last year , sponsored by Republican Rep. Steve Russell from Oklahoma , which would have provided a “ religious liberty ” exemption to an Obama executive order prohibiting government contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation .
Rep. Charlie Dent ( R-Pa. ) , a leader of the Tuesday Group , was among a group of bipartisan lawmakers who launched a failed attempt to override it . The Russell amendment was ultimately removed from the NDAA in the Senate .
“ After the Russell amendment , there is a heightened awareness regarding issues affecting the LGBT community , ” said the Republican staffer . “ People are paying much greater attention to those issues and amendments that affect those issues . ”","Republicans are battling behind the scenes over an amendment that would ban the Pentagon from funding the gender reassignment surgeries and other transgender-related healthcare of service members.

At each point, we just had hurdles we had to get over,” said one lobbyist advocating against the Hartzler amendment, who asked for anonymity in order to speak about the process. “Going into that vote that morning that day, my anxiety level was so high because we were so close and it was going to be so tight.”

Mattis called Hartzler at least once, including the day of the NDAA vote, to urge her to withdraw the amendment. Two sources told The Hill that the Defense secretary also spoke with Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks' to Romney's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC's liaison to rock 'n' roll MORE (R-Wis.) last week.

And now the lobbying process is beginning all over again, as the House prepares to vote on the legislation to fund the Defense Department.

The Hill spoke with seven Capitol Hill staffers and lobbyists about the issue, all of whom asked to remain off the record to protect their clients, employers or associates.

Some Republican lawmakers are angry with leaders for allowing the initial amendment to go to a vote last week, and are now fighting to keep it off the table again.

“There are many members who voted in favor of the amendment the first time but are advocating that the amendment not be made in order the second time,” said a Republican aide, mentioning an effort to push leaders. Conservative members are also reportedly pushing hard in favor of the measure.

The House Rules Committee, which is tightly controlled by GOP leadership, will meet Monday and Tuesday to decide which amendments make it into the Defense Department’s appropriations bill, including discussion on the Hartzler amendment.

The Family Research Council, Heritage Action and Alliance Defending Freedom have been among those urging members to support the amendment.

Hartzler and the amendment’s supporters ague that paying for transgender-related healthcare is too high a cost for the government — putting the projected figure above $1 billion over the next decade.

“The job of Congress is to ensure that our military is the most effective, efficient and well-funded fighting force in the world. With the challenges we are facing across the globe, we are asking the American people to invest their hard-earned money in national defense,"" Hartzler said in a statement. ""Each dollar needs to be spent to address threats facing us.""

Critics say Hartzler's figure is ""fake,"" pointing two studies from the New England Journal of Medicine and the RAND Corporation that show projected costs of between roughly $2.4 million and $8.4 million.

Last year, the Obama administration ended the prohibition on transgender people serving openly in the military, but set a transition to occur in stages.

The Defense Department is currently reviewing whether to accept new soldiers who identify as transgender.

Opponents of the amendment are pushing back on a number of fronts, including on the basis of LGBT rights and the belief that the Pentagon should be setting military priorities.

“The job of our Armed Forces is to defend our country, and the DoD should be given more leeway than other parts of the executive branch with respect to personnel decisions,” wrote Rep. Justin Amash Justin AmashTrump allies assail impeachment on process while House Democrats promise open hearings soon Hoyer: We are going to move as fast 'as the facts and truth dictate' on open hearings Conway spars with Wallace on whether White House will cooperate with impeachment inquiry after formal vote MORE (R-Mich.) in a Facebook post explaining his “no” vote on the Hartzler amendment.

“Those who serve in our Armed Forces deserve the best medical care. …. With respect to transgender persons, we should focus on the best science, not the political or philosophical opinions of partisans,” he said.

The Paul Singer-funded Republican LGBT advocacy group American Unity Fund — joined by the Palm Center and OutServe, two organizations that focus on LGBT individuals serving in the military, and Human Rights Campaign — led the charge on marshaling forces on Capitol Hill and the Pentagon against the amendment.

""The politics of these issues should have evolved to a point where leadership isn’t putting members in this position unnecessarily. You have a lot of prominent Republicans who have come a long way on this,"" said a Republican lobbyist who advocated against the amendment.

While public views on LGBT issues like same-sex marriage have shifted in recent years, transgender advocates say winning support from some Republicans would be an important milestone.

“To have a couple dozen house Republicans and a unified Democratic caucus take that vote to protect the transgender community, I think that’s a watershed moment” for transgender issues, said another Republican lobbyist who worked the issue.

“People are sick of toxic social issues. They’re sick of people playing political games and bully them to use must-pass legislation — in the NDAA or spending bills — to get these victories they otherwise wouldn’t have,” the lobbyist added.

It harkens back to an amendment last year, sponsored by Republican Rep. Steve Russell from Oklahoma, which would have provided a “religious liberty” exemption to an Obama executive order prohibiting government contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.

Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a leader of the Tuesday Group, was among a group of bipartisan lawmakers who launched a failed attempt to override it. The Russell amendment was ultimately removed from the NDAA in the Senate.

“After the Russell amendment, there is a heightened awareness regarding issues affecting the LGBT community,” said the Republican staffer. “People are paying much greater attention to those issues and amendments that affect those issues.”

The House of Representatives approved a resolution that would force President Trump to seek consent from Congress before taking new military action against Iran .
The move comes nearly a week after President Trump greenlighted a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general and led to increased tensions with Tehran .
The nonbinding war powers resolution was approved in a mostly party-line vote of 224-194 . Only three Republicans and one independent joined Democrats to pass the measure . Eight Democrats opposed it .
The Senate could consider a similar measure — but one that has the force of law — as early as next week , but it is unclear if it has enough votes to clear the chamber . Trump administration officials maintain the president already has the authority to take action against Iran under a 2002 war authorization passed by Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks .
The House vote also comes after briefings for lawmakers on Wednesday from top Trump administration officials left Democrats — and some Republicans — unhappy with a lack of transparency about what fueled the decision to strike the Iranian general .
`` You would think anytime we would engage in such an important change in approach that we would be working together , consulting together , respecting the approach that each sides takes to all of this and hopefully be on one side of it all , '' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , said ahead of the resolution 's passage . `` What this does is very important for the security of this country . ''
The measure was sponsored by Rep. Elissa Slotkin , D-Mich. , a former CIA analyst who worked on Middle East policy .
In response to the vote , the White House said the president `` has the right and duty to protect this nation and our citizens from terrorism . That 's what he continues to do , and the world is safer for it . ''
`` This House resolution tries to undermine the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevent terrorist activity by Iran and its proxies , and attempts to hinder the President 's authority to protect America and our interests in the region from the continued threats , '' White House Spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement Thursday evening . `` These Congressional actions are completely misguided . In fact , this ridiculous resolution is just another political move because , under well-established Supreme Court precedent , it 's non-binding and lacks the force of law . '' The White House reiterated its stance that the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani was authorized under `` his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive as well as the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force . ''
President Trump also addressed the vote at a campaign rally Thursday night in Toledo , Ohio , and mocked the idea of consulting Congress while carrying out an operation like the killing of Soleimani .

Updated 9:15 p.m. ET

The House of Representatives approved a resolution that would force President Trump to seek consent from Congress before taking new military action against Iran.

The move comes nearly a week after President Trump greenlighted a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general and led to increased tensions with Tehran.

The nonbinding war powers resolution was approved in a mostly party-line vote of 224-194. Only three Republicans and one independent joined Democrats to pass the measure. Eight Democrats opposed it.

The Senate could consider a similar measure — but one that has the force of law — as early as next week, but it is unclear if it has enough votes to clear the chamber. Trump administration officials maintain the president already has the authority to take action against Iran under a 2002 war authorization passed by Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.

The House vote also comes after briefings for lawmakers on Wednesday from top Trump administration officials left Democrats — and some Republicans — unhappy with a lack of transparency about what fueled the decision to strike the Iranian general.

""You would think anytime we would engage in such an important change in approach that we would be working together, consulting together, respecting the approach that each sides takes to all of this and hopefully be on one side of it all,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said ahead of the resolution's passage. ""What this does is very important for the security of this country.""

The measure was sponsored by Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a former CIA analyst who worked on Middle East policy.

In response to the vote, the White House said the president ""has the right and duty to protect this nation and our citizens from terrorism. That's what he continues to do, and the world is safer for it.""

""This House resolution tries to undermine the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevent terrorist activity by Iran and its proxies, and attempts to hinder the President's authority to protect America and our interests in the region from the continued threats,"" White House Spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement Thursday evening. ""These Congressional actions are completely misguided. In fact, this ridiculous resolution is just another political move because, under well-established Supreme Court precedent, it's non-binding and lacks the force of law."" The White House reiterated its stance that the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani was authorized under ""his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive as well as the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force.""

President Trump also addressed the vote at a campaign rally Thursday night in Toledo, Ohio, and mocked the idea of consulting Congress while carrying out an operation like the killing of Soleimani.

The war powers measure crafted by House Democrats was written as a concurrent resolution, which is traditionally considered nonbinding and doesn't require the president's signature.

Earlier Thursday, Pelosi said they purposely took this approach to ensure that the chamber could send a clear message to the president.

""We are taking this path because it does not require ... a signature of the president of the United States,"" she said. ""This is a statement of the Congress of the United States, and I will not have that statement be diminished by whether the president will veto it or not.""

On Thursday, administration officials issued a statement strongly opposing the House war powers measure.

""This concurrent resolution is misguided, and its adoption by Congress could undermine the ability of the United States to protect American citizens whom Iran continues to seek to harm,"" the statement from the Office of Management and Budget on the administration's policy said.

""This place is a safer place with Soleimani gone,"" the Louisiana Republican said.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, also attacked the Democrats' efforts.

""Thankfully this is a resolution going nowhere,"" he said. ""This is not a resolution, this is a retreat, a de facto apology.""

( AP Photo/Rahmat Gul , File )
Top officials in the White House were aware in early 2019 of classified intelligence indicating Russia was secretly offering bounties to the Taliban for the deaths of Americans , a full year earlier than has been previously reported , according to U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the intelligence .
The assessment was included in at least one of President Donald Trump ’ s written daily intelligence briefings at the time , according to the officials . Then-national security adviser John Bolton also told colleagues at the time that he briefed Trump on the intelligence assessment in March 2019 .
The White House didn ’ t respond to questions about Trump or other officials ’ awareness of Russia ’ s provocations in 2019 . The White House has said Trump wasn ’ t — and still hasn ’ t been — briefed on the intelligence assessments because they haven ’ t been fully verified . However , it ’ s rare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of a doubt before it is presented to top officials .
Bolton declined to comment Monday when asked by the AP if he ’ d briefed Trump about the matter in 2019 . On Sunday , he suggested to NBC that Trump was claiming ignorance of Russia ’ s provocations to justify his administration ’ s lack of response .
“ He can disown everything if nobody ever told him about it , ” Bolton said .
The revelations cast new doubt on the White House ’ s efforts to distance Trump from the Russian intelligence assessments . The AP reported Sunday that concerns about Russian bounties also were in a second written presidential daily briefing this year and that current national security adviser Robert O ’ Brien had discussed the matter with Trump . O ’ Brien denies doing that .
On Monday , O ’ Brien said that while the intelligence assessments regarding Russian bounties “ have not been verified , ” the administration has “ been preparing should the situation warrant action . ”
The administration ’ s earlier awareness of the Russian efforts raises additional questions about why Trump didn ’ t take punitive action against Moscow for efforts that put the lives of American service members at risk . Trump has sought throughout his time in office to improve relations with Russia and President Vladimir Putin , moving this year to try to reinstate Russia as part of a group of world leaders it had been kicked out of .
Officials said they didn ’ t consider the intelligence assessments in 2019 to be particularly urgent , given Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn ’ t a new occurrence . The officials with knowledge of Bolton ’ s apparent briefing for Trump said it contained no “ actionable intelligence , ” meaning the intelligence community didn ’ t have enough information to form a strategic plan or response . However , the classified assessment of Russian bounties was the sole purpose of the meeting .
The officials insisted on anonymity because they weren ’ t authorized to disclose the highly sensitive information .
The intelligence that surfaced in early 2019 indicated Russian operatives had become more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network , a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012 during the Obama administration .
The National Security Council and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence held meetings regarding the intelligence . The NSC didn ’ t respond to questions about the meetings .
Late Monday , the Pentagon issued a statement saying it was evaluating the intelligence but so far had “ no corroborating evidence to validate the recent allegations . ”
“ Regardless , we always take the safety and security of our forces in Afghanistan — and around the world — most seriously and therefore continuously adopt measures to prevent harm from potential threats , ” said Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman .
Concerns about Russian bounties flared anew this year after members of the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group , known to the public as SEAL Team Six , raided a Taliban outpost and recovered roughly $ 500,000 in U.S. currency . The funds bolstered the suspicions of the American intelligence community that Russians had offered money to Taliban militants and linked associations .
The White House contends the president was unaware of this development , too .
The officials told the AP that career government officials developed potential options for the White House to respond to the Russian aggression in Afghanistan , which was first reported by The New York Times . However , the Trump administration has yet to authorize any action .
The intelligence in 2019 and 2020 surrounding Russian bounties was derived in part from debriefings of captured Taliban militants . Officials with knowledge of the matter told the AP that Taliban operatives from opposite ends of the country and from separate tribes offered similar accounts .
Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russian intelligence officers had offered payments to the Taliban in exchange for targeting U.S. and coalition forces .

Top officials in the White House were aware in early 2019 of classified intelligence indicating Russia was secretly offering bounties to the Taliban for the deaths of Americans, a full year earlier than has been previously reported, according to U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the intelligence.

The assessment was included in at least one of President Donald Trump’s written daily intelligence briefings at the time, according to the officials. Then-national security adviser John Bolton also told colleagues at the time that he briefed Trump on the intelligence assessment in March 2019.

The White House didn’t respond to questions about Trump or other officials’ awareness of Russia’s provocations in 2019. The White House has said Trump wasn’t — and still hasn’t been — briefed on the intelligence assessments because they haven’t been fully verified. However, it’s rare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of a doubt before it is presented to top officials.

Bolton declined to comment Monday when asked by the AP if he’d briefed Trump about the matter in 2019. On Sunday, he suggested to NBC that Trump was claiming ignorance of Russia’s provocations to justify his administration’s lack of response.

“He can disown everything if nobody ever told him about it,” Bolton said.

The revelations cast new doubt on the White House’s efforts to distance Trump from the Russian intelligence assessments. The AP reported Sunday that concerns about Russian bounties also were in a second written presidential daily briefing this year and that current national security adviser Robert O’Brien had discussed the matter with Trump. O’Brien denies doing that.

On Monday, O’Brien said that while the intelligence assessments regarding Russian bounties “have not been verified,” the administration has “been preparing should the situation warrant action.”

The administration’s earlier awareness of the Russian efforts raises additional questions about why Trump didn’t take punitive action against Moscow for efforts that put the lives of American service members at risk. Trump has sought throughout his time in office to improve relations with Russia and President Vladimir Putin, moving this year to try to reinstate Russia as part of a group of world leaders it had been kicked out of.

Officials said they didn’t consider the intelligence assessments in 2019 to be particularly urgent, given Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn’t a new occurrence. The officials with knowledge of Bolton’s apparent briefing for Trump said it contained no “actionable intelligence,” meaning the intelligence community didn’t have enough information to form a strategic plan or response. However, the classified assessment of Russian bounties was the sole purpose of the meeting.

The officials insisted on anonymity because they weren’t authorized to disclose the highly sensitive information.

The intelligence that surfaced in early 2019 indicated Russian operatives had become more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012 during the Obama administration.

The National Security Council and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence held meetings regarding the intelligence. The NSC didn’t respond to questions about the meetings.

Late Monday, the Pentagon issued a statement saying it was evaluating the intelligence but so far had “no corroborating evidence to validate the recent allegations.”

“Regardless, we always take the safety and security of our forces in Afghanistan — and around the world — most seriously and therefore continuously adopt measures to prevent harm from potential threats,” said Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman.

Concerns about Russian bounties flared anew this year after members of the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group, known to the public as SEAL Team Six, raided a Taliban outpost and recovered roughly $500,000 in U.S. currency. The funds bolstered the suspicions of the American intelligence community that Russians had offered money to Taliban militants and linked associations.

The White House contends the president was unaware of this development, too.

The officials told the AP that career government officials developed potential options for the White House to respond to the Russian aggression in Afghanistan, which was first reported by The New York Times. However, the Trump administration has yet to authorize any action.

The intelligence in 2019 and 2020 surrounding Russian bounties was derived in part from debriefings of captured Taliban militants. Officials with knowledge of the matter told the AP that Taliban operatives from opposite ends of the country and from separate tribes offered similar accounts.

Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russian intelligence officers had offered payments to the Taliban in exchange for targeting U.S. and coalition forces.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the Taliban’s chief negotiator , a spokesman for the insurgents said Tuesday, but it was unknown whether there was any mention during their conversation of allegations about Russian bounties. Pompeo pressed the insurgents to reduce violence in Afghanistan and discussed ways of advancing a U.S.-Taliban peace deal signed in February, the Taliban spokesman tweeted.

The U.S. is investigating whether Americans died because of the Russian bounties. Officials are focused on an April 2019 attack on an American convoy . Three U.S. Marines were killed after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they returned to Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan.

The Defense Department identified them as Marine Staff Sgt. Christopher Slutman, 43, of Newark, Delaware; Sgt. Benjamin Hines, 31, of York, Pennsylvania; and Cpl. Robert Hendriks, 25, of Locust Valley, New York. They were infantrymen assigned to 2nd Battalion, 25th Marines, a reserve infantry unit headquartered out of Garden City, New York.

Hendriks’ father told the AP that even a rumor of Russian bounties should have been immediately addressed.

“If this was kind of swept under the carpet as to not make it a bigger issue with Russia, and one ounce of blood was spilled when they knew this, I lost all respect for this administration and everything,” Erik Hendriks said.

Three other service members and an Afghan contractor were wounded in the attack. As of April 2019, the attack was under a separate investigation, unrelated to the Russian bounties.

The officials who spoke to the AP also said they were looking closely at insider attacks from 2019 to determine if they were linked to Russian bounties.

MAGA hat controversy

Michael Berry , senior counsel at the Liberty Institute , a Texas-based legal organization dedicated to defending religious liberty in America , said recent high-profile cases of military chaplains facing punishment for private counseling sessions that reflected the teachings of their religion could cause devout Americans who are qualified for military service to think twice about joining the military .
In December , a chaplain for a Ranger training battalion received an administrative letter of concern after a soldier complained that he advocated Christianity and used the Bible during a mandatory unit suicide-prevention training session . The Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers said the chaplain “ used his official position to force his personal religious beliefs on a captive military audience ” in an article the group posted on its website .
And , last month , a Navy chaplain was removed from his post and may lose his career after some sailors complained about his private counseling , in which he reportedly advocated against homosexuality and sex outside of marriage .
“ People of faith are going to stay away from the military , ” said Mr. Berry in an interview with The ███ .
“ I can ’ t tell you how many moms and dads I ’ ve spoken to who say , ‘ My son or daughter wants to join the military , [ but ] in light of what you ’ ve described , I ’ m not sure I want to let them join the military anymore , ’ and I don ’ t blame them . I would have serious reservations about my own kids joining , ” Mr. Berry said .
Douglas Lee , president of the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty , whose job it is to find people who want to be chaplains and make sure they ’ re also qualified to serve in the military , said growing religious hostility within the military is making it harder for him to find potential recruits and for the armed forces to maintain the chaplains it does have .
“ I know people who get out , officers and chaplains , who ’ ve said , ‘ I can ’ t serve the way I want to in this environment , ’ ” said Mr. Lee , who also served as an Army chaplain . “ People who ’ ve said , ‘ Because of the religious liberty challenges I see , I think I ’ ll serve somewhere else . ’ ”
Not being able to recruit or retain these individuals is very dangerous from a national security standpoint , said Mr. Berry , because they could be the military ’ s next group of leaders , but will never serve because they don ’ t think they ’ re welcome .
“ We all used to sit around and talk about planning on spending 20 years , but at some point enough is enough , ” he said .
Mr. Berry said he thinks the “ hostile work environment ” that is forcing the most religious persons out of the military is only getting worse , and that while in the past problems were mainly in the Air Force , religious liberty issues have spread throughout all the services .
“ The problem is getting worse , not better , despite our efforts , ” he said . “ There is a culture [ of ] hostility [ toward ] religion in the military right now . ”
While problems in the past have touched all religious groups , Travis Weber , director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the Family Research Council , said he ’ s seen a recent uptick and pattern of Christians facing persecution for religious expression .
Mr. Lee blamed a lack of education among commanders about where the line is to express religion in the workplace that causes a knee-jerk reaction to any show of religion .
A commander recently told a gate guard on a base in Georgia that he could no longer tell someone to have a “ blessed day , ” for example , though further review found that wasn ’ t a religious imposition , he said .
In the chaplain example last month , Navy Chaplain Lt. Cmdr . Wes Modder was removed from his position counseling sailors and could be kicked out of the military for expressing his views on marriage and homosexuality in private sessions . Mr. Berry is representing Lt. Cmdr . Modder , who is still on active duty in Charleston , South Carolina , as the case is reviewed at a higher level .
Mr. Berry said this case even could set a precedent usable outside the military by establishing , as a principle , that the government can punish religious leaders based on the state ’ s moral disapproval of the church ’ s teachings , especially in matters of sex .
“ If what happened to Chaplain Modder is allowed to stand , it could foretell more instances in which the government tells priests , ministers , chaplains , etc . that their views are unacceptable , ” he said .
Mr. Weber said these types of punishments affect both troops and chaplains , since chaplains will feel the need to constantly be looking over their shoulder to avoid punishment , and service members will wonder if chaplains are being honest or just saying what they can say without getting in trouble .
Michael Weinstein , president of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , said that while chaplains can believe whatever their religion teaches , those who think they must act on religious teachings about sex or sexuality have no place in the military .
“ You can continue to believe that internally , but if you have to act on that , the right thing to do is to get out of the U.S. military , because you have no right to tell a member of the military that they ’ re inferior because of the way they were born , ” he said .
The military had 2,837 active-duty chaplains as of December 2014 , according to numbers provided by the Defense Department . The largest group was the Southern Baptist Convention , with 437 members . More than 200 chaplains are affiliated with the Roman Catholic church , while 26 are Jewish , and just one is Hindu .
“ The Department of Defense respects , places a high value on and supports by policy the rights of members of the military services to observe the tenets of their respective religions or to have no religious beliefs , ” said Lt. Cmdr . Nate Christensen , spokesman for the Defense Department . “ The mission of the chaplain corps is to provide care and the opportunity for service members , their families and other authorized personnel to exercise their constitutional right to the free exercise of religion . ”
Advocates agreed that chaplains play a crucial role in allowing troops to exercise their freedom of religion , no matter what religion that is .
Commanders have also relied on chaplains to act as combat multipliers , dealing with issues in the ranks like marriage crises or financial troubles that commanders often can ’ t address , Mr. Lee said .
Mr. Weinstein , however , said he thinks the chaplain corps would work better if chaplains were totally outside the military force structure and didn ’ t have a military rank .
In addition to posing a problem if a chaplain outranks whoever is seeking counseling , having religious leaders in the military serves as propaganda for Islamic extremist groups , who try to paint the U.S. military as the latest group of religious crusaders , he said .","Soon there may only be atheists in the foxholes.

Christians are leaving the U.S. military or are discouraged from joining in the first place because of a “hostile work environment” that doesn’t let them express their beliefs openly, religious freedom advocates say.

Michael Berry, senior counsel at the Liberty Institute, a Texas-based legal organization dedicated to defending religious liberty in America, said recent high-profile cases of military chaplains facing punishment for private counseling sessions that reflected the teachings of their religion could cause devout Americans who are qualified for military service to think twice about joining the military.

In December, a chaplain for a Ranger training battalion received an administrative letter of concern after a soldier complained that he advocated Christianity and used the Bible during a mandatory unit suicide-prevention training session. The Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers said the chaplain “used his official position to force his personal religious beliefs on a captive military audience” in an article the group posted on its website.

And, last month, a Navy chaplain was removed from his post and may lose his career after some sailors complained about his private counseling, in which he reportedly advocated against homosexuality and sex outside of marriage.

Mr. Berry represents both chaplains in question.

“People of faith are going to stay away from the military,” said Mr. Berry in an interview with The Washington Times.

“I can’t tell you how many moms and dads I’ve spoken to who say, ‘My son or daughter wants to join the military, [but] in light of what you’ve described, I’m not sure I want to let them join the military anymore,’ and I don’t blame them.

American photojournalist Luke Somers was killed during a failed rescue attempt in Yemen, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Saturday.

Somers had been held by al-Qaeda militants since his abduction in Yemen's capital of Sanaa in September 2013.

Hagel, speaking from Kabul where he made a surprise visit Saturday, confirmed the British-born hostage's death following an unsuccessful raid to free him by U.S. and Yemeni special forces.

""There were compelling reasons to believe Mr. Somers' life was in imminent danger,"" Hagel said in a statement,describing Somers' death as murder at the hands of terrorists.

Lucy Somers said she learned of her brother's death from the FBI.

""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she told the Associated Press.

A second hostage, South African Pierre Korkie, a teacher abducted in Yemen in May 2013 with his wife, was also killed in the failed raid. Yolande Korkie had previously been released by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants.

During the rescue operation, helicopters swept in and dropped U.S. commandos about a mile from the village where Somers was being held, according to a senior Defense Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

U.S. warplanes flew overhead for protection but did not fire weapons. The commandos, from teams based in the Middle East, killed all of the al-Qaeda-linked terrorists. No U.S. forces were wounded, the official said.

President Obama said he authorized the rescue attempt because of information the U.S. had that Somers' life was in immediate danger, including a video released by his terrorist captors this week that announced the journalist would be killed within 72 hours.

""As this and previous hostage rescue operations demonstrate, the United States will spare no effort to use all of its military, intelligence and diplomatic capabilities to bring Americans home safely, wherever they are located. And terrorists who seek to harm our citizens will feel the long arm of American justice,"" Obama said.

U.S. officials believe the militants shot the two men during a firefight, and that both were alive when American forces pulled them from a building on the group's compound and got them aboard aircraft, where medical teams operated on them during a short flight to the USS Makin Island, a Navy ship in the region.

Korkie is believed to have died during the flight, while American Somers died on the ship, according to senior U.S. officials who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the information had yet to be approved for release.

Those who knew Somers, who was born in Britain but spent much of his life in America, remembered the photographer as a person drawn to new experiences.

""He really wanted to understand the world,"" said Shawn Gillen, an English professor and chairman of Beloit College's journalism program. Somers earned a bachelor's degree in creative writing while attending Beloit College in Wisconsin from 2004 to 2007.""He'd want to be in places where world events were happening.""

""Al-Qaeda promised to conduct the execution (of Somers) today so there was an attempt to save them but unfortunately they shot the hostage before or during the attack,"" al-Ahmadi said.

At the same time, Pierre Korkie was set to be released Sunday, according to Gift of Givers, the aid group that negotiated his wife's freedom.

""The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by al-Qaeda,"" the group said in a statement.

In a YouTube video released Wednesday, Somers, 33, said his ""life is in danger.""The video featured an al-Qaeda official and a brief message from Somers — dressed in a purple shirt and with a shaved head — at the end.

Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said Thursday a U.S. raid last month attempted to free Somers, but he turned out not to be at the site.

Before her brother's death, Lucy Somers released an online video describing him as a romantic who ""always believes the best in people."" She ended with the plea: ""Please let him live.""

us_military,New York Times - News,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html,"As Tensions With Iran Escalated, Trump Opted for Most Extreme Measure",2020-01-04,"Helene Cooper, Eric Schmitt, Maggie Haberman, Rukmini Callimachi","From The New York Times , I ’ m Michael Barbaro . This is “ The Daily. ” Today : From Iraq to Washington , consequences are mounting after the United States assassinated Iranian General Qassim Suleimani . Helene Cooper on why President Trump chose to do it . It ’ s Monday , January 6 . Helene , what do we know about what led up to this extraordinary decision by the U.S. to take out General Suleimani ?
Well , from what we ’ ve been able to piece together over the past few days , all of this started on December 27 .
archived recording And just into Fox , an American contractor was just killed in northern Iraq in a rocket attack , and several U.S. troops were also injured .
When an Iranian-backed Shiite militia group launched an attack in Iraq that ended up killing an American contractor .
archived recording This is just the latest in a spate of similar rocket attacks , but it ’ s the first time that we ’ re actually seeing U.S. casualties .
Right after this happened , the Pentagon drew up the perennial list of options that the Defense Department is always keeping for the president to respond and decide what he ’ s going to do in order to respond to the attack . General Mark Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Defense Secretary Mark Esper both flew to Mar-a-Lago , where President Trump was spending the holidays , and met with him , presenting him this list of how do you respond to what the administration immediately determined was an Iranian-backed attack . One option included striking Iranian ships . Another option was striking , perhaps , a missile site or two , or looking for a way to launch airstrikes against the Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq that had started this . Also on the list was one extreme option , which was to launch an attack , which would really be a targeted assassination , actually , of General Qassim Suleimani , who is the head of Iran ’ s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ’ s Quds Force , and it ’ s basically Iran ’ s very muscular , yet covert , arm of the Iranian military . He ’ s , in essence , the most senior military commander in Iran . This is something that the Defense Department often does , is they will put an extreme option on the table because they will always give all options to the president , but it ’ s almost their way of nudging the president toward an option that they prefer , right ? If you put something that is viewed as a little bit crazy out there , then you get him to do what you want . President Trump , at the time , did not choose the nuclear option .
archived recording ( mike pompeo ) What we did was take a decisive response that makes clear what President Trump has said for months and months and months , which is that we will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy .
He went for , let ’ s launch an attack on the Shiite militia group that launched the attack that killed the American contractor .
archived recording 1 The Pentagon says it carried out military strikes in Iraq and Syria , targeting a militia group . archived recording 2 A spokesman for the group says U.S. airstrikes killed at least 25 of their fighters and hurt more than 50 others . This happened in Iraq and Syria yesterday .
So the president , in the end , chooses a pretty measured kind of tit-for-tat response . We were attacked by missiles , so we will attack with missiles .
archived recording ( mark esper ) I would add that , in our discussion today with the president , we discussed with him other options that are available , and I would note also that we will take additional actions as necessary to ensure that we act in our own self-defense , and we deter further bad behavior from militia groups or from Iran .
So then , a couple of days later , President Trump is still at Mar-a-Lago , and he ’ s watching TV . He ’ s still angry about the initial Shiite militia attack that killed the American contractor , but now he ’ s seeing , on TV , all of these video images of Iranian-backed protesters attacking the American Embassy in Baghdad .
archived recording 1 A chaotic scene as protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad today , scaling the walls , forcing the gates , and setting fires inside the heavily guarded compound while diplomats were trapped inside . Some protesters were chanting , “ Death to America. ” archived recording 2 [ CHANTING ]
And one of the first things that come to his mind is Benghazi and the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi in 2011 that led to the death of four Americans , including the ambassador to Libya .
archived recording How would you have handled that , if you were watching , in real time , Americans under fire at the American Consulate , and an ambassador under fire ? archived recording ( donald trump ) Well , it would have never taken place , because I think —
President Trump , during his campaign , and for years after the initial attack in Benghazi , really went after Hillary Clinton , who was secretary of state at the time , for not doing enough to prevent that . And this had been a rallying cry during his 2016 campaign , so this was a pretty big deal for him .
archived recording ( donald trump ) Horribly handled . A horrible leadership . She ’ s a horrible leader .
So he ’ s watching , now , these attacks that are happening under his own watch , and he ’ s thinking about Benghazi , according to his aides that we talked to . He ’ s also thinking about the 1979 attack on the American Embassy in Iran that led to the hostage crisis . He ’ s getting more and more angry , according to his aides , and then he calls for his menu of options again , and this time , he picks the extreme option .
And so this is the moment when the president calls for the strike on Suleimani , this top general .
That ’ s right . Pentagon officials and administration officials were very surprised , because it ’ s one thing to give an option to a president . It ’ s another thing for him to actually do it . They had put that option on the menu for President Trump , not thinking that he would take it , and now he has taken it . So the Defense Department went into action . This is something that the American Defense Department , quite tragically , almost , is very good at doing . We know how to kill people , and we have been tracking , for more than a decade , almost two decades , Qassim Suleimani . So intelligence-wise , we had intelligence reports that he would be flying into Baghdad International Airport that night . There was some question now , as the military is setting up , just sort of the mechanics of how this strike is going to be conducted . The Pentagon had determined that , if he was met , for instance , by Iraqi officials who were friendly towards the United States , they would not go ahead with the strike . If he was not , they would . When General Suleimani ’ s plane landed , he was met by the head of one of Iraq ’ s Iranian-backed Shia militias , who was viewed by the United States as somebody who — I think the phrase they used was a “ clean party , ” meaning it ’ s O.K . to kill him . It ’ s kind of a weird way of saying it .
So a clean party means somebody we don ’ t mind killing ?
Exactly . Exactly . And so they authorized the strike and blew up the two-car convoy as it was leaving Baghdad International Airport .
archived recording 1 In a dramatic escalation of tensions in the Middle East , a U.S. airstrike has killed Iran ’ s most important military commander . archived recording 2 This was a swift , precise military strike that has huge , unpredictable and possibly long-term consequences .
So help us to understand the significance of this decision by the president . Why was this ever an option given to him , even if it was the most extreme option ? And why do we think he chose it ?
It ’ s hard to explain why President Trump chose to take this option . I think many of us don ’ t understand it ourselves . The administration will tell you that he ’ s a very bad guy , and there ’ s no denying that . The administration will also tell you that he ’ s responsible for the death of hundreds of American troops . That is true as well . The issue , though — that has been true for years and years , as American troops have battled some Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq , and both Presidents Bush and Obama made the decision not to kill Suleimani because he was a general with the Iranian military , and the United States traditionally does not go around assassinating military generals . The last time we did this was in 1943 during World War II , when we took out a Japanese admiral . Iran is a sovereign state . Assassinating one of their officials is pretty much almost the same thing as assassinating the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , or a high-ranking American official , and then own up to it and take credit for it . It ’ s just not something that is normally often done in broad daylight . But we should also remember that , just a month ago , President Trump authorized the killing of Baghdadi that ISIS had , and he got a lot of very good and deserved credit for that . The administration now , today , will try to make the equivalent that General Suleimani is the same as Baghdadi , that he ’ s a terrorist , and he has certainly been behind many proxy terrorist acts by Iranian-backed groups in Yemen , in Lebanon , in Iraq and in Syria . So that has been increasing in recent months as the United States has choked off Iran economically .
archived recording 1 We ’ re following multiple breaking stories , including Iran ’ s seizure of at least one oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz today , and there are now conflicting reports about whether a second tanker was seized . Iran is clearly messaging that they hold cards here , but as this continues to go on , what will Iran continue to do ? archived recording 2 Well , you know , Brianna , I think it ’ s important that we understand what ’ s motivating Iran right now . Look , since the United States pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal , and the administration imposed new sanctions on Iran , those sanctions have absolutely crippled Iran ’ s economy .
That led the Iranian regime to start , as a lot of people at the Pentagon say , acting out , and you saw an increase in attacks from Iran , which has been punching out because it was being punched . And that is one of the reasons that the administration has now given for why this strike was taken . The other big reason , though , leads back to this , which is that the administration is saying that Suleimani was planning additional , even more high-profile attacks on the United States and on American interests and assets in the region , and that this was eminent .
archived recording ( mike pompeo ) We could see that he was continuing down this path , that there were in fact plots that he was working on that were aimed directly at significant harm to American interests throughout the region , not just in Iraq .
You know , you ’ re hearing that from General Milley , the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . You heard that on Sunday from Secretary of State Pompeo .
archived recording ( mike pompeo ) We would ’ ve been culpably negligent had we not taken this action . The American people would have said that we weren ’ t doing the right thing to protect and defend American lives .
Which is the argument that Suleimani was about to launch another imminent attack on American interests .
Helene , of all the rationales that we ’ ve heard from the Trump administration , this seems to be the most important in terms of explaining why we would do this now , take out Suleimani . But of course , the U.S. has a very complicated history of using potential threats to American interests as a rationale for actions overseas , especially in the Middle East . So what does your reporting show about how we should be thinking about this explanation of an imminent attack ?
That ’ s such an interesting and key question , how we should be thinking about the administration rationale for this attack . Do we believe them , or do we not ? Our reporting shows that it depends on where you stand . There is no question that General Suleimani has planned , and was continuing to plan , attacks against the United States through these groups , but that ’ s been going on for more than 15 years . So the question then becomes , why now ? The administration says there was something imminent and big that was about to happen , and they appear to be basing that on intelligence reports that they ’ ve received about General Suleimani ’ s travels in the last few days leading up to the attack that took his life . But these same intel sources also say that he had been asked by Ayatollah Khamenei , who ’ s the supreme leader of Iran , to come back to Iran , that Khomeini had not authorized anything . He had requested permission , and he was not given it , and he was told to come back to Iran . So that then belies the whole question of “ imminent. ” Does it become something that is happening in two days , or something that hasn ’ t even been approved yet ? So what the administration , then , will have to answer to the American people , if this leads to war , which it might , is whether or not this assassination was worth it .
We ’ ll be right back . Helene , what has been the response in the Middle East in the days since the U.S. killed Suleimani ?
The response since the U.S. killed Suleimani in the Middle East has been huge .
In Iran , where protesters had , two weeks ago , been protesting against the regime , they had now united , apparently , behind the regime , and had turned their ire on the United States .
You ’ re seeing these familiar views of American flags being burned in the streets .
This massive outpouring of mourners . It ’ s certainly ramped up the anti-American sentiment in Iran .
Meanwhile , in Baghdad , you ’ re seeing similar outpourings of grief , but that ’ s been accompanied by the Iraqi Parliament voting unanimously this morning to expel the United States from Iraq . They didn ’ t put forth a timeline for withdrawal , so there ’ s still some wiggle room there . But particularly the Shiites and the Iraqi government are very , very angry at the United States right now .
You have to understand that Iraq is made up of three very distinct groups — Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds — but it is predominantly Shiite . Iran is Shiite as well , and the Iraqi government is very close to Iran . The Shiites in Iraq are particularly close to General Suleimani and view him , in many ways , as one of their own . They ’ re also upset , though , because this was a targeted killing in their country . So in much the same way that if something like this happened in the United States , the United States government would be upset . That ’ s another reason why the Iraqi government is so angry .
Helene , can Iraq and its legislature do that ? Can they kick the U.S. troops out of the country ?
They can . Iraq can say , you are no longer welcome . Remember , we are there at the invitation of the Iraqi government , ostensibly to fight the Islamic State . That battle is largely over . So yes , the Iraqi government can kick the United States military out of Iraq . Whether they do or not , whether this is posturing , I don ’ t know yet . Every couple of hours , you see something else . Right after the Iraqi Parliament voted , we saw the Pentagon announced that it was suspending the anti-ISIS coalition effort in Iraq . There are 4,000 American troops who ’ ve been there , and that the troops who are in Iraq will be focused on protecting the American citizens who are still in the country , but who are being advised to leave as soon as possible . It ’ s like 2013 all over again , when the Obama administration ended combat and pulled troops out of Iraq . And you saw the rise of ISIS because once the United States is gone and out of the country , these other factions are given more room to maneuver and more room to thrive . And so you can see how these events could lead to a resurgence of ISIS if the ground becomes clear for them to move around more freely .
And wasn ’ t Suleimani also leading an Iranian militia that was an enemy of ISIS ?
Yes , there was a de facto cooperation between Suleimani and the United States in the fight against ISIS . They were both opposed to ISIS , and they were both fighting ISIS on the same turf .
Right , which would have made , in a very narrow and complicated way , Suleimani an ally in our fight against ISIS , even though he ’ s our enemy in many other respects .
He was an ally in our fight against ISIS . That is correct .
Helene , the ripple effects of all this are very complicated , but I wonder if there ’ s a simple way of thinking about this , which is that after all these months of provocation and response between the U.S. and Iran , that President Trump felt it was time for the U.S. to remind Iran that , at the end of the day , we are the military superpower , and our advantages over them are extraordinary and represent the kind of deterrent that means , whatever Iran ’ s ultimate response to this is , it will not be all that severe — that , in a sense , we just called Iran ’ s bluff .
That would work if we hadn ’ t started this to begin with by pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal , which was signed in 2015 under the Obama administration , and which was hated by President Trump and many Republicans .
archived recording ( donald trump ) I have been in business a long time . I know deal-making , and let me tell you , this deal is catastrophic for America , for Israel , and for the whole of the Middle East .
They viewed it as too weak , and said that it gave Iran rewards , as it did , by lifting sanctions for stopping their uranium enrichment , but did not address Iran ’ s misbehavior , and this is the General Suleimani-type misbehavior , in other areas .
archived recording ( donald trump ) The problem here is fundamental . We ’ ve rewarded the world ’ s leading state sponsor of terror with $ 150 billion , and we received absolutely nothing in return .
When we pulled out of the nuclear deal , we reimposed sanctions on Iran , and put even stiffer sanctions on the country . We started to punish companies and basically told the world , you either do business with Iran , or you do business with America . And of course , most of the world chose America . That had the result of completely putting a strangle on the Iranian economy , and that is kind of what has led to the Iranian regime then starting escalating attacks against the United States , because this is a hard-line regime , and they clearly believe that if they ’ re hurting , they ’ re going to pull the United States down into the mud with them .
But doesn ’ t it still stand to reason that if that is the situation that we are in , in a post-nuclear deal world , where Iran decides that the only way that it can operate is with attacks through militias that it organizes against the U.S. , that taking out a person like Suleimani is a reasonable option , given our superiority over Iran ? We have nuclear weapons . They do not . We have superpower military capabilities . They do not . That doesn ’ t leave them with a whole lot of options . Does it ?
Back in the ‘ 80s , there was this tanker war , where Iran , Iraq and the U.S. were all going after each other . And they made the Persian Gulf an impossible place , and the price of oil went way up . And it ended up with the United States , by mistake , shooting down an Iranian passenger jet . And Iran made a lot of noise after that happened , and then they quieted down . So there is precedent for that , but I think it ’ s easily as much of a chance that they don ’ t quiet . Iran has a whole lot of options to make us hurt . Certainly , the United States is much better equipped , but unless we ’ re actually suggesting that we ’ re going to drop a nuclear bomb on downtown Tehran , it ’ s never that easy once you get into a conventional war . So we went to war in Iraq , which lasted years , and which we are still seeing some of the consequences from . A war with Iran would be so much worse than any kind of war with Iraq . They ’ re way more sophisticated than Iraq ever was . They have the ability to make it hurt . So the question can be phrased as , is the United States willing to give up the blood and treasure it would take to subdue Iran ? Which of course , it could , but it ’ s going to cost us something . So are we willing to pay that fee ?
Helene , thank you . Thank you for talking to us on a Sunday . Thank you .
On Sunday , Iran ’ s leaders and their allies began to openly discuss plans for retaliation against the United States , saying that they would target America ’ s military bases and its soldiers . In an interview with CNN , a high-level adviser to Iran ’ s supreme leader said , quote , “ The only thing that can end this period of war is for the Americans to receive a blow that is equal to the blow that they have inflicted. ” On Twitter , President Trump warned Iran against such a response , writing , quote , “ They attacked us , & we hit back . If they attack again , which I would strongly advise them not to do , we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before ! ” We ’ ll be right back . Here ’ s what else you need to know today .
archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Look , it was a targeted attack on a government official , a high-ranking military official for the government of Iran , and what it ’ s done has moved this country closer to war . We are not safer today than we were before Donald Trump acted .
In interviews on Sunday , the leading Democratic candidates for president , including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg , on CNN , challenged the Trump administration ’ s rationale for killing General Suleimani and predicted that it could backfire on the U.S .
archived recording ( pete buttigieg ) Now , let ’ s be clear , Qassim Suleimani was a bad figure . He has American blood on his hands . None of us should shed a tear for his death . But just because he deserved it doesn ’ t mean it was the right strategic move . This is about consequences .
In a statement , former Vice President Joe Biden said that the president , quote , “ just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox , ” and Senator Bernie Sanders , at a campaign stop , accused the president of violating his campaign pledge .

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: From Iraq to Washington, consequences are mounting after the United States assassinated Iranian General Qassim Suleimani. Helene Cooper on why President Trump chose to do it. It’s Monday, January 6. Helene, what do we know about what led up to this extraordinary decision by the U.S. to take out General Suleimani?

helene cooper

Well, from what we’ve been able to piece together over the past few days, all of this started on December 27.

archived recording And just into Fox, an American contractor was just killed in northern Iraq in a rocket attack, and several U.S. troops were also injured.

helene cooper

When an Iranian-backed Shiite militia group launched an attack in Iraq that ended up killing an American contractor.

archived recording This is just the latest in a spate of similar rocket attacks, but it’s the first time that we’re actually seeing U.S. casualties.

helene cooper

Right after this happened, the Pentagon drew up the perennial list of options that the Defense Department is always keeping for the president to respond and decide what he’s going to do in order to respond to the attack. General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper both flew to Mar-a-Lago, where President Trump was spending the holidays, and met with him, presenting him this list of how do you respond to what the administration immediately determined was an Iranian-backed attack. One option included striking Iranian ships. Another option was striking, perhaps, a missile site or two, or looking for a way to launch airstrikes against the Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq that had started this. Also on the list was one extreme option, which was to launch an attack, which would really be a targeted assassination, actually, of General Qassim Suleimani, who is the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s Quds Force, and it’s basically Iran’s very muscular, yet covert, arm of the Iranian military. He’s, in essence, the most senior military commander in Iran. This is something that the Defense Department often does, is they will put an extreme option on the table because they will always give all options to the president, but it’s almost their way of nudging the president toward an option that they prefer, right? If you put something that is viewed as a little bit crazy out there, then you get him to do what you want. President Trump, at the time, did not choose the nuclear option.

archived recording (mike pompeo) What we did was take a decisive response that makes clear what President Trump has said for months and months and months, which is that we will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy.

helene cooper

He went for, let’s launch an attack on the Shiite militia group that launched the attack that killed the American contractor.

archived recording 1 The Pentagon says it carried out military strikes in Iraq and Syria, targeting a militia group. archived recording 2 A spokesman for the group says U.S. airstrikes killed at least 25 of their fighters and hurt more than 50 others. This happened in Iraq and Syria yesterday.

michael barbaro

So the president, in the end, chooses a pretty measured kind of tit-for-tat response. We were attacked by missiles, so we will attack with missiles.

helene cooper

Exactly, and we’ll attack who attacked us.

michael barbaro

Got it.

archived recording (mark esper) I would add that, in our discussion today with the president, we discussed with him other options that are available, and I would note also that we will take additional actions as necessary to ensure that we act in our own self-defense, and we deter further bad behavior from militia groups or from Iran.

helene cooper

So then, a couple of days later, President Trump is still at Mar-a-Lago, and he’s watching TV. He’s still angry about the initial Shiite militia attack that killed the American contractor, but now he’s seeing, on TV, all of these video images of Iranian-backed protesters attacking the American Embassy in Baghdad.

archived recording 1 A chaotic scene as protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad today, scaling the walls, forcing the gates, and setting fires inside the heavily guarded compound while diplomats were trapped inside. Some protesters were chanting, “Death to America.” archived recording 2 [CHANTING]

helene cooper

And one of the first things that come to his mind is Benghazi and the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi in 2011 that led to the death of four Americans, including the ambassador to Libya.

michael barbaro

Which was an attack of protesters —

helene cooper

Yes.

michael barbaro

— on an American, essentially, embassy-like building.

helene cooper

Yes.

archived recording How would you have handled that, if you were watching, in real time, Americans under fire at the American Consulate, and an ambassador under fire? archived recording (donald trump) Well, it would have never taken place, because I think —

helene cooper

President Trump, during his campaign, and for years after the initial attack in Benghazi, really went after Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, for not doing enough to prevent that. And this had been a rallying cry during his 2016 campaign, so this was a pretty big deal for him.

archived recording (donald trump) Horribly handled. A horrible leadership. She’s a horrible leader.

helene cooper

So he’s watching, now, these attacks that are happening under his own watch, and he’s thinking about Benghazi, according to his aides that we talked to. He’s also thinking about the 1979 attack on the American Embassy in Iran that led to the hostage crisis. He’s getting more and more angry, according to his aides, and then he calls for his menu of options again, and this time, he picks the extreme option.

michael barbaro

And so this is the moment when the president calls for the strike on Suleimani, this top general.

helene cooper

That’s right. Pentagon officials and administration officials were very surprised, because it’s one thing to give an option to a president. It’s another thing for him to actually do it. They had put that option on the menu for President Trump, not thinking that he would take it, and now he has taken it. So the Defense Department went into action. This is something that the American Defense Department, quite tragically, almost, is very good at doing. We know how to kill people, and we have been tracking, for more than a decade, almost two decades, Qassim Suleimani. So intelligence-wise, we had intelligence reports that he would be flying into Baghdad International Airport that night. There was some question now, as the military is setting up, just sort of the mechanics of how this strike is going to be conducted. The Pentagon had determined that, if he was met, for instance, by Iraqi officials who were friendly towards the United States, they would not go ahead with the strike. If he was not, they would. When General Suleimani’s plane landed, he was met by the head of one of Iraq’s Iranian-backed Shia militias, who was viewed by the United States as somebody who — I think the phrase they used was a “clean party,” meaning it’s O.K. to kill him. It’s kind of a weird way of saying it.

michael barbaro

So a clean party means somebody we don’t mind killing?

helene cooper

Exactly. Exactly. And so they authorized the strike and blew up the two-car convoy as it was leaving Baghdad International Airport.

archived recording 1 In a dramatic escalation of tensions in the Middle East, a U.S. airstrike has killed Iran’s most important military commander. archived recording 2 This was a swift, precise military strike that has huge, unpredictable and possibly long-term consequences.

michael barbaro

So help us to understand the significance of this decision by the president. Why was this ever an option given to him, even if it was the most extreme option? And why do we think he chose it?

helene cooper

It’s hard to explain why President Trump chose to take this option. I think many of us don’t understand it ourselves. The administration will tell you that he’s a very bad guy, and there’s no denying that. The administration will also tell you that he’s responsible for the death of hundreds of American troops.

So that has been increasing in recent months as the United States has choked off Iran economically.

So we went to war in Iraq, which lasted years, and which we are still seeing some of the consequences from. A war with Iran would be so much worse than any kind of war with Iraq. They’re way more sophisticated than Iraq ever was. They have the ability to make it hurt. So the question can be phrased as, is the United States willing to give up the blood and treasure it would take to subdue Iran? Which of course, it could, but it’s going to cost us something. So are we willing to pay that fee?

On Sunday, Iran’s leaders and their allies began to openly discuss plans for retaliation against the United States, saying that they would target America’s military bases and its soldiers. In an interview with CNN, a high-level adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said, quote, “The only thing that can end this period of war is for the Americans to receive a blow that is equal to the blow that they have inflicted.” On Twitter, President Trump warned Iran against such a response, writing, quote, “They attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!” We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) Look, it was a targeted attack on a government official, a high-ranking military official for the government of Iran, and what it’s done has moved this country closer to war. We are not safer today than we were before Donald Trump acted.

In interviews on Sunday, the leading Democratic candidates for president, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, on CNN, challenged the Trump administration’s rationale for killing General Suleimani and predicted that it could backfire on the U.S.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Now, let’s be clear, Qassim Suleimani was a bad figure. He has American blood on his hands. None of us should shed a tear for his death. But just because he deserved it doesn’t mean it was the right strategic move. This is about consequences.

In a statement, former Vice President Joe Biden said that the president, quote, “just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox,” and Senator Bernie Sanders, at a campaign stop, accused the president of violating his campaign pledge.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Trump promised to end endless wars. Tragically, his actions now put us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.

The Pentagon is concerned that not providing safe haven to more of the Iraqis , many of whom interpreted and did other key tasks for U.S. forces , will harm national security by dissuading locals from cooperating with the United States in Iraq and other conflict zones , the officials said .
In a closed-door White House meeting last week devoted to the Iraqi issue , officials focused largely on the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’ s method of conducting certain deep background checks on the Iraqis , and identified it as a major source of the drop in admissions , said the two officials aware of the discussions , who declined to be named .
As of Aug. 15 , just 48 Iraqis have been admitted to the United States this fiscal year through a special refugee program meant for people who worked for the U.S. government or American contractors , news media or non-governmental groups , according to data provided by the State Department . More than 3,000 came last year and about 5,100 in 2016 .
At the meeting last week , officials examined the multiple security checks that Iraqis must pass , including one background check that all refugees undergo , called the Interagency Check .
They determined the obstacle was a separate process called Security Advisory Opinions ( SAOs ) , which are required for a smaller subset of people - male and female refugees within a certain age range from Iraq and 10 other countries , mostly in the Middle East and Africa .
The FBI and intelligence agencies conduct the SAOs while the State Department coordinates the process .
At the meeting , the FBI revealed that of a batch of 88 Iraqis it had recently completed SAOs for , it found suspicious information on 87 of them , said the two officials aware of the meeting . Current and former officials said that is a much higher “ hit rate ” than in past years .

In the earlier , high-level meeting , the Pentagon and State Department both supported maintaining the admissions ceiling at 45,000 , one current official and one former official informed of the discussions said . Other agencies ’ positions on the cap were not yet clear .
At that meeting , a senior Pentagon official raised the issue of the paltry admissions of Iraqi refugees , and asked that if the admissions ceiling is cut further from 45,000 , the Iraqis be admitted without counting against the cap , one official said .
A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on preliminary discussions . The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on its position on the ceiling .
The White House official said the administration ’ s deliberations over the refugee ceiling are continuing and said the United States is “ under significant strain as a result of a massive asylum crisis that is separate from , and in addition to , the refugee ceiling . ”
President Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 promising tight restrictions on immigration , and in the past year and a half , his administration has sharply reduced refugee admissions through executive orders and closed-door decisions .
The refugee ceiling Trump set last year of 45,000 is the lowest since 1980 , when the modern refugee program was established . The United States is on track to admit about 22,000 refugees this year , approximately half of the maximum allowed .

“ADDITIONAL VETTING”

STRICTER VETTING

Last year, the Trump administration instituted more stringent screening for refugees, including a requirement that they submit phone numbers and email addresses for many more family members than before. That information is now assessed in the SAOs for those refugees who require them.

The countries whose refugees automatically require SAOs before they can be admitted, in addition to Iraq, are Egypt, Iran, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

Iraqis can raise flags for national security concerns for a number of reasons, especially if their work for the military required them to keep tabs on militants and other potential threats.

Years after their work for the military has ended, it can be difficult to verify that their contact with suspicious individuals or groups was strictly related to their job.

us_military,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/2/donald-trump-insurrection-act-talk-spurs-calls-mil/,'Lay down your arms': Prominent veterans urge troops to defy Trump,2020-06-02,"Mike Glenn, Ben Wolfgang","President Trump ’ s idea to deploy active-duty military forces to quell increasingly violent riots in cities across the country has sparked a sharp legal and constitutional clash .
But an even more explosive debate has broken out on a question once believed unthinkable : Should — and will — rank-and-file troops obey the commander in chief if they are ordered to round up American citizens on the streets of New York , Louisville or Chicago ?
Some prominent veterans and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling on service members to “ lay down your arms ” and defy Mr. Trump ’ s orders should he invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act and seek to move tanks and personnel to major metropolitan areas as civil unrest grows after the Memorial Day death of George Floyd during a confrontation with Minneapolis police .
That in turn has sparked an angry rebuttal from top retired military officials , who say U.S. soldiers and seamen would of course follow orders and that even to raise the question is irresponsible .
“ Though there are always outliers , I would expect almost all U.S. troops to obey any lawful order to quell rioting in cities , even where the instigators or participants are American citizens , and even if they disagreed with the order , ” retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles J. Dunlap Jr. told The ███ .
But in this , as in so many other ways , Mr. Trump represents a distinct break with his predecessors . The racial tensions inflamed by the Floyd killing are matched by unresolved racial tensions within the U.S. military as well .
Questions about the troops ’ affinity for Mr. Trump are well-founded . The president ’ s approval rating among active-duty forces hit the lowest point of his tenure in December , according to a Military Times poll , and troops have been tasked with patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border , aiding the national medical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other missions outside the Pentagon ’ s more traditional scope .
Critics say that asking troops to act as domestic riot police would be a bridge too far and should spur young men and women to openly revolt .
“ The president has made it clear that the fight for these constitutional principles is a fight against himself , ” said Rep. Seth Moulton , the Massachusetts Democrat and Marine Corps veteran who made a brief run for the Democratic president nomination . “ We must therefore , with every ounce of conviction , every commitment to peace and every glimmer of hope , join in lawful protest to overcome his tyranny .
“ And if he chooses to abuse the military as a tyrant would do — to stifle dissent , suppress freedom and cement inequality — then I call on all our proud young men and women in uniform , as a veteran and a patriot , to lay down your arms , uphold your oath and join this new march for freedom , ” Mr. Moulton added .
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith , Washington Democrat , said he had “ serious concerns about using military forces to respond to protesters ” and that he plans to call Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley to explain Mr. Trump ’ s policy .
Military leaders , of course , insist that men and women of the armed forces will obey the chain of command and follow any lawful orders given by their superiors , including Mr. Trump . Urging troops to lay down their arms en masse , officials and retired military officers say , is ludicrous and dangerous .
Gen. Dunlap , now executive director of the Center on Law , Ethics and National Security at Duke University , said he always opposed using U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement , “ absent truly extraordinary circumstances . ”
“ But it would be dangerous for any politician to suggest that any member of the military to ‘ lay down their arms ’ in defiance of a lawful order , ” he said . “ We don ’ t want those in the armed forces to think they have the right to pick and choose which lawful orders they ’ ll obey . ”
At the same time , the Pentagon has been clear that operating as a domestic law enforcement force is far from the ideal scenario for American forces , including National Guard personnel .
A military official told reporters at the Pentagon it is “ the mission we like doing the least. ” The Pentagon ’ s clear preference is to let the National Guard lead the response .
Dozens of states have activated National Guard forces to assist police in the effort to deal with growing unrest . Active-duty forces have been put on “ short alert status ” outside Washington but have not been deployed . The president has unique authorities to deploy forces in the District of Columbia , though his power is much more limited in the 50 states .
The Insurrection Act requires that a governor request the deployment of active-duty forces except in the most extreme circumstances — and even some of the president ’ s most ardent supporters say they won ’ t go down that road .
“ We know that Texans can take care of Texas , ” Gov . Greg Abbott , a Republican , said in explaining why he won ’ t ask for active-duty military help .
The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was in 1992 , when military personnel helped stem riots in Los Angeles after the acquittal of police officers involved in the beating of Rodney King , a black man , during an arrest .
For Mr. Trump , who has made rebuilding the military a cornerstone of his presidency , enlisting the help of rank-and-file troops to help with the crisis may be more complicated .
When the president came into office , 46 % of troops said they had a favorable opinion of him , compared with 37 % who had a negative view .
By December , those numbers had flipped . Just 42 % of troops said they approved of Mr. Trump , while 50 % did not , according to a survey conducted by the Military Times .
Ordering troops into U.S. cities to arrest their neighbors could frustrate men and women of the armed forces , drive approval numbers lower and compromise a key constituency for the president ahead of the November election .
In an extraordinarily personal message , the Air Force ’ s senior enlisted leader posted on social media a meditation on race , the military and his own experiences navigating his way as a black man in both civilian and military life .
“ As I struggle with the Air Force ’ s own demons that include the disparities in military justice and discipline among our young black male airmen and the clear lack of diversity in our senior officer ranks … I can look in the mirror for the solution , ” Kaleth O. Wright , chief master sergeant of the Air Force , said in a Twitter post . “ Do what you think is right for the country , for the community , for your sons , daughters , friends and colleagues — for every black man in this country who could end up like George Floyd . ”
Retired military officials argue that while troops surely would follow through on the president ’ s orders , invoking the Insurrection Act would be a mistake .
“ I don ’ t recommend the president invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty military to Minneapolis [ or any other city ] , but that would be within his authority , ” said retired Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr , now director of the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
“ Federal military forces are put in lots of different situations that may not have been their first choice , ” Mr. Spoehr said . “ I ’ m not sure everyone would have wanted to go to the southern border . … But there was nothing illegal or immoral about that . I ’ d be astonished if any military person was asked to do anything illegal or immoral . ”
Top military leaders have said they would refuse any orders they believe to be illegal or unethical . During his Senate confirmation hearings last year , Gen. Milley pledged that he would “ not be intimidated into making stupid decisions ” as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . He also said he would step down if he was deeply troubled by an order .
“ I think it would be a function of something that was illegal , unethical or immoral . That ’ s what I ’ ve been brought up with since I was 2nd lieutenant , and that would probably be cause for resignation , ” he told lawmakers .","President Trump’s idea to deploy active-duty military forces to quell increasingly violent riots in cities across the country has sparked a sharp legal and constitutional clash.

“We know that Texans can take care of Texas,” Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said in explaining why he won’t ask for active-duty military help.

The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when military personnel helped stem riots in Los Angeles after the acquittal of police officers involved in the beating of Rodney King, a black man, during an arrest.

For Mr. Trump, who has made rebuilding the military a cornerstone of his presidency, enlisting the help of rank-and-file troops to help with the crisis may be more complicated.

When the president came into office, 46% of troops said they had a favorable opinion of him, compared with 37% who had a negative view.

By December, those numbers had flipped. Just 42% of troops said they approved of Mr. Trump, while 50% did not, according to a survey conducted by the Military Times.

Ordering troops into U.S. cities to arrest their neighbors could frustrate men and women of the armed forces, drive approval numbers lower and compromise a key constituency for the president ahead of the November election.

In an extraordinarily personal message, the Air Force’s senior enlisted leader posted on social media a meditation on race, the military and his own experiences navigating his way as a black man in both civilian and military life.

“As I struggle with the Air Force’s own demons that include the disparities in military justice and discipline among our young black male airmen and the clear lack of diversity in our senior officer ranks … I can look in the mirror for the solution,” Kaleth O. Wright, chief master sergeant of the Air Force, said in a Twitter post. “Do what you think is right for the country, for the community, for your sons, daughters, friends and colleagues — for every black man in this country who could end up like George Floyd.”

Retired military officials argue that while troops surely would follow through on the president’s orders, invoking the Insurrection Act would be a mistake.

“I don’t recommend the president invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty military to Minneapolis [or any other city], but that would be within his authority,” said retired Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr, now director of the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

“Federal military forces are put in lots of different situations that may not have been their first choice,” Mr. Spoehr said. “I’m not sure everyone would have wanted to go to the southern border. … But there was nothing illegal or immoral about that. I’d be astonished if any military person was asked to do anything illegal or immoral.”

Top military leaders have said they would refuse any orders they believe to be illegal or unethical. During his Senate confirmation hearings last year, Gen. Milley pledged that he would “not be intimidated into making stupid decisions” as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He also said he would step down if he was deeply troubled by an order.

“I think it would be a function of something that was illegal, unethical or immoral. That’s what I’ve been brought up with since I was 2nd lieutenant, and that would probably be cause for resignation,” he told lawmakers.

The problem is that it ’ s unclear he will actually get one .
On Monday , Trump signed an executive order meant to create the space force , which would be the sixth branch of the US military ( but the White House text of the order doesn ’ t feature a directive to create the space force ) . He then asked Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to oversee the creation of the new service . If it ’ s officially created , the Air Force would likely give up all of its space duties to the space force , including preparing for war in space and protecting US satellites from harm .
“ We have the Air Force , and we ’ re going to have the space force , ” Trump said during a speech from the White House . “ Separate but equal . ”
Trump has long called for the creation of a space force , saying in March that it would be “ like the Army and the Navy , but for space , because we ’ re spending a lot of money on space. ” There was even a congressional push last year that tried to formally create the new service .
But Congress flatly rejected that proposal . In this fiscal year ’ s must-pass defense budget bill , both the House and the Senate decided against a new space force , preferring instead to keep space defense within the Air Force .
That doesn ’ t seem to matter to Trump , since he has now ordered the creation of the space-focused service . It ’ s unclear whether Trump can actually create a military branch out of thin air . But one thing is for sure : He doesn ’ t have much support for it .
A senior congressional source told me that Congress — not the president — would need to authorize a new military service , just like it did in 1947 when it created the Air Force . After all , the Constitution is clear that the Congress has the authority “ to raise and support armies . ”
There ’ s another problem : The Air Force is adamantly against a space force . “ The Pentagon is complicated enough , ” Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters last summer . “ This will make it more complex , add more boxes to the organization chart . ”
Even Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis came out against it . “ I oppose the creation of a new military service and additional organizational layers at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint warfighting efforts , ” Mattis wrote in a letter to congressional defense leaders last October .
Of course , there ’ s nothing stopping Trump from wanting a space force or even ordering its establishment . It ’ s just an open question as to whether there will ever be a space force .
“ [ T ] he near-term practical effect of all this is that the president can direct DoD to come up with a plan and start preparing to create a space force , but he still needs congress to authorize it , ” Todd Harrison , a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank , tweeted on Monday .
There ’ s a good case to make for a space force , though .
“ Space is no longer a peaceful domain , ” Deborah Lee James , the Obama administration ’ s final Air Force secretary , said in an interview last July . “ There is a real possibility that a conflict on Earth could bleed into space . ”
There are two main reasons for that : Russia and China . According to the Defense Intelligence Agency , Russia wants to gain more power in space because it believes gaining supremacy there will allow it to win future fights on this planet . And in late 2015 , China created the Strategic Support Force , which is meant to streamline and improve its space , cyber , and electronic warfare missions .
The two countries are causing problems with anti-satellite technology , too , noted Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last May — meaning they could mess with the satellites that help the US military do its job . The Pentagon is planning to open a space-war center to counter their threats .
Okay , but ... what sort of conflict is actually going on in space ? What are we really talking about ?
Basically , there are tons of military equipment in space , especially satellites . This kind of equipment helps the US , Russia , and China — and any tech-savvy force — navigate terrain and communicate with one another . On top of that , assets in space help to track enemy fighters , take pictures for intelligence services , and even help control missiles . Without space , it would be much harder to fight on Earth ; that ’ s why Russia and China are investing so heavily in it .
But Russia and China aren ’ t space ’ s only threats . The area just outside Earth ’ s orbit has seen an explosion of commercial satellites and other communications equipment since the 1960s , put there first by countries and , as of late , by commercial companies . That equipment is used to help drivers reach their destination , help potential lovers swipe right on dating apps , or simply help people text friends .
The chart below shows the huge growth in these satellites . The blue line represents their total growth since around 1960 .
The internet , of course , adds a new complication to all the equipment that countries are putting in space . Most notably , equipment can potentially be hacked . For instance , a team of hackers could jam a satellite by messing with its signals so it interrupts the satellite ’ s normal activity , rendering it useless . That could cause problems for all sorts of everyday activities , like credit card transactions and phone calls .
Then , of course , there ’ s space debris threatening all of that commercial and military space equipment , since it could knock into the expensive machines . NASA estimates that there are 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth , about 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger , and many millions of pieces that are too small to register .
The idea is that creating a new service will ensure that there ’ s a segment of the military whose entire job is to focus on space 100 percent of the time . That would allow a space force to counter Russia , China , and other threats while giving space-focused staff more bureaucratic power inside the Pentagon .
But Sean O ’ Keefe , a former NASA head and Navy secretary , thinks creating a brand new branch of the military is not the right way to go . “ This is a solution in search of a problem , ” he told me in an interview last summer . Basically , he thinks the Air Force is already doing a fine job protecting space , even if it does privilege earthbound pilots . Creating a space force would just add another layer of bureaucracy to an already massive organization : the Pentagon .
James , the former Air Force secretary , agrees . She thinks dealing with the current complaints about the Air Force and space — 1 ) that it ’ s not well-funded , 2 ) that acquisition takes too long , and 3 ) that there is no one person to call about military space operations — makes more sense .
So clearly the space force has its detractors , not least Defense Secretary Mattis . And of course , Congress has yet to officially mandate its creation .

But as more details have unfolded , the primary controversy in Washington over the weekend revolved around denials by President Trump and his aides that the president was ever briefed on the intelligence .
Trump on Sunday confirmed statements by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and the White House press secretary that he received no briefing on the subject , and he referred in tweets to “ so-called reports ” by “ Fake News . ”
“ Nobody briefed or told me , [ Vice President ] Pence or Chief of Staff [ Mark Meadows ] about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russians , as reported through an ‘ anonymous source ’ by the Fake News . . . Everybody is denying it & there have not been many attacks on us , ” Trump said on Twitter , insisting that “ nobody ’ s been tougher on Russia than the Trump administration . ”
But his Twitter remarks did little to clarify whether the administration was denying that the assessment existed , or simply denying that Trump knew anything about it . Richard Grenell , who served as acting director of national intelligence until last month , tweeted that “ I never heard this . And it ’ s disgusting how you continue to politicize intelligence . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) on Sunday joined other lawmakers — including leading Republicans — in expressing concern and calling for the administration to provide Congress with an explanation .
“ This is as bad as it gets , and yet the president will not confront the Russians on this score , denies being briefed , ” Pelosi said on ABC News ’ s “ This Week . ”
“ But he wants to ignore , ” she said , “ he wants to bring them back to the G-8 despite the annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine , despite what they yielded to [ Putin ] in Syria , despite [ Russian President Vladimir Putin ’ s ] intervention into our election , which is well documented by our intelligence community , and despite now possibly this allegation , which we should have been briefed on . ”
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham ( R-S.C. ) , a Trump ally who golfed with the president Sunday , earlier tweeted that “ I expect the Trump Administration to take such allegations seriously and inform Congress immediately as to the reliability of these news reports . ”
In a second tweet , Graham said it was “ Imperative Congress get to the bottom ” of the Russian offer “ to pay the Taliban to kill American soldiers with the goal of pushing America out of the region . ”
Rep. Liz Cheney ( R-Wyo . ) , the third-highest-ranking member of the House GOP leadership , also took to Twitter on Sunday to say that if the report of Russian bounties “ is true , the White House must explain ” why the president wasn ’ t briefed , who did know and when , and “ what has been done in response to protect our forces & hold Putin responsible . ”
A third person familiar with the issue said that “ I don ’ t think that anybody withheld anything and screwed up by not getting to the president on time. ” Until “ you were absolutely sure of the intelligence and the NSC had drawn up policy options , you weren ’ t going to walk into the Oval Office , ” the person said .
So the issue is not when the president was briefed , the person said , but rather , “ now that you are aware of it , what are you going to do about it ? That ’ s where the focus should be . ”
In years past , there were persistent reports that Russia was supplying small arms to the Taliban . Carter Malkasian , who served as a senior adviser to the previous chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. , said Russia had cultivated a relationship with certain Taliban elements , largely in northern Afghanistan , beginning around 2015 . The outreach was partly as a response to Moscow ’ s concerns about the threat posed by Islamic State militants in the region , and also out of a desire to see U.S. troops leave the region .
But more recently , U.S. officials said that Russia — which tried and failed to start its own Afghan peace process — has been cooperative and helpful since the Taliban signed a peace deal , including a plan for U.S. withdrawal , with the administration early this year .
Malkasian , now a scholar at CNA , said the bounty operation , if true , could be a “ random ” initiative , rather than one that reflected a well-coordinated program ordered by the highest levels of the government .
He said that a primary Russian goal in Afghanistan continues to be the exit of American forces , but not at any cost .","The intelligence was passed up from the U.S. Special Operations forces based in Afghanistan and led to a restricted high-level White House meeting in late March, the people said.

Richard Grenell, who served as acting director of national intelligence until last month, tweeted that “I never heard this. And it’s disgusting how you continue to politicize intelligence.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Sunday joined other lawmakers — including leading Republicans — in expressing concern and calling for the administration to provide Congress with an explanation.

“This is as bad as it gets, and yet the president will not confront the Russians on this score, denies being briefed,” Pelosi said on ABC News’s “This Week.”

“But he wants to ignore,” she said, “he wants to bring them back to the G-8 despite the annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine, despite what they yielded to [Putin] in Syria, despite [Russian President Vladimir Putin’s] intervention into our election, which is well documented by our intelligence community, and despite now possibly this allegation, which we should have been briefed on.”

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally who golfed with the president Sunday, earlier tweeted that “I expect the Trump Administration to take such allegations seriously and inform Congress immediately as to the reliability of these news reports.”

AD

In a second tweet, Graham said it was “Imperative Congress get to the bottom” of the Russian offer “to pay the Taliban to kill American soldiers with the goal of pushing America out of the region.”

AD

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-highest-ranking member of the House GOP leadership, also took to Twitter on Sunday to say that if the report of Russian bounties “is true, the White House must explain” why the president wasn’t briefed, who did know and when, and “what has been done in response to protect our forces & hold Putin responsible.”

A third person familiar with the issue said that “I don’t think that anybody withheld anything and screwed up by not getting to the president on time.” Until “you were absolutely sure of the intelligence and the NSC had drawn up policy options, you weren’t going to walk into the Oval Office,” the person said.

AD

So the issue is not when the president was briefed, the person said, but rather, “now that you are aware of it, what are you going to do about it? That’s where the focus should be.”

AD

In years past, there were persistent reports that Russia was supplying small arms to the Taliban. Carter Malkasian, who served as a senior adviser to the previous chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., said Russia had cultivated a relationship with certain Taliban elements, largely in northern Afghanistan, beginning around 2015. The outreach was partly as a response to Moscow’s concerns about the threat posed by Islamic State militants in the region, and also out of a desire to see U.S. troops leave the region.

But more recently, U.S. officials said that Russia — which tried and failed to start its own Afghan peace process — has been cooperative and helpful since the Taliban signed a peace deal, including a plan for U.S. withdrawal, with the administration early this year.

AD

Malkasian, now a scholar at CNA, said the bounty operation, if true, could be a “random” initiative, rather than one that reflected a well-coordinated program ordered by the highest levels of the government.

He said that a primary Russian goal in Afghanistan continues to be the exit of American forces, but not at any cost.",www.washingtonpost.com,left,zhTHkarIeY6Xwqyn

Flying in a C-17 military cargo jet to preserve the secrecy of the visit to the conflict zone , Pence landed in Erbil to meet with Iraqi Kurdistan President Nechirvan Barzani . The visit was meant to reassure the U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State after Syrian Kurds suffered under a bloody Turkish assault last month following the Trump-ordered withdrawal .

It was Pence ’ s second trip to the region in five weeks after Trump deployed him on whirling trip to Ankara , Turkey , last month to negotiate a cease-fire after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seized on the U.S. withdrawal to launch an assault on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria . Trump ’ s move had sparked some of the most unified criticism of his administration to date , as lawmakers in both parties accused Trump of forsaking longtime Kurdish allies and inviting Russia and Iran to hold even greater sway in the volatile region .
Pence said he welcomes “ the opportunity on behalf of President Donald Trump to reiterate the strong bonds forged in the fires of war between the people of the United States and the Kurdish people across this region . ”
A senior U.S. official said Pence ’ s visit was meant both to reassure Iraqi Kurds who remain allied with the U.S. in the fight against IS , as well as Americans who have long supported the Kurdish cause , that the Trump administration remained committed to the alliance . The visit was also designed to show Pence ’ s focus on foreign policy as Washington is gripped by the drama of impeachment .
When the U.S. forces withdrew , Syria ’ s Kurds — seeking protection from their No . 1 enemy Turkey — invited Syrian government and Russian forces into parts of northeastern Syria where they had not set foot in years .

The Ankara agreement required the Kurds to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border in an arrangement that largely solidified Turkey 's position and aimst .

Pence hailed the cease-fire as the way to end the bloodshed caused by Turkey 's invasion , though he remained silent on whether it amounted to a second abandonment of America 's former Kurdish allies , many of whom are branded as terrorists by Ankara . The deal includes a halt to American economic sanctions and no apparent long-term consequences for Turkey for its actions .
On Nov. 13 , Trump feted Erdogan with a White House visit over the objection of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who argued Erdogan should be denied the honor of a West Wing visit in the aftermath of the invasion and because of his decision to purchase Russian-made surface-to-air missiles over the objection of NATO allies .
Barzani thanked Pence for the U.S. military support in the fight against ISIS , adding that his “ visit at this particular time is an important indication of your continued support to Kurdistan and Iraq . ”

Pence said the U.S. and Kurdish alliance was meant to ensure that IS or another extremist group “ will not be able to gain a foothold in this region again . ”
Pence , joined on the trip by his wife , Karen Pence , also greeted U.S. troops ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday , serving turkey and accompaniments to hundreds of troops at the two locations .

“ Partisan politics and endless investigations have slowed things down in D.C. , ” Pence said .
Pence ’ s visit to Iraq comes as the country has been plagued by widespread anti-corruption protests . At least 320 protesters have been killed and thousands have been wounded since the unrest began on Oct. 1 , when demonstrators took to the streets in Baghdad and across Iraq ’ s mainly Shiite south to decry rampant government malfeasance and a lack of basic services despite Iraq ’ s oil wealth . The protests have exposed long-simmering resentment at Iran ’ s influence in the country , with protesters targeting Shiite political parties and militias with close ties to Tehran .
Pence spoke by phone with Mahdi after the Iraqi leader declined an invitation to meet with Pence at the airbase after security concerns prevented Pence from traveling into Baghdad . U.S .

us_military,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/27/defense-department-to-trump-on-transgender-ban-not-so-fast.html,Defense Department to Trump on transgender ban: Not so fast,2017-07-27,Barnini Chakraborty,"The Department of Defense declared Thursday there will be “ no modifications to the current policy ” on transgender service members for now , a day after President Trump issued a surprise three-tweet directive banning those troops from the military .
In a memo to service chiefs and commanders , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford , Jr. declared no changes to the policy until `` the President ’ s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance '' -- which has not yet happened .
“ In the meantime , we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect , ” Dunford said in the memo obtained by Fox News . “ As importantly , given the current fight and the challenges we face , we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions . ”
Dunford ’ s statement suggests Defense Secretary James Mattis wasn ’ t given any significant heads up on the policy change . Mattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted . Mattis has also been publicly silent amid questions about Trump ’ s announced ban , though the White House said Wednesday that Mattis was `` immediately informed '' of Trump 's decision .
Dunford himself was not aware that Trump was going to announce the ban , a U.S. official said .
Trump ’ s Wednesday morning tweets reversed an Obama-era policy of allowing transgender troops to serve . Trump wrote :
`` After consultation with my Generals and military experts , please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow ... Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military . Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming ... victory and can not be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail . Thank you . ''
TRUMP ANNOUNCES BAN ON TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN THE MILITARY
Trump did not mention Mattis , the retired Marine general who recently told the service chiefs to spend another six months weighing the costs and benefits of allowing transgender individuals to enlist .
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders seemed unable to provide basic details on the rollout of the change on Wednesday , saying the implementation would be worked out `` lawfully . ''
Civil liberty and LGBTQ groups quickly condemned Trump ’ s decision but were left in limbo trying to decipher the tweets . Was Trump enacting new policy or simply saying what he ’ d like to see happen ?
“ If you ’ re a transgender service member anywhere in the world , you are very nervous about what you ’ re hearing , ” former Army Chief Eric Fanning , the first openly gay head of a U.S. military service , told NBC 's `` Today '' show . “ Now you ’ re probably very confused and very frightened about what the future holds for you , when your commander in chief tweets a message like this . ”
GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said the president is “ calling for a witch hunt & purge of 15,000 trans military Americans . ”
Transgender service members have been able to serve openly in the military since last year , when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the prior ban . Some lawmakers including Reps. Steve King , R-Iowa , and Duncan Hunter , R-Calif. , backed the president 's move .
Sanders said Trump made `` a military decision . '' She said it was his judgment that allowing transgender service `` erodes military readiness and unit cohesion . ''
But experts told Fox News that from a legal standpoint , Trump ’ s tweets for now have all the merit of a public service announcement .
In the short term , nothing changes until a policy is drafted or some type of formal modification is made to military regulations . Lawsuits can not be filed , and transgender troops can not be yanked out of service or denied health care benefits .

''","The Department of Defense declared Thursday there will be “no modifications to the current policy” on transgender service members for now, a day after President Trump issued a surprise three-tweet directive banning those troops from the military.

In a memo to service chiefs and commanders, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford, Jr. declared no changes to the policy until ""the President’s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance"" -- which has not yet happened.

“In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,” Dunford said in the memo obtained by Fox News. “As importantly, given the current fight and the challenges we face, we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions.”

Dunford’s statement suggests Defense Secretary James Mattis wasn’t given any significant heads up on the policy change. Mattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted. Mattis has also been publicly silent amid questions about Trump’s announced ban, though the White House said Wednesday that Mattis was ""immediately informed"" of Trump's decision.

Dunford himself was not aware that Trump was going to announce the ban, a U.S. official said.

Trump’s Wednesday morning tweets reversed an Obama-era policy of allowing transgender troops to serve. Trump wrote:

""After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming...victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.""

TRUMP ANNOUNCES BAN ON TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN THE MILITARY

Trump did not mention Mattis, the retired Marine general who recently told the service chiefs to spend another six months weighing the costs and benefits of allowing transgender individuals to enlist.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders seemed unable to provide basic details on the rollout of the change on Wednesday, saying the implementation would be worked out ""lawfully.""

Civil liberty and LGBTQ groups quickly condemned Trump’s decision but were left in limbo trying to decipher the tweets. Was Trump enacting new policy or simply saying what he’d like to see happen?

“If you’re a transgender service member anywhere in the world, you are very nervous about what you’re hearing,” former Army Chief Eric Fanning, the first openly gay head of a U.S. military service, told NBC's ""Today"" show. “Now you’re probably very confused and very frightened about what the future holds for you, when your commander in chief tweets a message like this.”

GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said the president is “calling for a witch hunt & purge of 15,000 trans military Americans.”

Transgender service members have been able to serve openly in the military since last year, when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the prior ban. Some lawmakers including Reps. Steve King, R-Iowa, and Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., backed the president's move.

Sanders said Trump made ""a military decision."" She said it was his judgment that allowing transgender service ""erodes military readiness and unit cohesion.""

But experts told Fox News that from a legal standpoint, Trump’s tweets for now have all the merit of a public service announcement.

In the short term, nothing changes until a policy is drafted or some type of formal modification is made to military regulations. Lawsuits cannot be filed, and transgender troops cannot be yanked out of service or denied health care benefits.

“Until formal guidance is issued, nothing is going to change,” one U.S. defense official told Fox News, adding that tweets don’t count as “formal guidance.”

Separately, the Navy announced it would continue to provide transgender individuals medical treatment.

The Pentagon has not released data on the number of transgender people currently serving. A Rand Corp. study has estimated the number at between 1,320 and 6,630 out of 1.3 million active-duty troops.

The top U.S. military leader made a surprise visit to Iraq on Saturday to assess American and Iraqi efforts to roll back the Islamic State, officials said.

The trip by Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, comes as the U.S. plans to double the number of military advisers in Iraq, and two days after Dempsey suggested to Congress that the Pentagon may consider a modest additional number of U.S. troops to fight alongside Iraqis.

The general's spokesman, Air Force Col. Ed Thomas, said the trip — Dempsey's first since airstrikes against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL, began on Aug. 8 — is designed to get a firsthand look at the situation in Iraq, receive briefings and determine progress of the campaign.

Dempsey also visited with U.S. troops and commanders in Iraq on Saturday, he said. The general had talks with U.S. Ambassador Stuart Jones and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Baghdad before traveling to Erbil, where he met with Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani.

The U.S. and allies are conducting airstrikes against Islamic State positions in Iraq and Syria. The anti-ISIL plan promoted by President Obama and aides also includes training of local forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight on the ground.

Earlier this month, the Obama administration announced it planned to double the number of military advisers, up to around 3,000.

During testimony Thursday before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, Dempsey said Iraqi forces are doing better, but more complex operations may be needed to recapture areas taken by the Islamic State. Iraqi forces did reclaim an oil refinery town near Baghdad this week.

As for troop levels, Dempsey told Congress that the U.S. has a modest force in Iraq now and ""any expansion of that, I think, would be equally modest.""

He added: ""I just don't foresee a circumstance when it would be in our interest to take this fight on ourselves with a large military contingent.""

The votes capped a dramatic debate on Capitol Hill in which lawmakers expressed uncertainty about the Syria vote. The train-and-equip mission is a major plank of the president's plan to defeat the Islamic State. But, as the administration prepares for airstrikes in Syria and expands them in Iraq, lawmakers have raised concerns over whether American troops would be dragged into combat missions and over whether the Syrian rebels the U.S. would train can be trusted.

Overnight , the White House 's official Twitter account released a triumphant video of the moment set to music but omitting any signs of the mayhem unleashed on the protesters .
Trump appeared to be trying to project strength at a moment when his presidency seems feckless and as the nation spins out of control . If it occurred abroad and not in the White House , Americans might perceive a ridiculous self-deluding act of a wanna-be strongman .
`` I thought I was watching a scene from something in Turkey , and not in the United States , '' retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore , who commanded National Guard troops in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper .
And after using St. John 's Church , the `` church of the presidents , '' which had experienced a basement fire during Sunday 's demonstrations , Trump drew immediate criticism from faith leaders , including Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington .
`` The President just used the Bible , our sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition , and one of the churches of my diocese , without permission , as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus , '' Budde said on `` AC360 . ''
Trump 's showmanship was motivated in part by anger at media coverage saying he had sheltered in a bunker below the White House on Friday night amid protests in Washington , CNN 's Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak reported .

His speech and action were already being lauded on Fox News and among prominent conservatives on social media Monday night , in a manner likely to encourage Trump to flex his powers even more .
Yet the fact he ordered US troops against peaceful protesters for a mere photo op shows how far he may be willing to go to use every tool of presidential power in the service of his reelection . That realization alone opens up troubling visions of more democratic guardrails being crushed along the way . The fact that this is an impeached President who feels liberated by his Senate acquittal and has already used presidential power to try to hobble his Democratic opponent , Joe Biden , is cause for even greater alarm .

The President threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 , which according to some interpretations gives him power to send regular troops into the streets to restore law and order .
`` If the city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residence , then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them , '' Trump said .
The act has been invoked several times to bolster local law enforcement , including during the Detroit riots of 1967 and the Rodney King riots in 1992 .
But in Trump 's hands , the act raises the possibility that the commander in chief , protecting his own political interests , could try to send soldiers into states against their will .
It seems like an almost unbelievable prospect , and in Trump 's hands would represent an unprecedented politicization of the military that would be familiar from autocratic nations .
Several governors told CNN on Monday night that Trump has no power under the act to deploy troops without their request .

Earlier , on a day in which he also spoke by phone to a genuine autocratic strongman , Russian President Vladimir Putin , who has used his powers against his own people , Trump had berated governors for being weak and in a conference call demanded that they fully utilize the National Guard to `` dominate '' the streets amid unrest .
While he mentioned Floyd -- who died a week ago in the latest example of police brutality against black Americans -- in his address , it was only in passing in a speech dedicated to fostering the impression of tough guy leadership . He made no attempt to soothe the anger , fear and alienation stalking the nation . Trump , who has a record of racist rhetoric in and out of office , gave little sign he appreciates that black men and women believe that their country , amid some instances of brutal policing , sees their lives as cheap .
The way that Trump 's impulses often outpace the expectations of traditional political behavior was laid bare by the way the day started with calls for him to make a calming Oval Office address . But his press secretary , Kayleigh McEnany , warned that `` a national Oval Office address is not going to stop Antifa . ''
The comment reflected how the White House is billing the crisis as mostly owing to actions of the loosely affiliated group -- and has provided no evidence that it is orchestrating all the protests .
The President 's rhetoric and grandstanding , while they betray an inability to use conventional politics to solve difficult problems , will likely be embraced by his supporters on conservative media and among his base as strong leadership .
It is not hard to see how his propagandists will leap on media criticism of his comments to portray journalists as abetting domestic terrorists who are scornful of the need to protect religion .
Bishop Budde , however , declared that Trump had `` sanctioned the use of tear gas by police officers in riot gear to clear the churchyard .

How Pentagon aims to diversify military brass.,2020-03-17,Anna Mulrine Grobe,"Minority soldiers should be able to “ look upward and see themselves , ” retired Gen. Carter Ham , president of the Association of the U.S. Army , told a Heritage Foundation panel held in January . Right now , he said , the officer corps “ does not look like America . ”
Recent years have been tough on military recruiters in general . But the biggest challenge , which the Pentagon says it is determined to tackle , is the face of military leadership in an increasingly nonwhite nation .
Yet even when African Americans are commissioned , their careers can stall before they approach command posts . Retired Gen. Larry Spencer , former Air Force vice chief of staff , says that black officers can be unintentionally sidelined , in part because senior officials aren ’ t aware of the barriers to diversity in their organizations .
African Americans may be overrepresented in the United States military , but not in the officer corps : Only 9 % of officers are black , compared with 19 % of enlisted troops . To right this imbalance , the Pentagon wants to expand its training programs on historically black college and university campuses . Other paths to improving the pipeline of future military leaders lie in social media campaigns targeted at minority communities .
As a first-generation college student in Texas , George Bolton was hooked on an Army career through the stories of the Buffalo soldiers , the black cavalry units formed in 1866 to serve on the western frontier , becoming icons of African American military service .
Today , Lieutenant Colonel Bolton runs the Reserve Officers ’ Training Corps ( ROTC ) program at the historically black Alabama A & M University outside Huntsville . He often invokes these stories to inspire his students to take on the combat jobs that can in future vault them to the highest echelons of military leadership .
The more leaders of color willing to serve , he says , the better the military becomes . “ When you have people that can bring diversity to the policymakers , then you have a better product for the nation . And that ’ s how you become part of the solution , ” he says .
Judging by the current makeup of the United States military , that solution is still lacking . While African Americans make up nearly 1 in 5 of the enlisted ranks , they comprise only 9 % of officers . Across all minorities , the distribution is similarly lopsided : More than half of all enlisted women , and 43 % of enlisted men , are Hispanic or a racial minority . Yet virtually all U.S. combat brigade commanders – a stepping stone to becoming a general – are white .
The Pentagon is working to change this by using social media campaigns and recruiting potential officers in cities with large minority populations . In January , President Donald Trump announced an initiative to expand ROTC programs on the nation ’ s 102 historically black colleges and universities ( HBCU ) campuses , roughly one quarter of which have them . Among all colleges and universities , more than 1,700 currently host ROTC programs . The White House has not yet provided details of how it will expand onto the campuses .
Minority soldiers should be able to “ look upward and see themselves , ” retired Gen. Carter Ham , president of the Association of the United States Army , told a Heritage Foundation panel held in January on the ties between the military and HBCUs . Right now , he said , the officer corps “ does not look like America . ”
A strong U.S. labor market – at least until the coronavirus-induced economic shock – has made it harder for the U.S. military to replenish all ranks including minority officers . The Army , which is the largest military branch , missed its recruiting target in 2018 for the first time in more than a decade . “ I find that competing with a highly functioning economy forces the military to take a broader look at the populations they ’ re trying to recruit , ” says Nathalie Grogan , an analyst at the Center for a New American Security .
While the South has long supplied a disproportionate number of troops , military services are now focusing on urban areas like Chicago and Detroit . The Pentagon is also trying new recruiting strategies : The Navy targets roughly 20 % of its ads toward “ multicultural and female prospects . ”
For their part , Army leaders have reached out to the 55-strong Congressional Black Caucus , asking lawmakers to beat the drum and sharing data on how few African American military recruits from their districts are on leadership tracks . “ The message is , ‘ If you ’ re serious about advancing the opportunities of your constituents , here ’ s an avenue you ’ re not taking advantage of , ’ ” says General Ham .
Yet once recruiters bring service members of color in , it needs to do a better job keeping them , says Ms. Grogan , noting that midcareer black officers are more likely to leave than their white colleagues . Between the promotion from lieutenant colonel to colonel – a key career marker in the Army – 64 % of black officers chose to leave , compared to 51 % of white officers .
To retain black officers , Pentagon leaders need to be attuned to the ways they are unintentionally sidelined , says retired Gen. Larry Spencer , former Air Force vice chief of staff . “ It doesn ’ t mean that folks at the top are against or have any issues with diversity , but left alone to work itself out , it ’ s complicated , ” he says .
Years ago , for example , General Spencer expressed interest in being the military assistant to the next secretary of the Air Force – a plum assignment . The problem , he was told , was that the leading candidate was African American , and it would look like favoritism for him to choose a black aide . “ White males hire white males all the time . That ’ s still the case . ”
Most students who receive a full scholarship on an ROTC program are obliged to serve for four years after graduation , providing a pipeline for future top leadership .
At HBCUs , ROTC students say they receive the sort of leadership coaching that pushes them to tackle everything from the tyranny of low expectations to the pressure they put on themselves when they ’ re the only nonwhite people in the room . “ I see what works and what doesn ’ t , ” says Mia Robinson , a senior at Howard University who plans to become a military intelligence officer . “ Those people with leadership qualities that work , they go far . I also want to be a good leader for my peers . ”
Among her own mentees , this is vital , she adds . “ I notice that in the event they don ’ t have someone who looks like them , they ’ re not going to feel as comfortable . ”
Yet White House efforts to reach out to potential black recruits come at a time when many African Americans are wary of President Trump , says Katherine Washington-Williams , northeast regional head of the National Association for Black Veterans . “ I used to tell young people , ‘ Join the military , ’ because it ’ s one of the best things I ’ ve ever done . But now I look at our commander in chief , and I ’ m not seeing anything positive . I ’ m a proud American , but where ’ s the love ? ”
Maj. Gen. John Evans , head of U.S. Army Cadet Command , says he ’ s promoted women and officers of color onto his staff and that it ’ s made him a better leader . Their varied experience and backgrounds are particularly important , he says , because he came up in the notoriously white special operations world where , “ through our own fault or not , it was hard to get diversity into the conversation , because there weren ’ t other [ non-white ] officers you could bring in . ”

Carter Ham, president of the Association of the U.S. Army, told a Heritage Foundation panel held in January. Right now, he said, the officer corps “does not look like America.”

Recent years have been tough on military recruiters in general. But the biggest challenge, which the Pentagon says it is determined to tackle, is the face of military leadership in an increasingly nonwhite nation.

Yet even when African Americans are commissioned, their careers can stall before they approach command posts. Retired Gen. Larry Spencer, former Air Force vice chief of staff, says that black officers can be unintentionally sidelined, in part because senior officials aren’t aware of the barriers to diversity in their organizations.

African Americans may be overrepresented in the United States military, but not in the officer corps: Only 9% of officers are black, compared with 19% of enlisted troops. To right this imbalance, the Pentagon wants to expand its training programs on historically black college and university campuses. Other paths to improving the pipeline of future military leaders lie in social media campaigns targeted at minority communities.

As a first-generation college student in Texas, George Bolton was hooked on an Army career through the stories of the Buffalo soldiers, the black cavalry units formed in 1866 to serve on the western frontier, becoming icons of African American military service.

Today, Lieutenant Colonel Bolton runs the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program at the historically black Alabama A&M University outside Huntsville. He often invokes these stories to inspire his students to take on the combat jobs that can in future vault them to the highest echelons of military leadership.

The more leaders of color willing to serve, he says, the better the military becomes. “When you have people that can bring diversity to the policymakers, then you have a better product for the nation. And that’s how you become part of the solution,” he says.

Judging by the current makeup of the United States military, that solution is still lacking. While African Americans make up nearly 1 in 5 of the enlisted ranks, they comprise only 9% of officers. Across all minorities, the distribution is similarly lopsided: More than half of all enlisted women, and 43% of enlisted men, are Hispanic or a racial minority. Yet virtually all U.S. combat brigade commanders – a stepping stone to becoming a general – are white.

The Pentagon is working to change this by using social media campaigns and recruiting potential officers in cities with large minority populations. In January, President Donald Trump announced an initiative to expand ROTC programs on the nation’s 102 historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) campuses, roughly one quarter of which have them. Among all colleges and universities, more than 1,700 currently host ROTC programs. The White House has not yet provided details of how it will expand onto the campuses.

Minority soldiers should be able to “look upward and see themselves,” retired Gen. Carter Ham, president of the Association of the United States Army, told a Heritage Foundation panel held in January on the ties between the military and HBCUs. Right now, he said, the officer corps “does not look like America.”

A strong U.S. labor market – at least until the coronavirus-induced economic shock – has made it harder for the U.S. military to replenish all ranks including minority officers. The Army, which is the largest military branch, missed its recruiting target in 2018 for the first time in more than a decade. “I find that competing with a highly functioning economy forces the military to take a broader look at the populations they’re trying to recruit,” says Nathalie Grogan, an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.

Urban strategy

While the South has long supplied a disproportionate number of troops, military services are now focusing on urban areas like Chicago and Detroit. The Pentagon is also trying new recruiting strategies: The Navy targets roughly 20% of its ads toward “multicultural and female prospects.”

For their part, Army leaders have reached out to the 55-strong Congressional Black Caucus, asking lawmakers to beat the drum and sharing data on how few African American military recruits from their districts are on leadership tracks. “The message is, ‘If you’re serious about advancing the opportunities of your constituents, here’s an avenue you’re not taking advantage of,’” says General Ham.

Yet once recruiters bring service members of color in, it needs to do a better job keeping them, says Ms. Grogan, noting that midcareer black officers are more likely to leave than their white colleagues. Between the promotion from lieutenant colonel to colonel – a key career marker in the Army – 64% of black officers chose to leave, compared to 51% of white officers.

To retain black officers, Pentagon leaders need to be attuned to the ways they are unintentionally sidelined, says retired Gen. Larry Spencer, former Air Force vice chief of staff. “It doesn’t mean that folks at the top are against or have any issues with diversity, but left alone to work itself out, it’s complicated,” he says.

Years ago, for example, General Spencer expressed interest in being the military assistant to the next secretary of the Air Force – a plum assignment. The problem, he was told, was that the leading candidate was African American, and it would look like favoritism for him to choose a black aide. “White males hire white males all the time. That’s still the case.”

Most students who receive a full scholarship on an ROTC program are obliged to serve for four years after graduation, providing a pipeline for future top leadership.

At HBCUs, ROTC students say they receive the sort of leadership coaching that pushes them to tackle everything from the tyranny of low expectations to the pressure they put on themselves when they’re the only nonwhite people in the room. “I see what works and what doesn’t,” says Mia Robinson, a senior at Howard University who plans to become a military intelligence officer. “Those people with leadership qualities that work, they go far. I also want to be a good leader for my peers.”

Among her own mentees, this is vital, she adds. “I notice that in the event they don’t have someone who looks like them, they’re not going to feel as comfortable.”

Barriers to diversity

Yet White House efforts to reach out to potential black recruits come at a time when many African Americans are wary of President Trump, says Katherine Washington-Williams, northeast regional head of the National Association for Black Veterans. “I used to tell young people, ‘Join the military,’ because it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done. But now I look at our commander in chief, and I’m not seeing anything positive. I’m a proud American, but where’s the love?”

Maj. Gen. John Evans, head of U.S. Army Cadet Command, says he’s promoted women and officers of color onto his staff and that it’s made him a better leader. Their varied experience and backgrounds are particularly important, he says, because he came up in the notoriously white special operations world where, “through our own fault or not, it was hard to get diversity into the conversation, because there weren’t other [non-white] officers you could bring in.”

Military officials say that they are increasingly pushing young officers of color into jobs that aren’t their first choice to give them a better shot at career advancement.

In the Army for example, the top generals overwhelmingly come from the fighting fields – infantry, armor, field artillery – known collectively as the “combat arms.” Yet less than 10% of young black officers chose these fields, versus some 25% of white officers, according to the Military Leadership Diversity Commission. “This means that women and minorities have fewer opportunities for advancement and will, therefore, be underrepresented among leadership,” it concluded in a 2011 study.

A new report from the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center—a scientific research division of the Army with a focus on biological and chemical weapons—detailed what the field of cybernetics might look in 2050 . The report , titled Cyborg Soldiers 205 : Human/ Machine Fusion and the Implications for the Future of the DOD , reads like the framework for a dystopian novel set in a near future where injured soldiers are cybernetically enhanced , but come home to an America terrified of cyborgs .
“ The primary objective of this effort was to determine the potential of machines that are physically integrated within the human body to augment and enhance the performance of human beings over the next 30 years , ” the researchers said .
The study identified poor public perception as being a barrier to the mass adoption of cybernetics . Terminator II : Judgement Day poisoned us all against killer robots , much to the military ’ s chagrin .
“ Across popular social and open-source media , literature , and film , the use of machines to enhance the physical condition of the human species has received a distorted and dystopian narrative in the name of entertainment , ” the study said . “ Defense leadership should understand that negative public and social perceptions will need to be overcome , if these technologies are to be fielded . ”
Cyber enhancement is cutting edge technology , and it ’ s hard to predict where it will go over the next three decades . The Pentagon researchers focused on four probable areas of enhancement : super vision , augmented hearing , enhanced muscles , and “ direct neural enhancement of the human brain for two-way data transfer . ”
The Pentagon predicts a world where enhanced soldiers have cybernetically enhanced eyes that allow them to see across the battlefield in different wavelengths , and identify targets in “ dense , urban environments or subterranean megacities that will challenge identification and tracking of targets , ” they said .
The researchers mention what becomes a disturbing theme of the study—many of these enhancements may only occur after a soldier is injured . When working with a delicate area such as the eye , injury may be the only path towards convincing a wounded warrior to receive the surgery , the study notes .
“ Ocular enhancement would be an attractive medical option in situations where the eye tissue has been damaged or destroyed by injury or disease , ” the researchers said . “ It is deemed unlikely that individuals would willingly undergo removal of healthy tissue in an area considered to be sensitive . However , the central and critical role that vision plays in society would likely motivate warfighters who have lost part or all of their vision to voluntarily undergo surgery that would restore or even improve their ability to see . ”
This trend of fixing fallen soldiers with cybernetics continues with optogenetic musculoskeletal control systems . “ The most likely [ use ] would be in the restoration of lost function due to injury of muscles or nerves , ” the study said . “ Musculoskeletal injuries are the second leading cause of lost duty time in the U.S. Armed Forces . ”
To enhance muscles , the Pentagon would enhance weak tissue with a “ network of emplaced subcutaneous sensors that deliver optogenetic stimulation through programmed light pulses , ” the researchers said . Optogenetics stimulates muscle tissue , or even neurons , with light instead of electricity .
“ The optogenetic controller would , in effect , take control of the motions of a warfighter ’ s limbs , thereby allowing a novice ( i.e. , the warfighter ) to perform functions professionally ''
“ The human body would have an array of small optical sensors implanted beneath the skin in the body areas that need to be controlled . These sensors could be manifested as thin optical threads that are placed at regular intervals over critical muscle and nerve bundles and are linked to a central control area designed to stimulate each node only when the muscles below it are needed . ”
According to the study , this could allow wounded soldiers to return to battle with cybernetic muscles that operate better than their meat alone did . It could also allow them to control external tools such as drones and weapons systems not directly attached to their body . Or let someone else control them remotely .
“ The optogenetic controller would , in effect , take control of the motions of a warfighter ’ s limbs , thereby allowing a novice ( i.e. , the warfighter ) to perform functions professionally . ”
Cybernetic ears will both enhance perception and allow soldiers to access new abilities , according to the Pentagon .
The study imagines that future advances won ’ t just improve people ’ s hearing , but also allow for the “ conversion and transmission of these signals to others across distances , ” the study said . In other words , people could use cybernetic ears to access a network of voices and communication only perceptible to them . It ’ s like implanting your smartphone inside your ear , complete with real-time translation features for foreign languages .
Hearing loss is a major problem in the military and , for this reason , the researchers believe selling soldiers on enhanced hearing will be easier than eyes and muscles . However , the researchers feel that upgrading ears will be more invasive and less reversible than other technologies and so they recommend that the Pentagon pursue less invasive approaches . . “ Electrodes that directly interface with neural pathways could be implanted with a minor surgical procedure and potentially , could be removed with minimal adverse effects , ” they said .
The crown jewel of cybernetic enhancement is direct interface between the human brain and machines . The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) has been working on the technology for years . It has already successfully tested “ prosthetic memory chips. ” Even Elon Musk is working on neural implants with the goal of “ [ achieving ] symbiosis with artificial intelligence . ”
The Pentagon ’ s study suggests a future where humans with neural implants are jacked into a matrix that allows them to control machines , have machines control them , and to control each other . “ The enhancement would not simply entail user control of equipment ( brain to machine ) but also transmission to operator ( machine to brain ) and human to human ( command and control dynamics ) to enhance situational awareness as drone , computational analytical , and human information is relayed to the operator , ” it said .
Cybernetically enhanced soldiers could control drones and complicated weapon systems remotely with the power of their mind . The problem is , unlike some of the other technologies discussed , there probably won ’ t be a non-invasive way to achieve symbiosis between soldier and machine .
Because of that , the researchers suggested that neural links be restricted to an elite class of soldier , like the Navy SEALs , who may be amenable “ if they could provide significant improvements in capability , lethality , survivability , and overall battlefield superiority , ” they said .
More frightening than negative public perception of cyborgs , which the report goes into , is the Pentagon ’ s correct assertion that the adoption of technology has outpaced the legal and ethical frameworks that govern society . When a human merges with a machine , should the laws of war still consider it a person or a piece of equipment ?
“ If an enhanced warfighter is caught and captured , does he have the same protections under the Geneva Convention , and will his enhanced status alter the treatment he is likely to receive ? ” researchers asked .
There ’ s also basic questions of national security . Can cyborgs be hacked ? What kind of encryption should be used and will it ever be enough ? Should a soldier returning home surrender their enhancements ? Is it ethical to remove the enhanced muscles that allow a wounded soldier to walk ? What will the short and long term health effects of these technologies be ? Should military cohorts be integrated with cyborg soldiers or do they need their own units ?
The Pentagon doesn ’ t know . No one knows . All anyone knows is that these enhancements , in some form , are coming . They may not look exactly like what the Pentagon predicts here , but powerful people want them to happen . Billionaires want them to happen . The U.S. Military wants them to happen . The sad truth is that most moral , ethical , and legal considerations will likely be defined after the fact .

Former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran 13 years ago, has died in custody there, according to statement from his family.

""It is impossible to describe our pain,"" the family said, adding that his death appeared to have occurred before the coronavirus pandemic.

Levinson, the longest-held hostage in US history, disappeared in 2007 on the Iranian island of Kish.

His family say he was working on behalf of an unauthorised CIA mission.

He retired from the FBI in 1998, but had been working in Kish as a private investigator, looking at cigarette counterfeiting in the region, his wife says.

US officials suspected he was kidnapped by Iranian intelligence forces to be used as a bargaining chip in dealings with Washington.

What did President Trump say?

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday at the White House: ""I've been very much involved in that and he was a great gentleman and a great family.

""It's not looking good, he wasn't well for years in Iran, it's not looking promising.""

The president added: ""But Robert Levinson, who was outstanding, has been sick for a long time. He had some rough problems prior to his detainment or capture.

""It's not looking great, but I won't accept that he's dead. They haven't told us he's dead.""

In November, Mr Trump tweeted calling for Iran to turn over Levinson.

What did the family say?

The Levinson family statement on Wednesday said they had recently received information from US officials that had led them to conclude he had died in Iranian custody.

""It is impossible to describe our pain,"" they said.

""Our family will spend the rest of our lives without the most amazing man we have ever known, a new reality that is inconceivable to us.

""His grandchildren will never meet him. They will only know him through the stories we tell them.

""If not for the cruel, heartless actions of the Iranian regime, Robert Levinson would be alive and home with us today.""

When was the hostage last seen alive?

The family, of Coral Springs, Florida, received proof-of-life photos and a video in 2010 and 2011, though his whereabouts were unknown.

Photographs emerged of him bearded and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, similar to those worn by US detainees in Guantanamo Bay.

Around his neck hung signs, one of which said, ""why you cannot help me"".

Experts determined the video had been sent through Pakistan, while the photos were sent from an internet address in Afghanistan.

Pashtun wedding music could be heard playing faintly in the background of the video, suggesting Mr Levinson could be held in either of those two countries.

Another theory of US officials was that the Iranian government could have routed the images externally in an effort to blame Mr Levinson's disappearance on someone else.",www.bbc.com,center,7Hb3OOCnp24veGRA
