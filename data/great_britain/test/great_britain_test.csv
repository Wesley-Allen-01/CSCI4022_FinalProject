Goldstone, Eugene Rumer","Andrew Connelly ( @ connellyandrew ) is a freelance journalist covering political developments in the UK and Europe .
GLASGOW — Independence seems to be the must-have political accessory of 2014 . Pro-Russian separatists and Kyiv loyalists scorch the land amid bloody battles for control of eastern Ukraine , the so-called Islamic State continues to metastasize across Iraq and Syria , and both Israelis and Palestinians sift through the rubble after yet another orgy of death and destruction fought in the name of aspirant statehood .
Here in Scotland we are about to embark on a non-violent variant of this issue , with voting on a referendum over independence to be held on Sept. 18 . But Scotland ’ s democratic experiment is happening at a time of such immense volatility on the world stage that one wonders : What will be the global repercussions of a new , albeit vastly more peaceful , breakaway state ?
Despite obvious differences in scale and approach , Russian President Vladimir Putin and Alex Salmond , the first minister of Scotland and leader of the pro-secession Scottish National Party , share a similar rebel status : reveling in the scorn of the mainstream over their extreme actions , dismissing critics as discredited outsiders ill-equipped to judge their societies and , lately , a devil-may-care habit of concocting policy on the hoof when backed into a corner . Neither man is averse to throwing chunks of historical red meat to the crowd in order to whip up sentiment—the original impulse in Scottish National Party circles was to stage this referendum on June 23 , which is notable for being the 700 th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn , Scotland ’ s most famous battle with the English ( and one of the very few that it actually won ) .
Salmond has even batted his eyes at the Kremlin strongman in recent months . Though not in the habit of posing bare-chested and flexing a bicep atop a Highland cow ( much to the relief of Scots ) , he said back in March—when Russia was orchestrating its own referendum in Crimea—that Putin was admirable for having “ restored national pride ” for Russians . The first minister also frequently waxes lyrical about an independent Scotland building political and trade alliances with Nordic neighbors like Norway and Iceland , and departing from the United Kingdom ’ s “ Southern bias ” of commercial ties with Western Europe and the Commonwealth . Putin might cast an approving eye on this strategy as he attempts to return post-Soviet Central Asian republics to Russia ’ s political and economic orbit under the awkward “ Eurasian Union ” banner—a protection racket in all but name .
Both leaders also share the dubious honor of hosting on their territory enough weapons to annihilate the planet several times over . Russia ’ s stockpile of over 8,000 warheads dwarfs that of the United Kingdom ’ s , estimated to be in the region of 225 , but both countries have launch capability of mere minutes in the doomsday scenario . Relaxing at a recent patriotic youth camp Q & A last month , Putin casually remarked , “ Thank God , I think no one is thinking of unleashing a large-scale conflict with Russia . I want to remind you that Russia is one of the leading nuclear powers. ” Having a Russian , or indeed any even mildly malevolent world leader , remind you of their nuclear weapons is far from heartening . Thankfully in contrast , the Scottish National Party 's policy is for the naval base located on the River Clyde at Faslane , which hosts the UK ’ s permanently roaming nuclear submarines , to be scrapped . Cynical Scots wonder if that promise will actually stand or whether retaining the nukes will be used as a bargaining chip to gain future concessions from Westminster .
Like Putin , the Scottish leader also finds himself in a bitter and uncompromising stalemate with the British government . Instead of war , the topic is money , specifically what money Scotland will use . After years of flirting with euro membership , Salmond now proposes a “ currency union ” where Scotland could use the British pound , a move completely rejected by Westminster on the grounds that it would have to act as Scotland ’ s last lender of resort in a crisis . Salmond counters that if the UK does not subscribe to the currency union , then Scotland will unilaterally use the pound anyway and refuse to shoulder its share of the national debt . London has not doled out sanctions to Edinburgh as it has to Moscow , but this game of political playground hair-pulling is having ominous economic consequences , roiling the markets . Some Scottish banks are already talking of moving some operations to England in the event of a “ yes ” vote .
In the final analysis , however , Putin should not be too eager to see the lid pop open on the Scottish independence jack-in-the-box . Despite the Russian leader ’ s newfound taste for separatist referenda as seen in Crimea and Donetsk , these examples follow a Kremlin-produced script and , despite undoubted pro-Russian sentiment in these regions , the exercises hardly conformed to any meaningful democratic standards , if the polling stations festooned with camouflaged gunmen are anything to go by . True , after experiencing the disintegration of the Soviet Union—what he once called “ the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century ” —Putin may want to gloat and smirk at Downing Street in the event of a Scottish “ yes ” vote . And if it is correct , as many in eastern Europe suspect , that Putin seeks to build his new Russian empire by “ enfranchising ” Russian-speaking separatists in other countries like Moldova , he could well decide to invoke a vote in favor of Scottish independence as a precedent for his own purposes .
But Putin has built his entire political persona on keeping Russia intact , starting with the war he launched in Chechnya—and that probably puts him more in British Prime Minister David Cameron ’ s camp strategically than Salmond ’ s . The Russian president hinted at his views in June in an interview with the BBC in January—prior to his intervention in Ukraine—when he said : “ I believe that one should not forget that being part of a single strong state has some advantages and one should not overlook this . ”
It is also hard to imagine that Putin would or even could use Scotland as an example in the present crisis in Ukraine—that is , to back up his case for autonomy for the eastern part of the country . Putin appears to be more in favor of a Bosnia-style federation for Ukraine to strengthen and formalize Russian-speaking regions and therefore permanently block Ukraine ’ s aspirations to European Union and NATO membership . Moreover , it is unlikely that Moscow would be so encouraging to Scotland if Russia ’ s more restive , Muslim regions in the Southern Caucasus began to show more desire to leave , as anyone who lived through the Chechen wars will testify .
What of the Scottish referendum ’ s influence in other , more separatist-minded corners of Europe ? The most bitterly ironic example can be found in the Catalonia region of Spain , a region that fits one definition of a nation being defined by a common language – more than half the population speaks Catalan , compared with Scotland where only a minority speak Scottish Gaelic . While the Scots remain divided 50-50 on the question of secession , the streets of Barcelona have recently seen mass rallies of up to a million people screaming for a vote , something that the Spanish government consistently denounces as illegal and unconstitutional , with the Spanish prime minister darkly intoning that if the region were to become independent , Spain would block any attempts for it to join the EU . Here ’ s the irony , though : Cameron sanctioned a referendum in Scotland because he thought it wouldn ’ t be successful ; Madrid denies Catalonia a referendum because they know it would be .
Another country rattled by the separatist clamor from Edinburgh is Belgium , which despite hosting the European Parliament on its territory is paralyzed by its own internecine politics . Thanks to a revived pro-independence movement , the issue of the majority Dutch-speaking northern region of Flanders breaking away from their French-speaking countrymen in Wallonia is once again on the table . The Walloons fear such talk , not so much out of fraternal affection but more because the exit of the significantly more prosperous Dutch province would render the rump Belgian state financially embarrassed . The friction also emanates from the Flemish traditionally leaning more to the right than the French-speaking liberals in Belgium . That makes it more difficult for the Walloons ’ political preferences to be represented nationally—a complaint they share with the more Socialist-leaning Scots , who resent London ’ s years of conservative dominance .
Even within the UK ’ s own borders , some restive regions are using the Scottish drive to cough loudly at the back of the room and get the teacher ’ s attention . Teetering off England ’ s south coast , the impoverished region of Cornwall , famous for meat-filled pastries , ice cream and stunning landscape , has long vocalized its cultural and linguistic pride ( Cornish is also a Celtic language ) and even managed this year to gain national minority status .
Similarly , the northeast of England , a region still emerging from its post-industrial shadow , currently looks across the border and sees people in Scotland enjoy the fruits of free universities , free prescriptions and free care for the elderly—none of which they have—and wonders if a drive for more autonomy could bring more riches . And we haven ’ t even mentioned Wales or Northern Ireland yet . The main point is that whether Scotland votes “ aye ” or “ naw , ” these pint-sized regional independence movements are gaining traction thanks to the Scottish example and the widespread knowledge that London has a reputation of swallowing the best jobs , salaries and investment in the country and letting the rest of the country rot .
The referendum will also have the fringe benefit of shaking up the lethargic Westminster status quo . As the reigning prime minister and head of the Conservative and Unionist Party— to use its full name—David Cameron obviously has more than enough reasons to fight for a no vote that go far beyond ideological . To his credit , Cameron has until late said very little on the topic , knowing that to some Scottish ears the mere sound of his Eton-inflected tones is enough to conjure up images of a 19th-century English lord berating an overexcited ghillie on a Highland hunt . This was at least the case until the beginning of this week when an influential poll revealed for the first time that the “ yes ” campaign had climbed a few percentage points higher than the unionists , leading Cameron to pen a mawkish diatribe in the Scottish Daily Mail telling Scotland that it and rUK ( rest of the UK , working title ) are “ better off together. ” More and more , Cameron sounds like a needy boyfriend facing a break-up than a senior statesman rallying the country .
Political commentators speculate whether Cameron would survive a Scottish “ yes ” vote . The party ’ s electoral makeup wouldn ’ t suffer ( Scotland has precisely double the amount of giant pandas as Conservative MPs ) , but who wants to be the prime minister who lost a third of the nation ’ s territory and 8 percent of its population ? It is debatable whether that would be a resigning issue on its own , though he could risk being defenestrated anyway as harrumphing backbench right-wingers use the result as an excuse to remove a leader they consider to be too pro-European Union .
Add to all this a continent increasingly running into the arms of the far right , and the stage is set for a bumpy ride across a far greater landscape than Scotland . More than ever , the European Parliament is populated by a dyspeptic rag-tag rabble of nationalists , populists and outright fascists . Following the EU parliamentary elections in May , Germany let the team down by electing a neo-Nazi candidate ( who now cutely sits on the parliament ’ s “ civil liberties ” committee ) , Italy went dynastical and brought in Benito Mussolini ’ s great-grand daughter and France completely lost the plot by elevating the far-right Front National to be the country ’ s largest political party represented in Europe . These eruptions are frequent , the mutant marriage of an electorate generally uninformed on the workings of EU and populations that have suffered from years of post-crisis austerity measures and are thus willing to give incumbent governments a bloody nose . Nevertheless , it presents a worrying situation : A vote for Scottish independence could embolden other , less savory nationalist movements across Europe .
Traditionally the average British citizen has also been woefully uninformed about the workings of the supranational entity “ on the continent ” that partially governs them , although the meteoric rise of a euroskeptic populist party has harnessed this ignorance and transformed it into political action . In the most recent EU elections , the United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) came out on top , gaining 24 seats , more than any other party . It was a stunning victory for a group most Britons considered to be a glorified band of disaffected golfing barflies with a romanticized image of a vanquished old Britain and some unenlightened views on foreigners ; now it may soon even gain its first national MP . Its oleaginous leader , Nigel Farage , has managed to convince a sizeable chunk of British society that the country they hold dear is no longer in control of its own destiny but instead at the mercy of sinister EU bureaucrats in Brussels who wish to ban fun and flood the country with job-stealing immigrants .

""I do so with no ill will but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love,"" May said, with her husband, Philip, looking on.

May, once a reluctant supporter of EU membership, who won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, steps down with her central pledges - to lead the United Kingdom out of the bloc and heal its divisions - unfulfilled.

""It is, and will always remain, a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit,"" May said, adding that her successor would have to find a consensus to honor the 2016 referendum result.

PM BORIS JOHNSON?

May bequeaths a deeply divided country and a political elite that is deadlocked over how, when or whether to leave the EU.

The leading contenders to succeed May all want a tougher divorce deal, although the EU has said it will not renegotiate the Withdrawal Treaty it sealed in November.

Sterling reversed initial gains it made on May's resignation.

Boris Johnson, the face of the official Brexit campaign in 2016, is the favorite to succeed May. Betting markets put a 40% implied probability on Johnson winning the top job.

Others tipped by betting markets are Dominic Raab, a Brexit supporter and former Brexit secretary, with a 14% implied probability on his chances.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt each have a 7% probability, according to betting markets.

Defense Secretary Penny Mordaunt and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart each have a 4% chance of the top job while Home Secretary (interior minister) Sajid Javid has a 3% chance.",www.newsmax.com,right,nKORiPctJqTNuszj

Mr. Trump said he cheered the country ’ s 2016 vote to withdraw from the European Union and that seeing it through would clear the way for a “ phenomenal ” trade deal between the U.K. and U.S .
“ I would think that it will happen , and it probably should happen , ” he said in a joint press conference with Mrs. May . “ This is a great , great country , and it wants its own identity , it wants to have its own borders . It wants to run its own affairs . ”
Mrs. May , who is stepping down Friday , said she still wants to see an orderly transition out of the European Union , though it will be up to her successor to accomplish it after she ran into a quagmire .
“ I think the important thing is we deliver Brexit , ” she said . “ And once we ’ re out of the European Union , we will be able to do what we ’ ve been talking about today and develop not just that free trade agreement , but a broader economic partnership into the future . ”
The president and prime minister met a day after Mr. Trump ’ s big-pageantry arrival , which including a state dinner with Queen Elizabeth II .
Protesters could be heard in the background as Mr. Trump and Mrs. May made a brief walk from No . 10 Downing St. to the Foreign Office for their press conference .
Mr. Trump downplayed the extent of the public uproar . He said he didn ’ t see many protesters , so the coverage amounted to “ fake news , ” even as The Associated Press and other outlets reported that thousands took to the streets and depicted Mr. Trump as a big baby or a tyrant on a toilet .
The president instead said he wanted to focus on positive relations . He said there is “ tremendous potential ” for both countries if Mrs. May ’ s successor can pull the nation out of the EU .
“ The United States is committed to a phenomenal trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. , ” he said .
Thirteen candidates are seeking to replace Mrs. May . Conservative front-runner Boris Johnson and Brexit Party founder Nigel Farage are pushing for the U.K. to leave the EU without a deal Oct. 31 .
Mr. Trump didn ’ t wade too far into the prime minister race , though he praised Mr. Johnson and Jeremy Hunt , Britain ’ s foreign minister .
“ I know Boris . I like him . I ’ ve liked him for a long time , ” Mr. Trump said . “ I think he ’ d do a very good job . ”
“ I know Jeremy . I think he ’ d do a very good job , ” he added .
Later Tuesday , Mr. Trump met with Mr. Farage at Winfield House , the U.S. ambassador ’ s residence where the Trumps are staying during their visit .
“ Good meeting with President Trump – he really believes in Brexit and is loving his trip to London , ” Mr. Farage tweeted .
Responding to reporters , Mr. Trump didn ’ t shy away from his blistering critique of Sadiq Khan , the London mayor who castigated the British government for rolling out the red carpet for the U.S. leader .
“ I think he ’ s been a not very good mayor , from what I understand , ” Mr. Trump said .
The president said Mr. Khan should not speak poorly of a “ representative of the United States ” who can help the U.K .
Likewise , he declined to meet with Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn . He said he didn ’ t see an upside in sitting down with a “ negative force . ”
“ I really don ’ t like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done , ” the president said .
Mrs. May ascended to the prime minister ’ s job in 2016 in the wake of the shock vote in favor of Brexit . Then-Prime Minister David Cameron opposed leaving the union , and when the referendum passed he said it made sense to have a supporter at the helm .
Mrs. May , though , has had no success in working out details of the exit from the EU .
Mr. Trump , who had been critical of Mrs. May ’ s approach , paid tribute to her Tuesday . He said the prime minister is a good negotiator and deserves a “ lot of credit ” for her work in trying to fashion an orderly Brexit .
Mrs. May said that behind closed doors , she pressed Mr. Trump on climate change and his decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal , a move the U.K. opposed .
“ I ’ ve always talked honestly with you , Donald , when we ’ ve taken a different approach — and you ’ ve done the same with me , ” she said .
She praised Mr. Trump ’ s push to get European partners to pony up more money for their security .
“ They have no choice . They must fulfill their obligations , ” Mr. Trump said .","President Trump says Brexit should and will happen, leaning into the politics of the United Kingdom on Tuesday by scolding liberal Britons as negative Nellies, dismissing London protests against his visit and confabbing with one of the men who could replace Prime Minister Theresa May.

“I know Jeremy. I think he’d do a very good job,” he added.

Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump met with Mr. Farage at Winfield House, the U.S. ambassador’s residence where the Trumps are staying during their visit.

“Good meeting with President Trump – he really believes in Brexit and is loving his trip to London,” Mr. Farage tweeted.

Responding to reporters, Mr. Trump didn’t shy away from his blistering critique of Sadiq Khan, the London mayor who castigated the British government for rolling out the red carpet for the U.S. leader.

“I think he’s been a not very good mayor, from what I understand,” Mr. Trump said.

The president said Mr. Khan should not speak poorly of a “representative of the United States” who can help the U.K.

“He should be positive, not negative,” Mr. Trump said.

Likewise, he declined to meet with Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. He said he didn’t see an upside in sitting down with a “negative force.”

“I really don’t like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done,” the president said.

Mrs. May ascended to the prime minister’s job in 2016 in the wake of the shock vote in favor of Brexit. Then-Prime Minister David Cameron opposed leaving the union, and when the referendum passed he said it made sense to have a supporter at the helm.

Mrs. May, though, has had no success in working out details of the exit from the EU.

Mr. Trump, who had been critical of Mrs. May’s approach, paid tribute to her Tuesday. He said the prime minister is a good negotiator and deserves a “lot of credit” for her work in trying to fashion an orderly Brexit.

Mrs. May said that behind closed doors, she pressed Mr. Trump on climate change and his decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, a move the U.K. opposed.

“I’ve always talked honestly with you, Donald, when we’ve taken a different approach — and you’ve done the same with me,” she said.

She praised Mr. Trump’s push to get European partners to pony up more money for their security.

“They have no choice. They must fulfill their obligations,” Mr. Trump said.

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46971390,"Delaying Brexit won't solve anything, Theresa May tells MPs",,,"Jacob Rees-Mogg says he believes Theresa May 's Brexit deal could be `` reformed '' to win round opponents .
The Brexiteer - one of 118 Tory MPs who voted against the deal last week - said he had more optimism that `` things were going our way '' .
But he said as long as the Northern Ireland `` backstop '' was part of the deal he would not vote for it .
The EU 's negotiator Michel Barnier said there were currently only two Brexit options - the PM 's deal or no deal .
And he warned that even if MPs decided to take no deal off the table , it would not stop it from happening unless there was `` a positive majority for another solution '' .
Under current law , the UK will exit the EU on 29 March , whether or not a deal has been struck . The decision to leave was taken by 52 % to 48 % in a referendum in June 2016 .
The backstop element of Mrs May 's deal seeks to keep a border open between Northern Ireland and Ireland with no checks on people or goods regardless of what deal is signed . But critics say it keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU and separate from the rest of the UK - and that the UK would be permanently trapped in it .
MPs - many of whom oppose a no deal Brexit - are proposing alternative plans to the PM 's deal with the EU , including seeking an extension to the UK 's exit date . The UK is currently scheduled to leave at 23:00 GMT on 29 March .
The other 27 EU member states would need to agree such an extension .
Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that the government could use `` prorogation '' - a procedure to shut down Parliament - to stop any backbench bills trying to delay the UK 's departure .
The constitutional move would involve the agreement of the Queen to bring the current session of Parliament to an end early and Mr Rees-Mogg called it the `` government 's backstop '' to ensuring Brexit went ahead .
But Mrs May has said the `` right way '' to ensure Brexit , and rule out no-deal , was to approve her withdrawal agreement .
At Prime Minister 's Questions , she told MPs delaying Brexit would not `` solve the situation '' , adding : `` The decision remains the same - the deal , no-deal or no Brexit . ''
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused her of having a `` closed mind '' to other Brexit options - such his party 's plan for a customs union with the EU - which he believes a majority of MPs could get behind .
He also repeated his call for the PM to rule out no deal .
But Mrs May attacked the Labour leader for refusing to take part in cross-party talks with her on the way forward and accused him of not understanding his own policy and its `` implications '' for UK trade .
The PM met the Scottish and Welsh first ministers for talks on the next steps for Brexit on Wednesday afternoon .
But speaking after the meeting in Downing Street , Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said there was `` no real sign of any willingness to compromise '' .
Ms Sturgeon , who wants to seek an extension to Article 50 - the mechanism that sees the UK leave the EU on 29 March - said : `` There was n't much indication that the prime minister is listening to , or hearing the concerns of people in Scotland , and no doubt across the UK , about trade , the economy and population .
`` It seems to me that her priority is trying to win support from the DUP and the hard-line Brexiteers in her party , rather than genuinely trying to compromise to bring others on side , and that strikes me as a course of action that is destined to fail . ''
Wales ' First Minister , Mark Drakeford , said the prime minister `` repeated many of her red lines '' during his meeting at No 10 .
He said that if the House of Commons remained deadlocked , then `` going back to the people will have to be the way forward '' and `` a prosperous future for Wales is secured by continuing membership of the EU '' .
Mr Rees-Mogg - who is the chairman of the pro-Leave European Research Group - gave a speech in Westminster on Wednesday saying he wanted a deal , but could not vote for Mrs May 's plan while the backstop was in place .
`` Everybody wants a deal ; the prime minister wants a deal , the EU wants a deal and the Irish wants a deal , '' he said .
`` And if the only way to get it is by re-opening the text ( of the withdrawal agreement ) , that is what they will have to do . ''
After leaving Downing Street after a meeting with the government 's chief whip , former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said : `` There is every chance that if the UK now negotiates with conviction and if we really mean it this time we can secure the changes that we need . ''
The prime minister 's supporters say they believe some opponents of Mrs May 's deal are now willing to consider backing it because of the moves by other MPs to delay Brexit .
Neither Jacob Rees-Mogg nor Boris Johnson are ready to say they will back Theresa May 's deal ( and I do n't suppose either of them have much in common with the Gallagher brothers either ) .
But after weeks of behaving as if the prime minister 's compromise agreement with the EU is a heinous political crime about to be inflicted on the country , they are singing a rather different tune .
Yes , they are explicit . They absolutely do not want to accept the controversial backstop for reasons we 've discussed here more times than I care to remember .
But the band of Brexiteers are talking now about the possibility of being able to back the deal .
Not on the Irish backstop - chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU would not be willing to put a time limit on it .
But he said the backstop was not the `` central issue '' and the debate was now about the future shape of the UK 's relationship with the EU , after it leaves with a deal .
`` We 're cooperating with the British government . Things could start moving rapidly , '' Mr Barnier told The Luxembourg Times .
`` We are ready to be more ambitious if the British decide to shift their red lines , for example by remaining in a customs union , or participating in the single market . I believe there is a readiness in London for that . ''
Speaking later , Mr Barnier said there appeared to be a majority in the House of Commons to oppose a no-deal `` but opposing no-deal will not stop no deal from happening at the end of March ... a positive majority for another solution will need to emerge '' .
German Economic Minister Peter Altmeir said a no deal should be avoided at all costs , and that if it meant extending UK membership of the EU beyond 29 March , Germany would be supportive , adding : `` It would certainly be considered seriously . ''
Next Tuesday MPs will get to vote on Theresa May 's way forward on Brexit , after rejecting her initial plan by a record-breaking 230 votes last Tuesday .
Mrs May is hoping to tweak the deal to address concerns about the Northern Irish `` backstop '' among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland 's Democratic Unionist Party , which she relies on to keep her in power .
But MPs are attempting to take control of the Brexit process by tabling amendments to Mrs May 's plans .
Labour MP Yvette Cooper has tabled an amendment that would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February .
It has been backed by several Remainer Conservatives and is the only amendment that would be legally binding on the government , if passed .
Other amendments would ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline or set up a `` Citizens ' Assembly '' to give the public more say .
Another proposal seeks to win over some opponents of the prime minister 's deal by insisting on `` an expiry date to the backstop '' , the `` insurance policy '' intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland .
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC 's Newsnight that it was `` highly likely '' the party would back Yvette Cooper 's amendment , which would significantly increase its chances of getting through .
International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said delaying or cancelling Brexit with such amendments would be a `` calamitous '' breach of trust with the electorate and worse than leaving the EU with no deal , accusing those of pushing for a delay of actually wanting to stop Brexit .
But Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry said it was `` not true '' that Tory MPs backing the move wanted to stop Brexit as they had voted for Mrs May 's deal . Her colleague , Nick Boles , said Mr Fox had `` never been very good at detail '' .
What 's the latest on the backstop - and what is it ?
The backstop is a position of last resort , designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland whatever arrangement the UK and the EU end up with .
At present , goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions because the UK and Ireland are both part of the EU single market and customs union , so products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards .
But , after Brexit , all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes , which could mean products being checked at the border . Both the UK and the EU worry that having a visible border could put the peace process at risk .
The backstop is opposed by some Conservative MPs and Northern Ireland 's Democratic Unionist Party because it could mean keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely and having different rules for different parts of the UK .
But the Taoiseach ( Irish prime minister ) Leo Varadkar said he could not give up the formal guarantee of the backstop `` for a promise that it will be all right on the night '' .
The European Commission also warned that it was `` obvious '' that a no-deal Brexit would mean a hard border in Ireland .","Image copyright EPA

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Britain’s general election was supposed to be unwinnable. The contest was reckoned—by pundits, pollsters and voters alike —to be a matter of determining which of David Cameron and Ed Miliband would fare less badly. Reality disagreed.

David Cameron’s Conservative party has not just been returned to power, it has confounded expectations by winning an overall majority in the House of Commons. With 331 seats, Cameron will no longer need to rely upon the Liberal Democrats or any other junior coalition partner. It is a stunning result.

Story Continued Below

For Labour, who finished with 232 seats on 30 percent of the vote, this is a calamitous result. Just 48 hours ago, Miliband had reason to think he might be Prime Minister. The polls suggested that he could win 35 percent of the votes cast and that, though the Conservatives might be the largest party in a hung parliament, it would be easier for Labour to form some kind of coalition administration than it would be for the Tories. There would, thanks in large part to the rise of the Scottish National Party, be an anti-tory majority at Westminster. Now Miliband has presided over Labour’s worst result since 1983, when the party’s platform was memorably dubbed—by Gerald Kaufman, one of its own stalwart MPs—“the longest suicide note in political history.”

In the end, it came down to credibility. That’s a quality that’s hard to measure but easy to feel and, in the end, Miliband didn’t have enough of it. For a long while it looked as though voters’ doubts about his aptitude or suitability for high office had been priced in to the opinion polls; that turned out to be a mistaken assumption.

Not that the carnage was limited to Labour. Three party leaders resigned on Friday. Miliband confirmed that his time was up. So did Nick Clegg, until this campaign the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The Liberal Democrats suffered grievously, abandoned by their own voters for the crime of daring to go into power with the Conservatives. They have been left with only 8 MPs.

And Nigel Farage, the puckish, populist leader of UK Independence Party also took his leave having failed in his bid to win the seat of South Thanet. Though UKIP won almost four million votes, it took just a single seat as it failed to make the breakthroughs it had hoped for. The party had to settle for a raft of second place finishes, including in many Labour seats in northern England.

UKIP’s vote, plus the more than one million won by the Green party, were a reminder that this was, despite Cameron’s triumph, very much an outsider’s election. Millions of Britons voiced their dissatisfaction with a political system many consider broken. It was a kind of repudiation that should prompt some humility even in these first hours of Cameron’s surprising victory.

Doubts about Labour’s capacity to steer the British economy to sunnier climes proved telling. Miliband never fully came to terms with the economic calamity over which his party had presided in 2008. The financial crisis might not have been caused by decisions Labour made in office, but many voters were, at the very least, persuaded that Labour’s actions exacerbated the problem. More to the point, they did not believe Labour had atoned sufficiently for its past errors.

Meanwhile, Cameron was able to boast that Britain, by the emaciated standards of the G7, has enjoyed relatively healthy economic growth. His “long-term economic plan” involving public spending restraint might have been painful—not least when measured in terms of living standards and stagnant wages—but unemployment has been reduced, inflation remains all but non-existent and interest rates are at historic lows. In such circumstances, Cameron seemed the less risky option even if further spending cuts will be required in this parliament if Britain’s books are to be balanced and its debt-to-GDP ratio reduced.

If Cameron’s victory was one large story on a night of shocks, it was matched by the stunning result in Scotland that may yet prove more important and influential than anything that happened in other parts of the United Kingdom.

The SNP won 56 of Scotland’s 59 constituencies and the future of the UK, which Cameron claims was “settled” by last year’s referendum on Scottish independence is now once again in doubt.

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52192604,Coronavirus: Boris Johnson moved to intensive care as symptoms worsen,,,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to intensive care in hospital after his coronavirus symptoms `` worsened '' , Downing Street has said .
A spokesman said he was moved on the advice of his medical team and was receiving `` excellent care '' .
Mr Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise `` where necessary '' , the spokesman added .
The prime minister , 55 , was admitted to hospital in London with `` persistent symptoms '' on Sunday evening .
The Queen has been kept informed about Mr Johnson 's health by No 10 , according to Buckingham Palace .
BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the prime minister was given oxygen late on Monday afternoon , before being taken to intensive care .
A No 10 statement read : `` The prime minister has been under the care of doctors at St Thomas ' Hospital , in London , after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus .
`` Over the course of [ Monday ] afternoon , the condition of the prime minister has worsened and , on the advice of his medical team , he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital . ''
It continued : `` The PM is receiving excellent care , and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication . ''
Mr Raab - who will later chair the government 's daily Covid-19 meeting - said there was an `` incredibly strong team spirit '' behind the prime minister .
He added that he and his colleagues were making sure they implemented plans Mr Johnson had instructed them to deliver `` as soon as possible '' .
`` That 's the way we 'll bring the whole country through the coronavirus challenge , '' he said .
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described it as `` terribly sad news '' .
`` All the country 's thoughts are with the prime minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time , '' he added .
US President Donald Trump said Americans `` are all praying for his recovery '' .
He described Mr Johnson as `` a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation '' who is `` strong '' and `` does n't give up '' .
Mr Johnson was initially taken to hospital for routine tests after testing positive for coronavirus 10 days ago . His symptoms included a high temperature and a cough .
Earlier on Monday , he tweeted that he was in `` good spirits '' .
After very , very little information was shared today , the prime minister was taken into intensive care at around 19:00 BST .
We 've been told he is still conscious , but his condition has worsened over the course of the afternoon .
And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness .
The statement from Downing Street makes clear he is receiving excellent care and he wants to thank all of the NHS staff .

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to intensive care in hospital after his coronavirus symptoms ""worsened"", Downing Street has said.

A spokesman said he was moved on the advice of his medical team and was receiving ""excellent care"".

Mr Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise ""where necessary"", the spokesman added.

The prime minister, 55, was admitted to hospital in London with ""persistent symptoms"" on Sunday evening.

The Queen has been kept informed about Mr Johnson's health by No 10, according to Buckingham Palace.

BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the prime minister was given oxygen late on Monday afternoon, before being taken to intensive care.

However, he has not been put on a ventilator.

A No 10 statement read: ""The prime minister has been under the care of doctors at St Thomas' Hospital, in London, after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus.

""Over the course of [Monday] afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.""

It continued: ""The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.""

Mr Raab - who will later chair the government's daily Covid-19 meeting - said there was an ""incredibly strong team spirit"" behind the prime minister.

He added that he and his colleagues were making sure they implemented plans Mr Johnson had instructed them to deliver ""as soon as possible"".

""That's the way we'll bring the whole country through the coronavirus challenge,"" he said.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described it as ""terribly sad news"".

""All the country's thoughts are with the prime minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time,"" he added.

US President Donald Trump said Americans ""are all praying for his recovery"".

He described Mr Johnson as ""a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation"" who is ""strong"" and ""doesn't give up"".

Mr Johnson was initially taken to hospital for routine tests after testing positive for coronavirus 10 days ago. His symptoms included a high temperature and a cough.

Earlier on Monday, he tweeted that he was in ""good spirits"".

After very, very little information was shared today, the prime minister was taken into intensive care at around 19:00 BST.

We've been told he is still conscious, but his condition has worsened over the course of the afternoon.

And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness.

The statement from Downing Street makes clear he is receiving excellent care and he wants to thank all of the NHS staff.

But something important has changed, and he has felt it necessary to ask his foreign secretary to deputise for him where needs be.

That is a completely different message from what we have heard over the past 18 hours or so, where it was continually ""the prime minister is in touch"" and ""he is in charge"" - almost like everything is business as usual.

But clearly being in intensive care changes everything.

Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Mr Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in.

It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK reached 5,373 - an increase of 439 in a day.

The Department of Health and Social Care said there were now 51,608 confirmed coronavirus cases.

Intensive care is where doctors look after the sickest patients - his admission to ICU is the clearest indication of how ill the prime minister is.

We do not know the full details of Mr Johnson's condition, but he is conscious and not being ventilated.

Not every patient in intensive care is ventilated, but around two-thirds are within 24 hours of admission with Covid-19.

This is a disease that attacks the lungs and can cause pneumonia and difficulty breathing.

This leaves the body struggling to get enough oxygen into the blood and to the body's vital organs.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""sending [Mr Johnson] every good wish"", while Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster added she was ""praying for a full and speedy recovery"".

Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford called it ""concerning news"".

Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both said their thoughts were with him.

Mrs May noted that the ""horrific virus does not discriminate"".

The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar wished Mr Johnson ""a rapid return to health"", and French President Emmanuel Macron said he hoped he ""overcomes this ordeal quickly.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also wished him a ""speedy and full recovery"".

Now Americans are asking: How the hell did the Brits end up in this mess, and what is the way out?

Before answering those questions it’s worth restating the point of it all in the first place. Let’s remind ourselves of the noble rationale for Brexit, an argument that is increasingly lost in the breathless reporting of the shambolic implementation process.

The reason that a majority of Britons voted to leave the EU was the simple and reasonable demand that the decisions that govern their lives be made by representatives they can vote for or against in elections.

Brexit was, at its heart, about democracy and sovereignty.

Remember, the EU is not some kind of European version of NAFTA. It is the equivalent of a Federal Government for Europe, with two key differences.

First, the EU is actually more centralizing and intrusive with respect to its member states than the Federal Government is to the individual states of the U.S. I have seen this first hand - whether in my former role as senior advisor in 10 Downing Street or starting a business here in America. Believe me, however annoying you may think the feds are here, they’ve got nothing on the Brussels bureaucrats who run the EU.

Believe me, however annoying you may think the feds are here, they’ve got nothing on the Brussels bureaucrats who run the EU.

And that takes us to the second big difference: accountability. However much Americans may hate the over-centralization of power in Washington, at least Congress is elected. At least the President is elected. The EU’s policy-making body, the European Commission, is appointed. Unelected bureaucrats drive the EU agenda.

The slogan of Britain’s official ‘Leave’ campaign, “Take Back Control” was therefore well chosen. The proposition was simple: Let’s become an independent, self-governing nation again.

A majority agreed.

So how did that simple and uplifting idea, asserting a desire for sovereignty and democratic accountability, turn into the unremitting incompetence and division of the past two-and-a-half years?

It started with then-Prime Minister David Cameron’s impetuous decision to resign immediately, in the early hours after the Brexit vote. He was reported to have told aides “why should I stay around to deal with all the hard s**t?”

By flouncing out in such a peremptory fashion, he left the ruling Conservative Party to elect a new leader practically overnight. There was no “transition,” no time to reflect. A sleep-deprived and shell-shocked party stumbled immediately into a contest for which no-one was properly prepared.

The clear win reshapes Britain ’ s political landscape , giving Mr. Cameron ’ s Conservatives the right to govern without the influence of a coalition partner and pushing out a generation of big-name politicians from the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties .
But it will also require Mr. Cameron to navigate tricky issues that could bring huge changes to Britain ’ s place in the world . The pro-independence Scottish National Partyemerged as a big force in British politics , presenting a strengthened challenge in keeping the U.K. together .
And despite his opposition to leaving the EU , Mr. Cameron had promised under pressure from some on the right of his party to renegotiate the relationship and hold the referendum by 2017 if re-elected .
“ We will deliver that in-out referendum on our future in Europe , ” Mr. Cameron , speaking after a visit to Buckingham Palace , where he informed Queen Elizabeth II that he would be staying on as prime minister .
In a sign of the success of the SNP , Mr. Cameron also promised to implement further devolution that all parties had agreed to for Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland . “ In Scotland our plans are to create the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world , with important powers over taxation , ” he said
He said the Conservatives would be the party of the working class and would represent the whole country : “ Together , we can make Great Britain greater still . ”
The Conservatives ’ showing is a far different result than the dead heat predicted in months of pre-election surveys . With all of the 650 Parliament seats declared Friday , the Conservative Party had won 331 seats , more than the opposition combined and enough to rule without support from other parties . Labour had taken 232 .
It is the first time the Conservatives have won a majority since 1992
The SNP won all but three of the 59 seats in Scotland , rolling to its best-ever U.K. election result . Not since 1918 , which delivered a sweeping victory for Irish nationalists , has a party committed to its breakup held such sway in a part of the U.K .
Scottish voters last year rejected independence , but that campaign appears to have fueled the SNP ’ s meteoric rise on the back of a desire for greater autonomy . Their showing will amplify a noisy debate about whether Scotland should remain in the U.K .
Results in the U.K ’ s general election continue to come in , with Britain ’ s Conservative party on target to meet exit poll predictions suggesting they will form the next government . Mark Kelly reports .
George Osborne , a close ally of Mr. Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the outgoing government , identified the SNP ’ s triumph as the incoming government ’ s most significant challenge , and indicated a further transfer of powers to the Scottish Parliament .
“ We have to listen to what the Scottish people are telling us , ” he said . “ If we can find common ground , we will seek it . We ’ ve got legislation we can take through Parliament that would represent a considerable further devolution of powers . ”
Despite the uncertainty ahead , the pound surged to its highest level in three months early Friday , and futures for the FTSE 100—the benchmark equity index of the country ’ s largest companies—were 1.8 % higher .
Labour leader Ed Miliband stepped down after the party ’ s weakest performance since 1987 in terms of seats won . The party suffered some high-profile losses , including that of Ed Balls , the party ’ s spokesman on the economy and a former government minister .
“ I take absolute and total responsibility for the result , and our defeat at this election , ” said Mr. Miliband . “ The party needs to have an open and honest debate about the right way forward . ”
The Liberal Democrats , the Conservatives ’ coalition partner since 2010 , also suffered heavy losses . At least four party members who had served as ministers in the coalition government lost their seats .
Former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , who was one of the few in his party to retain a seat , resigned as its leader in the wake of the defeat , saying the results had been “ immeasurably more unkind and crushing than I could have feared . ”
The Conservatives focused their campaign on the party ’ s economic record , highlighting the U.K. ’ s recovery on their watch and accusing the previous Labour government of irresponsible spending . Mr. Cameron ’ s party also sought to attack its rival by portraying a Labour government as a weak one that would be propped up by Scottish nationalists .
Mr. Miliband had sought to position his party as one that would fight for the working class , arguing that many ordinary people were worse off after five years of a Conservative-led government , particularly at a time that prices have risen faster than wages .
The U.K . Independence Party , which had surged on its tough-on-immigration and anti-EU stance , took only one seat , down from two before the vote . The party ’ s leader , Nigel Farage , who failed to win the seat he contested , stepped down as party leader , depriving UKIP of its most recognizable and charismatic face .
The seat is the first the party has ever won in a national election , but the result falls far short of the “ few dozen seats ” Mr. Farage had said he was targeting . The party saw its first two members voted in to Parliament late last year in special elections , after both candidates defected from the Conservatives .
In London , early results showed maverick Mayor Boris Johnson won a parliamentary seat , confirming him as a favorite to succeed Mr. Cameron as Conservative Party leader down the road .","LONDON—Prime Minister David Cameron swept to an unexpectedly strong election victory on Friday with a majority in Parliament, and immediately vowed to give more powers to Scotland and let voters have a say on whether to stay in the European Union.

In a sign of the success of the SNP, Mr. Cameron also promised to implement further devolution that all parties had agreed to for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. “In Scotland our plans are to create the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world, with important powers over taxation,” he said

He said the Conservatives would be the party of the working class and would represent the whole country: “Together, we can make Great Britain greater still.”

U.K. Election: Conservatives Win Majority After a tense night of results, the U.K.’s Conservative party secures a majority at the general election.

The Conservatives’ showing is a far different result than the dead heat predicted in months of pre-election surveys. With all of the 650 Parliament seats declared Friday, the Conservative Party had won 331 seats, more than the opposition combined and enough to rule without support from other parties. Labour had taken 232.

It is the first time the Conservatives have won a majority since 1992

The SNP won all but three of the 59 seats in Scotland, rolling to its best-ever U.K. election result. Not since 1918, which delivered a sweeping victory for Irish nationalists, has a party committed to its breakup held such sway in a part of the U.K.

Scottish voters last year rejected independence, but that campaign appears to have fueled the SNP’s meteoric rise on the back of a desire for greater autonomy. Their showing will amplify a noisy debate about whether Scotland should remain in the U.K.

Results in the U.K’s general election continue to come in, with Britain’s Conservative party on target to meet exit poll predictions suggesting they will form the next government. Mark Kelly reports.

George Osborne, a close ally of Mr. Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the outgoing government, identified the SNP’s triumph as the incoming government’s most significant challenge, and indicated a further transfer of powers to the Scottish Parliament.

“We have to listen to what the Scottish people are telling us,” he said. “If we can find common ground, we will seek it. We’ve got legislation we can take through Parliament that would represent a considerable further devolution of powers.”

Despite the uncertainty ahead, the pound surged to its highest level in three months early Friday, and futures for the FTSE 100—the benchmark equity index of the country’s largest companies—were 1.8% higher.

Labour leader Ed Miliband stepped down after the party’s weakest performance since 1987 in terms of seats won. The party suffered some high-profile losses, including that of Ed Balls, the party’s spokesman on the economy and a former government minister.

“I take absolute and total responsibility for the result, and our defeat at this election,” said Mr. Miliband. “The party needs to have an open and honest debate about the right way forward.”

The Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives’ coalition partner since 2010, also suffered heavy losses. At least four party members who had served as ministers in the coalition government lost their seats.

Former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was one of the few in his party to retain a seat, resigned as its leader in the wake of the defeat, saying the results had been “immeasurably more unkind and crushing than I could have feared.”

The Conservatives focused their campaign on the party’s economic record, highlighting the U.K.’s recovery on their watch and accusing the previous Labour government of irresponsible spending. Mr. Cameron’s party also sought to attack its rival by portraying a Labour government as a weak one that would be propped up by Scottish nationalists.

Mr. Miliband had sought to position his party as one that would fight for the working class, arguing that many ordinary people were worse off after five years of a Conservative-led government, particularly at a time that prices have risen faster than wages.

The U.K. Independence Party, which had surged on its tough-on-immigration and anti-EU stance, took only one seat, down from two before the vote. The party’s leader, Nigel Farage, who failed to win the seat he contested, stepped down as party leader, depriving UKIP of its most recognizable and charismatic face.

The seat is the first the party has ever won in a national election, but the result falls far short of the “few dozen seats” Mr. Farage had said he was targeting. The party saw its first two members voted in to Parliament late last year in special elections, after both candidates defected from the Conservatives.

In London, early results showed maverick Mayor Boris Johnson won a parliamentary seat, confirming him as a favorite to succeed Mr. Cameron as Conservative Party leader down the road.

Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died Monday following a stroke. She was 87. Despite many accomplishments during her 11 years in office, she was a divisive figure, and there is still much bitterness surrounding the woman who was dubbed the Iron Lady.

Thatcher's long journey to becoming one of Britain's most influential leaders began in humble surroundings. She was born on Oct. 13, 1925, in the small English town of Grantham. Her mother was a dressmaker, her father a grocer and a local politician.

Thatcher often credited her father with introducing her to politics. She said he instilled in her the importance of being an independent thinker and of being able to stand on her own two feet — values that she expected from all Britons once she gained power.

Simon Hoggart, a political sketchwriter for The Guardian newspaper, said there were early indications of this during her tenure as secretary of education when she wanted to do away with the 1/3 pint of free milk schoolchildren had been receiving since World War II.

""Thatcher decided it was a waste of money and a waste of time, because by the time she became minister of education, people had enough milk,"" he said, ""and she stopped it. And she was known as 'Mrs. Thatcher, milk snatcher.' ""

'Not A Consensus Politician'



Thatcher honed her reputation as a right-wing politician after she became Conservative Party leader in the mid-1970s. At that time, the Labour Party was in power, there was high inflation and unemployment, and a series of crippling strikes came to a head during the winter of 1978 and '79. Hoggart says that era was dubbed ""the winter of discontent.""

""The railway unions went on strike — the railroads are important for commuters in this country — hospital workers were on strike, even people who dispose of dead bodies were on strike,"" he said. ""The sense that we were, the nation was, unraveling in front of our eyes was quite powerful.""

The Falklands And The Cold War



Owen says that determination — and stubbornness also — worked to Thatcher's advantage, especially after Argentina invaded the British-ruled Falkland Islands in 1982. Thatcher sent in the military.

Lord Geoffrey Howe, her treasurer and then-foreign minister, said the war was a stressful time for Thatcher.

'The Prime Minister ... We Needed'

Thatcher had pushed through an extremely unpopular community tax, which sparked violent riots. Complaints and concerns to Thatcher fell on deaf ears.

“ Harry and Meghan are pursuing a media strategy closer to Hollywood A-listers than the grin-and-bear-it universalism associated with the ruling family .

What’s happening

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, officially the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced their intention to “step back” from their roles as senior members of the British royal family on Wednesday.

The couple, commonly referred to by their first names, said they intend to split their time between the U.K. and North America as they “carve out a progressive new role” within the monarchy and work to become “financially independent.”

The announcement, which was reportedly released in defiance of “clear instructions from the queen,"" is said to have sent shock waves through Buckingham Palace. The couple’s decision to distance themselves from official duties while retaining their titles is unprecedented, royal experts say.

Harry and Meghan have been the subject of intense media attention since first appearing together in public in 2017. Their wedding the next year was treated as a global event. They had their first child, Archie, in May.

Why there’s debate

The most frequently cited reason for Harry and Meghan’s decision is their discontent with the media coverage they receive. As the son of a future king and an idolized prince, Harry has been in the public eye his entire life. Meghan, an American with with a white father and black mother, has been subjected to enormous scrutiny in the press. The famously aggressive British tabloids heaped a unique level of criticism on her, some argue, that at times trafficked in racial tropes and occasionally dipped into explicit racism.

Another common explanation for the couple’s decision is a perception that they didn’t particularly care for the ceremonial elements of royal life. As sixth in line for the throne, Harry is unlikely to ever become king. This gives him a freedom that his older brother, William, who’s behind only his father, Charles, in the line of succession, doesn’t have. Others have accused them of wanting all of the financial and fame benefits of royalty without taking on any of the work that comes along with it.

Some see Harry and Meghan’s move as a sign of changing attitudes toward the monarchy, which they argue represents a legacy of subjugation and colonialism that has little place in the modern world.

What’s next

The first indication of how the couple might spend some of their time after stepping back from royal duties came from reports that had Meghan signed a deal to do voice-over work for Disney, with all the proceeds going to a conservation charity.

Many of the broader details of Harry and Meghan’s future, such as where in North America they will live, are still unclear. It’s also unknown how much of a role, if any, they’ll have in the monarchy going forward.

Perspectives

Frustration with criticism from tabloids

“The British media spent much of 2019 turning their fire on Meghan. She was painted by many as a whinging, out-of-touch celebrity who did little more than complain about how restrictive life in the clan was.” — Luke McGee, CNN

Racist media

“Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have finally had enough. Enough of the disproportionate

scrutiny, blatant misogyny and relentless racism that has been hurled at them (well, mostly at Meghan) unremittingly since they got married in 2018.” — Natalie Morris, Metro (United Kingdom)

Desire to control their media narrative

“Harry and Meghan are pursuing a media strategy closer to Hollywood A-listers than the grin-and-bear-it universalism associated with the ruling family. The price of access will now be good behavior — or as they call it, ‘objective news reporting.’ No more vague rumors, no more cruel comment pieces, if you want a ringside seat at the Harry and Meghan show.” — Helen Lewis, Atlantic

They didn’t like the job

“Why are they leaving? I think it was pretty obvious if you hung around with them as I did and followed them when they did their tours and trips. There were great chunks of the job they simply didn’t like.” — Jonny Dymond, BBC

The rise of populist politics in the U.K.

“If the media paid more attention to Britain’s communities of color, perhaps it would find the announcement far less surprising. With a new prime minister whose track record includes overtly racist statements, some of which would make even Donald Trump blush, a Brexit project linked to native nationalism and a desire to rid Britain of large numbers of immigrants, and an ever thickening loom of imperial nostalgia, many of us are also thinking about moving.” — Afua Hirsch, New York Times",www.news.yahoo.com,center,UyphSkS9vMKbe8SC

Analysis

By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent

The contrast could not have been starker. The President of the United States received a warm welcome from the Queen and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace.

There were two 41-gun salutes - one for Mr Trump and another marking the 66th anniversary of the Queen's coronation on Sunday - as well as an honour guard of young Grenadiers resplendent in scarlet.

At the same time, Mr Trump launched a verbal attack on the mayor of the city in which he is now a guest, calling Sadiq Khan ""a stone cold loser"" for questioning why the president had been granted a state visit.

A quick walk around the crowd outside Buckingham Palace revealed the presence of supporters and detractors of Mr Trump - both equally strong in their views.

Asked what they expect the UK to get from this visit, they reply: ""Trade deals.""

Nearly 10 years after Kremlin critic and former spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with a rare radioactive element and died in London , a retired British judge has issued a report concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin `` probably '' approved a plan by Russia 's security service to kill the former FSB agent .
The Kremlin has long denied any involvement in Litvinenko 's death . The two men who are accused of poisoning Litvinenko , Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun , have suggested he might have poisoned himself , either intentionally or accidentally . But the British findings dismiss that possibility , along with the idea that the situation was some sort of elaborate ruse .
The report released today by Sir Robert Owen , chairman of the British inquiry into Litvinenko 's murder , concludes that `` the FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr. Patrushev , then head of the FSB , and also by President Putin .
Litvinenko 's widow , Marina , speaking Thursday outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London , welcomed the report by saying , `` The words my husband spoke on his deathbed , when he accused Mr. Putin of his murder , have been proved true in an English court . ''
She also urged Prime Minister David Cameron to take action against Putin and Russia .
`` I am calling immediately for the expulsion from the U.K. of all Russian intelligence operatives , '' Litvinenko said , `` whether from the FSB who murdered Sasha or from other Russian agencies based in the London embassy . ''
Responding to the report , Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said , `` We regret that the purely criminal case has been politicized and has marred the entire atmosphere of bilateral relations . ''
As writer Will Storr told NPR in 2013 , `` This has been written about as the first-ever successful nuclear attack on the West by Russia . It 's a major situation . ''
The report recounts how the spy came to be in London : In 2000 , six years before Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned , he arrived in the city with his wife and son , Anatoly , and made a declaration to a police officer : `` I am a KGB officer and I 'm asking for political asylum . ''
Litvinenko was 44 when he died in 2006 of cardiac arrest brought on by acute radiation syndrome . The report says he was poisoned twice — the first time coming just days after he and his family were granted British citizenship on Oct. 13 , 2006 .
`` The evidence establishes that Mr. Litvinenko ingested the fatal dose whilst drinking tea from a teapot contaminated with polonium-210 in the Pine Bar of the Millennium Hotel in the West End of London in the afternoon of 1 November in the company of Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun . I am sure that Mr. Lugovoy and Mr. Kovtun placed the polonium-210 into the teapot at the Pine Bar and did so with the intention of poisoning Mr . Litvinenko . ''
That fatal encounter came weeks after Lugovoy and Kovtun had attempted to administer polonium-210 to Litvinenko , Owen says .
Judge Owen adds that there 's no sign of a possible personal motive for Lugovoy and Kovtun , and that all the evidence in the case `` points in one direction '' — to Moscow . Litvinenko died on Nov. 23 , 2006 .
As a former Soviet intelligence officer wrote for The Telegraph in 2009 , Litvinenko 's clashes with Putin extend at least back to 1998 , when he blew the whistle on orders from the FSB to murder a politician in Russia . At the time , Putin had been in charge of the FSB for a matter of months ; Litvinenko was arrested and placed under scrutiny until he managed to reach London .
The material that killed Litvinenko has a half-life of just 138 days ; it also leaves a faint blue glow that helped forensic investigators track the polonium-210 's trail through London .
As for the alleged perpetrators , the report states , `` Warrants were in due course issued for their arrest , and the Crown Prosecution Service sought unsuccessfully to extradite them from the Russian Federation to stand trial for murder . ''

Nearly 10 years after Kremlin critic and former spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with a rare radioactive element and died in London, a retired British judge has issued a report concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""probably"" approved a plan by Russia's security service to kill the former FSB agent.

The prime minister had been seeking to pitch Saturday ’ s vote in the Commons as a choice between deal or no deal after coming to an agreement with the EU .
Johnson was helped by comments from Jean-Claude Juncker casting doubt on the possibility of a further Brexit delay , but the heads of state and government did not follow the European commission president ’ s lead .
A summit communique issued after two hours of discussion tasked the commission and European parliament with taking “ the necessary steps to ensure that the agreement can enter into force on November 1 ” .
But a senior EU official said that the leaders would follow events on Saturday , and reflect on the next steps if they were in a “ different situation ” .
A second diplomatic source said they had chosen not to interfere in a “ sensitive domestic debate … but they leave the door open to the possibility of an extension , to be discussed at a later stage – if required ” .
Donald Tusk , the president of the European council who will provide guidance on the options in the event of another rejection of a deal , said the issue of an extension was for a later date .
“ Our intention is to work towards ratification . We support a deal and this was a clear decision of the 27 member states . And we prepared for this ratification , politically logistically , technically ” , Tusk said . “ Now the ball is in the court of the UK . I have no idea what will be the result of the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday . It isn ’ t for me to comment on political developments in the UK . But if there is a request for an extension , I will consult member states to see how they react . ”

Johnson is facing an uphill battle to build a majority after the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party rejected the revised deal , describing it as driving “ a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast agreement ” .
Juncker had tried to help sell the deal by pouring doubt on a further Brexit extension in the event of it being rejected .
He told reporters he was “ ruling out ” a prolongation , but the issue is solely the remit of the EU heads of state and government . “ If we have a deal , we have a deal and there is no need for prolongation , ” he added
No other EU leader expressed the same view . One senior EU official told ███ of Juncker ’ s intervention : “ It is fake news . ”
Agreement on the new deal was struck in a phone call between Juncker and Johnson at 11.10am London time .
During a later joint appearance they called on the Commons to pass the deal so that negotiations could move on to the terms of the trading relationship .

Johnson said : “ I hope very much … that my fellow MPs in Westminster do now come together to get Brexit done , to get this excellent deal over the line and to deliver Brexit without any more delay so that we can focus on the priorities of the British people . ”
Juncker said the EU would ensure the UK was able to exit on 31 October if parliament gave its consent to the deal on its “ super Saturday ” sitting this weekend .
Johnson will have to win over a significant number of Labour MPs and some of the 21 former Conservatives who had the whip removed last month .
As details of the new deal emerged , the DUP issued a statement attacking Downing Street ’ s deal . “ It is our view that these arrangements would not be in Northern Ireland ’ s long-term interests , ” the party said . “ Saturday ’ s vote in parliament on the proposals will only be the start of a long process to get any withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons . ”

Asked whether the agreement was the final possible deal for the EU , he declined to comment .
Under the agreement , Barnier said , Northern Ireland would stay in the EU ’ s single market for goods and the EU ’ s customs code would be enforced on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland .
“ This means that all applicable procedures on goods will take place at points on entry into Northern Ireland and not across the island , ” he said .

There would be another opportunity four years later to give consent if they voted by simple majority , and eight years later if they took the cross-party route .

“ This democratic support is a cornerstone of our newly agreed approach , ” Barnier said . “ Why ? Because this newly agreed protocol is no longer to be replaced by a subsequent agreement between the EU and the UK . ”
Barnier said Johnson had agreed the political declaration would maintain British commitments to fair competition . The prime minister had agreed this was the quid pro quo for a free-trade agreement which would seek to keep trade between the UK and the EU free of tariffs and quotas .
The EU negotiator said the British government was seeking a looser relationship to the bloc and “ the option of creating a single customs territory between us has been discarded ” .","EU leaders have left open the option of extending Brexit beyond 31 October if the new deal is voted down by the Commons, in a blow to Boris Johnson’s strategy.

The prime minister had been seeking to pitch Saturday’s vote in the Commons as a choice between deal or no deal after coming to an agreement with the EU.

Johnson was helped by comments from Jean-Claude Juncker casting doubt on the possibility of a further Brexit delay, but the heads of state and government did not follow the European commission president’s lead.

A summit communique issued after two hours of discussion tasked the commission and European parliament with taking “the necessary steps to ensure that the agreement can enter into force on November 1”.

But a senior EU official said that the leaders would follow events on Saturday, and reflect on the next steps if they were in a “different situation”.

A second diplomatic source said they had chosen not to interfere in a “sensitive domestic debate … but they leave the door open to the possibility of an extension, to be discussed at a later stage – if required”.

Donald Tusk, the president of the European council who will provide guidance on the options in the event of another rejection of a deal, said the issue of an extension was for a later date.



“Our intention is to work towards ratification. We support a deal and this was a clear decision of the 27 member states. And we prepared for this ratification, politically logistically, technically”, Tusk said. “Now the ball is in the court of the UK. I have no idea what will be the result of the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday. It isn’t for me to comment on political developments in the UK. But if there is a request for an extension, I will consult member states to see how they react.”

Johnson is facing an uphill battle to build a majority after the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party rejected the revised deal, describing it as driving “a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast agreement”.

Juncker had tried to help sell the deal by pouring doubt on a further Brexit extension in the event of it being rejected.

He told reporters he was “ruling out” a prolongation, but the issue is solely the remit of the EU heads of state and government. “If we have a deal, we have a deal and there is no need for prolongation,” he added

No other EU leader expressed the same view. One senior EU official told the Guardian of Juncker’s intervention: “It is fake news.”

Agreement on the new deal was struck in a phone call between Juncker and Johnson at 11.10am London time.

During a later joint appearance they called on the Commons to pass the deal so that negotiations could move on to the terms of the trading relationship.

Johnson said: “I hope very much … that my fellow MPs in Westminster do now come together to get Brexit done, to get this excellent deal over the line and to deliver Brexit without any more delay so that we can focus on the priorities of the British people.”

Juncker said the EU would ensure the UK was able to exit on 31 October if parliament gave its consent to the deal on its “super Saturday” sitting this weekend.

Johnson will have to win over a significant number of Labour MPs and some of the 21 former Conservatives who had the whip removed last month.

As details of the new deal emerged, the DUP issued a statement attacking Downing Street’s deal. “It is our view that these arrangements would not be in Northern Ireland’s long-term interests,” the party said. “Saturday’s vote in parliament on the proposals will only be the start of a long process to get any withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons.”

But Trump will also face a significant protest in the capital on Tuesday, where left-wing activists and politicians are due to march in protest of the visit -- similar to a large protest that took place during Trump’s working visit to the country last year.

Trump said he had only seen a ""small protest"" and said he had instead seen a lot of support from Brits: ""It was a very, very small group of people put in for political reasons.""",www.foxnews.com,right,Z53qt7HnkB7haH5n

MPs will vote on four alternatives to Theresa May’s thrice-rejected Brexit deal, including a customs union and a Norway-style deal, as backbenchers seek to force the government to change course.

May admitted the decision to delay the vote was made after it became clear she would lose it `` by a significant margin . '' She will now go back to EU leaders to seek further reassurances , she said .
The embattled leader told the UK House of Commons that she had listened `` very carefully to what has been said in this chamber and out of it '' -- a statement that was met with laughter and jeering by members of Parliament .
An emergency debate on the government 's decision will take place in Parliament on Tuesday morning as `` the first item of business , '' Speaker John Bercow said . Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn requested the emergency debate Monday night .
May admitted that `` there remains widespread and deep concern '' over the Northern Ireland backstop . The backstop is an arrangement designed to ensure there is no return to a `` hard border '' between Ireland , which will remain part of the European Union after Brexit , and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the bloc next March .
Northern Ireland 's secretary of state said she supported the decision to delay the vote .
`` Clearly , having listened to colleagues across the House , there is more work to be done to provide reassurances on the Northern Ireland-Ireland backstop , '' MP Karen Bradley said in a statement . `` I am convinced that leaving the EU without an agreement would be disastrous for Northern Ireland and potentially for the long-term future of the Union . I am not prepared to take risks with or gamble the Union of the United Kingdom . ''
The prime minister said she had hoped changes secured to the backstop , to avoid being trapped in it indefinitely , would be enough for MPs .
`` I spoke to a number of EU leaders over the weekend and , in advance of the European Council , I will go to see my counterparts in other member states and the leadership of the council and the commission . I will discuss with them the clear concerns that this House has expressed , '' May said .
`` We will therefore defer the vote scheduled for tomorrow and not proceed to divide the House at this time , '' May added .
On Tuesday morning May will travel to The Hague to hold a bilateral meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte , Downing Street said .
It will be part of May 's plan to seek `` assurances '' from EU leaders , which she can then convey to the UK Parliament to pass her Brexit deal .
Corbyn called her agreement a `` botched deal '' before adding that `` our country deserves better than this . ''
`` The government has lost control of events and is in complete disarray , '' Corbyn said . `` It 's been evident for weeks that the prime minister 's deal did not have confidence of this House yet she plowed on regardless , reiterating 'this is the only deal available . ' ''
The leader of the House , Andrea Leadsom , confirmed the vote was no longer on the House voting schedule after May 's statement .
The uncertainty over the future of Brexit caused sterling to plummet Monday to its weakest level in a year-and-a-half .
UK parliamentarians were supposed to be given the opportunity to approve or reject the deal in a so-called `` meaningful vote '' in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening .
In recent weeks , May had been trying to win support for her agreement but , with a high number of her own Conservative Party MPs opposed to it , she did n't appear to be having much success .
JUST WATCHED The future of Brexit remains uncertain Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The future of Brexit remains uncertain 02:42
There was confusion and anger as May hit the pause button on the vote .

''","London (CNN) The Brexit process was thrown into disarray Monday as Prime Minister Theresa May pulled the plug on a crucial parliamentary vote on her deal for the country to leave the European Union.

May admitted the decision to delay the vote was made after it became clear she would lose it ""by a significant margin."" She will now go back to EU leaders to seek further reassurances, she said.

The embattled leader told the UK House of Commons that she had listened ""very carefully to what has been said in this chamber and out of it"" -- a statement that was met with laughter and jeering by members of Parliament.

An emergency debate on the government's decision will take place in Parliament on Tuesday morning as ""the first item of business,"" Speaker John Bercow said. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn requested the emergency debate Monday night.

May admitted that ""there remains widespread and deep concern"" over the Northern Ireland backstop. The backstop is an arrangement designed to ensure there is no return to a ""hard border"" between Ireland, which will remain part of the European Union after Brexit, and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the bloc next March.

Northern Ireland's secretary of state said she supported the decision to delay the vote.

""Clearly, having listened to colleagues across the House, there is more work to be done to provide reassurances on the Northern Ireland-Ireland backstop,"" MP Karen Bradley said in a statement. ""I am convinced that leaving the EU without an agreement would be disastrous for Northern Ireland and potentially for the long-term future of the Union. I am not prepared to take risks with or gamble the Union of the United Kingdom.""

The prime minister said she had hoped changes secured to the backstop, to avoid being trapped in it indefinitely, would be enough for MPs.

""I spoke to a number of EU leaders over the weekend and, in advance of the European Council, I will go to see my counterparts in other member states and the leadership of the council and the commission. I will discuss with them the clear concerns that this House has expressed,"" May said.

""We will therefore defer the vote scheduled for tomorrow and not proceed to divide the House at this time,"" May added.

On Tuesday morning May will travel to The Hague to hold a bilateral meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Downing Street said.

It will be part of May's plan to seek ""assurances"" from EU leaders, which she can then convey to the UK Parliament to pass her Brexit deal.

Opposition leader: Our country deserves better

Corbyn called her agreement a ""botched deal"" before adding that ""our country deserves better than this.""

""The government has lost control of events and is in complete disarray,"" Corbyn said. ""It's been evident for weeks that the prime minister's deal did not have confidence of this House yet she plowed on regardless, reiterating 'this is the only deal available.'""

The leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, confirmed the vote was no longer on the House voting schedule after May's statement.

The uncertainty over the future of Brexit caused sterling to plummet Monday to its weakest level in a year-and-a-half.

UK parliamentarians were supposed to be given the opportunity to approve or reject the deal in a so-called ""meaningful vote"" in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.

In recent weeks, May had been trying to win support for her agreement but, with a high number of her own Conservative Party MPs opposed to it, she didn't appear to be having much success.

EU: No further negotiations

There was confusion and anger as May hit the pause button on the vote.

European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU ""will not renegotiate the deal including the backstop"" and stressed that ""as time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.""

Tusk added that the EU is ""ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.""

This exercise doesn't predict how much the economy will grow over the 15-year period, but rather the impact of specific changes in Britain's trade relationships, other things being equal.

That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't.

The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth.

There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option.

Other members of the EU, which combined has about six times Britain’s economic might, called for discussion but indicated there was little chance of fundamental change to the deal May had negotiated.

Some argue , “ Britain ’ s fight about Brexit is best understood as a civil war over the country ’ s culture . Remainers believe that important parts of contemporary Britain are in need of serious reform . But they also tend to be in tune with the beliefs of the country ’ s cultural elite , and to think that its core institutions are worth preserving . By and large , they trust the BBC , think highly of the country ’ s universities , and believe that Britain ’ s place in the world—as a medium-size power exerting its influence through multilateral institutions such as NATO and the United Nations—is appropriate…
“ Leavers , by contrast , feel that these institutions have come to be dominated by a left-liberal cultural establishment that looks down on them and sells the country short . They accuse the BBC of having a left-wing bias . They believe that universities serve to indoctrinate their children . And though they are confident that their country could manage on its own , they have grown convinced that most politicians are too timid to help it regain its past grandeur… [ Johnson ] has always understood that Brexit is as much a symbol as a cause… If he plays his cards right , he will dominate British politics for much longer than pundits expect—and inspire imitators well beyond the shores of Brexit Britain . ”
Regarding Corbyn , “ He is less popular than Boris Johnson among both men and women , in every socioeconomic category , whether richer or poorer , in London and Scotland as well as the Midlands and Wales and , remarkably , in every age group… Yet the curious thing about British politics just now is that , among Labour supporters , this is barely mentioned in public . To raise it is to bring social media ordure down upon on your head , as if it were improper or even sacrilegious to speak of such things – even though it is truly extraordinary that the party of opposition is not 20 points ahead of a government in office for nine years , so bitterly divided it has expelled 21 of its own MPs , including two former chancellors , and which has failed to deliver on its central promise…
“ The diehards will say that to criticise Corbyn in this way is to side with the Tories against the poor and vulnerable . But the opposite is true . To stick with a path that makes five more years of Boris Johnson , and a hard Brexit , more likely is not to side with the poor and the vulnerable – it is to betray them . ”
Many posit that “ At the end of it [ all ] , the majority of the population is likely to end up disappointed , irrespective of how they voted on Brexit in the past and may do in the future if the government ’ s opponents succeed in getting a second referendum . ‘ Leavers ’ may well not get the promised land they were hoping for , or ‘ Remainers ’ will always resent losing their European citizenship , and the rights to reside and work in 27 other countries , that went with it… however long this process takes , and however it ends , Britain will have changed , and its status in the world will only have further eroded . ”
“ Trump ’ s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it ’ s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there ’ s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But… ‘ even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. ’ … ‍ “ In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid , the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation .

But they also tend to be in tune with the beliefs of the country’s cultural elite, and to think that its core institutions are worth preserving. By and large, they trust the BBC, think highly of the country’s universities, and believe that Britain’s place in the world—as a medium-size power exerting its influence through multilateral institutions such as NATO and the United Nations—is appropriate…



“Leavers, by contrast, feel that these institutions have come to be dominated by a left-liberal cultural establishment that looks down on them and sells the country short. They accuse the BBC of having a left-wing bias. They believe that universities serve to indoctrinate their children. And though they are confident that their country could manage on its own, they have grown convinced that most politicians are too timid to help it regain its past grandeur… [Johnson] has always understood that Brexit is as much a symbol as a cause… If he plays his cards right, he will dominate British politics for much longer than pundits expect—and inspire imitators well beyond the shores of Brexit Britain.”

Yascha Mounk, The Atlantic

Regarding Corbyn, “He is less popular than Boris Johnson among both men and women, in every socioeconomic category, whether richer or poorer, in London and Scotland as well as the Midlands and Wales and, remarkably, in every age group… Yet the curious thing about British politics just now is that, among Labour supporters, this is barely mentioned in public. To raise it is to bring social media ordure down upon on your head, as if it were improper or even sacrilegious to speak of such things – even though it is truly extraordinary that the party of opposition is not 20 points ahead of a government in office for nine years, so bitterly divided it has expelled 21 of its own MPs, including two former chancellors, and which has failed to deliver on its central promise…



“The diehards will say that to criticise Corbyn in this way is to side with the Tories against the poor and vulnerable. But the opposite is true. To stick with a path that makes five more years of Boris Johnson, and a hard Brexit, more likely is not to side with the poor and the vulnerable – it is to betray them.”

Jonathan Freedland, The Guardian

Many posit that “At the end of it [all], the majority of the population is likely to end up disappointed, irrespective of how they voted on Brexit in the past and may do in the future if the government’s opponents succeed in getting a second referendum. ‘Leavers’ may well not get the promised land they were hoping for, or ‘Remainers’ will always resent losing their European citizenship, and the rights to reside and work in 27 other countries, that went with it… however long this process takes, and however it ends, Britain will have changed, and its status in the world will only have further eroded.”

James Rodgers, NBC News

“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… ‍ “In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”

LONDON (AP) — Love her or loathe her, one thing's beyond dispute: Margaret Thatcher transformed Britain.

The Iron Lady who ruled for 11 remarkable years imposed her will on a fractious, rundown nation — breaking the unions, triumphing in a far-off war, and selling off state industries at a record pace. She left behind a leaner government and more prosperous nation by the time a mutiny ousted her from No. 10 Downing Street.

Story Continued Below

Thatcher's former spokesman, Tim Bell, said that the former prime minister had died Monday morning of a stroke. She was 87.

For admirers, Thatcher was a savior who rescued Britain from ruin and laid the groundwork for an extraordinary economic renaissance. For critics, she was a heartless tyrant who ushered in an era of greed that kicked the weak out onto the streets and let the rich become filthy rich.

""Let us not kid ourselves, she was a very divisive figure,"" said Bernard Ingham, Thatcher's press secretary for her entire term. ""She was a real toughie. She was a patriot with a great love for this country, and she raised the standing of Britain abroad.""

Thatcher was the first — and still only — female prime minister in Britain's history. But she often found feminists tiresome and was not above using her handbag as a prop to underline her swagger and power. A grocer's daughter, she rose to the top of Britain's snobbish hierarchy the hard way, and envisioned a classless society that rewarded hard work and determination.

She was a trailblazer who at first believed trailblazing impossible: Thatcher told the Liverpool Daily Post in 1974 that she did not think a woman would serve as party leader or prime minister during her lifetime.

But once in power, she never showed an ounce of doubt.

Thatcher could be intimidating to those working for her:

British diplomats sighed with relief on her first official visit to Washington D.C. as prime minister to find that she was relaxed enough to enjoy a glass of whiskey and a half-glass of wine during an embassy lunch, according to official documents.

Like her close friend and political ally Ronald Reagan, Thatcher seemed motivated by an unshakable belief that free markets would build a better country than reliance on a strong, central government. Another thing she shared with the American president: a tendency to reduce problems to their basics, choose a path, and follow it to the end, no matter what the opposition.

She formed a deep attachment to the man she called ""Ronnie"" — some spoke of it as a schoolgirl crush. Still, she would not back down when she disagreed with him on important matters, even though the United States was the richer and vastly stronger partner in the so-called ""special relationship.""

The government says it will try to get Theresa May's Brexit deal through the Commons, despite Speaker John Bercow throwing the process into doubt.

Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay suggested a vote could take place next week - after Mrs May has sought a delay to Brexit from the EU.

Mr Bercow has ruled that the PM can not bring her deal back for a third vote without ""substantial"" changes.

The UK is due to leave the EU in 10 days with or without a deal.

The prime minister had hoped to have another try at getting MPs to back the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU this week - but Speaker Bercow effectively torpedoed that with his surprise intervention on Monday.

What are the options?

Government ministers and MPs have been floating different ideas on how to get a vote on the prime minister's deal, in light of the Speaker's ruling.

The government is to add a new clause to the Brexit bill to rule out any extension to the transition period beyond the end of next year.

The post-Brexit transition period - due to conclude in December 2020 - can currently be extended by mutual agreement for up to two years.

But an amended Withdrawal Agreement Bill the Commons is set to vote on this week would rule out any extension.

The PM told MPs it would put an end to years of ""deadlock, dither and delay"".

As the House of Commons assembled for the first time since the election, Boris Johnson said his priority was to ""get Brexit done"". He also promised to seek ""common ground"" and to approach politics with a ""new and generous spirit"" after the rancour of recent years.

Jeremy Corbyn congratulated the Conservative leader on his victory but said he would be ""judged"" on whether he delivered on the ""many, many promises"" he had made during the campaign, including to longstanding Labour voters.

The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January, more than three and a half years after the public backed Brexit in a referendum.

Trade deals typically take many years to conclude and senior EU figures are sceptical that a deal can be agreed within that time. If it is not, the economic relationship will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, with the likelihood of tariffs on imports and exports.

The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc would ""do the maximum"" to finalise the deal in time. Asked about the UK's refusal to contemplate any extra time for the talks, he said ""it is the British choice to choose the procedure it wants"".

Political signal

This is a political signal, a moment of early chest beating too, designed to disappoint those who might have been hoping No 10 might slide to a softer Brexit over the next few months.

And designed to gratify those who are adamant that Brexit must be completely ""done"" as soon as possible.

Boris Johnson seems to have concluded that if the talks are to go anywhere fast, there has to be a convincing clear deadline.

It was his vow of a Halloween deadline that got him to Downing Street in the first place, and although it was broken in the end, there's little question that his attitude towards extending again and again changed the dynamics of the talks with the EU that got the revised deal done.

Putting the deadline into law may also be designed to focus minds in Brussels. How effective that might be? That's a different question.

Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's move was ""reckless and irresponsible"" and he argued that Mr Johnson was ""prepared to put people's jobs at risk"".

Liberal Democrat interim leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""The only way Johnson can meet the December 2020 timetable is by giving up all his previous promises to Leave voters and agreeing to all the demands of the EU.""

Downing Street has said the government plans to ask the new Parliament to have its first debate and vote on the withdrawal agreement - the legislation needed to ratify Brexit - on Friday.

With a majority of 80 following Thursday's general election, Mr Johnson is expected to get the bill into law with few changes in time for the UK to end its EU membership on 31 January.

So, the government is going to pass a law to stop itself doing something that it had already promised not to do.

On the surface, that doesn't change much.

Because the decision on whether to extend the transition period lies with the prime minister anyway, not with Parliament.

And with his new majority, Mr Johnson knows his critics can't do anything to force his hand.

But as a statement of intent, this announcement is important.

By reaffirming Mr Johnson's guarantee that the transition period will not be extended, it suggests there will only be enough time to agree a pretty basic trade deal which would leave many important issues unresolved.

That means a quick 'zero tariffs zero quotas' deal on goods could be done, as long as the UK is prepared to sign up to the EU's main conditions.

They include the UK sticking with EU rules on environmental and social policy, and on state aid for companies.

Such an agreement wouldn't get rid of all border checks, though, and it wouldn't do anything for the services sector.

Commons officials have begun the process of swearing in the new MPs - which will continue on Wednesday.

What will happen this week?

Tuesday and Wednesday

After the election of the Speaker, the process of swearing in MPs begins. They are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866.

Two to three days are usually set aside for this process.

Thursday

The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days.

Friday

Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday.

The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament.

MPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days in order to leave the EU by the then Brexit deadline of 31 October.

After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated.",www.bbc.com,center,gcToBpiKVinmgzeS

Johnson Says He Wants to Get On With Election ( 6.15 p.m . )
Boris Johnson told a private meeting of Conservative MPs that he wants to get on with an election , according to two people present who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The prime minister said that the government can ’ t keep going in circles without a majority , and that while he doesn ’ t want an election , one is inevitable and necessary to break the deadlock currently surrounding Brexit .
The Home Office on Wednesday said it will introduce new border controls to make it harder for “ serious criminals ” to enter the U.K. in the event of a no-deal Brexit . A tougher criminality threshold will be applied to European Economic Area citizens in order to deport and keep out criminals from abroad , the department said .
In a measure to allow businesses to recruit and retain staff after Brexit , the Home office also announced that EEA and Swiss citizens and their close family members who arrive in the U.K. between Brexit and the end of 2020 will be able to obtain temporary immigration status lasting three years .
Other new measures include removing the EU customs channel at entry points , introducing blue passports later this year – a totemic issue for Brexiteers – and removing the right to permanent residence for those who arrive after Brexit .
Caroline Spelman , another Conservative former minister , switched sides and joined the rebels in today ’ s vote , according to data from the House of Commons .
Having voted against Tuesday night ’ s successful bid by MPs to seize control of the Parliamentary timetable , Spelman backed the bill to block a no-deal Brexit .
Spelman is not expected to be expelled from the party , as rebels were last night , because the vote was not being treated as an issue of confidence in the government , according to a party official speaking on condition of anonymity .
First Stage of Anti No-Deal Brexit Bill Approved ( 5:20 p.m . )
Members of Parliament voted by 329 votes to 300 to continue with the bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit .
The bill will now be examined in detail in the House of Commons with a series of votes on amendments expected to start at 7 p.m .
A footnote from Prime Minister ’ s Questions earlier in the day : Boris Johnson three times set out his intended date for an early general election as Oct. 15 .
That ’ s a day later than his officials were briefing last week and addresses concerns that Oct. 14 is the start of a Jewish holiday .
Nicholas Soames , the grandson of Winston Churchill , appeared on the edge of tears as he confirmed he will stand down as an MP after 37 years . He was one of the Tory rebels who was expelled from the Conservative Party by Johnson on Tuesday night .
“ I ’ m truly very sad that it should end in this way , ” he said . “ It is my most fervent hope that this house will rediscover the spirit of compromise , humility and understanding that will enable us finally to push ahead with the vital work in the interests of the whole country that has inevitably had to be so sadly neglected whilst we have devoted so much time to wrestling with Brexit . ''
He did allow himself a parting shot at Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg , however , saying that while he had loyally voted for Theresa May ’ s deal three times , their disloyalty to the party at that time had helped to inspire his rebellion .
Philip Hammond , the former chancellor of the exchequer who was thrown out of the Conservative Party for voting against Boris Johnson on Tuesday night , said Parliament voting to block a no-deal Brexit won ’ t hinder negotiations “ because actually there is no negotiation going on with the EU . ”
“ We ’ ve had confirmation from multiple sources across the EU that nothing is happening , ” Hammond said . “ Nothing we are doing here is going to undermine the prime minister ’ s ability to negotiate with the EU . ”
Johnson has claimed said that the only obstacle to getting a deal with the EU is the belief in Brussels that Parliament will continue to block a no-deal divorce . He also claims the legislation will hand power to Jeremy Corbyn , leader of the opposition Labour Party .
Hammond countered that idea , too . “ I would sooner boil my head than hand power to the leader of the opposition , ” he said .
Labour ’ s members of Parliament held an extra meeting this morning to discuss strategy following its regular gathering last night . Two of the MPs present privately said the party had discussed the timing of a general election , with many voices telling Corbyn to delay until after Britain has left the EU .
The party is split , with the leadership keen to go for an election because they think it might put leader Jeremy Corbyn in government , while rank-and-file MPs -- who have doubts about his electoral appeal -- are much more reluctant .
Labour ’ s Treasury spokesman John McDonnell tried to put a gloss on the divisions , telling reporters the debate was about finding the best strategy for avoiding a no-deal Brexit . Even getting a law passed in Parliament to prevent that scenario -- which MPs are currently debating -- didn ’ t guarantee Boris Johnson would obey it , he said .
“ We ’ re looking at every way , having secured the legislation , of making sure that he can ’ t wriggle out , ’ ’ McDonnell said .
In the House of Commons , MPs have begun to debate a law designed to prevent the U.K. from leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31 -- something Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is willing to do if necessary . That ’ s why lawmakers voted to take control of Parliament ’ s agenda from the government late Tuesday .
Labour ’ s Hilary Benn , one of the bill ’ s sponsors , opened the debate , saying legislation is needed because threatening a no-deal Brexit is not a “ credible ” negotiating strategy .
“ What unites us is a conviction that there is no mandate for no deal , and that the consequences for the economy and for our country would be highly damaging , ” Benn said . “ No deal doesn ’ t end anything , it will simply plunge us into greater uncertainty . No deal will not be the end of Brexit , it will only be the end of the beginning . ”
No-Deal Efforts Will Limit Worst-Case Brexit Hit : BOE ( 3 p.m . )
The U.K. ’ s preparations for a no-deal Brexit may help to limit the damage to the economy , though the fallout will still be considerable , according to the Bank of England . The drop in GDP from peak to trough is less than the 8 % seen last November -- but still a dramatic 5.5 % , the central bank said as it updated its assumptions for a worst-case scenario .

Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid was reprimanded three times by Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow for being too political in his spending statement to Parliament .
John McDonnell , Labour ’ s Treasury spokesman , accused Javid of using the announcement to win votes in a coming election , which Johnson wants Parliament to approve tonight .
“ People will see this as the grubby electioneering that it is , ” McDonnell said . “ It ’ s straight out of the Lynton Crosby book of opinion poll politics , ” he said , referring to Johnson ’ s elections adviser . The Tories “ have calculated how little they have to spend ” to meet people ’ s concerns about key issues , he said .

Hilary Benn , one of the sponsors of the bill to extend Brexit negotiations , said he ’ s confident it will pass its remaining stages in the House of Commons later Wednesday and survive any filibuster attempts in the House of Lords . ( see 1:25 p.m . )
“ The question is the speed at which we can get it through the Lords but I don ’ t doubt there ’ s a majority for it there , ” Benn told ███ in an interview .
Most of the action today is in the House of Commons , but in the upper House of Lords , where the rebel Brexit bill will go next , another battle will begin this afternoon .
The opposition will be trying to seize control of the agenda , just as happened in the Commons yesterday . But unlike yesterday , it first has to get past dozens of amendments that have been proposed in an effort to filibuster the motion so there isn ’ t time for it to be passed .
The opposition definitely has enough votes , but it doesn ’ t -- yet -- have control of the timetable . Expect the sitting to go through the night , at the very least .
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said his government would support another Brexit delay if it helps secure a deal . Speaking to reporters in Dublin , he said if the U.K. does seek an extension , a persuasive case on how that would help get a divorce agreement would need to be made .
He called on Johnson ’ s administration to bring forward “ alternatives that do the same job ” as the contentious backstop plan for avoiding goods checks at the Irish border . “ We can ’ t do a deal unless we have proposals to work with , ” he added .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is keeping abreast of the political developments in London . “ The German government is watching the procedures in parliament with interest , ” her chief spokesman , Steffen Seibert , said in Berlin .
Seibert said EU member states remained willing to reach an agreement with Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s government , “ even now on Sept. 4. ” Any extension would be for the U.K. government to decide – and member states would consider it accordingly , he said .
Johnson faced an impassioned attack from Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi over a 2018 newspaper article the premier wrote . In his article , Johnson compared Muslim women wearing burqas covering their faces and bodies to letterboxes and bank-robbers .
Sikh lawmaker Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi ’ s criticism of Johnson draws applause from opposition benches . Source : ███
Dhesi drew applause from opposition MPs over his stance . Johnson did not reply directly , accusing Labour of anti-semitism . Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson admonished Johnson for his response , saying the prime minister “ must be more careful ’ ’ about what he says .
At Johnson ’ s first weekly question and answer session in Parliament , the prime minister repeated his line that the U.K. intends to leave the EU on Oct. 31 . He said the only thing that stands in the way is “ the surrender bill from the opposition . ”
Johnson called on Corbyn to say whether Labour would vote for an election , suggesting his opponent was afraid of such a contest . “ Is he frit ? ” Johnson asked , a term used by former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to accuse an opponent of cowardice . Later Johnson called Corbyn “ a chlorinated chicken ” a joke based on concerns that Brexit will lead to lower food standards .
Corbyn repeatedly asked Johnson to set out his negotiating position with the EU , which the premier repeatedly dodged . “ These negotiations are a sham , all he is doing is running down the clock , ” Corbyn said . “ I fail to see how I can be accused of undermining negotiations because no negotiations are taking place . ”
The European Commission ’ s published a 12-page note of its preparations for no-deal and one stand-out section is what it says about the Irish border and the “ backstop ” that Johnson wants removed from Theresa May ’ s deal .
The commission says the contentious “ backstop ” -- which would guarantee the border is kept free of infrastructure and controls until suitable alternative arrangements are agreed -- is the “ only solution identified that safeguards the Good Friday agreement , ensures compliance with international law obligations and preserves the integrity of the single market . ”
Pointedly , it says that in the event of a no-deal Brexit , EU law requires all goods entering Ireland from U.K. to be subject to relevant checks and controls .
The Commission and Ireland “ continue working together ” on steps for immediate aftermath of no deal and “ a more stable solution ” in the longer term , the document says .
Boris Johnson ’ s cabinet discussed the spending round at their meeting this morning , according to an statement from the Prime Minister ’ s office . The official “ readout ” didn ’ t mention any discussions about Tuesday night ’ s votes at the meeting .
The spending round , due to be announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid on Wednesday afternoon , will focus on domestic priorities , including health , schools and tackling crime , according to the statement .
The EU isn ’ t moved by last night ’ s excitement in the House of Commons , in public at least .
For European officials , Boris Johnson remains their point of contact , European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters in Brussels , distancing herself from any idea that the bloc thinks he ’ s no longer in charge .
Nothing has changed from the EU ’ s point of view , Andreeva said .
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage , who praised Johnson ’ s sacking of Tory rebels as a “ an act of real leadership , ” welcomed the appointment of Steve Baker as chairman of the Brexiteer European Research Group .
In a posting on Twitter , Farage welcomed Baker ’ s suggestion of an election pact between the two parties and that he would oppose a Brexit deal “ even if the backstop is removed . ”
“ A positive step in the right direction to deliver a clean break Brexit , ” Farage said on Twitter .
A YouGov poll published on Tuesday had the Tories on 35 % , Labour on 25 % , Liberal Democrats on 16 % and the Brexit Party on 11 % , showing the potential benefit of a pact for the party .
Former cabinet minister Greg Hands said he ’ s “ uncomfortable ” with removing the whip from the 21 Tory MPs , but described Tuesday night ’ s bill as a “ ludicrous construction ” which hands power to Brussels .
He said in an interview with Ireland ’ s RTE radio that he doesn ’ t think an election is a good idea as he doubts it would change the make up of the House of Commons that much .
Labour Brexit Spokesman Keir Starmer confirmed that Labour will not back Johnson ’ s call for a general election when it comes to Parliament on Wednesday evening .
Opposition parties -- and many Conservatives -- do not trust Johnson and want to ensure the law delaying Brexit until Jan. 31 unless Johnson can get a deal is firmly on the statute books , Starmer said .
“ We ’ re not going walk into a trap . This week it ’ s crucial we complete the task in hand , ” Starmer said in interview with BBC Radio 4 . “ We ’ re not shy of a general election but we ’ re not going to be trapped into abandoning control of Parliament , abandoning this plan . ”
Conservative MPs woke Wednesday morning nursing the political equivalent of a hangover after 21 of their colleagues were expelled for defying Johnson and backing a move to take control of Parliament to block a no-deal Brexit .
Two former chancellors of the exchequer , Kenneth Clarke and Philip Hammond , alongside Winston Churchill ’ s grandson Nicholas Soames had the whip withdrawn , meaning they are no longer Conservatives , although they remain as members of Parliament .
The move prompted astonishment from moderates . Ruth Davidson , who as leader of the party in Scotland proved a vote-winner , tweeted : “ How , in the name of all that is good and holy , is there no longer room in the Conservative Party for Nicholas Soames . ”
However , former leader Michael Howard , on the Brexit-supporting wing of the party , said the expulsion of Clarke -- his friend of sixty years -- was inevitable and followed “ the logic of events . ”
Irish Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty said it was “ comforting ” that the House of Commons had taken the first step toward forcing Boris Johnson to delay Brexit by three months in an effort to stop a no-deal split .
“ The only thing we ’ re absolutely sure that Westminster does not want is a hard Brexit , ” Doherty said in an interview with state broadcaster RTE . “ And I think that ’ s comforting . ”
The Irish gamble to stick by the backstop has been underpinned by a consistent belief that Parliament would block a no-deal Brexit , which would accelerate many of the consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU that Ireland has been trying to avoid .

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose Brexit strategy is in tatters, told lawmakers from his disintegrating Conservative party that he wants to get on with an election to stop his government going around in circles.

On Wednesday, members of Parliament are set to push their showdown with the premier over Britain’s divorce from the European Union to its climax.

Two of the MPs present privately said the party had discussed the timing of a general election, with many voices telling Corbyn to delay until after Britain has left the EU.

The party is split, with the leadership keen to go for an election because they think it might put leader Jeremy Corbyn in government, while rank-and-file MPs -- who have doubts about his electoral appeal -- are much more reluctant.

Labour’s Treasury spokesman John McDonnell tried to put a gloss on the divisions, telling reporters the debate was about finding the best strategy for avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Even getting a law passed in Parliament to prevent that scenario -- which MPs are currently debating -- didn’t guarantee Boris Johnson would obey it, he said.

“We’re looking at every way, having secured the legislation, of making sure that he can’t wriggle out,’’ McDonnell said.

MPs Begin Debate on No-Deal Brexit Law (3:40 p.m.)

In the House of Commons, MPs have begun to debate a law designed to prevent the U.K. from leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31 -- something Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is willing to do if necessary. That’s why lawmakers voted to take control of Parliament’s agenda from the government late Tuesday.

Labour’s Hilary Benn, one of the bill’s sponsors, opened the debate, saying legislation is needed because threatening a no-deal Brexit is not a “credible” negotiating strategy.

“What unites us is a conviction that there is no mandate for no deal, and that the consequences for the economy and for our country would be highly damaging,” Benn said. “No deal doesn’t end anything, it will simply plunge us into greater uncertainty. No deal will not be the end of Brexit, it will only be the end of the beginning.”

No-Deal Efforts Will Limit Worst-Case Brexit Hit: BOE (3 p.m.)

The U.K.’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit may help to limit the damage to the economy, though the fallout will still be considerable, according to the Bank of England. The drop in GDP from peak to trough is less than the 8% seen last November -- but still a dramatic 5.5%, the central bank said as it updated its assumptions for a worst-case scenario.

Javid Told Not to Electioneer in Statement (2:10 p.m.)

Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid was reprimanded three times by Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow for being too political in his spending statement to Parliament.

John McDonnell, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, accused Javid of using the announcement to win votes in a coming election, which Johnson wants Parliament to approve tonight.

“People will see this as the grubby electioneering that it is,” McDonnell said. “It’s straight out of the Lynton Crosby book of opinion poll politics,” he said, referring to Johnson’s elections adviser. The Tories “have calculated how little they have to spend” to meet people’s concerns about key issues, he said.

Benn Confident Bill Will Pass Lords (2:05 p.m.)

Hilary Benn, one of the sponsors of the bill to extend Brexit negotiations, said he’s confident it will pass its remaining stages in the House of Commons later Wednesday and survive any filibuster attempts in the House of Lords. (see 1:25 p.m.)

“The question is the speed at which we can get it through the Lords but I don’t doubt there’s a majority for it there,” Benn told Bloomberg in an interview.

House of Lords Prepares for Filibuster Fight (1.25 p.m.)

Most of the action today is in the House of Commons, but in the upper House of Lords, where the rebel Brexit bill will go next, another battle will begin this afternoon.

The opposition will be trying to seize control of the agenda, just as happened in the Commons yesterday. But unlike yesterday, it first has to get past dozens of amendments that have been proposed in an effort to filibuster the motion so there isn’t time for it to be passed.

The opposition definitely has enough votes, but it doesn’t -- yet -- have control of the timetable. Expect the sitting to go through the night, at the very least.

Irish Open to Deadline Extension (1:16 p.m.)

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said his government would support another Brexit delay if it helps secure a deal. Speaking to reporters in Dublin, he said if the U.K. does seek an extension, a persuasive case on how that would help get a divorce agreement would need to be made.

He called on Johnson’s administration to bring forward “alternatives that do the same job” as the contentious backstop plan for avoiding goods checks at the Irish border. “We can’t do a deal unless we have proposals to work with,” he added.

Merkel’s Office Says Brexit Delay Possible (1:10 p.m.)

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is keeping abreast of the political developments in London. “The German government is watching the procedures in parliament with interest,” her chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in Berlin.

Seibert said EU member states remained willing to reach an agreement with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government, “even now on Sept. 4.” Any extension would be for the U.K. government to decide – and member states would consider it accordingly, he said.

Johnson faced an impassioned attack from Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi over a 2018 newspaper article the premier wrote. In his article, Johnson compared Muslim women wearing burqas covering their faces and bodies to letterboxes and bank-robbers.

Dhesi drew applause from opposition MPs over his stance. Johnson did not reply directly, accusing Labour of anti-semitism. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson admonished Johnson for his response, saying the prime minister “must be more careful’’ about what he says.

Johnson and Corbyn Clash Over Brexit, Election (12:20 p.m.)

At Johnson’s first weekly question and answer session in Parliament, the prime minister repeated his line that the U.K. intends to leave the EU on Oct. 31. He said the only thing that stands in the way is “the surrender bill from the opposition.”

Boris Johnson on Sept. 4.

Johnson called on Corbyn to say whether Labour would vote for an election, suggesting his opponent was afraid of such a contest. “Is he frit?” Johnson asked, a term used by former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to accuse an opponent of cowardice. Later Johnson called Corbyn “a chlorinated chicken” a joke based on concerns that Brexit will lead to lower food standards.

Corbyn repeatedly asked Johnson to set out his negotiating position with the EU, which the premier repeatedly dodged. “These negotiations are a sham, all he is doing is running down the clock,” Corbyn said. “I fail to see how I can be accused of undermining negotiations because no negotiations are taking place.”

EU Sees Irish Backstop as Only Solution (11:45 a.m.)

The European Commission’s published a 12-page note of its preparations for no-deal and one stand-out section is what it says about the Irish border and the “backstop” that Johnson wants removed from Theresa May’s deal.

The commission says the contentious “backstop” -- which would guarantee the border is kept free of infrastructure and controls until suitable alternative arrangements are agreed -- is the “only solution identified that safeguards the Good Friday agreement, ensures compliance with international law obligations and preserves the integrity of the single market.”

Pointedly, it says that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, EU law requires all goods entering Ireland from U.K. to be subject to relevant checks and controls.

The Commission and Ireland “continue working together” on steps for immediate aftermath of no deal and “a more stable solution” in the longer term, the document says.

Cabinet Focused on Spending Announcement (11:35 a.m.)

Boris Johnson’s cabinet discussed the spending round at their meeting this morning, according to an statement from the Prime Minister’s office. The official “readout” didn’t mention any discussions about Tuesday night’s votes at the meeting.

The spending round, due to be announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid on Wednesday afternoon, will focus on domestic priorities, including health, schools and tackling crime, according to the statement.

EU Unmoved by Johnson’s Commons Defeat (11:20 a.m.)

The EU isn’t moved by last night’s excitement in the House of Commons, in public at least.

For European officials, Boris Johnson remains their point of contact, European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters in Brussels, distancing herself from any idea that the bloc thinks he’s no longer in charge.

Nothing has changed from the EU’s point of view, Andreeva said.

Farage Backs Brexit Pact With Tories (10:45 a.m.)

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who praised Johnson’s sacking of Tory rebels as a “an act of real leadership,” welcomed the appointment of Steve Baker as chairman of the Brexiteer European Research Group.

Nigel Farage

In a posting on Twitter, Farage welcomed Baker’s suggestion of an election pact between the two parties and that he would oppose a Brexit deal “even if the backstop is removed.”

“A positive step in the right direction to deliver a clean break Brexit,” Farage said on Twitter.

A YouGov poll published on Tuesday had the Tories on 35%, Labour on 25%, Liberal Democrats on 16% and the Brexit Party on 11%, showing the potential benefit of a pact for the party.

Hands ‘Uncomfortable’ With Tory Purge (10:10 a.m.)

Former cabinet minister Greg Hands said he’s “uncomfortable” with removing the whip from the 21 Tory MPs, but described Tuesday night’s bill as a “ludicrous construction” which hands power to Brussels.

He said in an interview with Ireland’s RTE radio that he doesn’t think an election is a good idea as he doubts it would change the make up of the House of Commons that much.

Labour Won’t Be ‘Trapped,’ Starmer Says (8:20 a.m.)

Labour Brexit Spokesman Keir Starmer confirmed that Labour will not back Johnson’s call for a general election when it comes to Parliament on Wednesday evening.

Opposition parties -- and many Conservatives -- do not trust Johnson and want to ensure the law delaying Brexit until Jan. 31 unless Johnson can get a deal is firmly on the statute books, Starmer said.

“We’re not going walk into a trap. This week it’s crucial we complete the task in hand,” Starmer said in interview with BBC Radio 4. “We’re not shy of a general election but we’re not going to be trapped into abandoning control of Parliament, abandoning this plan.”

Tories Reel after Rebels Expelled (Earlier)

Conservative MPs woke Wednesday morning nursing the political equivalent of a hangover after 21 of their colleagues were expelled for defying Johnson and backing a move to take control of Parliament to block a no-deal Brexit.

Two former chancellors of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke and Philip Hammond, alongside Winston Churchill’s grandson Nicholas Soames had the whip withdrawn, meaning they are no longer Conservatives, although they remain as members of Parliament.

The move prompted astonishment from moderates. Ruth Davidson, who as leader of the party in Scotland proved a vote-winner, tweeted: “How, in the name of all that is good and holy, is there no longer room in the Conservative Party for Nicholas Soames.”

However, former leader Michael Howard, on the Brexit-supporting wing of the party, said the expulsion of Clarke -- his friend of sixty years -- was inevitable and followed “the logic of events.”

Irish Take Comfort From Westminster (Earlier)

Irish Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty said it was “comforting” that the House of Commons had taken the first step toward forcing Boris Johnson to delay Brexit by three months in an effort to stop a no-deal split.

“The only thing we’re absolutely sure that Westminster does not want is a hard Brexit,” Doherty said in an interview with state broadcaster RTE. “And I think that’s comforting.”

The Irish gamble to stick by the backstop has been underpinned by a consistent belief that Parliament would block a no-deal Brexit, which would accelerate many of the consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU that Ireland has been trying to avoid.

President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will meet Queen Elizabeth II for tea at Windsor Castle on Friday in an encounter that will last less than a hour and involve some of the ceremonial flourish the British do so well.

The Trumps should be impressed, as most American visitors to Windsor usually are. And according to the U.S. ambassador to Britain, it's a meeting Trump longed for.

He's spending only a few days in the United Kingdom, including meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May and visiting his golf courses in Scotland, but meeting the monarch is usually the main event.

Will Trump take to Twitter to bash a few more targets, as he has already done at the NATO summit he's attending in Belgium? Will he stick to the rules – no hugging the queen, please – or will there be a faux pas?

And what will stylish Melania wear? She's already turning heads in Belgium.

Here's what to expect, according to Buckingham Palace:

Where it will happen:

Windsor Castle is about a half-hour's drive west of London, which the Americans want to avoid due to the expected anti-Trump protesters in the capital city.

The castle is the world's oldest (more than 900 years old) and largest inhabited royal castle in the world, a massive (nearly 500,000 square feet) fortress built by William the Conqueror and occupying 13 acres.

It's also the queen's favorite royal residence and where she spends most weekends when she is in London. (Buckingham Palace, with about 600 rooms, is her weekday work home.)

In May, Windsor's St. George's Chapel was the scene of her grandson Prince Harry's wedding to former American actress Meghan Markle, now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a spectacular royal celebration watched around the world.

What happens first:

The Trumps will shake hands with the 92-year-old monarch. Her husband, Prince Philip, 97, who has retired from public life, is not expected to join them.

British men usually bow their heads and British women curtsy when meeting the queen, but they don't have to, and Americans and other nationalities don't have to, either.

Palace officials usually tell newcomers to relax – the days of ""off with 'is 'head!"" are over. On the official website of the British monarchy, the advice is pretty simple: Be polite.

""There are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting The Queen or a member of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe the traditional forms.""

The ceremonial details:

Her Majesty will welcome the Trumps in the Quadrangle of the castle, the large open area surrounded by Clarence, Queen's, Augusta, York and Lancaster Towers and the King George IV Gate.

A Guard of Honor, formed of the Coldstream Guards, will give a Royal Salute (""God Save the Queen"") and then the American national anthem will be played.

Trump, who is known to appreciate military flourish, will be pleased to see the Coldstream Guards, the oldest continuously serving regiment in the British Army. It's an elite infantry unit but it's also justly famous for its high-profile ceremonial duties, such as parading for the monarch.

Then the queen and the president will inspect the Guard of Honor before watching the military march past.

What happens next:

The Trumps will then join the queen inside the castle for tea.

Buckingham Palace did not specify in which room – the castle has about 1,000 – but the queen's sitting room is a possibility.

It is known that President Trump is a teetotaler; it's not clear if he's a tea drinker.

How often does the queen receive presidents at Windsor Castle?

According to the palace, she's received three other U.S. presidents at the castle since 1982, the most recent being President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama in 2016 when she hosted a private lunch there for the presidential couple. (Later, the Obamas had dinner with Prince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge at Kensington Palace, where they met little Prince George.)

The queen received President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush in 2008, and she hosted President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan in 1982. The queen and Reagan, both skilled riders and horse fans, went for a canter in the private Home Park of the castle.

How many presidents total has the queen met?

Trump is 12th American president out of 13 serving presidents the queen has met in her 66 years on her throne. (President Lyndon Johnson was the only one she's missed meeting.)",www.usatoday.com,center,AFYoVWWw2rq7fTc2

Commons speaker John Bercow has spoken to reporters outside Parliament , answering the questions over when Parliament would resume , given the Supreme Court has given it leave to do so whenever it wishes . The answer is Wednesday morning , with opportunities for members to make urgent questions , request emergency debates , and to hold ministers to account . Expect fireworks .
BREAKING : Speaker Bercow : Parliament Will ‘ Resume ’ Wednesday After Supreme Court Nullification of Suspension https : //t.co/2kWH5SaOKa — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) September 24 , 2019
Anti-Brexit politicians have leapt upon the ruling as resembling a fatal blow against Boris Johnson , who it is claimed could be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history if he were ousted now . But what or who could replace Mr Johnson is not clear as no single party can command a majority in Parliament .
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed his party ’ s annual conference in Brighton as the ruling was made , and told the delegates there that the Prime Minister should “ consider his position ” . Speaking outside the Supreme Court former Tory MP turned independent Anna Soubry also called on the Prime Minister to resign , saying it was time for what she unironically calls a government of national unity to take power . Presumably formed of a coalition of opposition parties , the purpose of the much-discussed “ unity ” government would be to overturn Brexit , it has been claimed — despite delivering Brexit being the majority position in the United Kingdom .
The first question was whether the court even had the right to consider the question — a matter of jurisdiction . Some had argued the division of powers under the UK constitution meant it would not be proper for the unelected judiciary to make decisions on the acts of the executive — the government — but the court disagreed , stating they believed they had the right . In the words of Lady Brenda Hale who read out the unanimous decision of the 11 justices , the matter was “ judicable ” , and for for them to decide on .
Lady Hale explained : “ …this was not an ordinary prorogation in the run-up to a Queen ’ s speech . It prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role in five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and the exit day on the 31st of October . Proroguing Parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess .
“ While Parliament is Prorogued , neither house can meet , debate , or pass legislation . Neither house can debate government policy . Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers , or meet and take evidence in committees . ”
Of the decision to Prorogue itself , Lady Hale said : “ The decision to ask her majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without justification . ”
Mr Johnson had used a mechanism known in Westminster parlance as Prorogation to suspend Parliament , usually a normal and regular event in Parliamentary life , but one met this time with outrage by anti-Brexiteers . Normal Parliamentary sessions have lasted between one and two years , being regularly suspended to clear out old unfinished legislation and to allow new government programmes to be launched .
But amid the endless Parliamentary discussion over whether to honour the result of the 2016 referendum which saw the British people vote by a margin of over one million votes — the largest democratic mandate given in British history — this Parliamentary session has rumbled on , becoming the longest since the infamous ‘ long Parliament ’ of the English Civil War .
The government under Mr Johnson insisted given those circumstances , and the fact the UK government has not yet been able to introduce new domestic legislation , it was reasonable to suspend Parliament .
Anti-Brexit activists claim the Prime Minister not only lied to the country , but lied to the Queen , as under the British constitutional system she has to be asked as a formality to suspend Parliament .
The Associated Press has created this handy timeline of the most recent events leading up to today , to give some context for today ’ s ruling :
July 24 , 2019 : Boris Johnson becomes prime minister after winning a party leadership contest to succeed Theresa May . He vows to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 , with or without a deal .
August 28 : Johnson suspends Parliament for a five-week period ending Oct. 14 . Queen Elizabeth II approves his request , as she is required to do under Britain ’ s constitutional monarchy . He says it is a routine decision to set the stage for announcement of his new domestic agenda , but House of Commons Speaker John Bercow calls it a “ constitutional outrage . ”
August 29 : Activist Gina Miller launches legal action against Johnson at the High Court in London . Her case is subsequently joined by former prime minister John Major and others .
August 30 : In a separate case , a judge in Scotland refuses to grant an emergency measure blocking the suspension of Parliament but schedules a full hearing at a later date .
September 4 : The Court of Session in Scotland rejects the bid to have the suspension declared unlawful .
September 5 : The High Court in London hears Miller ’ s case against the suspension . Her lawyers argue the move was an “ unlawful abuse of power ” by the prime minister .
September 6 : The High Court in London rejects Miller ’ s case . She vows to take it to the Supreme Court .
September 11 : The Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland rules that the suspension was illegal and was intended to “ stymie ” Parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline .
September 17 : A three-day hearing on both cases begins at the Supreme Court , with 11 justices presiding .
September 24 : The Supreme Court is scheduled to announce its decision .","The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks, a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union.

Update 1330: Boris Johnson speaks

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted, speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York, insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned.

In remarks that have already angered remainers, the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain’s withdrawal from going ahead.

The Prime Minister told the BBC:

Update 1220: Parliament will resume session tomorrow

Commons speaker John Bercow has spoken to reporters outside Parliament, answering the questions over when Parliament would resume, given the Supreme Court has given it leave to do so whenever it wishes. The answer is Wednesday morning, with opportunities for members to make urgent questions, request emergency debates, and to hold ministers to account. Expect fireworks.

Update 1115: Calls for the Prime Minister to resign

Anti-Brexit politicians have leapt upon the ruling as resembling a fatal blow against Boris Johnson, who it is claimed could be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history if he were ousted now. But what or who could replace Mr Johnson is not clear as no single party can command a majority in Parliament.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed his party’s annual conference in Brighton as the ruling was made, and told the delegates there that the Prime Minister should “consider his position”. Speaking outside the Supreme Court former Tory MP turned independent Anna Soubry also called on the Prime Minister to resign, saying it was time for what she unironically calls a government of national unity to take power. Presumably formed of a coalition of opposition parties, the purpose of the much-discussed “unity” government would be to overturn Brexit, it has been claimed — despite delivering Brexit being the majority position in the United Kingdom.

The original story continues below:

The first question was whether the court even had the right to consider the question — a matter of jurisdiction. Some had argued the division of powers under the UK constitution meant it would not be proper for the unelected judiciary to make decisions on the acts of the executive — the government — but the court disagreed, stating they believed they had the right. In the words of Lady Brenda Hale who read out the unanimous decision of the 11 justices, the matter was “judicable”, and for for them to decide on.

Lady Hale explained: “…this was not an ordinary prorogation in the run-up to a Queen’s speech. It prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role in five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and the exit day on the 31st of October. Proroguing Parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess.

“While Parliament is Prorogued, neither house can meet, debate, or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers, or meet and take evidence in committees.”

Of the decision to Prorogue itself, Lady Hale said: “The decision to ask her majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without justification.”

Mr Johnson had used a mechanism known in Westminster parlance as Prorogation to suspend Parliament, usually a normal and regular event in Parliamentary life, but one met this time with outrage by anti-Brexiteers. Normal Parliamentary sessions have lasted between one and two years, being regularly suspended to clear out old unfinished legislation and to allow new government programmes to be launched.

But amid the endless Parliamentary discussion over whether to honour the result of the 2016 referendum which saw the British people vote by a margin of over one million votes — the largest democratic mandate given in British history — this Parliamentary session has rumbled on, becoming the longest since the infamous ‘long Parliament’ of the English Civil War.

The government under Mr Johnson insisted given those circumstances, and the fact the UK government has not yet been able to introduce new domestic legislation, it was reasonable to suspend Parliament.

Anti-Brexit activists claim the Prime Minister not only lied to the country, but lied to the Queen, as under the British constitutional system she has to be asked as a formality to suspend Parliament.

The Associated Press has created this handy timeline of the most recent events leading up to today, to give some context for today’s ruling:

July 24, 2019: Boris Johnson becomes prime minister after winning a party leadership contest to succeed Theresa May. He vows to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.

August 28: Johnson suspends Parliament for a five-week period ending Oct. 14. Queen Elizabeth II approves his request, as she is required to do under Britain’s constitutional monarchy. He says it is a routine decision to set the stage for announcement of his new domestic agenda, but House of Commons Speaker John Bercow calls it a “constitutional outrage.”

August 29: Activist Gina Miller launches legal action against Johnson at the High Court in London. Her case is subsequently joined by former prime minister John Major and others.

August 30: In a separate case, a judge in Scotland refuses to grant an emergency measure blocking the suspension of Parliament but schedules a full hearing at a later date.

September 4: The Court of Session in Scotland rejects the bid to have the suspension declared unlawful.

September 5: The High Court in London hears Miller’s case against the suspension. Her lawyers argue the move was an “unlawful abuse of power” by the prime minister.

September 6: The High Court in London rejects Miller’s case. She vows to take it to the Supreme Court.

September 11: The Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland rules that the suspension was illegal and was intended to “stymie” Parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline.

September 17: A three-day hearing on both cases begins at the Supreme Court, with 11 justices presiding.

September 24: The Supreme Court is scheduled to announce its decision.",www.breitbart.com,right,swQqvYCP44OX6z1M
great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47533666,Brexit: May in final push to convince MPs to back deal,,,"MPs are voting on Theresa May 's Brexit deal after she made a final bid to convince them to back it .
Battling a sore throat after late night talks with the EU , the prime minister urged MPs to vote for her `` improved deal '' or risk `` no Brexit at all '' .
But some leading Tory Brexiteers and the DUP , who keep her government in power , have rejected the deal .
They say the legal assurances secured by the PM are not enough to prevent the UK being tied permanently to the EU .
Sir Bill Cash , a leading Brexiteer , said : `` In the light of our own legal analysis and others we do not recommend accepting the government 's motion today . ''
Sir Bill was part of a panel of legally-trained Brexiteer MPs who examined the PM 's revised deal , concluding that it did not deliver the binding changes MPs had demanded .
Another Brexit-supporting Tory , Jacob Rees-Mogg , said he had not yet decided which way to vote .
Conservative MP Simon Clarke , leaving a meeting of Mr Rees-Mogg 's European Research Group , said a `` majority '' of the group would vote against the deal .
The DUP said in a statement that `` sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time '' .
Commons Speaker John Bercow did not select any of the amendments to the government motion that had been tabled by MPs .
With husband Philip watching from the public gallery , Mrs May made a final plea to MPs to `` come together '' and `` prove beyond all doubt that democracy comes before party , faction or personal ambition '' .
`` This is the moment and this is the time , '' she said .
`` Back this motion and get the deal done , because only then can we get on with what we came here to do - what we were sent here to do .
`` We can not serve our country by overturning a democratic decision of the British people . ''
The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March . MPs voted overwhelmingly to reject the PM 's deal on 15 January by 432 votes to 202 .
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that `` after three months of running down the clock '' the prime minister had `` achieved not a single change to the withdrawal agreement '' .
He said it was the same `` bad deal '' MPs had rejected in January and Labour would be voting against it again because it `` risks people 's living standards '' , jobs and the NHS .

Charles Walker , vice chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs , said defeat for the government in the vote later would lead to a general election .
He told BBC Radio 4 's World At One : `` If it does n't go through tonight , as sure as night follows day , there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks .
He added : `` She will lead us into that general election . We have n't got time for a leadership election . ''
Downing Street said : `` We are not preparing for and we do not want a general election . ''
It comes after Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told MPs the legal risk of being tied to the EU after Brexit `` remains unchanged '' .
He added that the new assurances secured by the PM did `` reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained '' in the Irish backstop if talks on the two sides future relationship broke down due to `` bad faith '' by the EU .
He defined `` bad faith '' as a `` pattern of refusing to accept reasonable proposals '' on the Irish backstop .
But he said the question of whether a satisfactory post-Brexit deal on a permanent trading relationship can be reached remained `` a political judgment '' - and he said MPs should back the PM 's deal .

Conservative MPs leaving the meeting suggested half of those who voted against the deal last time will switch to support it later , said BBC 's Chief Political Correspondent Vicky Young .

The decision to reject a stripped-down version of May ’ s divorce deal has left it totally unclear how , when or even whether Britain will leave the EU , and plunges the three-year Brexit crisis to a deeper level of uncertainty .
“ I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House , ” May told parliament after the defeat . “ The implications of the House ’ s decision are grave . ”
Within minutes of the vote - which took place as thousands of Brexit supporters protested outside parliament - European Council President Donald Tusk said EU leaders would meet on April 10 to discuss Britain ’ s departure from the bloc .

The decision to reject a stripped-down version of May’s divorce deal has left it totally unclear how, when or even whether Britain will leave the EU, and plunges the three-year Brexit crisis to a deeper level of uncertainty.

“I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House,” May told parliament after the defeat. “The implications of the House’s decision are grave.”

Within minutes of the vote - which took place as thousands of Brexit supporters protested outside parliament - European Council President Donald Tusk said EU leaders would meet on April 10 to discuss Britain’s departure from the bloc.

A succession of European leaders said there was a very real chance Britain would now leave without a deal, a scenario that businesses fear would cause chaos for the world’s fifth-biggest economy.

TALKS TO CONTINUE

May had offered on Wednesday to resign if the deal passed, in a bid to win over eurosceptic rebels in her Conservative Party who support a more decisive break with the EU than the divorce her deal offers.

The vote leaves her Brexit strategy in tatters. With no majority in parliament for any Brexit option so far, it is unclear what May will now do. Options include asking the EU for a long delay, parliament forcing an election, or a “no-deal” exit.

However, May’s spokesman said she would continue talks with opponents of the deal and some political correspondents said she could bring it back a fourth time, perhaps in a “run-off” against any alternative that parliament itself came up with.

Analysis

By BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy

Sir Oliver's amendment is a cunningly-crafted proposition which, crucially, could be voted for by MPs who want a deal, but don't trust this one, and don't trust the government.

It rests on the idea that were Parliament to approve the deal for the purposes of the Benn Act now, there might then be a danger that the subsequent legislation to enact it might be, somehow, derailed, resulting in a no-deal exit on 31 October.

With the Benn Act out of the way, they believe that some manoeuvre, some legislative judo move, by factions inside and outside the government, who favour a ""clean Brexit"" could leave no time for any effective counter… and Britain would be out, with no deal.

This reflects the sheer level of distrust that has accumulated over several cycles of Brexit angst.

Can Boris Johnson win the vote?

The winning post for votes in the House of Commons is 320 if everyone turns up - seven Sinn Fein MPs do not sit and the Speaker and three deputies do not vote.

There are currently 287 voting Conservative MPs. The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them.

Then, if the DUP will not support his deal, he will need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all.

That is still not quite enough, though, so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents. In March, when MPs voted on Theresa May's deal for the third time, five Labour MPs backed it, plus two ex-Labour independents.

This time it is likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal.

What they didn ’ t expect was for the president , a former reality TV star , to arrange a surprise meeting with the woman who is suspected in the crash . According to a family spokesperson , cameras were standing by ready to capture the encounter .
The parents of the British teen killed in a car crash with a US diplomat 's wife met President Donald Trump in the White House on Tuesday . The couple expected to push the president to waive diplomatic immunity for the American woman , so they can seek justice for their son .
The victim of the crash , Harry Dunn , was 19 when he was killed in the August accident .

The suspect was not identified by authorities but has been widely named as Anne Sacoolas by British media and politicians since .
Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity and fled the UK earlier this October , despite initially telling police she would cooperate with the investigation , police said .
Many are now calling for Sacoolas to return to the UK so the investigation can continue .

Foot ’ s election manifesto was memorably described as “ the longest suicide note in history. ” This morning , Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into its next election , but hinted that he would stick around for “ a period of reflection ” while the Party figures out what to do . Johnson was more succinct . “ We have defeated Corbyn , ” he said .
It was a terrible night for the United Kingdom . Johnson and the Conservatives can look forward to great power in London in the coming years , but Scotland , Northern Ireland , England , and Wales increasingly look like nations coming apart . The Scottish National Party , which opposes Brexit and wants independence , won forty-eight out of fifty-nine seats in Scotland . The Party ’ s leader , Nicola Sturgeon , said that she would write to Johnson before Christmas to request another referendum to break the union with England , which has lasted for three hundred and twelve years . “ I have a mandate to give Scotland a choice for an alternative future , ” she said . One nationalism breeds another . In Northern Ireland , which under Johnson ’ s Brexit deal will be separated from mainland Britain by a regime of customs checks , the Conservatives ’ former allies , the Democratic Unionist Party , lost two of its ten seats . The D.U.P. ’ s veteran leader in Parliament , Nigel Dodds , lost his seat , in North Belfast , to John Finucane , a Sinn Fein candidate whose father was murdered by pro-union terrorists during the Troubles . “ North Belfast rejects Brexit , ” Finucane said . “ North Belfast is a Remain constituency and wants a future as part of the European Union. ” Johnson must now hold a creaking entity together . This morning , he described the Conservatives as “ a great one-nation party , ” meaning that they represent the whole of the U.K . But there is only one nation where Brexit and Johnson ’ s populism have truly flourished , and that is England . There the map is Conservative blue .
The questions for Labour are existential . Under Tony Blair , the Party merged its historic base in Scotland and the industrial north of England with metropolitan liberals and floating commuter voters in the south . Two elections ago , in 2015 , the S.N.P . virtually banished Labour from Scotland , stripping the Party of around forty M.P.s . Last night , Labour lost another fifty-nine seats , this time in former mining and manufacturing communities across the north , where it had dominated the vote since the First World War . In Blyth Valley , a constituency north of Newcastle , the Conservatives won for the first time since 1950 , when the electoral district was created . In Blair ’ s old parliamentary seat of Sedgefield , the Labour vote collapsed by seventeen per cent . The new M.P. , Paul Howell , is the first Conservative to represent the town since 1931 . Many of the seats that Labour lost were in parts of the country that voted to leave the European Union three years ago . This morning , Johnson acknowledged that , in places like Burnley , Bassetlaw , and Bishop Auckland , which has voted for Liberal and Labour M.P.s since 1885 , people had turned to the Conservatives to deliver Brexit . The Prime Minister described leaving the E.U . as now the “ irrefutable , irresistible , unarguable decision of the British people. ” He said that he would work flat-out to enact it . “ You may intend to return to Labour next time round , ” Johnson said . “ If that is the case , I am humbled that you have put your trust in me , and I will never take your support for granted . ”
But Brexit alone does not explain Labour ’ s weak performance . Since 2016 , the Party has stretched and strained to accommodate its traditional supporters , many of whom voted for Brexit . Corbyn himself is no fan of the E.U . The trouble is that Labour ’ s demographic coalition—the British equivalent of the group that the Democratic Party must hold together in 2020—is losing its glue . Corbyn ’ s metropolitan socialism , his big-ticket nationalizations and green industrial strategy , did not cut it in communities that had voted Labour for generations . They were ideas that came from somewhere else . In Bolsover , Derbyshire , Dennis Skinner , Labour ’ s eighty-seven-year-old M.P. , had held office since before his Conservative opponent was born . Like seventy per cent of his constituents , Skinner supported Brexit . But he lost by more than five thousand votes . Mark Fletcher , who won the seat for the Tories , told the Financial Times that Corbyn ’ s unpopularity had been decisive . “ Anti-Corbyn sentiment was the biggest thing I picked up on the doorstep , ” Fletcher said . “ Brexit would be number two . Number three would be the sense of not being listened to , taken for granted . ”
What does Johnson ’ s victory mean ? In short order , it means that the debate over Brexit , which has traumatized British politics for the past three and a half years , is over . With a compliant House of Commons , Johnson will take the country out of the E.U . on January 31st . He will also have considerable leeway in the trade negotiations that follow . Johnson has promised to settle a new free-trade deal with the E.U . by the end of 2020 . Most experts and diplomats agree that this is impossible , but Johnson will have a rancorous British Parliament cheering him on . No one on the right will stand up to him . Everyone else will hope that a softer , less divisive Johnson will emerge , now that he has been elected Prime Minister by the population as a whole . This morning , there has already been speculation that Johnson will use his margin of victory to pivot to the center—negotiating a close partnership with the E.U . and governing as a moderate—but this is based on nothing at all . Rejoicing at Conservative Party headquarters , Johnson sounded almost dazed by what had happened . “ We must now understand the earthquake we have created , the way in which we have changed the political map of this country , ” he said . “ We must grapple with the consequences of that. ” President Trump tweeted his congratulations , teasing the offer of “ a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT ” to the U.K. Those entreaties will be hard to resist , as will the political instincts that have carried Johnson this far . During the campaign , he made strikingly few promises—there was Brexit , some more police , a few new hospitals—and nothing much else . Johnson has achieved a momentous political triumph through discord , populism , and a few bon mots . Why on earth would he stop now ?","Speaking before dawn at Conservative Party headquarters on Friday morning, Boris Johnson celebrated “a huge, great stonking mandate” from the British people, after his party won an overwhelming victory in Thursday’s election. The Conservatives now have three hundred and sixty-four members of Parliament—a majority of almost eighty over the the other parties—and enormous freedom to govern for the next five years. The vote is a turning point. It is the best result for the Tories since 1987, and the first time since the days of Margaret Thatcher that the Party has decisively won the argument about the future of the country. The argument, of course, was about Brexit, at least for Johnson. “Get Brexit Done” was his slogan and sole focus. For Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party, whose election manifesto was anything but myopic—an eye-catching grab-bag of progressive ideas to address inequality and climate change, arranged around a complicated Brexit policy—this was a disaster. The party held on to just two hundred and three seats in the House of Commons, its worst result since the Depression, and more or less in line with the defeat of Michael Foot, its most recent radical left-wing leader, in 1983.

The so-called `` meaningful vote '' comes at the end of five days of debate over the plan .
Mrs May called for politicians to back her deal or risk `` letting the British people down '' .
But with many of her own MPs expected to join opposition parties to vote against the deal , it is widely expected to be defeated .
Labour , the SNP and Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh all pulled the amendments that they had proposed to the deal before they came to a vote .
Tory MP John Baron insisted MPs vote on his - which would have given the UK the right to terminate the Northern Ireland backstop without the agreement of the EU - but it was defeated by 600 votes to 24 .
Closing the debate on her deal , Mrs May said the responsibility of MPs was `` profound '' and that her deal `` delivers on the core tenets of Brexit ... in a way that protects jobs , ensures our security and honours the integrity of our United Kingdom '' .
But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said backing the `` botched and damaging '' deal would be a `` reckless leap in the dark '' for the UK .
The prime minister addressed her cabinet on Tuesday morning before heading to the Commons for the start of the debate on her deal - which includes both the withdrawal agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves the EU and a political declaration for the future relationship .
She had spent the lead up to the vote trying to reassure MPs from all sides of the House over the controversial Northern Irish `` backstop '' - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland - having received new written assurances from the EU that it would be temporary and , if triggered , would last for `` the shortest possible period '' .
Speaking at the close of the debate , Mrs May added : `` If we leave with the deal I am proposing , I believe we can lay the foundations for which to build a better Britain .
`` And as prime minister I would not stand at this dispatch box and recommended a course of action that I do not believe is in the best interests of our country and our future . ''

A rally by supporters of the People 's Vote campaign for another referendum is currently taking place in nearby Parliament Square .
Opening the final day of the debate earlier , Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave an impassioned speech to the Commons with the prime minister by his side , saying that voting for the deal was `` the first of two keys that will unlock our future with the European Union '' , allowing the government to focus on the future relationship .
He said that MPs could not underestimate the complexity of Brexit and that the deal offered an `` orderly , predictable and legally certain '' way of leaving the bloc , without `` thousands '' of legal issues arising for citizens and businesses .
`` If you found yourself suddenly with the rug pulled from under you , not knowing what your legal obligations would be , you would say to this House , 'What are you playing at ? What are you doing ? '
`` You are not children in the playground , you are legislators , and it is your job . We are playing with people 's lives , '' he said .
But many remain opposed to the deal , with about 100 Conservative MPs and the DUP 's 10 MPs expected to join Labour and the other opposition parties in voting it down .
Mr Corbyn told the Commons : `` The prime minister has treated Brexit as a matter for the Conservative Party rather than for the good of the country . But she has failed to even win over her own party .
`` This deal is a bad deal for our economy , a bad deal for our democracy , and a bad deal for this country . ''
Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said that Brexiteers like him could back a deal if aspects such as the backstop were dealt with .
But he told the Today programme the EU had played `` a smart game of hard ball '' and said it was time for the UK to do the same .
Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said the backstop `` was something that we could not accept '' and said her party 's MPs would be voting against the deal .
`` It ( the backstop ) does violence to the union - it separates us from the rest of the United Kingdom in a very very obvious way , '' she said , calling for Mrs May to `` get rid '' of the backstop .
And speaking during the Commons debate , the leader of the SNP at Westminster , Ian Blackford , reiterated his belief that there was `` no such thing as a good Brexit '' and his party would continue to fight against leaving .
`` There is no way that the Scottish National Party and the people of Scotland are going to be sitting in that bus as the prime minister drives us off the cliff , '' he said .
BBC Brussels correspondent , Adam Fleming , said the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will be returning to the city later to deal with `` Brexit-related business '' , fuelling speculation Mrs May will make an emergency visit on Wednesday if her deal is voted down .
When asked by the BBC for a message to MPs ahead of the vote , he said : `` I would like them to behave in a responsible way . ''
The EU 's chief Brexit negotiator , Michel Barnier , also appealed for MPs to `` keep calm '' when voting later .
He will be holding talks with the European Parliament 's Brexit steering group later tonight in Strasbourg before a debate on Wednesday morning about the result of the meaningful vote .
The deal suffered a heavy defeat in the House of Lords on Monday night , as peers backed a Labour motion by 321 votes to 152 .
While the Lords vote carries no real weight , as peers accepted MPs should have the final say , the motion - which also rejected a `` no deal '' scenario - expressed `` regret '' that Mrs May 's deal would `` damage the future economic prosperity , internal security and global influence '' of the UK .

great_britain,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://spectator.org/may-turns-brexit-into-wrecks-it/,OPINION: May Turns Brexit Into Wrecks-It,,"Jed Babbin, Raheem Kassam, F.H. Buckley, Stephen Maclean","Friday was supposed to be “ Brexit Day , ” when the United Kingdom once again became a sovereign nation independent of the European Union . Instead , it was the day that the UK ’ s parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May ’ s awful Brexit deal for the third time .
May has lost power in great chunks since grabbing the PM job when David Cameron resigned . She called a snap election in 2017 and lost her party ’ s majority in Parliament in the result .
Her critics in the UK and the EU have levied severe criticism for her action invoking Article 50 of the EU ’ s principal treaty , triggering the two-year period to negotiate an exit deal before she had any plan for negotiating such a deal . Those criticisms are all correct , but do nothing to resolve the crisis that Brexit has come to be .
May ’ s deal includes the “ Irish backstop , ” a provision designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic . If invoked by the EU after a transition period that lasts until the end of 2020 , the backstop would effectively keep the entire UK in the EU indefinitely .
The backstop is just one of the biggest stumbling blocks in May ’ s deal . ( The Irish are being at least slightly more helpful than they were during Easter week 1916 . )
The backstop , and other features of May ’ s deal , led Parliament to reject it by 230 votes in January and by 149 votes earlier in March . In the 29 March vote , May lost by only 58 votes . Before that vote , May promised that if her plan were approved , she ’ d resign . Despite her enormous unpopularity and clear failure as PM , even that wasn ’ t enough to get her bad deal passed .
Now , she ’ s reportedly planning a fourth vote this week . May apparently believes that if she can get Parliament to vote on the same question enough times that she ’ ll eventually win approval of her deal .
And she might . But the three votes that have already turned her deal down are decisive in one sense . They have already robbed any fourth — or fifth or whatever number vote — of legitimacy .
House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has tried to impose some parliamentary order on May ’ s continued votes . After the second vote , he ruled that another vote couldn ’ t be held unless the government ’ s motion was changed substantially . So May ’ s team made it different by chopping off half of it . The part that was voted down on Friday contained only the separation mechanism and left out entirely the provisions governing future relations between the UK and the EU . It was , as several critics said , a truly “ blind Brexit. ” No wonder it failed to gain Parliament ’ s approval .
In the UK ’ s system , the prime minister ’ s government — not Parliament – usually controls Parliament ’ s agenda . It votes on what the PM submits to it . Not anymore , at least on Brexit . Parliament has seized control of its own agenda and is making as much of a mess of it as May has .
In eight “ indicative ” votes last week , Parliament turned down every sensible alternative to May ’ s deal . Among the ones rejected are : leaving the EU without a deal ; adding a permanent “ customs union ” to May ’ s deal , and adoption of a soft Brexit modeled on Norway ’ s complicated quasi-membership in the EU . Others that were rejected include holding a second Brexit referendum in the UK and canceling the Article 50 notice that the UK is quitting the EU .
The EU consented to move Brexit Day from 29 March 29 to April 12 , presuming May ’ s deal is passed by then . If it isn ’ t , Brexit Day will be May 22 , supposedly avoiding the necessity of UK candidates running in the coming EU elections . But if May and the EU agree on more delays , the UK will have to run elections for representation to an organization it ’ s supposedly quitting .
By those actions , the UK Parliament has stuck its head in the sand , refusing to take any responsibility for the wreck of the HMS Brexit . Why should they when Theresa May is willing to serve as the UK ’ s chief javelin catcher until the Brexit mess is over ?
The only sensible outcome for the UK is a no-deal Brexit . That would free it up to negotiate trade agreements with any nation , which it can ’ t do as an EU member or as a member of a customs union with the EU .

Instead, it was the day that the UK’s parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s awful Brexit deal for the third time.

Astonishingly, it’s not entirely Theresa May’s fault. Just mostly.

May has lost power in great chunks since grabbing the PM job when David Cameron resigned. She called a snap election in 2017 and lost her party’s majority in Parliament in the result.

Her critics in the UK and the EU have levied severe criticism for her action invoking Article 50 of the EU’s principal treaty, triggering the two-year period to negotiate an exit deal before she had any plan for negotiating such a deal. Those criticisms are all correct, but do nothing to resolve the crisis that Brexit has come to be.

May’s deal includes the “Irish backstop,” a provision designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. If invoked by the EU after a transition period that lasts until the end of 2020, the backstop would effectively keep the entire UK in the EU indefinitely.

The backstop is just one of the biggest stumbling blocks in May’s deal. (The Irish are being at least slightly more helpful than they were during Easter week 1916.)

The backstop, and other features of May’s deal, led Parliament to reject it by 230 votes in January and by 149 votes earlier in March. In the 29 March vote, May lost by only 58 votes. Before that vote, May promised that if her plan were approved, she’d resign. Despite her enormous unpopularity and clear failure as PM, even that wasn’t enough to get her bad deal passed.

Now, she’s reportedly planning a fourth vote this week. May apparently believes that if she can get Parliament to vote on the same question enough times that she’ll eventually win approval of her deal.

And she might. But the three votes that have already turned her deal down are decisive in one sense. They have already robbed any fourth — or fifth or whatever number vote — of legitimacy.

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has tried to impose some parliamentary order on May’s continued votes. After the second vote, he ruled that another vote couldn’t be held unless the government’s motion was changed substantially. So May’s team made it different by chopping off half of it. The part that was voted down on Friday contained only the separation mechanism and left out entirely the provisions governing future relations between the UK and the EU. It was, as several critics said, a truly “blind Brexit.” No wonder it failed to gain Parliament’s approval.

In the UK’s system, the prime minister’s government — not Parliament – usually controls Parliament’s agenda. It votes on what the PM submits to it. Not anymore, at least on Brexit. Parliament has seized control of its own agenda and is making as much of a mess of it as May has.

In eight “indicative” votes last week, Parliament turned down every sensible alternative to May’s deal. Among the ones rejected are: leaving the EU without a deal; adding a permanent “customs union” to May’s deal, and adoption of a soft Brexit modeled on Norway’s complicated quasi-membership in the EU. Others that were rejected include holding a second Brexit referendum in the UK and canceling the Article 50 notice that the UK is quitting the EU.

The EU consented to move Brexit Day from 29 March 29 to April 12, presuming May’s deal is passed by then. If it isn’t, Brexit Day will be May 22, supposedly avoiding the necessity of UK candidates running in the coming EU elections. But if May and the EU agree on more delays, the UK will have to run elections for representation to an organization it’s supposedly quitting.

By those actions, the UK Parliament has stuck its head in the sand, refusing to take any responsibility for the wreck of the HMS Brexit. Why should they when Theresa May is willing to serve as the UK’s chief javelin catcher until the Brexit mess is over?

The only sensible outcome for the UK is a no-deal Brexit. That would free it up to negotiate trade agreements with any nation, which it can’t do as an EU member or as a member of a customs union with the EU. It would leave the issue of trade between the UK and the EU to the reasonable rules of the World Trade Organization.

But the Irish on both sides of the border — May’s ally, the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, and the Irish Republic — are both unwilling to risk uncertainty of controls on the border between them.

Time is the greatest limiting factor now. May won’t resign and isn’t susceptible to another intra-party “no confidence” motion until December. If she did resign, it’s very unlikely that the Conservative Party she supposedly leads would come up with a new leader before the May 22 Brexit date. Even if she called another snap general election, it can’t be held by then. Angry Tories have reportedly told her they’d block a snap election.

The most likely outcomes are the worst. May probably will — despite John Bercow’s efforts — get more votes on her deal until it passes. As I said before, the outcome of any further vote approving her deal cannot be legitimate. The other possible outcome – canceling or delaying Brexit indefinitely — will certainly be worse.

Parliamentarians are risking No Deal or No Brexit.

Brexit has temporarily transformed the governing laws of parliamentarian democracy. Theresa May finally submitted her negotiated deal for withdrawal from the European Union to Parliament this week. This is the effort on which her entire premiership has been staked. It takes up nearly all the energy of her government. And Parliament delivered its verdict by voting it down 432 to 202. In other words, it told her: You have failed miserably at the one thing your government was supposed to do.

Historians are searching for some parallel example of the government’s business being so viciously rejected by Parliament. Losses by 60 votes or 90 votes have invariably caused prime ministers to resign, or triggered no-confidence votes that those PMs promptly lost. May’s loss also triggered a no-confidence vote. And even though the Parliament had utterly and viciously rejected her government’s main piece of legislation, the most important bill in decades, Theresa May won it easily.

So what in the world is going on in Westminster?

As I’ve outlined before, there are two crises at work. The first is a crisis of responsibility in Parliament. Theresa May’s deal may not be what hard Brexiteers wanted. But they have neither the votes nor the courage to oust May and expose their own Brexit to parliamentary and public criticism. And they certainly don’t have the votes in Parliament to pass their preferred terms. By shooting down a deal that has been negotiated with over two dozen other European heads of state, with the clock ticking down, their rejection of their party leader’s deal makes the possibility of crashing out of the EU without a deal at the end of March more likely, or it will provoke the rest of Parliament to delay or cancel Brexit altogether, possibly inflicting yet another national referendum on the issue.

The second crisis underlies the first. In the U.K. system, Parliament is supposed to be sovereign. But Brexit was won by national referendum, against the tide of media and parliamentary consensus. That result seemed to give the cause of Brexit a superior form of popular legitimacy. And yet many Tory and Labour MPs, despite running on election manifestos committing themselves to delivering Brexit, are against the project altogether. They hope to show that Brexit is harmful, or “impossible” in some way, thinking that the passage of time will increase an ascendant majority for Remain.

But May, to her credit, is not fooling herself by thinking she can save this deal. She is essentially putting herself in Parliament’s hands and trying to discover what kind of deal can actually command a majority. The going assumption, fed by reports from Germany, is that a delay of Article 50’s ejection of the U.K. from the EU can be had.

But even after such a delay, Parliament may discover that it has no working political majority willing to stand behind any Brexit.

An unprecedented opportunity to reshape the laws and regulations governing the U.K. economy is being squandered. Right now, a solution to these twin crises is not within sight. Parliament has voted for its confidence in May’s leadership and demonstrated that it has none. Pretend confidence. Pretend governance. But there is no way to keep pretending.

Asked if she would join forces with Labour or the Conservatives, Jo Swinson said: ""I can't be clearer - neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn is fit to be prime minister.""

Labour's John McDonnell told BBC Breakfast: ""There will be no deals, no coalition. We will go in as a majority government. If we don't win an overall majority, we will have a minority government.""",www.bbc.com,center,2m7f2vwS7EMZZ0zd

Fiscally liberal social conservatism is a force whose potential electoral power has been greatly underestimated. It’s like a huge basin of light sweet crude that sat patiently about three feet beneath the surface of politics, just waiting for some ragged crew of Beverly Hillbillies to stumble upon it and reap gigantic rewards. Donald Trump achieved the presidency by sheer instinct, not by crunching data and judiciously weighing competing voter interests. He sensed that enormous success could be had by melding a pugnacious brand of cultural conservatism — opposing political correctness and loudly denouncing illegal immigrants — with a defense of the liberal welfare state and its entitlements.

Prime Minister Theresa May was fighting to save her Brexit deal on Thursday after several ministers resigned , deepening the political turmoil over the terms of her plan to exit from the European Union .
Six members of the government , including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab , one of the architects of the deal , quit Thursday as the prime minister faced a barrage of criticism over the plan in Parliament , raising the possibility that she could face a challenge to her leadership .
In a news conference late Thursday , Mrs. May stood by her deal and suggested she would fight any leadership challenge . “ This is a Brexit that delivers on the priorities of the British people , ” she said , adding that not moving forward with it “ would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it . ”
“ Am I going to see this through ? Yes , ” she said .
The British pound fell sharply after the resignations were announced , closing down 1.67 % against the dollar on the day , its biggest daily decline against the U.S. currency since October 2016 .
The coming days will be critical for both Mrs. May ’ s Brexit deal and her premiership as she seeks to quell a rebellion that has been brewing for months within her own party over the U.K. ’ s future ties to the EU . Members of her Conservative Party were openly plotting Thursday to try to trigger a no-confidence vote in an effort to force Mrs. May to negotiate a different deal with Brussels .
On Wednesday , Mrs. May secured approval from her cabinet for a Brexit pact that would see the U.K. bound to the EU for years after it formally quits the bloc in March , hampering the country ’ s hopes of negotiating trade deals with other countries and giving Brussels final say in arrangements to prevent a hard border in Ireland .
The pact has drawn fierce disapproval not only from the opposition Labour Party , but also from key Conservative Party figures who said Mrs. May has conceded too much .
In addition to Mr. Raab , Esther McVey , the pensions secretary , and two other ministers also resigned , along with two more junior ministerial aides .
Michael Gove , the most prominent Brexit hard-liner left in the government , didn ’ t publicly express his support for or opposition to the deal on Thursday .
In an address to a rowdy Parliament on Thursday , Mrs. May appealed to lawmakers of all parties to vote for it when it goes to the House of Commons for approval .
“ The choice is clear : We can choose to leave with no deal . We can risk no Brexit at all . Or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated , ” Mrs. May said . “ Voting against a deal will take us all back to square one . ”
“ It is mathematically impossible to get this deal through , ” said Mark Francois , a euroskeptic Conservative . Mr. Francois said he estimates that more than 80 Tory lawmakers are prepared to vote against the deal , as are Mrs. May ’ s allies in the Democratic Unionist Party and opposition parties . “ The stark reality , prime minister , is that it was dead on arrival . ”
Mrs. May relies on Northern Ireland ’ s DUP for a majority in the U.K. ’ s 650-seat Parliament . That alliance looked increasingly shaky on Thursday , as members of the party criticized the deal .
Mrs. May , who was in favor of remaining in the EU ahead of the 2016 referendum , has struggled to unite her Conservative Party . Some of its lawmakers want the U.K. to retain close ties to its biggest trading partner after it exits the bloc , while others want the country to break free so it can strike free-trade agreements with other countries . Mrs. May has spent her premiership jousting with a core of heavily euroskeptic Conservative lawmakers who have repeatedly threatened to oust her from office if she didn ’ t deliver a Brexit deal they deem acceptable .
A Conservative Party leadership challenge can be triggered if 48 Tory lawmakers submit letters of no confidence to a special committee . Even if such a challenge emerges , it is unlikely that a majority of Tories would then vote in favor of ousting her from office . However , a rebellion of 48 lawmakers would mean Mrs. May wouldn ’ t have the support within her own ranks to get a Brexit deal voted through Parliament .
Prime Target How Conservative members of Parliament could replace Theresa May = 1 Tory seat Trigger a no-confidence vote 48 Conservative MPs must write letters to the head of their group declaring they have no confidence in their leader to trigger a vote . 50 % Win the no-confidence vote A no-confidence vote needs a simple majority of all Conservative MPs ( 159 votes ) to pass Total seats 316 Hold a leadership contest Candidates must be proposed and seconded in writing If there are more than three candidates , Conservative MPs vote in multiple rounds , with the one gathering the least votes dropping out , until there are two candidates left All party members get to vote on the remaining two candidates The new leader would become the new prime minister and would n't be obliged to call an early election
That would be a clear signal that Mrs. May has to go back to the negotiating table .
Jacob Rees-Mogg , the leader of a group of Conservative euroskeptic lawmakers , submitted his letter of no confidence Thursday and called for Mrs. May to be replaced . “ We didn ’ t ask for the right things ” from the EU , he said .
Jeremy Corbyn , the leader of the main opposition Labour Party , said his party would vote against the proposed agreement . “ The government must withdraw this half-baked deal , ” he said in the House of Commons .
Mrs. May ’ s plan would leave the U.K. largely within the economic orbit of the EU , with Britain continuing to follow many of the bloc ’ s regulations and applying its tariffs . But in leaving the EU , London would lose the leverage to influence policies in the EU , which represents half of U.K. trade .
Some of Mrs. May ’ s critics have charged that her deal represents the worst of both worlds and betrays the 2016 vote by leaving the U.K. tethered to the EU—thus constraining its ability to strike free-trade deals with other nations—but without influence on the bloc ’ s decisions .
Under the terms negotiated , Northern Ireland could be left more closely tied than the rest of the U.K. to the EU if a broader Brexit deal on Britain ’ s long-term trading and economic relations can ’ t be reached .
Mr. Raab said in his resignation letter that “ the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presents a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom . ”
Investors are concerned about the possibility that the U.K. could leave the EU without a deal in March .
Along with the pound ’ s decline , the U.K. ’ s FTSE 250 stock index ended the session 1.3 % lower .
The EU has called a summit of leaders to discuss the withdrawal agreement on Nov. 25 .
European Council President Donald Tusk said Thursday the EU remained ready for all scenarios , including a possible reversal of Brexit .
“ All I can say is that the EU is prepared for a final deal with the United Kingdom in November , ” he said . “ We are also prepared for a no-deal scenario . ”
Other European leaders watched on with concern at the political meltdown in the U.K .
“ We have a politics of Brexit in Westminster that is incredibly divisive and difficult , ” said Simon Coveney , Ireland ’ s deputy prime minister . “ Theresa May will now have to persuade people that the consequences of not voting for this , of pulling it down , are chaotic , provides uncertainty about the future , and we don ’ t know what the political consequences of that will be . ”

Leaders want to avoid no-deal Brexit

Beware the reports of ""huge"" differences between EU leaders when it comes to a Brexit delay and the way forward in the coming days.

Take Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron: there are big differences in their political styles.

And big differences in the message they want to send their own domestic audiences (tough for France; open for Germany) when talking about Brexit.

But like most EU leaders - irritation, frustration and Brexit fatigue aside - they would rather avoid a costly no-deal Brexit.

Chancellor Merkel, like European Council President Donald Tusk has announced she will work ""until the last hours"" to try to avoid it.

And while EU leaders have ruled out re-opening the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the ""backstop"" text, you can bet they'll discuss a longer Brexit delay at their summit today.

They will also discuss the short delay requested by Theresa May, in case - as the EU fears - chaos and division continue next week in Westminster.

The UK is set to leave the EU next Friday unless the law is changed. The current default position for leaving is without a withdrawal agreement.

Mrs May agreed a deal with the EU, but MPs have rejected it twice.

She has asked the EU for a short extension of the two-year Brexit process until 30 June, but any extension needs to be agreed to by all EU members.

European Council President Donald Tusk said he believed the EU would agree to a short extension, but this would only be if Mrs May's deal is signed off by MPs next week. Another EU summit next week could be called in an emergency if needed, he said.

Mr Tusk said the ""question remains open"" as to how long a delay the other EU leaders would support.

great_britain,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36620426,Brexit: The story of an island apart,,Mark Mardell,"Our little archipelago of isles on the outer edges of a huge land mass has often thought of itself as rather special , even before it was the centre of an empire that changed the world .
As so often , Shakespeare put it best : `` This precious stone set in the silver sea/ Which serves it in the office of a wall/ Or as a moat defensive to a house , / Against the envy of less happier lands , / This blessed plot , this earth , this realm , this England . ''
It is that silver sea that helps define our relationship with the rest of Europe .
These isles have very rarely been in isolation from it , whether splendid or otherwise . How could it be , as one historian recently argued , when the Magna Carta was signed by French nobles and the Bill of Rights designed for a Dutch prince ?
But it has always kept a beady eye on other powers across the water .
It has been often concerned with stopping other European powers dominating the continent , playing one off against another .
But from that physical separation flows a psychological distance too .
As the BBC 's first Europe editor , I spent a lot of time thinking about our tricky relationship . After all , in my previous incarnation as a political journalist based at Westminster I had seen how some politicians ' profound distaste for the evolving project of the European Union had blown back into British politics with profound and startling consequences .
I had watched as Margaret Thatcher 's attitude towards the EU 's nascent plans for a single currency , summed up by `` no , no , no '' , had her own side bringing her down . It was the defenestration of a prime minister deeply beloved by most of her party .
I had reported for Newsnight as John Major 's government was harried and hamstrung by those who rebelled against the Maastricht treaty . Europe meant it could do nothing . Blair 's government was much friendlier , with any tensions buried by his own project .
Now Europe has claimed another scalp , that of a man who told his party to stop banging on about it . It will be the thing that David Cameron is remembered for - banging on about Europe , and losing the argument .
Now I know the European Union is not Europe . But those who stress that are missing the point . No , it is not the same as European culture . No it is not a geographically exact expression . But there are only a couple of European countries who are `` out '' , and firmly intend to stay out . All the others , or at least their leaders , want a share in this deeply political expression of a dream .
By the end of my time based in Brussels I was convinced that I had understood the key difference . To many in the UK being part of the EU was a hard-headed economic relationship , about free markets , selling and buying stuff . It was a sort of second best , a consolation prize after the loss of empire , but not one that had a similar place in patriots ' hearts .
But for nearly all the other countries it was a refuge . It was a home they were constructing as a bulwark against history , against horror .
Germany was fleeing its role in spreading death and destruction to every corner of the continent , fleeing its own political ambitions . France was running away from defeat and occupation , from humiliation and powerlessness .
So were many other countries . Greece , Portugal and Spain found refuge - in an imagined future - from the real past of right-wing dictatorships . The countries of the East were replacing communist tyranny with a new attempt to create peace and democracy .
The thought that war could once again ravage a continent , so risible to David Cameron 's detractors , do not seem so funny to many on the continent .
For many Britons , World War Two was our finest hour , standing alone , and putting those Europeans to shame , withstanding Hitler and beating him . Some realised the Russians and the Americans helped a little bit too . But we were still better than the rest of the Quislings and dictators .
The European Union , for all its bureaucracy , is a deeply romantic project , a desire to forge something new , something different . A new relationship binding nation states in a way that will exorcise forever the ghosts of the inglorious past .
I sat in a cafe next to some fairly senior people who work in the commission in Brussels . They were despairing of Brexit , making desperate , rather hysterical jokes about it and the future in Britain . But then one by one they confessed when they got up on Friday morning , switched on the news , checked their phones , they cried . Few in the UK would say that if another country left the EU .
But the irritations of these dozen or so people of different nationalities , with the UK - comments about British pride , warm beer and arrogant politicians - underlined a more fundamental frustration with British attitudes .
These Spanish , and Swedes , a Belgian and a Hungarian , were all emoting and swearing and arguing in English . One said ( in French ) `` maybe we can all go back to speaking French now '' . She was shouted down - in English - `` that will never happen . English is the language of the European Union now . ''
I remember Neil Kinnock joking that the EU changed forever when the Swedes arrived and started saying `` good morning '' in the lift .
One might think that is trivial . But maybe it highlights something we rarely realise in our desire for hard power - the extent of our soft power . It also underscores a real frustration with the British that has been growing . Many in Europe think we 've won . While readers of some British newspapers have been treated to stories of little Britain being bullied by the big commission , that is not how you see it if you are , say , Portuguese or Latvian .
Then you would see , time after time , Britain being given a special deal , treated with kid gloves and washed with buckets of soft soap .

Some in Brussels may reflect smugly on how John of Gaunt 's speech in Richard II concludes : `` That England that was wont to conquer others/Hath made a shameful conquest of itself . ''","Our little archipelago of isles on the outer edges of a huge land mass has often thought of itself as rather special, even before it was the centre of an empire that changed the world.

As so often, Shakespeare put it best: ""This precious stone set in the silver sea/ Which serves it in the office of a wall/ Or as a moat defensive to a house,/ Against the envy of less happier lands,/ This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.""

It is that silver sea that helps define our relationship with the rest of Europe.

These isles have very rarely been in isolation from it, whether splendid or otherwise. How could it be, as one historian recently argued, when the Magna Carta was signed by French nobles and the Bill of Rights designed for a Dutch prince?

But it has always kept a beady eye on other powers across the water.

It has been often concerned with stopping other European powers dominating the continent, playing one off against another.

But from that physical separation flows a psychological distance too.

As the BBC's first Europe editor, I spent a lot of time thinking about our tricky relationship. After all, in my previous incarnation as a political journalist based at Westminster I had seen how some politicians' profound distaste for the evolving project of the European Union had blown back into British politics with profound and startling consequences.

I had watched as Margaret Thatcher's attitude towards the EU's nascent plans for a single currency, summed up by ""no, no, no"", had her own side bringing her down. It was the defenestration of a prime minister deeply beloved by most of her party.

I had reported for Newsnight as John Major's government was harried and hamstrung by those who rebelled against the Maastricht treaty. Europe meant it could do nothing. Blair's government was much friendlier, with any tensions buried by his own project.

Now Europe has claimed another scalp, that of a man who told his party to stop banging on about it. It will be the thing that David Cameron is remembered for - banging on about Europe, and losing the argument.

Now I know the European Union is not Europe. But those who stress that are missing the point. No, it is not the same as European culture. No it is not a geographically exact expression. But there are only a couple of European countries who are ""out"", and firmly intend to stay out. All the others, or at least their leaders, want a share in this deeply political expression of a dream.

By the end of my time based in Brussels I was convinced that I had understood the key difference. To many in the UK being part of the EU was a hard-headed economic relationship, about free markets, selling and buying stuff. It was a sort of second best, a consolation prize after the loss of empire, but not one that had a similar place in patriots' hearts.

But for nearly all the other countries it was a refuge. It was a home they were constructing as a bulwark against history, against horror.

Germany was fleeing its role in spreading death and destruction to every corner of the continent, fleeing its own political ambitions. France was running away from defeat and occupation, from humiliation and powerlessness.

So were many other countries. Greece, Portugal and Spain found refuge - in an imagined future - from the real past of right-wing dictatorships. The countries of the East were replacing communist tyranny with a new attempt to create peace and democracy.

The thought that war could once again ravage a continent, so risible to David Cameron's detractors, do not seem so funny to many on the continent.

For many Britons, World War Two was our finest hour, standing alone, and putting those Europeans to shame, withstanding Hitler and beating him. Some realised the Russians and the Americans helped a little bit too. But we were still better than the rest of the Quislings and dictators.

The European Union, for all its bureaucracy, is a deeply romantic project, a desire to forge something new, something different. A new relationship binding nation states in a way that will exorcise forever the ghosts of the inglorious past.

I sat in a cafe next to some fairly senior people who work in the commission in Brussels. They were despairing of Brexit, making desperate, rather hysterical jokes about it and the future in Britain. But then one by one they confessed when they got up on Friday morning, switched on the news, checked their phones, they cried. Few in the UK would say that if another country left the EU.

But the irritations of these dozen or so people of different nationalities, with the UK - comments about British pride, warm beer and arrogant politicians - underlined a more fundamental frustration with British attitudes.

Image copyright AP Image caption The EU headquarters in Brussels, 24 June 2016

These Spanish, and Swedes, a Belgian and a Hungarian, were all emoting and swearing and arguing in English. One said (in French) ""maybe we can all go back to speaking French now"". She was shouted down - in English - ""that will never happen. English is the language of the European Union now.""

I remember Neil Kinnock joking that the EU changed forever when the Swedes arrived and started saying ""good morning"" in the lift.

One might think that is trivial. But maybe it highlights something we rarely realise in our desire for hard power - the extent of our soft power. It also underscores a real frustration with the British that has been growing. Many in Europe think we've won. While readers of some British newspapers have been treated to stories of little Britain being bullied by the big commission, that is not how you see it if you are, say, Portuguese or Latvian.

Then you would see, time after time, Britain being given a special deal, treated with kid gloves and washed with buckets of soft soap.

They say we've won. We won and turned Europe on to a free-market, anti-statist, liberal economic agenda.

great_britain,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/politics/trump-uk-visit-theresa-may/index.html,Trump denies he criticized British prime minister after criticizing her,2018-07-13,Jeremy Diamond,"London ( CNN ) President Donald Trump wrapped up the official portion of his United Kingdom visit Friday , during which he had falsely denied criticizing his host , met with the Queen and maneuvered around a huge protest against his presence .
Trump ended up denying that he criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May , the day after a British tabloid published an interview with him in which he did just that . He dismissed the interview , conducted by a Rupert Murdoch-owned publication , as `` fake news '' saying it did n't include his comments praising May .
Trump said his comments came after he `` read some reports '' that suggested the United Kingdom would not be able to make a free trade deal with the US , but he said May and her representatives have since reassured him that will still be possible .
`` I believe after speaking with the prime minister 's people that it will absolutely be possible , '' Trump said . `` The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade , that we do n't have any restrictions , because we want to trade with the UK and the UK wants to trade with us . ''
Trump also said Friday he apologized to May for the interview , though it appears his apology was about the paper 's omission of his comments praising her , not his criticism .
`` She is a total professional because when I saw her I said , ' I want to apologize , because I said such good things about you , ' `` Trump said .
Trump said May said , `` Do n't worry , it 's only the press . ''
Trump took pains Friday to praise May and reaffirm his belief in the special relationship between the US and the UK -- `` the highest grade of special '' -- during a news conference in which the questions focused on Trump 's comments a day earlier in which he criticized May 's `` soft Brexit '' plan and said she did n't listen to his suggestions on how to exit the European Union .
Still , Trump -- despite stomping all over diplomatic protocol by giving a critical interview as he headed to London -- did not back away from his comments , reaffirming that he would handle Brexit differently than May and that he believes May 's chief political rival in her own party Boris Johnson `` would be a great prime minister . ''
`` I also said that this incredible woman right here is doing a great job , doing a fantastic job , '' Trump said , justifying his comments .
During his news conference , Trump addressed a range of topics including his hope to address nuclear disarmament with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their upcoming Helsinki summit ; defending his behavior at the recent NATO summit ; and proclaiming that immigration has been `` bad for Europe . ''
The US President , who has faced planned protests in London since his arrival , also told The Sun he feels `` unwelcome '' in London , explaining why much of his visit will take place outside the capital city .
A giant `` Trump Baby '' blimp floated outside of Britain 's House of Parliament on Friday morning .
Blimp organizer Leo Murray told CNN the giant balloon had been designed to speak to Trump `` in a language that he understands , which is personal insults . ''
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through central London against Trump as he visits the UK , chanting `` Donald Trump 's not welcome here , '' and holding placards that call him the `` World 's # 1 racist '' and an `` American psycho . ''
Throngs of protesters began marching from outside the BBC at central London 's Portland Place , slamming the President for his attitude and behavior toward women and controversial policies , including the Muslim travel ban and the separation of migrant children from their families at the US border , organizers of the `` Bring the Noise '' protest said .
May insisted Friday that her country would have `` no limit to the possibility of doing trade deals around the world '' after Brexit .
She was responding to a question about whether her latest Brexit proposal -- which includes a `` common rulebook '' with the European Union -- would make it impossible for the UK to make its own trade deals .
May sidestepped a reporter 's question about whether she felt undermined by Trump 's reported comments on her Brexit plan
Trump insisted that he `` did n't criticize '' the British prime minister and said he has `` a lot of respect '' for her when asked during a joint news conference Friday about his interview with The Sun .
Trump accused the British newspaper of omitting his praise of May , and said , `` It 's called fake news . ''
`` I did n't criticize the prime minister . I have a lot of respect for the prime minister , '' Trump said . `` It did n't put in what I said about the prime minister , and I said tremendous things . ''

Trump ended up denying that he criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May , the day after a British tabloid published an interview with him in which he did just that. He dismissed the interview, conducted by a Rupert Murdoch-owned publication, as ""fake news"" saying it didn't include his comments praising May.

Trump said his comments came after he ""read some reports"" that suggested the United Kingdom would not be able to make a free trade deal with the US, but he said May and her representatives have since reassured him that will still be possible.

""I believe after speaking with the prime minister's people that it will absolutely be possible,"" Trump said. ""The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions, because we want to trade with the UK and the UK wants to trade with us.""

Trump also said Friday he apologized to May for the interview, though it appears his apology was about the paper's omission of his comments praising her, not his criticism.

""She is a total professional because when I saw her I said, 'I want to apologize, because I said such good things about you,' "" Trump said.

Trump said May said, ""Don't worry, it's only the press.""

Trump took pains Friday to praise May and reaffirm his belief in the special relationship between the US and the UK -- ""the highest grade of special"" -- during a news conference in which the questions focused on Trump's comments a day earlier in which he criticized May's ""soft Brexit"" plan and said she didn't listen to his suggestions on how to exit the European Union.

Still, Trump -- despite stomping all over diplomatic protocol by giving a critical interview as he headed to London -- did not back away from his comments, reaffirming that he would handle Brexit differently than May and that he believes May's chief political rival in her own party Boris Johnson ""would be a great prime minister.""

""I also said that this incredible woman right here is doing a great job, doing a fantastic job,"" Trump said, justifying his comments.

During his news conference, Trump addressed a range of topics including his hope to address nuclear disarmament with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their upcoming Helsinki summit; defending his behavior at the recent NATO summit; and proclaiming that immigration has been ""bad for Europe.""

Massive protests

The US President, who has faced planned protests in London since his arrival , also told The Sun he feels ""unwelcome"" in London, explaining why much of his visit will take place outside the capital city.

A giant ""Trump Baby"" blimp floated outside of Britain's House of Parliament on Friday morning.

Blimp organizer Leo Murray told CNN the giant balloon had been designed to speak to Trump ""in a language that he understands, which is personal insults.""

Tens of thousands of protesters marched through central London against Trump as he visits the UK, chanting ""Donald Trump's not welcome here,"" and holding placards that call him the ""World's #1 racist"" and an ""American psycho.""

Throngs of protesters began marching from outside the BBC at central London's Portland Place, slamming the President for his attitude and behavior toward women and controversial policies, including the Muslim travel ban and the separation of migrant children from their families at the US border, organizers of the ""Bring the Noise"" protest said.

Brexit

May insisted Friday that her country would have ""no limit to the possibility of doing trade deals around the world"" after Brexit.

She was responding to a question about whether her latest Brexit proposal -- which includes a ""common rulebook"" with the European Union -- would make it impossible for the UK to make its own trade deals.

May sidestepped a reporter's question about whether she felt undermined by Trump's reported comments on her Brexit plan

Trump insisted that he ""didn't criticize"" the British prime minister and said he has ""a lot of respect"" for her when asked during a joint news conference Friday about his interview with The Sun.

Trump accused the British newspaper of omitting his praise of May, and said, ""It's called fake news.""

""I didn't criticize the prime minister. I have a lot of respect for the prime minister,"" Trump said. ""It didn't put in what I said about the prime minister, and I said tremendous things.""

During opening remarks ahead of the joint news conference with May, Trump said he is ""OK with"" however the British decide to carry out Brexit, despite trashing May's ""soft Brexit"" blueprint in The Sun.

""Whatever you do is OK with me,"" Trump said. ""Whatever you're gonna do is OK with us, just make sure we can trade with you, that's all that matters.""

The interview

Asked earlier in the day whether he regrets his interview with British tabloid The Sun , Trump very visibly shook his head and rolled his eyes, turning to his aides with a look that showed his displeasure with the question.

Trump's interview published Thursday amounted to a stunning diplomatic affront for a visiting US president, emerging while Trump was still at a gala dinner May threw in honor of his visit. The dinner offered much pomp and circumstance with a military band, red carpet and ornate surroundings, even though Trump's stop in the UK is officially not a state visit.

For May, it comes at a time when she is already politically weakened following a string of resignations from her Cabinet.

Despite Trump's criticism -- which pounded the front pages of nearly every British newspaper -- he and May carried on with their regularly scheduled meetings on Friday.

The White House had attempted to mollify Trump's criticism, with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders releasing a statement insisting that ""the President likes and respects Prime Minister May very much.""

Putin summit

Trump also addressed his upcoming summit with Putin, insisting his behavior at NATO did not undermine putting forward a united front ahead of Helsinki.

""The other 28 countries have put in $34 billion more in to NATO. Do you think Putin is happy about that? I don't think so,"" Trump said.

He said he plans to discuss with the Russian President ways to ""substantially reduce"" the two countries' nuclear weapons arsenals, calling nuclear weapons ""the biggest problem in the world.""

""If we could do something to substantially reduce them ... certainly it's a subject I'll be bringing up with him,"" Trump said.

Trump noted that maintaining nuclear arsenals is ""also very expensive,"" but said that was the ""least important"" issue.

Trump also blamed the ""political problem"" in the United States -- not Russia's meddling or aggressive actions around the world -- for shackling him in his efforts to improve relations with Russia.

Trump said ""pure stupidity"" in the US ""makes it very hard to do something with Russia.""

Trump and European immigration

Trump also lamented immigration in Europe during his news conference, saying ""it has been very bad for Europe.""

He warned European leaders to ""better watch themselves"" because he believes immigration is ""changing the culture"" of their societies.

""I think it has been very bad, for Europe ... I think what has happened is very tough. It's a very tough situation -- you see the same terror attacks that I do,"" Trump said.

""I just think it is changing the culture, I think it is a very negative thing for Europe,"" he added. ""I know it is politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I will say it and I will say it loud.""

EU 'unlikely to entertain changes'

By Katya Adler, Europe editor

The excitable interventions we're witnessing in Parliament will convince EU leaders even more deeply that MPs are still very divided over Brexit and that now is not the decisive moment for Brussels to budge.

The EU wants to avoid an endless process of Theresa May shuttling to and from Brussels, getting a tweak or two, returning to Parliament, having the deal still rejected, coming back to Brussels and so on.

It's right to think the EU sometimes insists one thing, then does something rather different.

But the Irish backstop is a hugely sensitive issue, painfully co-negotiated over months with UK negotiators and almost impossible to fudge (as the EU prefers to do in difficult situations).

EU leaders are unlikely to touch the conditions of the backstop until a no-deal Brexit is well and truly staring them in the face. And even then they are unlikely to entertain changes unless Dublin is on board.

If he is, there will be something to talk about. If not, the EU will try its best to avoid being the ones to say ""forget it"".

But Mr Johnson should think again if he imagines his proposals, which do include concessions from his side, will prompt EU countries with a lot to lose in a no deal Brexit (like Germany) to try to force Ireland to accept his offer.

Angela Merkel today insisted EU leaders would stick together. With such an important EU member leaving, Mrs Merkel believes unity amongst those left behind is paramount.

Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, supported the plan, saying it would allow Northern Ireland to leave the customs union and single market at the same time as the rest of the UK.

Several Conservative MPs who opposed Theresa May's agreement also signalled their likely support, with leading Brexiteer Steve Baker saying he was ""cautiously optimistic"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious""

But Sinn Fein said the plans were a ""non-starter"" and accused the DUP, their former power-sharing partners of ""working against the interests of the people"" of Northern Ireland.

And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""not acceptable"" and ""worse"" than Theresa May's agreement, as it ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement that secured peace in Northern Ireland.

What is in the proposals?

The prime minister has set out details of his plan to replace the Irish border ""backstop"" in the current Brexit agreement.

The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely.

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:

Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021

But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone""

This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years

Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks

These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""

The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has spoken to Mr Johnson, said the EU would study the proposals carefully.

She said she ""trusted"" the bloc's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to maintain European unity.

But opponents of Brexit in Parliament indicated they would not support the proposals, unless they were accompanied by the promise of another referendum.

The Liberal Democrats, who want to stop Brexit, said the proposals would deal a ""hammer blow"" to the Northern Irish economy.

The Scottish National Party dismissed the proposals as ""window dressing"".",www.bbc.com,center,A76fe6BVjfTySlqN

Boris Johnson has won a decisive majority, on the back of a big swing from Labour to the Conservatives in Leave-voting Britain.

Yet north of the border the SNP dramatically almost swept the board.

With all results now declared, the prime minister has won a majority of 80 seats - the biggest Tory majority since 1987.

Meanwhile, at 44%, the party's share of the vote is set to be at its highest since 1979, when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister.

Labour, in contrast, finds itself with little more than 200 seats, even fewer than the party won in its previous worst post-war result in 1983.

The difference between Leave and Remain seats

However, the swing in the Tories' favour varied dramatically across the country.

In those seats where more than 60% of voters backed Leave in the 2016 EU referendum, the increase in Conservative support on average was 6%.

However, in those seats where more than 60% voted Remain, the party's vote actually fell by three points.

In contrast, Labour's vote fell on average by more than 10 points in the most pro-Leave areas.

Its vote fell by more than six points in the most pro-Remain ones.

Working-class and middle-class voters

This pattern had a clear impact on the geography of the election.

Support for the Conservatives rose by four points in the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire - the regions of England that voted most heavily in favour of Leave.

In contrast, the party's vote fell back by a point in London and the South East.

And in Scotland, the party's vote fell by as much as four points.

Conversely, Labour saw its vote fall by 12 to 13 points in the North East and Yorkshire, while it fell by only six or seven points in London and the South of England.

The result also saw Labour lose ground heavily in its traditional working-class heartlands.

Support for the party fell by 11 points in those constituencies with most voters in working-class jobs.

Its share of the vote fell by only seven points in those with most middle-class voters.

The bond between Labour and its traditional working-class base is now badly strained.

In the EU referendum working-class voters voted heavily to leave the EU. These voters had already swung quite strongly to the Conservatives in 2017.

Labour tried to retain their support - remaining ambiguous about whether it was a pro-Remain or a pro-Leave party.

But this election simply saw the pro-Conservative trend continue yet further.

As a result, Labour dramatically lost many a seat in the North of England and the Midlands - places such as Ashfield, Bishop Auckland, and Workington - that had never previously elected a Conservative MP in a general election.

An emboldened SNP

The success of the Conservatives in England and Wales was matched by that of the SNP in Scotland.

The party has won 48 of the 59 seats north of the border, and 45% of the vote across Scotland as a whole.

It is a result almost as good as the party's historic performance in the 2015 election.

Scotland vote share After 59 of 59 seats Party % share SNP Scottish National Party 45.0% CON Conservative 25.1% LAB Labour 18.6% LD Liberal Democrat 9.5% GRN Green 1.0% BRX The Brexit Party 0.5% Scotland vote share change since 2017 After 59 of 59 seats Lost Gained SNP Scottish National Party +8.1 Gained

LD Liberal Democrat +2.8 Gained

GRN Green +0.8 Gained

BRX The Brexit Party +0.5 Gained

CON Conservative -3.5 Lost

LAB Labour -8.5 Lost

And, in a country that voted in favour of Remain, it is likely to embolden the SNP in its pursuit of a second independence referendum.

That is a ballot to which the Conservatives are strongly opposed. So, a constitutional clash between the Scottish and UK governments seems likely.

Liberal Democrat losses

One of the SNP's biggest scalps was the Dunbartonshire East seat of Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson - a defeat that capped a miserable night for the Liberal Democrats.

Despite advancing more strongly in pro-Remain areas, the party seems likely to end up with only 11 or 12 seats.

This will be no more than the number they won in 2017, even though their share of the vote is up by four points.

None of the many MPs who defected to the party during the last Parliament have been able to retain their seats.

More from Sir John Curtice

Fewer than half backed Brexit parties

The announcement of the election was greeted with concern about the level of turnout, for a ballot held just a fortnight before Christmas.

In the event, about 67% of voters made it to the polls - just two points down on 2017.

Turnout fell most markedly in seats where Labour are relatively strong, suggesting that some of those who usually support the party opted to stay at home.

The Conservatives' success means that Britain will now leave the EU at the end of January.

However, it seems unlikely to end the debate about Britain's relationship with the EU.

The country's divisions over Brexit were exposed in the very different swings across the country.

Meanwhile, at 47%, fewer than half of voters backed the Conservatives or the Brexit Party - the parties in favour of leaving the EU without another referendum.

This is a point to which opponents of Brexit are likely to point in the weeks and months to come.

But for now at least, the day clearly belongs to Mr Johnson.

Analysis: The 'end of an era' for May

Theresa May's news conference with Donald Trump had an ""end of era"" feel to it.

Only days before she stands down as the Conservatives' leader, the prime minister set out clear positions she hoped may survive her premiership.

On Iran, the UK and US agree on the threat but disagree on the solution, and the US must ""do everything to avoid escalation which is in no-one's interest"".

On China, she said both sides cannot ignore the threat to their interests, but they must also recognise the country's ""economic significance"" - a clear warning against a lasting US trade war with Beijing.

But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal with the US mentioned today by Mr Trump.

That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation.

At the end of a day of meetings with the prime minister and a visit to the Churchill War Rooms, Mr Trump welcomed guests for a banquet at the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park.

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended on behalf of the Queen, along with the prime minister and some members of her cabinet.

During his visit, the US president is expected to meet Tory leadership hopefuls Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt. He had a phone conversation with Boris Johnson, another candidate.

He also met former Cabinet ministers and Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson.

On Monday, Mr Trump was welcomed by the Queen and had lunch at Buckingham Palace with senior royals. He also visited Westminster Abbey and had tea at Clarence House with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.

He attended a state banquet at Buckingham Palace in the evening, during which Mr Trump praised the ""eternal friendship"" between the UK and US.

The Queen said the countries were celebrating an alliance which had ensured the ""safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades"".

The president's visit coincides with the commemorations for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, which the Queen, Mr Trump and other heads of state will attend at Portsmouth on Wednesday.

great_britain,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/04/08/britain-margaret-thatcher-at-age-87-dies-after-suffering-stroke/,Former Britain Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dies after suffering stroke,2013-04-08,,"Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , an outspoken woman known to many as `` The Iron Lady , '' has died at 87 after suffering a stroke .
`` It is with great sadness that Mark and Carol Thatcher announced that their mother Baroness Thatcher died peacefully following a stroke this morning , ” Thatcher spokesperson Lord Bell said in a statement .
Thatcher led Britain 's Conservatives to three election victories from 1979 to 1990 , the longest continuous period in office by a British prime minister since the early 19th century . Alongside former U.S. President Ronald Reagan , Thatcher battled against communism and saw the Berlin Wall get torn down in 1989 .
On Monday , British Prime Minister David Cameron cut short his trip to several European countries after the announcement of Thatcher 's death .
`` We have lost a great leader , a great prime minister and a great Briton , '' Cameron said in a statement .
Tony Blair , a former British prime minister , said Thatcher had a vast impact on the world .
`` Very few leaders get to change not only the political landscape of their country but of the world , '' he said . `` Margaret was such a leader . ''
President Barack Obama said with Thatcher 's death , America has lost a `` true friend , '' while former President George W. Bush echoed Blair 's sentiment , calling Thatcher an `` inspirational leader . ''
`` Prime Minister Thatcher is a great example of strength and character , and a great ally who strengthened the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States , '' Bush said in a statement .
Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II was sad to hear the news of Thatcher 's passing , adding that she would be sending a private message of sympathy to the family today .
Downing Street said the Queen has authorized a ceremonial funeral — a step short of a state funeral — to be held at St. Paul 's Cathedral .
It said the funeral will be attended by a `` wide and diverse range of people , '' and the service will be followed by a private cremation . But it did not provide further details on the timing of the service , saying only that the arrangement are `` in line with the wishes '' of Thatcher 's family .
During 11 bruising years as prime minister , Thatcher transformed her country by a ruthless dedication to free markets and infuriated European allies . She transferred large chunks of the economy from the state hands to private ownership .
`` The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people 's money , '' she once said , according to Reuters .
Thatcher retired from public engagements in 2002 following a series of small strokes , and was only occasionally seen in public since then .
To her fervent admirers , battling Maggie was an icon , a national savior who ended Britain 's post-World War II cycle of confrontation and decline -- eclipsed as a 20th-century British leader only by Winston Churchill .
Her vehement critics , however , saw her as a bellicose figure at home and abroad , a destroyer of industries and , with it , a way of life .
She was a sharply divisive figure even within her Conservative Party , especially on the issue of European integration ; the party declined into a bickering shambles after she fell from power .
Between 1979 and 1990 , her governments crushed the once-mighty labor unions , defeated Argentina in the Falkland Islands war and preached military readiness to the Western alliance .
`` We have raised Britain in the respect of the world from what it was -- broke , bankrupt , unwilling to defend itself properly , '' Thatcher declared in 1987 . `` We have , I think , transformed Britain . ''
Thatcher 's years in power overlapped Reagan 's two terms as president , and her support for the American leader and her agreement with his world view never wavered . It was a political union of opposites : Thatcher had none of Reagan 's disarming charm , and he lacked her appetite for hard work and devotion to detail .
The grocer 's daughter became Europe 's first female prime minister in 1979 , four years after the Conservative Party surprised itself by making her its leader . Typically , she jumped into the leadership race while more prominent male colleagues dithered , and then proved unstoppable .
Thatcher led the Tories to a landslide victory in 1979 , followed by easy wins in 1983 and 1987 .
She loved the jokes claiming she beat her all-male Cabinet ministers with her handbag , and reveled in being the `` Iron Lady , '' a nickname coined by the Soviet press .
At home , she sold huge , loss-making state-owned companies , from Jaguar to national utilities to British Airways . Many became profitable .
For the employed majority of Britons , living standards rose dramatically , but the gap widened between the well-off and the poor .
The late Peter Jenkins , a leading liberal political commentator throughout the Thatcher years , once wrote that she had `` changed the political map and put her country on its feet again . ''
`` She did all this with ruthlessness and much injustice and at a high cost in human misery , but she did it , '' he said .
Margaret Hilda Roberts was born Oct. 13 , 1925 , in the central England town of Grantham , the younger daughter of Beatrice and Alfred Roberts , a strict Methodist and pillar of the local community . Throughout her life , she espoused his values of hard work and thrift .
She earned a science degree at Oxford University , working for a time as a research chemist before switching to law and becoming a barrister -- a lawyer who argues cases in court .
In 1951 , she married Denis Thatcher , a wealthy businessman 11 years her senior . Their children , twins Mark and Carol , were born in 1953 .
She called Denis , who died June 26 , 2003 , her rock and her great support . He paid for the nannies and private boarding schools which gave her the freedom to make a political career .
Thatcher was elected to Parliament in 1959 , the youngest of 25 women in the House of Commons , representing Finchley in north London .
As education secretary in the 1970-74 government of Prime Minister Edward Heath , newspapers dubbed her `` Thatcher Milk Snatcher '' when she ended free milk for schoolchildren .
Her big chance came in 1975 when the Tories dumped Heath . Thus began what a biographer , the late Hugo Young , called `` an era in which an ordinary politician , laboring under many disadvantages , grew into an international figure who did some extraordinary things to her country . ''
She marked her course clearly . `` A man 's right to work as he will , to spend what he earns , to own property , to have the state as servant and not as master , they are the essence of a free economy , and on that freedom all our other freedoms depend , '' she said in a speech in 1975 .
Her ascension to prime minister came in May 1979 on a wave of popular disgust at high inflation , garbage-strewn streets and a series of public sector strikes under the Labour Party government of James Callaghan .
When her popularity was at a low ebb in 1982 , Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands . Spurning negotiation , she dispatched warships to the remote south Atlantic archipelago .
`` Rejoice ! Rejoice ! '' she exclaimed after British Marines retook South Georgia island . The surge of national pride that followed Britain 's victory carried her triumphantly through the 1983 national elections , a victory aided by a Labour Party torn apart by years of infighting .
After surviving an Irish Republican Army bomb that killed five people at the Conservatives ' 1984 convention , Thatcher brushed off the dust of her shattered Brighton hotel suite and , hours later , made her keynote speech on cue .
She never faltered , in word or deed , in her support of the United States . In 1986 , she allowed U.S. warplanes to fly from British bases to bomb Libya . She sent ships , tanks and troops to fight against Iraq in the first Gulf War , but had resigned before the battle was joined in 1991 .
Thatcher was one of the first to spot Mikhail Gorbachev as a promising leader of the Soviet Union . `` I like Mr. Gorbachev , we can do business together , '' she said after their first meeting in Britain in 1984 .
In her memoirs , Thatcher said of Gorbachev : `` I spotted him because I was searching for someone like him . And I was confident that such a person could exist , even within that totalitarian structure , because I believed that the spirit of the individual could never ultimately be crushed in the Kremlin any more than in the Gulag . ''
Thatcher sat next to Gorbachev at Reagan 's funeral , and in a taped eulogy spoke of the personal dynamics of the era of `` perestroika . ''
`` I can not imagine how any diplomat , or any dramatist , could improve on ( Reagan 's ) words to Mikhail Gorbachev at the Geneva summit : ` Let me tell you why it is we distrust you . ' Those words are candid and tough and they can not have been easy to hear . But they are also a clear invitation to a new beginning and a new relationship that would be rooted in trust , '' she said .
Though Thatcher 's Conservatives won re-election in 1987 , the fall of the Iron Curtain deprived her of a key role as the scourge of communism , and she could appear out of touch with the times . She opposed the unification of Germany in tones that suggested the Nazi era was not forgiven , and her opposition to the growing influence of the European Union became more strident and nationalistic .
Thatcher had often seemed at odds with her own government 's policy of developing European integration , and the issue became her downfall in 1990 when Conservative legislators were feeling a panic over the government 's low opinion poll ratings .
In November of that year , she fell short of winning re-election as Tory leader on the first ballot of Conservative legislators . `` I fight on . I fight to win , '' she said . But , persuaded that the party had abandoned her , she resigned .
`` The people who brought about that incident are responsible for the biggest defeat the Conservative Party has ever had , '' she said after Tony Blair 's Labour Party ended 18 years of Tory rule in 1997 . `` It was catastrophic for me because I got things right . ''
Blair 's `` New Labour '' government , ironically , became part of her formidable legacy . The once-socialist Labourites moved to the center with echoes of Thatcherism -- from preserving Britain 's nuclear deterrent to telling single mothers on welfare to find work .
Out of power , Lady Thatcher , named a baroness in 1992 , made regular and lucrative U.S. lecture tours , and founded the Thatcher Foundation to spread her free-market philosophy .
Europe remained an obsession . In her book , `` Statecraft , '' published in 2002 , she described the European Union as `` perhaps the greatest folly of the modern era '' and wrote that most of the 20th century 's greatest problems -- including Nazism and Marxism -- originated on the continent .
Thatcher hardly ever admitted any regrets , but in a 1998 interview with the British magazine Saga she said she rarely saw her children or grandchildren .
`` It 's very sad , '' she said . `` It 's something that I thought would never happen . ''

great_britain,The Economist,0,https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/12/13/victory-for-boris-johnsons-all-new-tories,Victory for Boris Johnson’s all-new Tories,2019-12-13,,"BRITAIN ’ S ELECTION on December 12th was the most unpredictable in years—yet in the end the result was crushingly one-sided . As we went to press the next morning , Boris Johnson ’ s Conservative Party was heading for a majority of well over 70 , the largest Tory margin since the days of Margaret Thatcher . Labour , meanwhile , was expecting its worst result since the 1930s . Mr Johnson , who diced with the possibility of being one of Britain ’ s shortest-serving prime ministers , is now all-powerful .
The immediate consequence is that , for the first time since the referendum of 2016 , it is clear that Britain will leave the European Union . By the end of January it will be out—though Brexit will still be far from “ done ” , as Mr Johnson promises . But the Tories ’ triumph also shows something else : that a profound realignment in British politics has taken place . Mr Johnson ’ s victory saw the Conservatives taking territory that Labour had held for nearly a century . The party of the rich buried Labour under the votes of working-class northerners and Midlanders .
After a decade of governments struggling with weak or non-existent majorities , Britain now has a prime minister with immense personal authority and a free rein in Parliament . Like Thatcher and Tony Blair , who also enjoyed large majorities , Mr Johnson has the chance to set Britain on a new course—but only if his government can also grapple with some truly daunting tasks .
On a rainswept night the Conservatives marched into constituencies long seen as Labour strongholds ( see Britain section ) . Blyth Valley , an ex-mining community in the north-east where Tories have for generations been the enemy , fell before midnight . Wrexham , Labour turf for more than 80 years , declared for the Conservatives at 2am . Great Grimsby , a struggling northern port held by Labour since the second world war , was taken soon after . By dawn it was clear that the “ red wall ” of Labour constituencies , which stretched unbroken from north Wales to Yorkshire , had been demolished .

As we went to press the next morning, Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party was heading for a majority of well over 70, the largest Tory margin since the days of Margaret Thatcher. Labour, meanwhile, was expecting its worst result since the 1930s. Mr Johnson, who diced with the possibility of being one of Britain’s shortest-serving prime ministers, is now all-powerful.

The immediate consequence is that, for the first time since the referendum of 2016, it is clear that Britain will leave the European Union. By the end of January it will be out—though Brexit will still be far from “done”, as Mr Johnson promises. But the Tories’ triumph also shows something else: that a profound realignment in British politics has taken place. Mr Johnson’s victory saw the Conservatives taking territory that Labour had held for nearly a century. The party of the rich buried Labour under the votes of working-class northerners and Midlanders.

After a decade of governments struggling with weak or non-existent majorities, Britain now has a prime minister with immense personal authority and a free rein in Parliament. Like Thatcher and Tony Blair, who also enjoyed large majorities, Mr Johnson has the chance to set Britain on a new course—but only if his government can also grapple with some truly daunting tasks.

A cold coming they had of it

On a rainswept night the Conservatives marched into constituencies long seen as Labour strongholds (see Britain section). Blyth Valley, an ex-mining community in the north-east where Tories have for generations been the enemy, fell before midnight. Wrexham, Labour turf for more than 80 years, declared for the Conservatives at 2am. Great Grimsby, a struggling northern port held by Labour since the second world war, was taken soon after. By dawn it was clear that the “red wall” of Labour constituencies, which stretched unbroken from north Wales to Yorkshire, had been demolished.

Mr Johnson was lucky in his opponent. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s leader, was shunned by voters, who doubted his promises on the economy, rejected his embrace of dictators and terrorists and were unconvinced by his claims to reject anti-Semitism.

But the result also vindicates Mr Johnson’s high-risk strategy of targeting working-class Brexit voters. Some of them switched to the Tories, others to the Brexit Party, but the effect was the same: to deprive Labour of its majority in dozens of seats.

Five years ago, under David Cameron, the Conservative Party was a broadly liberal outfit, preaching free markets as it embraced gay marriage and environmentalism. Mr Johnson has yanked it to the left on economics, promising public spending and state aid for struggling industries, and to the right on culture, calling for longer prison sentences and complaining that European migrants “treat the UK as though it’s basically part of their own country.” Some liberal Tories hate the Trumpification of their party (the Conservative vote went down in some wealthy southern seats). But the election showed that they were far outnumbered by blue-collar defections from Labour farther north.

This realignment may well last. The Tories’ new prospectus is calculated to take advantage of a long-term shift in voters’ behaviour which predates the Brexit referendum. Over several decades, economic attitudes have been replaced by cultural ones as the main predictor of party affiliation. Even at the last election, in 2017, working-class voters were almost as likely as professional ones to back the Tories. Mr Johnson rode a wave that was already washing over Britain. Donald Trump has shown how conservative positions on cultural matters can hold together a coalition of rich and poor voters. And Mr Johnson has an extra advantage in that his is unlikely to face strong opposition soon. Labour looks certain to be in the doldrums for a long time (see Bagehot). The Liberal Democrats had a dreadful night in which their leader, Jo Swinson, lost her seat.

Yet the Tories’ mighty new coalition is sure to come under strain. With its mix of blue collars and red trousers, the new party is ideologically incoherent. The northern votes are merely on loan. To keep them Mr Johnson will have to give people what they want—which means infrastructure, spending on health and welfare, and a tight immigration policy. By contrast, the Tories’ old supporters in the south believe that leaving the EU will unshackle Britain and usher in an era of freewheeling globalism. Mr Johnson will doubtless try to paper over the differences. However, whereas Mr Trump’s new coalition in America has been helped along by a roaring economy, post-Brexit Britain is likely to stall.

Any vulnerabilities in the Tories’ new coalition will be ruthlessly found out by the trials ahead. Brexit will formally happen next month, to much fanfare. Yet the difficult bit, negotiating the future relationship with Europe, lies ahead. The hardest arguments, about whether to forgo market access for the ability to deregulate, have not begun. Mr Johnson will either have to face down his own Brexit ultras or hammer the economy with a minimal EU deal.

As he negotiates the exit from one union he will face a crisis in another. The Scottish National Party won a landslide this week, taking seats from the Tories, and expects to do well in Scottish elections in 2021. After Brexit, which Scots voted strongly against, the case for an independence referendum will be powerful. Yet Mr Johnson says he will not allow one. Likewise in Northern Ireland, neither unionists nor republicans can abide the prime minister’s Brexit plans. All this will add fuel to a fight over whether powers returning from Brussels reside in Westminster or Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh. The judiciary is likely to have to step in—and face a hostile prime minister whose manifesto promises that the courts will not be used “to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays”.

Led all that way for birth or death?

There is no doubting the strength of Mr Johnson’s position. He has established his personal authority by running a campaign that beat most expectations. His party has been purged of rebels, and their places taken by a new intake that owes its loyalty to him personally. Having lost control of Parliament for years, Downing Street is once more in charge.

Mr Johnson will be jubilant about the scale of his victory, and understandably so. But he should remember that the Labour Party’s red wall has only lent him its vote. The political realignment he has pulled off is still far from secure.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he can ""still be prime minister"" as he aims to thwart Theresa May's attempt to run a minority government.

He told the Sunday Mirror: ""This is still on. Absolutely.""

Labour will set out its own programme for government as an amendment to the Queen's Speech, focusing on austerity and a ""jobs-first Brexit,"" he says.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr he will call on MPs from all other parties to back his policies instead of Mrs May's.

Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told Sky News Labour are ""absolutely on our toes"" to set up an alternative minority government if Mrs May's government falls apart, accusing the Conservative PM of ""squatting in Downing Street"".

Mrs May is seeking a loose ""confidence and supply"" arrangement with the DUP's 10 MPs that would allow her to press ahead with a minority government, after losing her Commons majority in Thursday's general election.

The Conservatives could command a majority with the support of the DUP if they manage to to do a deal with the Northern Irish party.

'Serious programme'

Labour gained 30 seats in Thursday's general election to take its total to 262 seats, but the Conservatives remain the largest party in Parliament with 318 seats. This is more than the total of Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party. The number needed for a majority is 326.

Jeremy Corbyn said he did not think Mrs May had any credibility and it was ""unclear"" what kind of programme the Conservatives would be able to put forward.

He said there was a ""possibility"" of voting down the Queen's Speech and Labour were going to ""push all the way"" to achieve that.

As he said in his interview with the Sun she 'is a very good person' and he 'never said anything bad about her,'"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. “He thought she was great on NATO today and is a really terrific person. He is thankful for the wonderful welcome from the Prime Minister here in the U.K.”

The two leaders also discussed a mutual commitment to stopping nuclear proliferation, in North Korea and Iran, and terrorism.

But if Britain secedes from the EU, warns Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland will secede from the United Kingdom.

Northern Ireland, which voted in 2016 to remain in the EU, could follow Scotland out of Britain, leaving her with ""Little England"" and Wales.

When did secessionism begin? The Americans started it all.

The first great secessionist cause was the Revolution, when the 13 American colonies declared and won independence from the British crown.

It is solemnly declared today that our Revolution was about ideas, such as the equality of all men. But the author of the Declaration did not believe in equality.

And what are they?

Secessionism appears rooted principally in issues of national identity — ethnicity, religion, race, language, culture and ""the mystic chords of memory"" — most of which Jay identified as both uniting Americans and separating us from our British ""brethren.""

Yet these issues of identity appear not to be receding but rising in the Caucasus, Mideast, Africa and South Asia.

Taiwan's secession is not recognized by China. The secession of Russian-speaking Donbass is not recognized by a U.S.-armed Ukraine, or by us.

As more and more people identify themselves by who they are, and are not, secessions of people from each other will continue.

These are not inconsequential matters.

In 1939, the question of whether 300,000 Germans in a Polish-controlled city, Danzig, should be restored to German rule led to the worst war in the history of the world.

The other 27 EU member-states finalized and approved the withdrawal agreement at a summit in Brussels this Sunday . But the process is far from over : May must now get a deeply divided UK Parliament to approve the plan .
Hostility for the deal has been building for nearly two weeks , ever since May first unveiled the proposed agreement .
The most vocal resistance comes from the prime minister ’ s own Conservative Party , a fractured mess of loyalists and hardline “ Brexiteers ” who want a more decisive break with the European Union . The opposition Labour Party has also said it will resist the deal . Right now , at least , the withdrawal agreement doesn ’ t seem to have the votes .
This standstill could push everyone toward a “ no deal ” Brexit , the “ cliff edge ” scenario that would be bad for the EU , and likely catastrophic for Britain . Planes would be grounded , ports would be clogged , food would rot , and garbage would pile up , and those are just some of the possible scenarios .
May ’ s future is riding on the agreement , as well . At a Sunday press conference , she warned that a failed deal would lead to division and uncertainty . That includes her own job , which is far from secure as she faces pushback from all sides .
Amid this political turmoil , Brexit ’ s March 29 , 2019 , deadline inches ever closer . Here ’ s a look at some possible outcomes as May prepares to test her deal in Parliament .
To recap , May introduced a Brexit proposal on November 14 after months of back-and-forth with EU leaders .
This lengthy agreement tackles some of the critical issues in the forthcoming EU-UK break-up , specifically the divorce settlement ( how much the UK must pay the EU , which is likely at least £39 billion , or about $ 50 billion ) and the post-Brexit status of UK citizens and EU nationals living in the EU and UK , respectively . It also includes the Irish “ backstop , ” ensuring that the politically sensitive border between Northern Ireland ( part of the UK ) and the Republic of Ireland ( an EU country ) remains open , even if the UK and EU don ’ t finalize border details in a post-Brexit deal .
The withdrawal agreement also calls for a 21-month transition period until December 31 , 2020 , to give the EU and the UK time to figure out their future relationship , the hard details of the trade , security cooperation , and more . ( The transition can be renewed one time for up to two years . ) A political declaration lays out the broad outlines for this arrangement .
The details of these plan were largely finalized on Sunday , when the 27 EU member states signed off on the deal in Brussels . The European Parliament will also need to formally approve the agreement at some point . But first it ’ s got to get ratified by the UK Parliament .
And this is promising to be difficult because every political camp within the UK has found something to hate in this agreement .
May ’ s plan , briefly , is an attempt at a “ soft ” Brexit compromise , but even those who favor closer alignment with the EU don ’ t love this deal . They see this deal as severing too many ties to EU , leaving Britain weaker and worse off economically than it was before .
The hardline “ Brexiteers ” in her party are virulently opposed — though it ’ s unlikely they ’ d be pleased by any deal . They see May ’ s deal as preventing the UK from reclaiming control of its borders and laws , and blocking it from making trade deals with other countries . Under May ’ s deal , the UK will also still have to follow EU customs rules for a period of time , but will lose its decision-making power in the bloc .
Then there ’ s Labour , the opposition party led by Jeremy Corbyn . Labour has its own disagreements about Brexit within the party , but it has collectively rejected May ’ s deal , saying it doesn ’ t meet their required pillars for a satisfactory Brexit . The party also sees this as an opportunity : If May and her deal implode , it might put them closer to regaining control of the government .
There ’ s pushback from other corners , including the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) , a party from Northern Ireland . The DUP ’ s partnership with the Tories is keeping May in power . This party has resisted the deal ; they object to the Irish border backstop plan because it would apply different rules to Northern Ireland , compared to the rest of the UK .
The bottom line : Few are satisfied with this compromise , because the UK is splintered between those who want out of the EU and those who never wanted to leave in the first place . No side actually “ wins ” with this deal .
And May ’ s own government is divided on the plan . After she secured cabinet approval of her draft deal last week , two top Cabinet ministers quit in protest the next day , including her Brexit secretary . ( Several other junior members also stepped down . ) It ’ s a sign the divisions within Britain are deep enough to derail whatever May brings home from Brussels .
The UK Parliament could approve the deal ... at some point
The UK Parliament will vote on the Brexit deal in mid-December . May needs 320 votes to pass the agreement , but it ’ s not clear yet if she will have the support .
Back in 2017 , May tried to shore up support for Brexit negotiations by calling snap elections . Her plan backfired , and May ’ s Conservative Party ended up losing the majority , and formed a minority government with the DUP , whose 10 votes it needed to retain power .
The DUP said May has broken her promise on Brexit , and seems unlikely to support the deal .
As many as 51 Conservative party members have said they wouldn ’ t vote for a previous “ soft ” Brexit plan , but the number of total defectors right now is unclear . May ’ s cabinet will try to whip votes , though that won ’ t likely convince the hardcore Brexiteers .
It seems likely May will need to peel off some Labour votes in order to get her deal passed . ( Labour has broadly rejected the deal , but there ’ s still a chance that some MPs could break off and support it . )
So while it ’ s too early to say May ’ s deal is headed for defeat , it ’ s definitely not looking great .
At least on the first try . Experts say if the Brexit deal gets voted down in December , there ’ s a chance May might be able to try again , especially if the financial markets or businesses freak out at the prospect no-deal scenario .
In other words : The UK will have to be pushed to the brink to get Parliament to finally act .
Which is why some observers say this deal might eventually pass — but maybe not until the second try . If the markets react severely , members of Parliament may be cowed into going “ back and take a second look ” at the deal , according to Spencer Boyer , a senior fellow with the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement .
May could step aside after a leadership challenge from her Conservative party
Pro-Brexit Conservative MPs led the charge to oust May last week . Their efforts have since stalled , but at least 26 Tories confirmed they submitted letters of no confidence against May last week , arguing her handling of Brexit has made her unfit to lead .
At least 48 MPs must turn in letters to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee , the Conservatives ’ parliamentary group , to trigger a “ no confidence ” vote within the party . May needs a majority — 158 Tory MPs — to survive . If she loses , she ’ d have to step aside . If she defeats the challenge , she can ’ t be challenged by her party for 12 months .
The rebellion against May fizzled out , as it appeared her opponents overestimated their support and couldn ’ t reach the 48-letter threshold .
But the threat could be revived now that May has finalized the deal , as the pro-Brexit crowd isn ’ t likely to stop agitating against her .
Yet the schisms within May ’ s own Conservative party could ultimately protect her from a leadership challenge . “ The reason she ’ s managed to last has been that there isn ’ t a clear alternative [ to her ] , ” Simon Usherwood , a professor at the University of Surrey and deputy director of an independent Brexit think tank , told me .
In other words , the pro-Brexit and pro-European wings of her party fear May ’ s replacement could be far more opposed to their positions . “ Nobody feels entirely sure that if they got rid of her they would get ... someone who ’ s more favorable and supportive of what they want , ” Usherwood added .
In March 2017 , May formally triggered Article 50 of the EU ’ s Lisbon Treaty . That set off a two-year countdown to the formal Brexit deadline of March 29 , 2019 .
If her Brexit deal fails in Parliament , that could push the UK closer to the brink of a devastating no-deal Brexit . But the UK might try to finagle an extension , arguing it needs more time to approve a deal , or negotiate more concessions , or buy time in the case of political uncertainty , such as a leadership change .
There ’ s no guarantee the EU would go for this . The complications are many , including upcoming EU parliamentary elections in May . And European leaders have said it ’ s this deal or no deal , so it seems highly unlikely they ’ d consider going back to the negotiating table .
The idea of a second referendum , or a “ people ’ s vote ” on Brexit , has been percolating for a while . Perhaps years of Brexit drama has been enough to change some people ’ s minds , or the public could solve the gridlock in Parliament , the thinking goes .
But how to get a second referendum — or what it would look like — is complicated . May said she would not call for one , so barring any last-minute about face or leadership change , it ’ s unlikely to happen . It would also be a near-impossible feat to hold a campaign before the March 29 , and would probably require begging the EU for an Article 50 extension .
There ’ s also the fact that a second referendum would likely be messy . It ’ s not clear what the referendum would ask . Would it be a test of May ’ s Brexit deal versus no-deal ? Would it involve multiple choices — leave , stay , or take the deal ? Would it be a do-over of the original 2016 “ leave ” versus “ remain , ” which will still disappoint at least half of a bitterly divided country and not necessarily change the outcome ?
Some Labour MPs are pushing to have a vote on a second referendum , but Corbyn has declined to come out strongly in favor . “ It ’ s an option for the future , but it ’ s not an option for today , ” Corbyn said over the weekend .
Proponents of the second referendum who see it as a Brexit out might be deluding themselves , too . “ The last two national votes we ’ ve had haven ’ t gone the way that people thought they would , ” Usherwood said . “ So do you really want to open up a huge amount of uncertainty ? ”
May currently faces a leadership challenge within her own party . But if MPs turn against her in Parliament , that could throw the entire government into turmoil .
The DUP sent a few warning shots , refusing to support Conservative legislation twice last week to pressure May on a better Brexit deal . May needs DUP ’ s 10 votes to stay in power ; if they defect from her government , the Conservatives lose a majority . That could lead to a no-confidence vote in Parliament , potentially triggering general elections .
Labour , meanwhile , has been pushing for new elections — and there ’ s always a chance they could get them if May ’ s deal blows up badly enough in Parliament , or her government crumbles . “ Labour ’ s top priority is to get back in power , ” Boyer told me .
A second referendum or a new general election seems implausible now . But Brexit ’ s one promise is to be unpredictable .
What happened in Brussels this weekend means it ’ s now up to the United Kingdom to decide whether to accept this divorce deal , or not . And European leaders have made clear that it ’ s this deal , or no deal at all .
“ This is the best deal for the UK , the best deal for Europe , this is the only deal possible , ” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Sunday .
Erik Jones , the director of European and Eurasian Studies at Johns Hopkins University , told me that even if MPs object to this premise , or vote down the deal believing there ’ s a better one to be had , there ’ s not much more Europe can give that will sway the ideologues on either side .
“ You ’ re not going to get any significant concessions , ” he said . “ If you think that there ’ s any silver bullet that could change the minds of enough members of the British Parliament having voted it down once , it just ain ’ t there . ”
Looming over these debates is the possibility of a no-deal Brexit . The economic and logistical pain of crashing out of the EU may be enough to push MPs to accept an imperfect Brexit deal . “ Everyone ’ s made a lot of noise and has been unhappy about this , that and the other , but they haven ’ t been able to agree on an alternative plan of action , ” Usherwood said .
So , in the end , the current Brexit deal may be the only option . Ultimately , Usherwood said , if everything looks even less attractive than this deal , then that ’ s what will end up getting signed . “ But , ” he added , “ who knows ? ”","British Prime Minister Theresa May and the European Union have a Brexit deal, a historic agreement that lays out the terms of the United Kingdom’s breakup with the bloc.

May’s plan, briefly, is an attempt at a “soft” Brexit compromise, but even those who favor closer alignment with the EU don’t love this deal. They see this deal as severing too many ties to EU, leaving Britain weaker and worse off economically than it was before.

The hardline “Brexiteers” in her party are virulently opposed — though it’s unlikely they’d be pleased by any deal. They see May’s deal as preventing the UK from reclaiming control of its borders and laws, and blocking it from making trade deals with other countries. Under May’s deal, the UK will also still have to follow EU customs rules for a period of time, but will lose its decision-making power in the bloc.

Then there’s Labour, the opposition party led by Jeremy Corbyn. Labour has its own disagreements about Brexit within the party, but it has collectively rejected May’s deal, saying it doesn’t meet their required pillars for a satisfactory Brexit. The party also sees this as an opportunity: If May and her deal implode, it might put them closer to regaining control of the government.

There’s pushback from other corners, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), a party from Northern Ireland. The DUP’s partnership with the Tories is keeping May in power. This party has resisted the deal; they object to the Irish border backstop plan because it would apply different rules to Northern Ireland, compared to the rest of the UK.

The bottom line: Few are satisfied with this compromise, because the UK is splintered between those who want out of the EU and those who never wanted to leave in the first place. No side actually “wins” with this deal.

And May’s own government is divided on the plan. After she secured cabinet approval of her draft deal last week, two top Cabinet ministers quit in protest the next day, including her Brexit secretary. (Several other junior members also stepped down.) It’s a sign the divisions within Britain are deep enough to derail whatever May brings home from Brussels.

The UK Parliament could approve the deal ... at some point

The UK Parliament will vote on the Brexit deal in mid-December. May needs 320 votes to pass the agreement, but it’s not clear yet if she will have the support.

Back in 2017, May tried to shore up support for Brexit negotiations by calling snap elections. Her plan backfired, and May’s Conservative Party ended up losing the majority, and formed a minority government with the DUP, whose 10 votes it needed to retain power.

The DUP said May has broken her promise on Brexit, and seems unlikely to support the deal.

As many as 51 Conservative party members have said they wouldn’t vote for a previous “soft” Brexit plan, but the number of total defectors right now is unclear. May’s cabinet will try to whip votes, though that won’t likely convince the hardcore Brexiteers.

It seems likely May will need to peel off some Labour votes in order to get her deal passed. (Labour has broadly rejected the deal, but there’s still a chance that some MPs could break off and support it.)

So while it’s too early to say May’s deal is headed for defeat, it’s definitely not looking great.

At least on the first try. Experts say if the Brexit deal gets voted down in December, there’s a chance May might be able to try again, especially if the financial markets or businesses freak out at the prospect no-deal scenario.

In other words: The UK will have to be pushed to the brink to get Parliament to finally act.

Which is why some observers say this deal might eventually pass — but maybe not until the second try. If the markets react severely, members of Parliament may be cowed into going “back and take a second look” at the deal, according to Spencer Boyer, a senior fellow with the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.

May could step aside after a leadership challenge from her Conservative party

Pro-Brexit Conservative MPs led the charge to oust May last week. Their efforts have since stalled, but at least 26 Tories confirmed they submitted letters of no confidence against May last week, arguing her handling of Brexit has made her unfit to lead.

At least 48 MPs must turn in letters to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, the Conservatives’ parliamentary group, to trigger a “no confidence” vote within the party. May needs a majority — 158 Tory MPs — to survive. If she loses, she’d have to step aside. If she defeats the challenge, she can’t be challenged by her party for 12 months.

The rebellion against May fizzled out, as it appeared her opponents overestimated their support and couldn’t reach the 48-letter threshold.

But the threat could be revived now that May has finalized the deal, as the pro-Brexit crowd isn’t likely to stop agitating against her.

Yet the schisms within May’s own Conservative party could ultimately protect her from a leadership challenge. “The reason she’s managed to last has been that there isn’t a clear alternative [to her],” Simon Usherwood, a professor at the University of Surrey and deputy director of an independent Brexit think tank, told me.

In other words, the pro-Brexit and pro-European wings of her party fear May’s replacement could be far more opposed to their positions. “Nobody feels entirely sure that if they got rid of her they would get ... someone who’s more favorable and supportive of what they want,” Usherwood added.

The UK manages to get a Brexit deadline extension

In March 2017, May formally triggered Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty. That set off a two-year countdown to the formal Brexit deadline of March 29, 2019.

If her Brexit deal fails in Parliament, that could push the UK closer to the brink of a devastating no-deal Brexit. But the UK might try to finagle an extension, arguing it needs more time to approve a deal, or negotiate more concessions, or buy time in the case of political uncertainty, such as a leadership change.

There’s no guarantee the EU would go for this. The complications are many, including upcoming EU parliamentary elections in May. And European leaders have said it’s this deal or no deal, so it seems highly unlikely they’d consider going back to the negotiating table.

The UK could hold a second referendum

The idea of a second referendum, or a “people’s vote” on Brexit, has been percolating for a while. Perhaps years of Brexit drama has been enough to change some people’s minds, or the public could solve the gridlock in Parliament, the thinking goes.

But how to get a second referendum — or what it would look like — is complicated. May said she would not call for one, so barring any last-minute about face or leadership change, it’s unlikely to happen. It would also be a near-impossible feat to hold a campaign before the March 29, and would probably require begging the EU for an Article 50 extension.

There’s also the fact that a second referendum would likely be messy. It’s not clear what the referendum would ask. Would it be a test of May’s Brexit deal versus no-deal? Would it involve multiple choices — leave, stay, or take the deal? Would it be a do-over of the original 2016 “leave” versus “remain,” which will still disappoint at least half of a bitterly divided country and not necessarily change the outcome?

Some Labour MPs are pushing to have a vote on a second referendum, but Corbyn has declined to come out strongly in favor. “It’s an option for the future, but it’s not an option for today,” Corbyn said over the weekend.

Proponents of the second referendum who see it as a Brexit out might be deluding themselves, too. “The last two national votes we’ve had haven’t gone the way that people thought they would,” Usherwood said. “So do you really want to open up a huge amount of uncertainty?”

May’s government could fall apart

May currently faces a leadership challenge within her own party. But if MPs turn against her in Parliament, that could throw the entire government into turmoil.

The DUP sent a few warning shots, refusing to support Conservative legislation twice last week to pressure May on a better Brexit deal. May needs DUP’s 10 votes to stay in power; if they defect from her government, the Conservatives lose a majority. That could lead to a no-confidence vote in Parliament, potentially triggering general elections.

Labour, meanwhile, has been pushing for new elections — and there’s always a chance they could get them if May’s deal blows up badly enough in Parliament, or her government crumbles. “Labour’s top priority is to get back in power,” Boyer told me.

Nobody really knows what will happen

A second referendum or a new general election seems implausible now. But Brexit’s one promise is to be unpredictable.

What happened in Brussels this weekend means it’s now up to the United Kingdom to decide whether to accept this divorce deal, or not. And European leaders have made clear that it’s this deal, or no deal at all.

“This is the best deal for the UK, the best deal for Europe, this is the only deal possible,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Sunday.

Erik Jones, the director of European and Eurasian Studies at Johns Hopkins University, told me that even if MPs object to this premise, or vote down the deal believing there’s a better one to be had, there’s not much more Europe can give that will sway the ideologues on either side.

“You’re not going to get any significant concessions,” he said. “If you think that there’s any silver bullet that could change the minds of enough members of the British Parliament having voted it down once, it just ain’t there.”

Looming over these debates is the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The economic and logistical pain of crashing out of the EU may be enough to push MPs to accept an imperfect Brexit deal. “Everyone’s made a lot of noise and has been unhappy about this, that and the other, but they haven’t been able to agree on an alternative plan of action,” Usherwood said.

So, in the end, the current Brexit deal may be the only option. Ultimately, Usherwood said, if everything looks even less attractive than this deal, then that’s what will end up getting signed. “But,” he added, “who knows?”",www.vox.com,left,UVLWJNQqLBXHOODH

A Drax spokeswoman said the company ’ s ambition was to be removing , not adding carbon to the atmosphere , by 2030 .

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46887852,Brexit and no-confidence vote: Corbyn targets 'zombie government',,,"MPs are voting on a motion that could oust Theresa May 's government from power and start moves towards a general election .
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , who tabled the no confidence motion , said the PM 's `` zombie '' administration had lost the right to govern , and they `` should do the right thing and resign '' .
But Mrs May said a general election was simply not `` in the national interest '' .
It comes 24 hours after MPs voted down the PM 's Brexit plans by a huge margin .
Closing the debate , Labour 's deputy leader Tom Watson said : `` She is a prime minister without a majority for her flagship policy , with no authority and no plan B . ''
But Environment Secretary , Michael Gove , said Mrs May had provided `` inspirational leadership '' .
He launched a scathing attack on Mr Corbyn over a number of his positions on national security issues , saying to loud cheers from Conservative MPs that the country could not have confidence in him as a leader .
Mr Corbyn 's motion is backed by MPs from the SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymru and Green Party .
But senior Labour figures accept it is not likely to succeed , as she has the backing of Tory rebels and the DUP 's 10 MPs , who less than 24 hours ago helped inflict a humiliating defeat on her .
Labour says further no-confidence votes could follow if this one fails .
Mr Corbyn told MPs : `` The prime minister has consistently claimed that her deal , which has been decisively rejected , was good for Britain workers and business… she should have nothing to fear by going to the people . ''
He added that 2011 's Fixed-term Parliaments Act `` was never intended to prop up a zombie government '' , saying that the prime minister had `` lost control '' and suffered an `` historic and humiliating defeat '' .
Mr Watson added : `` I do n't doubt that [ Mrs May ] has sincerely attempted to fulfil the task given to us buy the voters in the referendum . I have no doubt too that she has tried her best and given it her all .
`` But she has failed and I am afraid the failure is hers and hers alone .
`` We know she has worked hard , but the truth is she is too set in her ways , too aloof to lead .
`` She lacks the imagination and agility to bring people with her , she lacks the authority on the world stage to negotiate this deal . Ultimately she has failed . ''
Mrs May told MPs it was Parliament that decided to put the question of European Union membership to the people , `` and now Parliament must finish the job '' .
She said extending Article 50 , the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March , to allow time for an election would mean `` delaying Brexit for who knows how long '' .
She repeated her offer of cross-party talks to find a way forward on Brexit , but has not so far invited the Labour leader to take part in them .
A general election would `` deepen divisions when we need unity , it would bring chaos when we need certainty , '' Mrs May said .
Tory MP for Croydon South , Chris Philip , accused Mr Corbyn of `` shameless political opportunism '' , which put `` party interests ahead of national interests '' .
James Morris , Tory MP for Halesowen and Rowley Regis , said the motion was `` merely a tactical device by the opposition to cause chaos '' .
And Conservative ex-minister Anna Soubry , who wants Mr Corbyn to back another EU referendum , questioned why her party were six points ahead of Labour in a weekend opinion poll , adding : `` Could it be because he 's the most hopeless Leader of the Opposition that we 've ever had ? ''
But other MPs backed Mr Corbyn , with Labour 's Stephen Doughty saying his leader was `` absolutely right '' to call for a general election `` because it is not just the government 's record on Brexit which is at stake tonight '' .
Labour frontbencher Liam Byrne , MP for Birmingham , Hodge Hill , accused Mrs May of building `` a cage of red lines '' over Brexit .
SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the government of `` seeking to run down the clock '' over Brexit and warned that the UK could `` crash out '' of the EU with no deal .
`` The risk of a no deal is something that is unthinkable , '' he said . `` If the government and the prime minister want to drive the bus over the cliff , we will not be in the passenger seat . ''
Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said 48 % of the population who voted to remain in the EU had been `` totally disregarded '' by the government and Mrs May had an `` unwillingness to listen '' .
He said a general election provided `` another route and a welcome one '' that could resolve the issue , and he also called for a `` People 's Vote '' .
The leader of Plaid Cymru in Westminster , Liz Saville Roberts , who will vote against the government later , added her support for a `` People 's Vote '' , and called for the House to come together to make progress , condemning the `` pantomime point scoring '' taking place .
The DUP 's leader Arlene Foster and its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds have both said they will support the government in the confidence vote .
But , speaking after what she described as a `` useful discussion '' with the prime minister , Ms Foster said `` lessons will need to be learned '' from the defeat on the Brexit deal .
`` The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt and we will continue to work to that end , '' she added .
A shift to promising some kind of closer relationship with the EU , whether an actual customs union or something by a similar name , seems to be becoming more likely .
That 's not because everyone in the government , let alone in No 10 or in the Cabinet , thinks it 's the right thing to do - Liam Fox , whose job it is to pursue an independent trade policy , is not the only one with significant doubts .
But you can see a realistic route of getting that kind of arrangement through the House of Commons .
One former minister involved in trying to persuade the PM to soften up said : `` We have three days to push and push her to move , or there wo n't be anything that can get through . ''
David Cameron , who resigned the day after the UK voted in 2016 to leave the EU , said he hoped , and thought , Mrs May would win Wednesday 's vote .
Speaking to the BBC he also insisted he did not regret calling the referendum .
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says that if the prime minister sees off the challenge , she will begin a series of meetings with `` senior Parliamentarians '' on Thursday .
He said Mrs May intended to retain her `` red lines '' - ruling out Labour 's demand for a customs union with the EU - with sources suggesting compromising on this would risk cabinet resignations .
However , speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live , Justice Minister David Gauke suggested that the customs union option could not be ruled out , saying : `` We have got to engage and we have got to be constructive . ''
Earlier Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom told the BBC the government was clear that it will not delay or revoke Article 50 , although Chancellor Philip Hammond reportedly suggested delaying Brexit in a conference call on Tuesday evening .
Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 , UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years . The next one is due in 2022 .
But a vote of no confidence lets MPs decide on whether they want the government to continue . The motion must be worded : `` That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty 's Government . ''
If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown .
If during that time the current government , or any other alternative government can not win a new vote of confidence , then an early general election would be called .
That election can not happen for at least 25 working days .
European leaders reacted to Tuesday 's vote with dismay but gave no indication they were willing to make concessions .
Several have warned of increased chances of a no-deal Brexit , which many MPs fear will cause chaos at ports and damage industry .
Michel Barnier , the EU 's chief Brexit negotiator , said Brussels `` profoundly regrets '' how the UK 's MPs voted and said it was `` up to the British authorities '' to indicate how it would move forward .
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged the UK to clarify its intentions , saying : `` Time is almost up . ''
And European Council President Donald Tusk has appeared to suggest that the UK should stay in the EU .
`` If a deal is impossible , and no one wants no deal , then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is ? `` , he tweeted .
The Commons defeat - the largest in history , by 432 votes to 202 - came as a huge blow for Mrs May .
She had spent two years negotiating the plan aimed at bringing about an orderly Brexit on 29 March , 2019 , and setting up a 21-month transition period to negotiate a free-trade deal with Brussels .
But it faced opposition across Parliament , which has never had a majority in favour of Brexit . The UK public voted by 52 % to 48 % to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum .
Some Remain MPs oppose the deal because they want a further referendum with the option to scrap Brexit , while others accept Brexit will happen but want the UK to have a closer relationship with the EU than currently proposed .
On the other side are MPs who think Mrs May 's deal leaves the UK tied too closely to EU rules , while some want to see a no-deal Brexit , which is where the UK leaves the EU without any special arrangements in place .
A key sticking point on the plan remains the Northern Irish backstop - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland . Many MPs argue it could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules indefinitely .

MPs are voting on a motion that could oust Theresa May's government from power and start moves towards a general election.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who tabled the no confidence motion, said the PM's ""zombie"" administration had lost the right to govern, and they ""should do the right thing and resign"".

But Mrs May said a general election was simply not ""in the national interest"".

It comes 24 hours after MPs voted down the PM's Brexit plans by a huge margin.

Closing the debate, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said: ""She is a prime minister without a majority for her flagship policy, with no authority and no plan B.""

But Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, said Mrs May had provided ""inspirational leadership"".

He launched a scathing attack on Mr Corbyn over a number of his positions on national security issues, saying to loud cheers from Conservative MPs that the country could not have confidence in him as a leader.

Mr Corbyn's motion is backed by MPs from the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green Party.

But senior Labour figures accept it is not likely to succeed, as she has the backing of Tory rebels and the DUP's 10 MPs, who less than 24 hours ago helped inflict a humiliating defeat on her.

Labour says further no-confidence votes could follow if this one fails.

Mr Corbyn told MPs: ""The prime minister has consistently claimed that her deal, which has been decisively rejected, was good for Britain workers and business… she should have nothing to fear by going to the people.""

He added that 2011's Fixed-term Parliaments Act ""was never intended to prop up a zombie government"", saying that the prime minister had ""lost control"" and suffered an ""historic and humiliating defeat"".

Mr Watson added: ""I don't doubt that [Mrs May] has sincerely attempted to fulfil the task given to us buy the voters in the referendum. I have no doubt too that she has tried her best and given it her all.

""But she has failed and I am afraid the failure is hers and hers alone.

""We know she has worked hard, but the truth is she is too set in her ways, too aloof to lead.

""She lacks the imagination and agility to bring people with her, she lacks the authority on the world stage to negotiate this deal. Ultimately she has failed.""

How did Theresa May respond?

Mrs May told MPs it was Parliament that decided to put the question of European Union membership to the people, ""and now Parliament must finish the job"".

She said extending Article 50, the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March, to allow time for an election would mean ""delaying Brexit for who knows how long"".

She repeated her offer of cross-party talks to find a way forward on Brexit, but has not so far invited the Labour leader to take part in them.

A general election would ""deepen divisions when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty,"" Mrs May said.

What do other MPs think?

Tory MP for Croydon South, Chris Philip, accused Mr Corbyn of ""shameless political opportunism"", which put ""party interests ahead of national interests"".

James Morris, Tory MP for Halesowen and Rowley Regis, said the motion was ""merely a tactical device by the opposition to cause chaos"".

And Conservative ex-minister Anna Soubry, who wants Mr Corbyn to back another EU referendum, questioned why her party were six points ahead of Labour in a weekend opinion poll, adding: ""Could it be because he's the most hopeless Leader of the Opposition that we've ever had?""

But other MPs backed Mr Corbyn, with Labour's Stephen Doughty saying his leader was ""absolutely right"" to call for a general election ""because it is not just the government's record on Brexit which is at stake tonight"".

Labour frontbencher Liam Byrne, MP for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, accused Mrs May of building ""a cage of red lines"" over Brexit.

SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the government of ""seeking to run down the clock"" over Brexit and warned that the UK could ""crash out"" of the EU with no deal.

""The risk of a no deal is something that is unthinkable,"" he said. ""If the government and the prime minister want to drive the bus over the cliff, we will not be in the passenger seat.""

Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said 48% of the population who voted to remain in the EU had been ""totally disregarded"" by the government and Mrs May had an ""unwillingness to listen"".

He said a general election provided ""another route and a welcome one"" that could resolve the issue, and he also called for a ""People's Vote"".

The leader of Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, who will vote against the government later, added her support for a ""People's Vote"", and called for the House to come together to make progress, condemning the ""pantomime point scoring"" taking place.

The DUP's leader Arlene Foster and its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds have both said they will support the government in the confidence vote.

But, speaking after what she described as a ""useful discussion"" with the prime minister, Ms Foster said ""lessons will need to be learned"" from the defeat on the Brexit deal.

""The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt and we will continue to work to that end,"" she added.

When will May budge?

A shift to promising some kind of closer relationship with the EU, whether an actual customs union or something by a similar name, seems to be becoming more likely.

That's not because everyone in the government, let alone in No 10 or in the Cabinet, thinks it's the right thing to do - Liam Fox, whose job it is to pursue an independent trade policy, is not the only one with significant doubts.

But you can see a realistic route of getting that kind of arrangement through the House of Commons.

One former minister involved in trying to persuade the PM to soften up said: ""We have three days to push and push her to move, or there won't be anything that can get through.""

Former prime minister gives backing

David Cameron, who resigned the day after the UK voted in 2016 to leave the EU, said he hoped, and thought, Mrs May would win Wednesday's vote.

Speaking to the BBC he also insisted he did not regret calling the referendum.

What happens next?

BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says that if the prime minister sees off the challenge, she will begin a series of meetings with ""senior Parliamentarians"" on Thursday.

He said Mrs May intended to retain her ""red lines"" - ruling out Labour's demand for a customs union with the EU - with sources suggesting compromising on this would risk cabinet resignations.

However, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Justice Minister David Gauke suggested that the customs union option could not be ruled out, saying: ""We have got to engage and we have got to be constructive.""

Earlier Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom told the BBC the government was clear that it will not delay or revoke Article 50, although Chancellor Philip Hammond reportedly suggested delaying Brexit in a conference call on Tuesday evening.

How does a no confidence motion work?

Image copyright UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor

By the BBC's head of political research Peter Barnes

Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years. The next one is due in 2022.

But a vote of no confidence lets MPs decide on whether they want the government to continue. The motion must be worded: ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government.""

If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown.

If during that time the current government, or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called.

That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days.

How has the EU reacted?

European leaders reacted to Tuesday's vote with dismay but gave no indication they were willing to make concessions.

Several have warned of increased chances of a no-deal Brexit, which many MPs fear will cause chaos at ports and damage industry.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, said Brussels ""profoundly regrets"" how the UK's MPs voted and said it was ""up to the British authorities"" to indicate how it would move forward.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged the UK to clarify its intentions, saying: ""Time is almost up.""

And European Council President Donald Tusk has appeared to suggest that the UK should stay in the EU.

""If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"", he tweeted.

Why did MPs reject Theresa May's deal?

The Commons defeat - the largest in history, by 432 votes to 202 - came as a huge blow for Mrs May.

She had spent two years negotiating the plan aimed at bringing about an orderly Brexit on 29 March, 2019, and setting up a 21-month transition period to negotiate a free-trade deal with Brussels.

But it faced opposition across Parliament, which has never had a majority in favour of Brexit. The UK public voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.

Some Remain MPs oppose the deal because they want a further referendum with the option to scrap Brexit, while others accept Brexit will happen but want the UK to have a closer relationship with the EU than currently proposed.

On the other side are MPs who think Mrs May's deal leaves the UK tied too closely to EU rules, while some want to see a no-deal Brexit, which is where the UK leaves the EU without any special arrangements in place.

A key sticking point on the plan remains the Northern Irish backstop - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland. Many MPs argue it could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules indefinitely.

( AFP ) – British Prime Minister David Cameron steps down on Wednesday and Theresa May prepares to take his place following a momentous referendum to leave the European Union that has sent shockwaves around the world .
Cameron will hold his final weekly question and answer session in parliament before tendering his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace .
The monarch will then call on May to form a government and the newly-anointed prime minister will make a statement outside her new Downing Street residence .
European leaders have asked the government to move quickly to renegotiate its relationship with the EU but May has indicated she will not be rushed into triggering the formal procedure for Brexit .
The 59-year-old , who will become Britain ’ s second female prime minister after Margaret Thatcher , also has to attempt to bridge Conservative Party divisions and deal with a potential economic downturn .
Her other daunting challenges include keeping pro-EU Scotland from bidding for independence in order to stay in the 28-nation bloc , and weaving new global trade and diplomatic alliances to prepare for a post-Brexit future .
May campaigned with Cameron for Britain to stay in the EU and she will also have to convince Brexit supporters that she will implement the result of the June 23 referendum to leave the EU as she has promised .
After six years in office , Cameron announced he would resign the day after the vote . He will chiefly be remembered for proposing the referendum in the first place and then spectacularly failing to clinch it .
He sought to deflect that criticism in an interview with the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday , saying : “ As I leave , I hope people will see a stronger country , a thriving economy and more chances to get on in life .
“ It has been a privilege to serve the country I love . ”
May ’ s bid for his job accelerated as key proponents of Britain ’ s EU withdrawal , including charismatic former mayor of London Boris Johnson , stepped back in a head-spinning round of political bloodletting .
The vote exposed deep inequalities in British society which May has promised to address and upended the political scene , sending her Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party into turmoil .
Labour ’ s embattled leader Jeremy Corbyn , who was accused of failing to persuade working-class voters to back EU membership , now faces a bitter leadership contest of his own against rebel lawmaker Angela Eagle .
Investors will be watching May ’ s first days in office closely but with greater optimism as the value of the pound , which fell by up to 15 percent against the dollar and the euro in the days of the Brexit vote , has rebounded on news of her impending promotion .
“ Theresa May ’ s virtual ‘ coronation ’ as prime minister has delivered a boost to the pound as the clouds of uncertainty following the Brexit vote start to disperse , ” said market analyst Neil Wilson at ETX Capital , a financial trading company in London .
May is expected to begin announcing cabinet picks later on Wednesday and these could reportedly include current energy minister Amber Rudd , foreign minister Philip Hammond and Brexit campaigner Chris Grayling , the Conservatives ’ House of Commons leader .
May has been a tough-talking interior minister for the past six years and is something of an unknown quantity internationally , although she has received ringing endorsements from party colleagues and a normally sceptical British tabloid press .
She is also liked in and around Maidenhead , the well-to-do commuter town west of London that she has represented in parliament since 1997 .
“ She will get this country back on its feet , ” said 69-year-old Jim Charlesworth , a neighbour of May and her banker husband Philip .
Martin Trepte , editor of the Maidenhead Advertiser , the local newspaper , said : “ She ’ s a mature , grown-up , no-nonsense politician . She knows her stuff . ”
The daughter of a Church of England vicar , May is a cricket fan with a sober , well-mannered demeanour who lists her hobbies as cooking and walking .
She shows a flash of flamboyance with a colourful shoe collection — particularly her leopard-skin heels — which has become famous in the British press .","British Prime Minister David Cameron steps down on Wednesday and Theresa May prepares to take his place following a momentous referendum to leave the European Union that has sent shockwaves around the world.

Original Story:

(AFP) – British Prime Minister David Cameron steps down on Wednesday and Theresa May prepares to take his place following a momentous referendum to leave the European Union that has sent shockwaves around the world.

Cameron will hold his final weekly question and answer session in parliament before tendering his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.

The monarch will then call on May to form a government and the newly-anointed prime minister will make a statement outside her new Downing Street residence.

European leaders have asked the government to move quickly to renegotiate its relationship with the EU but May has indicated she will not be rushed into triggering the formal procedure for Brexit.

The 59-year-old, who will become Britain’s second female prime minister after Margaret Thatcher, also has to attempt to bridge Conservative Party divisions and deal with a potential economic downturn.

Her other daunting challenges include keeping pro-EU Scotland from bidding for independence in order to stay in the 28-nation bloc, and weaving new global trade and diplomatic alliances to prepare for a post-Brexit future.

– Clouds start to disperse –

May campaigned with Cameron for Britain to stay in the EU and she will also have to convince Brexit supporters that she will implement the result of the June 23 referendum to leave the EU as she has promised.

After six years in office, Cameron announced he would resign the day after the vote. He will chiefly be remembered for proposing the referendum in the first place and then spectacularly failing to clinch it.

He sought to deflect that criticism in an interview with the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday, saying: “As I leave, I hope people will see a stronger country, a thriving economy and more chances to get on in life.

“It has been a privilege to serve the country I love.”

May’s bid for his job accelerated as key proponents of Britain’s EU withdrawal, including charismatic former mayor of London Boris Johnson, stepped back in a head-spinning round of political bloodletting.

The vote exposed deep inequalities in British society which May has promised to address and upended the political scene, sending her Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party into turmoil.

Labour’s embattled leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was accused of failing to persuade working-class voters to back EU membership, now faces a bitter leadership contest of his own against rebel lawmaker Angela Eagle.

Investors will be watching May’s first days in office closely but with greater optimism as the value of the pound, which fell by up to 15 percent against the dollar and the euro in the days of the Brexit vote, has rebounded on news of her impending promotion.

“Theresa May’s virtual ‘coronation’ as prime minister has delivered a boost to the pound as the clouds of uncertainty following the Brexit vote start to disperse,” said market analyst Neil Wilson at ETX Capital, a financial trading company in London.

May is expected to begin announcing cabinet picks later on Wednesday and these could reportedly include current energy minister Amber Rudd, foreign minister Philip Hammond and Brexit campaigner Chris Grayling, the Conservatives’ House of Commons leader.

– Leopard-skin heels –

May has been a tough-talking interior minister for the past six years and is something of an unknown quantity internationally, although she has received ringing endorsements from party colleagues and a normally sceptical British tabloid press.

She is also liked in and around Maidenhead, the well-to-do commuter town west of London that she has represented in parliament since 1997.

“She will get this country back on its feet,” said 69-year-old Jim Charlesworth, a neighbour of May and her banker husband Philip.

Martin Trepte, editor of the Maidenhead Advertiser, the local newspaper, said: “She’s a mature, grown-up, no-nonsense politician. She knows her stuff.”

The daughter of a Church of England vicar, May is a cricket fan with a sober, well-mannered demeanour who lists her hobbies as cooking and walking.

She shows a flash of flamboyance with a colourful shoe collection — particularly her leopard-skin heels — which has become famous in the British press.",www.breitbart.com,right,HHnadjeT4yCuHVNk
great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49810261,"Supreme Court: Suspending Parliament was unlawful, judges rule",,,"Boris Johnson 's decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks was unlawful , the Supreme Court has ruled .
Judges said it was wrong to stop MPs carrying out duties in the run-up to the Brexit deadline on 31 October .
The PM , who has faced calls to resign , said he `` profoundly disagreed '' with the ruling but would `` respect '' it .
The Labour conference finished early following the ruling and MPs are returning to Westminster ready for Parliament to reconvene on Wednesday .
A senior government official said the prime minister spoke to the Queen after the Supreme Court ruling , but would not reveal the details of the conversation .
It comes after the court ruled it was impossible to conclude there had been any reason `` let alone a good reason - to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament for five weeks '' .
Mr Johnson , who returns to London from New York on Wednesday , also chaired a 30-minute phone call with his cabinet .
A source told the BBC that the Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said to other cabinet ministers on the call that the action by the court had amounted to a `` constitutional coup '' .
The prime minister insisted he wanted to outline his government 's policies in a Queen 's Speech on 14 October , and to do that , Parliament must be prorogued and a new session started .
But critics said he was trying to stop MPs scrutinising his Brexit plans and the suspension was far longer than necessary .
During a speech in New York , the PM said he `` refused to be deterred '' from getting on with `` an exciting and dynamic domestic agenda '' , and to do that he would need a Queen 's Speech .
The court ruling does not prevent him from proroguing again in order to hold one , as long as it does not stop Parliament carrying out its duties `` without reasonable justification '' .
A No 10 source said the Supreme Court had `` made a serious mistake in extending its reach to these political matters '' , and had `` made it clear that its reasons [ were ] connected to the Parliamentary disputes over , and timetable for '' Brexit .
But Supreme Court president Lady Hale emphasised in the ruling that the case was `` not about when and on what terms '' the UK left the EU - it was about the decision to suspend Parliament .
Delivering the justices ' conclusions , she said : `` The decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification . ''
Lady Hale said the unanimous decision of the 11 justices meant Parliament had effectively not been prorogued - the decision was null and of no effect .
Speaker of the Commons John Bercow said MPs needed to return `` in light of the explicit judgement '' , and he had `` instructed the House of Commons authorities to prepare ... for the resumption of business '' from 11:30 BST on Wednesday .
He said prime minister 's questions would not go ahead , but there would be `` full scope '' for urgent questions , ministerial statements and applications for emergency debates .
Short of the inscrutable Lady Hale , with the giant diamond spider on her lapel , declaring Boris Johnson to be Pinocchio , this judgement is just about as bad for the government as it gets .
Mr Johnson is , as is abundantly clear , prepared to run a general election campaign that pits Parliament against the people . And so what , according to that view of the world , if that includes the judges as part of the establishment standing in his way ?
But there is a difference between being ruthless and reckless .
And the scope and strength of this judgement can not just be dismissed as some pesky judges sticking their noses in .
Reacting to the ruling , Mr Johnson said it was an `` unusual judgement '' , adding : `` The prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge .
`` There are a lot of people who basically want to stop this country from coming out of the EU and we have a Parliament that is unable to be prorogued and does n't want to have an election . I think it is time we took things forward . ''
The PM said getting a deal was `` not made much easier with these sort of things in Parliament or the courts '' , but insisted the UK would still leave on 31 October .
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was due to close the Labour Party conference in Brighton with a speech on Wednesday , but brought it forward to Tuesday afternoon so he could return to Westminster .
He told cheering delegates : `` Tomorrow Parliament will return . The government will be held to account for what it has done . Boris Johnson has been found to have misled the country . This unelected prime minister should now resign . ''
Lawyers for the government had argued the decision to prorogue was one for Parliament , not the courts .
But the justices disagreed , unanimously deciding it was `` justiciable '' , and there was `` no doubt that the courts have jurisdiction to decide upon the existence and limits of a prerogative power '' .
The court also criticised the length of the suspension , with Lady Hale saying it was `` impossible for us to conclude , on the evidence which has been put before us , that there was any reason - let alone a good reason - to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament for five weeks '' .
A spokesperson from the Attorney General 's office said the government had acted in `` good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional '' .
`` These are complex matters on which senior and distinguished lawyers have disagreed , '' a statement said .
`` The Divisional Court led by the Lord Chief Justice agreed unanimously with the government 's legal position , as did the Outer House in Scotland .
`` We are disappointed that in the end the Supreme Court took a different view . We respect the judgment of the Supreme Court . ''
It is worth just taking a breath and considering that a prime minister of the United Kingdom has been found by the highest court in the land to have acted unlawfully in shutting down the sovereign body in our constitution , Parliament , at a time of national crisis .
The court may have fallen short of saying Boris Johnson had an improper motive of stymieing or frustrating parliamentary scrutiny , but the damage is done , he has been found to have acted unlawfully and stopped Parliament from doing its job without any legal justification .
And the court has quashed both his advice to the Queen and the Order in Council which officially suspended parliament .
That means Parliament was never prorogued and so we assume that MPs are free to re-enter the Commons .
This is the most dramatic example yet of independent judges , through the mechanism of judicial review , stopping the government in its tracks because what it has done is unlawful .
Be you ever so mighty , the law is above you - even if you are the prime minister .
Unprecedented , extraordinary , ground breaking - it is difficult to overestimate the constitutional and political significance of today 's ruling .
The ruling was made after a three-day hearing at the Supreme Court last week which dealt with two appeals - one from campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller , the second from the government .
Mrs Miller was appealing against the English High Court 's decision that the prorogation was `` purely political '' and not a matter for the courts .
The government was appealing against the ruling by Scotland 's Court of Session that the prorogation was `` unlawful '' and had been used to `` stymie '' Parliament .
The court ruled in favour of Mrs Miller 's appeal and against the government 's .
Speaking outside the court , Mrs Miller said the ruling `` speaks volumes '' .
`` This prime minister must open the doors of Parliament tomorrow . MPs must get back and be brave and bold in holding this unscrupulous government to account , '' she added .
The SNP 's Joanna Cherry , who led the Scottish case , called for Mr Johnson to resign as a result of the ruling .
`` The highest court in the United Kingdom has unanimously found that his advice to prorogue this Parliament , his advice given to Her Majesty the Queen , was unlawful , '' she said .
`` His position is untenable and he should have the guts , for once , to do the decent thing and resign . ''
Former Prime Minister Sir John Major - one of the sponsors of the prorogation appeal - said it gave him `` no pleasure to be pitted against a government and prime minister of my own party '' .
`` No prime minister must ever treat the monarch or Parliament in this way again . ''
Mr Johnson was backed by US President Donald Trump at a joint press conference at the United Nations in New York .
`` I 'll tell you , I know him well , he 's not going anywhere , '' said Mr Trump , after a US reporter quizzed the prime minister on whether he was going to resign .
But reaction at home was far more negative . Scotland 's First Minister , the SNP 's Nicola Sturgeon , said the ruling was the most significant constitutional judgement in her lifetime , and it would be `` unthinkable '' for Mr Johnson to remain in office .
Wales ' First Minister , Labour 's Mark Drakeford , said the court 's decision had been a `` victory for the rule of law '' and the PM had `` tried to play fast and loose with our constitution '' .
In Northern Ireland , the leader of the DUP , Arlene Foster , said the ruling must be respected , while Sinn Fein 's vice president , Michelle O'Neill , said Mr Johnson should resign .
Other figures have taken to Twitter to support the court 's decision , including former Tory minister Amber Rudd , who resigned her post - and the party whip - over the government 's approach to Brexit .
The leader of The Brexit Party , Nigel Farage , said Mr Johnson must , `` as a matter of honour '' , offer his resignation to MPs in Parliament on Wednesday .
The decision to prorogue Parliament had been a `` disaster '' , he added , and there must be a general election `` before very long because Parliament and the government have ceased to function '' .
Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve , who has been an outspoken critic of the suspension , said he was `` not surprised '' by the judgement because of the `` gross misbehaviour by the prime minister '' .
He told the BBC 's Victoria Derbyshire programme he was `` delighted '' the Supreme Court had `` stopped this unconstitutional act in its tracks '' .
But Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said the court 's decision was `` the worst possible outcome for our democracy '' and `` an absolute disgrace '' .
He told the same programme : `` What we 've got is a Parliament that 's completely out of step with sentiment of the country . ''
Fellow Tory MP and chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group Steve Baker said the ruling was an `` earthquake moment '' .
He described the Commons as a `` rotten Parliament '' facing a `` crisis '' , and called for a general election so a government with a majority could move forward .
Prorogation is a power that rests with the Queen , carried out by her on the advice of the prime minister .
And at the end of August - shortly before MPs returned from their summer recess - Mr Johnson called Her Majesty to advise she suspend Parliament between 9 September until 14 October .
MPs had been expecting to be in recess for some of these weeks for their party conferences .
But unlike prorogation , a recess must be agreed by a vote , and a number of MPs said they would have voted against it to ensure they could scrutinise Mr Johnson 's Brexit plans .
The decision to prorogue prompted an uproar from the Commons , especially from MPs who had planned to take control of Parliament to force through a law to block a no-deal Brexit after Mr Johnson said the UK would leave the EU with or without a deal on the Halloween deadline .
Despite only sitting for a week , they did manage to pass that law ahead of prorogation and it received royal assent on 9 September .

What happened before Parliament was suspended?

Prorogation is a power that rests with the Queen, carried out by her on the advice of the prime minister.

And at the end of August - shortly before MPs returned from their summer recess - Mr Johnson called Her Majesty to advise she suspend Parliament between 9 September until 14 October.

great_britain,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu/eu-gives-may-till-october-for-brexit-seeking-clarity-idUSKCN1RM0LX,"EU gives May till October for Brexit, seeking clarity",2019-04-11,Elizabeth Piper,"BRUSSELS ( ███ ) - European Union leaders gave Britain six more months to leave the bloc , more than Prime Minister Theresa May says she needs but less than many in the bloc wanted , thanks to fierce resistance from France .
The summit deal in Brussels in the early hours of Thursday meant Britain will not crash out on Friday without a treaty to smooth its passage . But it offers little clarity on when , how or even if Brexit will happen , as May struggles to build support in parliament for withdrawal terms agreed with the EU last year .
With German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisting that Britain would not be forced out and that a chaotic no-deal departure must be avoided if at all possible , there was never any real doubt that May would get an extension .
French President Emmanuel Macron , reprising a role he took last month when May got a first , two-week delay , pushed leaders into hours of debate over dinner as he fought a largely solo campaign to persuade them not to give the British up to another year .
Summit chair Donald Tusk and others argued that obliging May to accept a much longer deadline than the June 30 date she had sought could help swing pro-Brexit hardliners within her own Conservative party behind her deal , fearing a long delay could see the British public turning against a withdrawal altogether .
But Macron , while irritating some peers who saw his stance as Gallic grandstanding , insisted that letting Britain stay in the Union any longer risked undermining the project of European integration that is one of his main policy goals .
The result was a compromise on the date , with a deadline of Oct. 31 , for Britain to leave , deal or no deal — on condition that May holds an election on May 23 to return British members to a new European Parliament that convenes in July , and that it pledge not to disrupt key EU decision-making before it leaves .
If May fails to win over lawmakers on the treaty or fails to hold an election , Britain will leave with no deal on June 1 .
The prime minister was keen to stress that the extension to Oct. 31 — and several leaders refused to rule out further delays — did not mean she would not deliver Brexit sooner and before , as she promised her rebellious party , she steps down .
“ I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension , ” she told reporters , as her team prepared for another round of talks on Thursday with the Labour opposition , to whom May turned for help last week .

“ But the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear . So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach consensus on a deal that is in the national interest , ” she added , acknowledging the coming weeks would not be easy .
Tusk , a former Polish premier who has long tried to keep a door open for Britons to change their minds and stay , said the delay until Halloween gave time for London to ratify May ’ s deal , tweak elements of the future EU-UK relationship to Labour ’ s liking — or give it a chance to “ cancel Brexit altogether ” .
Merkel , who eased tension at the start of the talks by sharing a joke with May over photographs of them both wearing very similar jackets , stressed a need for calm and order : “ We want an orderly exit by Britain , ” she said . “ And an orderly exit by Britain can be best ensured if we give it some time . ”
Macron defended his resistance to giving Britain nine months or a year more , saying it was for the “ common good ” . French officials , pointing to threats by some of May ’ s pro-Brexit potential successors , spoke of the EU facing “ blackmail ” by a future British government blocking decisions in Brussels .
“ It ’ s true that the majority was more in favor of a very long extension . But it was not logical in my view , and above all , it was neither good for us , nor for the UK , ” said Macron .
French pressure also tightened clauses referring to Britain not disrupting EU affairs if it stays in longer and a reference to a June 20-21 EU summit taking stock of the position again .
May addressed the other 27 for an hour at the start of the summit and failed to convince many , notably Macron , that she truly had a new strategy for securing ratification .

The summit deal in Brussels in the early hours of Thursday meant Britain will not crash out on Friday without a treaty to smooth its passage. But it offers little clarity on when, how or even if Brexit will happen, as May struggles to build support in parliament for withdrawal terms agreed with the EU last year.

With German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisting that Britain would not be forced out and that a chaotic no-deal departure must be avoided if at all possible, there was never any real doubt that May would get an extension.

The drama was about its length and conditions.

French President Emmanuel Macron, reprising a role he took last month when May got a first, two-week delay, pushed leaders into hours of debate over dinner as he fought a largely solo campaign to persuade them not to give the British up to another year.

Summit chair Donald Tusk and others argued that obliging May to accept a much longer deadline than the June 30 date she had sought could help swing pro-Brexit hardliners within her own Conservative party behind her deal, fearing a long delay could see the British public turning against a withdrawal altogether.

But Macron, while irritating some peers who saw his stance as Gallic grandstanding, insisted that letting Britain stay in the Union any longer risked undermining the project of European integration that is one of his main policy goals.

The result was a compromise on the date, with a deadline of Oct. 31, for Britain to leave, deal or no deal — on condition that May holds an election on May 23 to return British members to a new European Parliament that convenes in July, and that it pledge not to disrupt key EU decision-making before it leaves.

If May fails to win over lawmakers on the treaty or fails to hold an election, Britain will leave with no deal on June 1.

MAY EYES BREXIT SOON

The prime minister was keen to stress that the extension to Oct. 31 — and several leaders refused to rule out further delays — did not mean she would not deliver Brexit sooner and before, as she promised her rebellious party, she steps down.

“I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension,” she told reporters, as her team prepared for another round of talks on Thursday with the Labour opposition, to whom May turned for help last week.

“But the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear. So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach consensus on a deal that is in the national interest,” she added, acknowledging the coming weeks would not be easy.

Tusk, a former Polish premier who has long tried to keep a door open for Britons to change their minds and stay, said the delay until Halloween gave time for London to ratify May’s deal, tweak elements of the future EU-UK relationship to Labour’s liking — or give it a chance to “cancel Brexit altogether”.

Merkel, who eased tension at the start of the talks by sharing a joke with May over photographs of them both wearing very similar jackets, stressed a need for calm and order: “We want an orderly exit by Britain,” she said. “And an orderly exit by Britain can be best ensured if we give it some time.”

FRENCH RESISTANCE

Macron defended his resistance to giving Britain nine months or a year more, saying it was for the “common good”. French officials, pointing to threats by some of May’s pro-Brexit potential successors, spoke of the EU facing “blackmail” by a future British government blocking decisions in Brussels.

“It’s true that the majority was more in favor of a very long extension. But it was not logical in my view, and above all, it was neither good for us, nor for the UK,” said Macron.

French pressure also tightened clauses referring to Britain not disrupting EU affairs if it stays in longer and a reference to a June 20-21 EU summit taking stock of the position again.

May addressed the other 27 for an hour at the start of the summit and failed to convince many, notably Macron, that she truly had a new strategy for securing ratification.

Leaders are exasperated with May’s handling of a tortuous and costly divorce that is a distraction from ensuring the bloc can hold its own against global economic challenges.

Across from the summit venue, the EU executive celebrated its part in funding a global project that produced the first picture of a black hole, prompting no shortage of ironic comments on social media about the juxtaposition.

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50786580,"General election 2019: Let the healing begin, urges victorious PM",,,"Boris Johnson has said he hopes his party 's `` extraordinary '' election win will bring `` closure '' to the Brexit debate and `` let the healing begin '' .
Speaking in Downing Street , he said he would seek to repay the trust placed in him by Labour supporters who had voted Conservative for the first time .
He said he would not ignore those who opposed Brexit as he builds with Europe a partnership `` of sovereign equals '' .
The Tories have won a Commons majority of 80 , the party 's largest since 1987 .
It means the UK is heading out of the EU at the end of next month , the BBC 's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said , with Mr Johnson 's `` thumping '' majority allowing him to get the laws required through Parliament `` in a matter of weeks '' .
The Conservatives ' victory in the 650th and final contest of the election - the seat of St Ives , in Cornwall - took their total number of MPs up to 365 . Labour finished on 203 , the SNP 48 , Liberal Democrats 11 and the DUP eight .
Sinn Fein has seven MPs , Plaid Cymru four and Northern Ireland 's SDLP has two . The Green Party and NI 's Alliance Party have one each .
The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer 's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats .
The Conservatives swept aside Labour in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and the north of England and picked up seats across Wales , while holding off the Lib Dem challenge in many seats in the south of England .
Voter turnout overall , on a cold and damp polling day , was 67.3 % , which is down by 1.5 % on the 2017 total .
Speaking outside No 10 , Mr Johnson thanked lifelong Labour supporters who deserted Jeremy Corbyn 's party and turned to the Conservatives , saying he would fulfil his pledge to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January .
`` I say thank you for the trust you have placed in us and in me and we will work round the clock to repay your trust and to deliver on your priorities with a Parliament that works for you '' .
Mr Johnson , who earlier accepted the Queen 's invitation to form a government , also addressed those who did not vote for the Conservatives and still want to remain in the EU .
`` We in this One Nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe , '' he said .
Mr Johnson 's focus on the one nation pitch suggests he will seek to offer policies to people beyond the Tory heartlands - more public spending , for example , after years of austerity , the BBC 's political correspondent Nick Eardley said .
He added that there is no strict definition of one nation conservatism , `` but broadly , it refers to the idea the Conservative Party should act for everybody in the UK . That means policies that work for people from different economic backgrounds , from different regions and from the different nations of the UK . ''
When they return to Westminster next week , MPs are due to begin the process of considering legislation paving the way for the UK to leave on 31 January . Talks about a future trade and security relationship will begin almost immediately .
Nevertheless , Mr Johnson said the UK `` deserves a break from wrangling , a break from politics and a permanent break from talking about Brexit '' . `` I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin . ''
He said he would use his new-found parliamentary authority to bring the country together and `` level up '' opportunities , while he said he recognised that the NHS remained the `` overwhelming priority '' of the British people .
The BBC 's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM 's appeal for unity marked a striking change in tone to when he first became prime minister in July .
At 33 % , Labour 's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by former leader Neil Kinnock in 1992 .
Mr Corbyn has said he will not fight another election as Labour leader and that he expects to stand down `` early next year '' when a successor has been chosen by the party .
But he insisted he had done all he could , adding that he had received `` more personal abuse '' from the media during the campaign than any previous prime ministerial candidate .
Senior Labour figures have sought to defend the party 's strategy , arguing that many of its policies were popular but that Brexit had crowded out all other issues for many voters .
Wes Streeting , the newly elected MP for Ilford North , said the party 's `` far left '' manifesto had jarred with the electorate and blaming Brexit was an attempt to `` kneecap '' credible centrist candidates such as Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry .
Meanwhile , Jo Swinson has quit as Liberal Democrat leader after losing her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes .

Boris Johnson has said he hopes his party's ""extraordinary"" election win will bring ""closure"" to the Brexit debate and ""let the healing begin"".

Speaking in Downing Street, he said he would seek to repay the trust placed in him by Labour supporters who had voted Conservative for the first time.

He said he would not ignore those who opposed Brexit as he builds with Europe a partnership ""of sovereign equals"".

The Tories have won a Commons majority of 80, the party's largest since 1987.

It means the UK is heading out of the EU at the end of next month, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, with Mr Johnson's ""thumping"" majority allowing him to get the laws required through Parliament ""in a matter of weeks"".

The Conservatives' victory in the 650th and final contest of the election - the seat of St Ives, in Cornwall - took their total number of MPs up to 365. Labour finished on 203, the SNP 48, Liberal Democrats 11 and the DUP eight.

Sinn Fein has seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four and Northern Ireland's SDLP has two. The Green Party and NI's Alliance Party have one each.

The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats.

The Conservatives swept aside Labour in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and the north of England and picked up seats across Wales, while holding off the Lib Dem challenge in many seats in the south of England.

Voter turnout overall, on a cold and damp polling day, was 67.3%, which is down by 1.5% on the 2017 total.

'Break from wrangling'

Speaking outside No 10, Mr Johnson thanked lifelong Labour supporters who deserted Jeremy Corbyn's party and turned to the Conservatives, saying he would fulfil his pledge to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January.

""I say thank you for the trust you have placed in us and in me and we will work round the clock to repay your trust and to deliver on your priorities with a Parliament that works for you"".

Mr Johnson, who earlier accepted the Queen's invitation to form a government, also addressed those who did not vote for the Conservatives and still want to remain in the EU.

""We in this One Nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe,"" he said.

Mr Johnson's focus on the one nation pitch suggests he will seek to offer policies to people beyond the Tory heartlands - more public spending, for example, after years of austerity, the BBC's political correspondent Nick Eardley said.

He added that there is no strict definition of one nation conservatism, ""but broadly, it refers to the idea the Conservative Party should act for everybody in the UK. That means policies that work for people from different economic backgrounds, from different regions and from the different nations of the UK.""

When they return to Westminster next week, MPs are due to begin the process of considering legislation paving the way for the UK to leave on 31 January. Talks about a future trade and security relationship will begin almost immediately.

Nevertheless, Mr Johnson said the UK ""deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics and a permanent break from talking about Brexit"". ""I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.""

He said he would use his new-found parliamentary authority to bring the country together and ""level up"" opportunities, while he said he recognised that the NHS remained the ""overwhelming priority"" of the British people.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM's appeal for unity marked a striking change in tone to when he first became prime minister in July.

At 33%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by former leader Neil Kinnock in 1992.

Mr Corbyn has said he will not fight another election as Labour leader and that he expects to stand down ""early next year"" when a successor has been chosen by the party.

But he insisted he had done all he could, adding that he had received ""more personal abuse"" from the media during the campaign than any previous prime ministerial candidate.

Senior Labour figures have sought to defend the party's strategy, arguing that many of its policies were popular but that Brexit had crowded out all other issues for many voters.

Wes Streeting, the newly elected MP for Ilford North, said the party's ""far left"" manifesto had jarred with the electorate and blaming Brexit was an attempt to ""kneecap"" credible centrist candidates such as Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry.

Meanwhile, Jo Swinson has quit as Liberal Democrat leader after losing her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes.

While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics.

After the SNP's ""overwhelming"" election victory, which saw the party win 48 of Scotland's 59 seats, Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson had ""no right"" to stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum.

However, the prime minister later spoke to the first minister by phone on Friday evening, with Downing Street saying he had told her he ""remained opposed"" to a second vote.

Mr Johnson was also said to have insisted that the result of the 2014 referendum ""should be respected"" after ""reiterating his unwavering commitment"" to the union.

Boris Johnson will become Britain’s next prime minister after winning a convincing victory over Jeremy Hunt in the Conservative party leadership race.

The former mayor of London, who has long cherished an ambition to lead his country, won 66% of the votes – 92,153, to Hunt’s 46,656. Turnout was 87.4% among 159,320 party members.

In a characteristically lighthearted acceptance speech, Johnson conceded that even some of his own supporters may “wonder quite what they have done”.

He claimed the Tory party had historically demonstrated it could “manage the jostling instincts in the human heart” – such as those of owning a home and helping the poorest in society.

The result of the contest was announced by the joint chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Cheryl Gillan. Her colleague, Charles Walker, first urged MPs to be “kinder” to the new leader than they had been to Theresa May.

Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chair, introduced the slick event at a conference centre in Westminster, saying the race had shown that his party was fundamentally united.

He will not take office formally until Wednesday afternoon. May will face her final prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons before tendering her resignation to the Queen.

Johnson will then go to Buckingham Palace for his appointment to be confirmed before being driven to Downing Street to give a speech in front of the black door of No 10.

He takes charge at a perilous political moment. The Conservatives’ wafer-thin parliamentary working majority is expected to be eroded further next week – to just two – if the Liberal Democrats win the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection.

Johnson has faced a furious internal revolt even before arriving in Downing Street, with several key cabinet ministers, including Hammond saying they would resign rather than serve under him.

They have been alarmed by Johnson’s insistence that he is willing to countenance leaving the European Union without a deal on 31 October, rather than postpone Brexit once again, even if that meant proroguing parliament.

Despite painstaking media management, his campaign has been dogged by a series of controversies, including the revelation that police had been called to a noisy argument at the home he shares with his partner, Carrie Symonds.

Johnson was also blamed by some colleagues, including Duncan for the resignation of the ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, after confidential diplomatic cables about Trump were leaked. Duncan said the former foreign secretary had thrown Darroch “under a bus”.

However, Johnson had been the runaway favourite to become leader after securing support from both wings of the bitterly divided Tory party, from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to the chair of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg.

He is regarded by colleagues as an impressive political campaigner, and the man with the best chance of seeing off the formidable electoral challenge from Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, which beat the Tories soundly in May’s European elections.

May will leave Downing Street on Wednesday after a three-year premiership overwhelmingly defined by the failure of her government to implement Brexit.

Johnson is likely to embark on fresh negotiations with EU leaders and key Brussels decision makers as soon as possible, with a view to securing changes to May’s deal in time for the Halloween deadline.

But with no secure majority, and Labour determined to demand a referendum on any deal he brings back from Brussels, many MPs believe he could be forced to call a general election within months in order to win a mandate for his plan.",www.theguardian.com,left,nHwKMlst77q1y6Q2

Analysis

by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent

So was it Boris Johnson what done it? Was the failure of the former foreign secretary to defend Sir Kim in last night's Tory leadership debate the crucial factor in the ambassador's decision to resign?

Without Sir Kim speaking publicly on the subject, we are reliant on others to speak for him.

And certainly, according to well-placed sources in Whitehall, Mr Johnson's decision to avoid criticising President Trump and his lack of support for Sir Kim was said to be the straw that broke the camel's back.

LONDON — Britain's former Prime Minister Tony Blair has apologized for ""mistakes"" made in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

great_britain,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-path-speci/special-report-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm-idUSKBN21P1VF,Special Report: Johnson listened to his scientists about coronavirus - but they were slow to sound the alarm,2020-04-07,Stephen Grey,"LONDON ( ███ ) - It was early spring when British scientists laid out the bald truth to their government . It was “ highly likely , ” they said , that there was now “ sustained transmission ” of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom .
If unconstrained and if the virus behaved as in China , up to four-fifths of Britons could be infected and one in a hundred might die , wrote the scientists , members of an official committee set up to model the spread of pandemic flu , on March 2 . Their assessment didn ’ t spell it out , but that was a prediction of over 500,000 deaths in this nation of nearly 70 million .
Yet the next day , March 3 , Prime Minister Boris Johnson was his cheery self . He joked that he was still shaking hands with everyone , including at a hospital treating coronavirus patients .
“ Our country remains extremely well prepared , ” Johnson said as Italy reached 79 deaths . “ We already have a fantastic NHS , ” the national public health service , “ fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease . ”
Alongside him at the Downing Street press conference was Chris Whitty , the government ’ s chief medical adviser and himself an epidemiologist . Whitty passed on the modelling committee ’ s broad conclusions , including the prediction of a possible 80 % infection rate and the consequent deaths . But he played them down , saying the number of people who would be infected was probably “ a lot lower ” and coming up with a total was “ largely speculative . ”
The upbeat tone of that briefing stood in sharp contrast with the growing unease of many of the government ’ s scientific advisers behind the scenes . They were already convinced that Britain was on the brink of a disastrous outbreak , a ███ investigation has found .
Interviews with more than 20 British scientists , key officials and senior sources in Johnson ’ s Conservative Party , and a study of minutes of advisory committee meetings and public testimony and documents , show how these scientific advisers concluded early the virus could be devastating .
But the interviews and documents also reveal that for more than two months , the scientists whose advice guided Downing Street did not clearly signal their worsening fears to the public or the government . Until March 12 , the risk level , set by the government ’ s top medical advisers on the recommendation of the scientists , remained at “ moderate , ” suggesting only the possibility of a wider outbreak .
“ You know , there ’ s a small little cadre of people in the middle , who absolutely did realise what was going on , and likely to happen , ” said John Edmunds , a professor of infectious disease modelling and a key adviser to the government , known for his work on tracking Ebola . Edmunds was among those who did call on the government to elevate the warning level earlier .
From the outset , said Edmunds , work by scientists had shown that , with only limited interventions , the virus would trigger an “ overwhelming epidemic ” in which Britain ’ s health service was not going “ to get anywhere near being able to cope with it . That was clear from the beginning . ”
But he said : “ I do think there ’ s a bit of a worry in terms you don ’ t want to unnecessarily panic people . ”
Johnson , who himself has sickened with the virus , moved more slowly than the leaders of many other prosperous countries to adopt a lockdown . He has been criticised for not moving more swiftly to organise mass tests and mobilise supplies of life-saving equipment and beds . Johnson was hospitalized on April 5 and moved to intensive care the next day .
It is too soon to judge the ultimate soundness of the UK ’ s early response . If history concludes that it was lacking , then the criticism levelled at the prime minister may be that , rather than ignoring the advice of his scientific advisers , he failed to question their assumptions .
Interviews and records published so far suggest that the scientific committees that advised Johnson didn ’ t study , until mid-March , the option of the kind of stringent lockdown adopted early on in China , where the disease arose in December , and then followed by much of Europe and finally by Britain itself . The scientists ’ reasoning : Britons , many of them assumed , simply wouldn ’ t accept such restrictions .
The UK scientists were also mostly convinced - and many still are - that , once the new virus escaped China , quarantine measures would likely not succeed . Minutes of technical committees reviewed by ███ indicate that almost no attention was paid to preparing a programme of mass testing . Other minutes and interviews show Britain was following closely a well-laid plan to fight a flu pandemic - not this deadlier disease . The scientists involved , however , deny that the flu focus ultimately made much difference .
Now , as countries debate how to combat the virus , some experts here say , the lesson from the British experience may be that governments and scientists worldwide must increase the transparency of their planning so that their thinking and assumptions are open to challenge .
John Ashton , a clinician and former regional director of Public Health England , the government agency overseeing healthcare , said the government ’ s advisers took too narrow a view and hewed to limited assumptions . They were too “ narrowly drawn as scientists from a few institutions , ” he said . Their handling of COVID-19 , Ashton said , shows the need for a broader approach . “ In the future we need a much wider group of independent advisers . ”

When news came from China in January of a new infectious disease , Johnson had reason to believe his country was well prepared . It had some of the world ’ s best scientists and a well-drilled plan to deal with potentially lethal pandemics . Perhaps , some scientists say in hindsight , the plan made them slow to adapt .
For many years , the Cabinet Office - a collection of officials who act as the prime minister ’ s direct arm to run the government - took the threat of pandemics seriously . Presciently , it rated pandemics as the Number 1 threat to the country , ahead of terrorism and financial crashes .
At the centre of planning was a small group of scientists , among them Edmunds . His research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine runs one of the two computer modelling centres for epidemics that have mostly driven government policy . The other is at nearby Imperial College . Edmunds remembers that early in the outbreak , the data from China were sketchy , in the period “ where the Chinese were trying to pretend that this wasn ’ t transmissible between humans . ”
Edmunds and his colleague at Imperial , Neil Ferguson , were part of an alphabet soup of committees that fed advice into the Cabinet Office machinery around the prime minister . Both were founders of the flu pandemic modelling committee , known as SPI-M , that produced the March 2 report warning of more than 500,000 deaths . This committee had met together for nearly 15 years .
Ferguson did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article .
Edmunds and Ferguson were also part of NERVTAG , the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group . Both too were members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies , known as SAGE , that advises the government in times of crisis . SAGE reports directly to Johnson and the government ’ s main emergency committee , COBRA .
At first , when NERVTAG met on January 13 , it studied information from China that there was “ no evidence of significant human to human transmission ” of the new virus , according to minutes of the meeting . The scientists agreed the risk to the UK population was “ very low . ”
The evidence soon changed , but this wasn ’ t reflected in the official threat level . By the end of January , scientists in China began releasing clinical data . Case studies published in the British medical journal , The Lancet , showed 17 % of the first 99 coronavirus cases needed critical care . Eleven patients died . Another Chinese study , in the same magazine , warned starkly of a global spread and urged : “ Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally . ”
Edmunds recalled that “ from about mid January onwards , it was absolutely obvious that this was serious , very serious. ” Graham Medley , a professor of infectious diseases modelling at the London School and chairman of SPI-M , agreed . He said that the committee was “ clear that this was going to be big from the first meeting. ” At the end of January , his committee moved into “ wartime ” mode , he said , reporting directly into SAGE .
Dr Jon Read , a senior lecturer in biostatistics at the University of Lancaster , also a member of SPI-M , said by the end of January it was apparent the virus had “ pandemic potential ” and that death rates for the elderly were brutal . “ From my perspective within the sort of modelling community , everybody ’ s aware of this , and we ’ re saying that this is probably going to be pretty bad , ” he said .
But the scientists did not articulate their fears forcefully to the government , minutes of committee meetings reveal .
On January 21 , scientists on NERVTAG endorsed the elevation of the UK risk warning from COVID-19 from “ very low ” to “ low. ” SAGE met formally for the first time the following day about the coronavirus threat . So did COBRA , which was chaired by Matt Hancock , the health secretary , who would contract the virus himself in late March . He told reporters after the meeting : “ The clinical advice is that the risk to the public remains low . ”
In response to questions from ███ , the government ’ s Department of Health declined to clarify how the risk levels are defined or what action , if any , they trigger . In a statement , a spokesperson said : “ Increasing the risk level in the UK is a belt and braces measure which allows the government to plan for all future eventualities . ”
Two days later , China put the city of Wuhan , where the outbreak began , into a complete lockdown . Hubei , the surrounding province , would follow . But already , 17 passenger flights had flown directly from Wuhan to Britain since the start of 2020 , and 614 flights from the whole of China , according to FlightRadar24 , a flight-tracking service . That meant thousands of Chinese , some of them potential carriers , had come to Britain . On April 5 , scientific adviser Ferguson said he estimated only one-third of infected people reaching Britain had been detected .
As they watched China impose its lockdown , the British scientists assumed that such drastic actions would never be acceptable in a democracy like the UK . Among those modelling the outbreak , such stringent counter-measures were not , at first , examined .
“ We had milder interventions in place , ” said Edmunds , because no one thought it would be acceptable politically “ to shut the country down. ” He added : “ We didn ’ t model it because it didn ’ t seem to be on the agenda . And Imperial ( College ) didn ’ t look at it either. ” The NERVTAG committee agreed , noting in its minutes that tough measures in the short term would be pointless , as they “ would only delay the UK outbreak , not prevent it . ”
That limited approach mirrored the UK ’ s longstanding pandemic flu strategy . The Department of Health declined a request from ███ for a copy of its updated pandemic plan , without providing a reason . But a copy of the 2011 “ UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 , ” which a spokesman said was still relevant , stated the “ working presumption will be that Government will not impose any such restrictions . The emphasis will instead be on encouraging all those who have symptoms to follow the advice to stay at home and avoid spreading their illness . ”
According to one senior Conservative Party politician , who was officially briefed as the crisis unfolded , the close involvement in the response to the coronavirus of the same scientific advisers and civil servants who drew up the flu plan may have created a “ cognitive bias . ”
“ We had in our minds that COVID-19 was a nasty flu and needed to be treated as such , ” he said . “ The implication was it was a disease that could not be stopped and that it was ultimately not that deadly . ”
While the UK was prepared to fight the flu , Asian states like China , Hong Kong , Singapore and South Korea had built their pandemic plans with lessons learned from fighting the more lethal SARS outbreak that began in 2002 , he said . SARS had a fatality rate of up to 14 % . As a result , these countries , he said , were more ready to resort to widespread testing , lockdowns and other draconian measures to keep their citizens from spreading the virus .
Scientists involved in the UK response disagree that following the government ’ s flu plan clouded their thinking or influenced the outbreak ’ s course . The plan had a “ reasonable worst case ” scenario as devastating as the worst predictions for COVID-19 , they note .
Mark Woolhouse , a professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh , and a member of the SPI-M committee , said COVID-19 did behave differently than an expected pandemic flu - for example school closures proved to be far less effective in slowing the spread of the coronavirus . But , broadly , “ the government has been consistently responsive to changing facts . ”
By the end of January , the government ’ s chief medical adviser , Whitty , was explaining to politicians in private , according to at least two people who spoke to him , that if the virus escaped China , it would in time infect the great majority of people in Britain . It could only be slowed down , not stopped . On Jan 30 , the government raised the threat level to “ moderate ” from “ low . ”
The country ’ s medical officers “ consider it prudent for our governments to escalate planning and preparation in case of a more widespread outbreak , ” a statement said at the time . Whitty did not respond to questions from ███ for this article .
On the evening of January 31 , Boris Johnson sat before a fireplace in 10 Downing Street and told the nation , in a televised address : “ This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama . ”
He was talking of finally delivering Brexit , or what he called “ this recaptured sovereignty. ” Until that moment , Johnson ’ s premiership had been utterly absorbed by delivering on that challenge .
With Brexit done , Johnson had the chance to focus on other matters the following month , among them the emerging virus threat . But leaving the European Union had a consequence .
Between February 13 and March 30 , Britain missed a total of eight conference calls or meetings about the coronavirus between EU heads of state or health ministers - meetings that Britain was still entitled to join . Although Britain did later make an arrangement to attend lower-level meetings of officials , it had missed a deadline to participate in a common purchase scheme for ventilators , to which it was invited . Ventilators , vitally important to treating the direst cases of COVID-19 , have fallen into short supply globally . Johnson ’ s spokesman blamed an administrative error .
A Downing Street aide told ███ that from around the end of January , Johnson concentrated his attention increasingly on the coronavirus threat , receiving “ very frequent ” updates at least once per day from mid February , either in person or via a daily dashboard of cases .
In the medical and scientific world , there was growing concern about the threat of the virus to the UK . A report from Exeter University , published on February 12 , warned a UK outbreak could peak within four months and , without mitigation , infect 45 million people .
That worried Rahuldeb Sarkar , a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in the county of Kent , who foresaw that intensive care beds could be swamped . Even if disease transmission was reduced by half , he wrote in a report aimed at clinicians and actuaries in mid-February , a coronavirus outbreak in the UK would “ have a chance of overwhelming the system . ”
With Whitty stating in a BBC interview on February 13 that a UK outbreak was still an “ if , not a when , ” Richard Horton , a medical doctor and editor of the Lancet , said the government and public health service wasted an opportunity that month to prepare quarantine restriction measures and a programme of mass tests , and procure resources like ventilators and personal protective equipment for expanded intensive care .
Calling the lost chance a “ national scandal ” in a later editorial , he would testify to parliament about a mismatch between “ the urgent warning that was coming from the frontline in China ” and the “ somewhat pedestrian evaluation ” of the threat from the scientific advice to the government .
After developing a test for the new virus by January 10 , health officials adopted a centralised approach to its deployment , initially assigning a single public laboratory in north London to perform the tests . But , according to later government statements , there was no wider plan envisaged to make use of hundreds of laboratories across the country , both public and private , that could have been recruited .
According to emails and more than a dozen scientists interviewed by ███ , the government issued no requests to labs for assistance with staff or testing equipment until the middle of March , when many abruptly received requests to hand over nucleic acid extraction instruments , used in testing . An executive at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford said he could have carried out up to 1,000 tests per day from February . But the call never came .
“ You would have thought that they would be bashing down the door , ” said the executive , who spoke on condition of anonymity . By April 5 , Britain had carried out 195,524 tests , in contrast to at least 918,000 completed a week earlier in Germany .
Nor was there an effective effort to expand the supply of ventilators . The Department of Health told ███ in a statement that the government started talking to manufacturers of ventilators about procuring extra supplies in February . But it was not until March 16 , after it was clear supplies could run out , that Johnson launched an appeal to industry to help ramp up production .
Charles Bellm , managing director of Intersurgical , a global supplier of medical ventilation products based outside London , said he has been contacted by more than a dozen governments around the world , including France , New Zealand and Indonesia . But there had been no contact from the British government . “ I find it somewhat surprising , I have spoken to a lot of other governments , ” he said .
Countering such criticism , Hancock , the health minister , said the government is on track to deliver about 10,000 more ventilators in the coming weeks . One reason Britain was behind some countries on testing , he said , was the absence of a large diagnostics industry at the outbreak of the epidemic . “ We didn ’ t have the scale . ”
It was during the school half-term holidays in February that frontline doctor Nicky Longley began to realise that early efforts to contain the disease were likely doomed .
For weeks now , doctors and public health workers had been watching out for people with flu-like symptoms coming in from China . Longley , an infectious diseases consultant at London ’ s Hospital for Tropical Diseases , was part of a team that staffed a public health service helpline for those with symptoms . The plan , she said , had been to make all effort to catch every case and their contacts . And “ to start with , it looked like it was working . ”
But then , bad news . First , on Wednesday the 19th of February , came the shock news from Iran of two deaths . Then , on Friday the 21st , came a death in Italy and a bloom of cases in Lombardy and Veneto regions . Britain has close links to both countries . Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy that week .
“ I don ’ t think anybody really foresaw what was happening in Italy , ” Longley said . “ And I think , the minute everybody saw that , we thought : ‘ This is game over now . ’ ”
Until then , Longley said , everyone felt “ there was a chance to stamp it out ” even though most were sceptical it could be done long-term . But after Iran and Italy , it was obvious containment would not work . The contact tracing continued for a while . But as the cases in London built up , and the volume of calls to the helpline mushroomed , the priority began to shift to clinical care of the serious cases . “ At a certain point you have to make a decision about where you put your efforts as a workforce . ”
Edmunds noted that Iran and Italy had hardly reported a case until that point . “ And then , all of sudden you had deaths recorded. ” There was a rule of thumb that , in an outbreak ’ s early stages , for each death there were probably 1,000 cases in a community . “ And so it was quite clear that there were at least thousands of cases in Italy , possibly tens of thousands of cases in Italy right then . ”
Amid the dreadful news from Italy , the scientists at NERVTAG convened by phone that Friday , 21st February . But they decided to recommend keeping the threat level at “ moderate , ” where it had sat since January 30th . The minutes don ’ t give a detailed explanation of the decision . Edmunds , who had technical difficulties and couldn ’ t be heard on the call , emailed afterwards to ask the warning to be elevated to “ high , ” the minutes revealed . But the warning level remained lower . It ’ s unclear why .
“ I just thought , are we still , we still thinking that it ’ s mild or something ? It definitely isn ’ t , you know , ” said Edmunds .
A spokesman for the government ’ s chief scientific adviser , Sir Patrick Vallance , didn ’ t directly respond to ███ questions about the threat level . Asked whether , with hindsight , the scientists ’ approach was the right one , the spokesperson said in a statement that “ SAGE and advisers provide advice , while Ministers and the Government make decisions . ”
On Sunday , March 1st , Ferguson , Edmunds and other advisers spent the day with NHS public health service experts trying to work out how many hospital beds and other key resources would be needed as the outbreak exploded . By now , Italian data was showing that a tenth of all infected patients needed intensive care .
The following day , pandemic modelling committee SPI-M produced its “ consensus report ” that warned the coronavirus was now transmitting freely in the UK . That Thursday , March 5 , the first death in the UK was announced . Italy , which reached 827 deaths by March 11 , ordered a national lockdown . Spain and France prepared to follow suit .
Johnson held out against stringent measures , saying he was following the advice of the government ’ s scientists . He asserted on March 9 : “ We are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak , based on the very latest scientific and medical advice . ”
Indeed , the government ’ s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies , SAGE , had recommended that day , with no dissension recorded in its summary , that the UK reject a China-style lockdown . SAGE decided that “ implementing a subset of measures would be ideal , ” according to a record of its conclusions . Tougher measures could create a “ large second epidemic wave once the measures were lifted , ” SAGE said .
On March 12 came a bombshell for the British public . Chris Whitty , the chief medical officer , announced Britain had moved the threat to UK citizens from “ moderate ” to “ high. ” And he said the country had moved from trying to contain the disease to trying to slow its spread . New cases were not going to be tracked at all . “ It is no longer necessary for us to identify every case , ” he said . Only hospital cases would , in future , be tested for the virus . What had been an undisclosed policy was in the open : beyond a certain point , attempts to completely extinguish the virus would stop .
The same day , putting aside his jokey self , Johnson made a speech in Downing Street , flanked by two Union Jacks and evoking the spirit of Winston Churchill ’ s “ darkest hour ” address . He warned : “ I must level with you , level with the British public - more families , many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time . ”
For most Britons , it came as a shock . Several of the next day ’ s newspapers splashed Johnson ’ s words on their front pages .
Vallance , the government ’ s chief scientific adviser , who chaired SAGE , said in a BBC interview on March 13 that the plan was to simply control the pace of infection . The government had , for now , rejected what he called “ eye-catching measures ” like stopping mass gatherings such as football games or closing schools . The “ aim is to try and reduce the peak , broaden the peak , not to suppress it completely. ” Most people would get the virus mildly , and this would build up “ herd immunity ” which , in time , would stop the disease ’ s progress .
But by now , the country was rebelling . Major institutions decided to close . After players began to get infected , the professional football leagues suspended their games . As Johnson still refused to close schools and ban mass gatherings , the Daily Mirror ’ s banner headline , summing up a widespread feeling , asked on March 13 : “ Is It Enough ? ”
The catalyst for a policy reversal came on March 16 with the publication of a report by Neil Ferguson ’ s Imperial College team . It predicted that , unconstrained , the virus could kill 510,000 people . Even the government ’ s “ mitigation ” approach could lead to 250,000 deaths and intensive care units being overwhelmed at least eight times over .
Imperial ’ s prediction of over half a million deaths was no different from the report by the government ’ s own pandemic modelling committee two weeks earlier . Yet it helped trigger a policy turn-around , both in London and in Washington , culminating seven days later in Johnson announcing a full lockdown of Britain . The report also jarred the U.S. administration into tougher measures to slow the virus ’ spread .
Ferguson was now in isolation himself after catching the virus . Testifying by video link to a committee in Parliament , he explained why he and other scientific advisers had shifted from advocating partial social-distancing measures to warning that without a rigorous shutdown , the NHS would be overwhelmed . The reason , he said , lay in data coming out of Italy that showed large numbers of patients required critical care .
“ The revision was that , basically , estimates of the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation , mechanical ventilation , which is only done in a critical care unit , roughly doubled , ” he said .
What allowed Britain to alter course , said Edmunds , was a lockdown in Italy that “ opened up the policy space ” coupled with new data . First came a paper by Edmunds ’ own London School team that examined intermittent lockdowns , sent to the modelling committee on March 11 and validated by Edinburgh University . Ferguson ’ s revised Imperial research followed .
Edmunds said these new studies together had demonstrated that if the British government imposed a lengthy period of tougher measures , perhaps relaxed periodically , then the size of the epidemic could be substantially reduced .
Still , without a vaccine or effective treatments , it ’ s going to be hard to avoid a substantial part of the British population getting infected , said Edmunds . “ Until you get to a vaccine , there is no way of getting out of this without certainly tens of thousands of deaths , ” he said . “ And probably more than that . ”
Now subject to intense public scrutiny , the modelling teams at universities across Britain continue to work on different scenarios for how the world can escape the virus ’ s clutches . According to Medley , the chairman of the SPI-M pandemic modelling committee , no one now doubts , for all the initial reservations , that a lockdown was essential in Britain .
Medley added : “ At the moment we don ’ t know what ’ s going to happen in six months . All we know is that unless we stop transmission now , the health service will collapse . Yep , that ’ s the only thing we know for sure . ”","LONDON (Reuters) - It was early spring when British scientists laid out the bald truth to their government. It was “highly likely,” they said, that there was now “sustained transmission” of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.

If unconstrained and if the virus behaved as in China, up to four-fifths of Britons could be infected and one in a hundred might die, wrote the scientists, members of an official committee set up to model the spread of pandemic flu, on March 2. Their assessment didn’t spell it out, but that was a prediction of over 500,000 deaths in this nation of nearly 70 million.

Yet the next day, March 3, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was his cheery self. He joked that he was still shaking hands with everyone, including at a hospital treating coronavirus patients.

“Our country remains extremely well prepared,” Johnson said as Italy reached 79 deaths. “We already have a fantastic NHS,” the national public health service, “fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.”

Alongside him at the Downing Street press conference was Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser and himself an epidemiologist. Whitty passed on the modelling committee’s broad conclusions, including the prediction of a possible 80% infection rate and the consequent deaths. But he played them down, saying the number of people who would be infected was probably “a lot lower” and coming up with a total was “largely speculative.”

The upbeat tone of that briefing stood in sharp contrast with the growing unease of many of the government’s scientific advisers behind the scenes. They were already convinced that Britain was on the brink of a disastrous outbreak, a Reuters investigation has found.

Interviews with more than 20 British scientists, key officials and senior sources in Johnson’s Conservative Party, and a study of minutes of advisory committee meetings and public testimony and documents, show how these scientific advisers concluded early the virus could be devastating.

But the interviews and documents also reveal that for more than two months, the scientists whose advice guided Downing Street did not clearly signal their worsening fears to the public or the government. Until March 12, the risk level, set by the government’s top medical advisers on the recommendation of the scientists, remained at “moderate,” suggesting only the possibility of a wider outbreak.

“You know, there’s a small little cadre of people in the middle, who absolutely did realise what was going on, and likely to happen,” said John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling and a key adviser to the government, known for his work on tracking Ebola. Edmunds was among those who did call on the government to elevate the warning level earlier.

From the outset, said Edmunds, work by scientists had shown that, with only limited interventions, the virus would trigger an “overwhelming epidemic” in which Britain’s health service was not going “to get anywhere near being able to cope with it. That was clear from the beginning.”

But he said: “I do think there’s a bit of a worry in terms you don’t want to unnecessarily panic people.”

Johnson, who himself has sickened with the virus, moved more slowly than the leaders of many other prosperous countries to adopt a lockdown. He has been criticised for not moving more swiftly to organise mass tests and mobilise supplies of life-saving equipment and beds. Johnson was hospitalized on April 5 and moved to intensive care the next day.

It is too soon to judge the ultimate soundness of the UK’s early response. If history concludes that it was lacking, then the criticism levelled at the prime minister may be that, rather than ignoring the advice of his scientific advisers, he failed to question their assumptions.

Interviews and records published so far suggest that the scientific committees that advised Johnson didn’t study, until mid-March, the option of the kind of stringent lockdown adopted early on in China, where the disease arose in December, and then followed by much of Europe and finally by Britain itself. The scientists’ reasoning: Britons, many of them assumed, simply wouldn’t accept such restrictions.

The UK scientists were also mostly convinced - and many still are - that, once the new virus escaped China, quarantine measures would likely not succeed. Minutes of technical committees reviewed by Reuters indicate that almost no attention was paid to preparing a programme of mass testing. Other minutes and interviews show Britain was following closely a well-laid plan to fight a flu pandemic - not this deadlier disease. The scientists involved, however, deny that the flu focus ultimately made much difference.

Now, as countries debate how to combat the virus, some experts here say, the lesson from the British experience may be that governments and scientists worldwide must increase the transparency of their planning so that their thinking and assumptions are open to challenge.

John Ashton, a clinician and former regional director of Public Health England, the government agency overseeing healthcare, said the government’s advisers took too narrow a view and hewed to limited assumptions. They were too “narrowly drawn as scientists from a few institutions,” he said. Their handling of COVID-19, Ashton said, shows the need for a broader approach. “In the future we need a much wider group of independent advisers.”

Michael Cates, who succeeded Stephen Hawking as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, is leading an initiative by the Royal Society, the UK’s leading scientific body, to bring modellers in from other scientific disciplines to help understand the epidemic.

“Without faulting anyone so far, it’s vital, where there is such a lot at stake, to throw the maximum possible light on the methods, assumptions and data built into our understanding of how this epidemic will develop,” he told Reuters.

In a statement to Reuters, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was delivering “a science-led action plan” to contain the outbreak. “As the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans and what we learned from previous exercises has helped us to rapidly respond to COVID-19.”

A LOW RISK TO THE PUBLIC

When news came from China in January of a new infectious disease, Johnson had reason to believe his country was well prepared. It had some of the world’s best scientists and a well-drilled plan to deal with potentially lethal pandemics. Perhaps, some scientists say in hindsight, the plan made them slow to adapt.

For many years, the Cabinet Office - a collection of officials who act as the prime minister’s direct arm to run the government - took the threat of pandemics seriously. Presciently, it rated pandemics as the Number 1 threat to the country, ahead of terrorism and financial crashes.

At the centre of planning was a small group of scientists, among them Edmunds. His research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine runs one of the two computer modelling centres for epidemics that have mostly driven government policy. The other is at nearby Imperial College. Edmunds remembers that early in the outbreak, the data from China were sketchy, in the period “where the Chinese were trying to pretend that this wasn’t transmissible between humans.”

Edmunds and his colleague at Imperial, Neil Ferguson, were part of an alphabet soup of committees that fed advice into the Cabinet Office machinery around the prime minister. Both were founders of the flu pandemic modelling committee, known as SPI-M, that produced the March 2 report warning of more than 500,000 deaths. This committee had met together for nearly 15 years.

Ferguson did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article.

Edmunds and Ferguson were also part of NERVTAG, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group. Both too were members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as SAGE, that advises the government in times of crisis. SAGE reports directly to Johnson and the government’s main emergency committee, COBRA.

At first, when NERVTAG met on January 13, it studied information from China that there was “no evidence of significant human to human transmission” of the new virus, according to minutes of the meeting. The scientists agreed the risk to the UK population was “very low.”

The evidence soon changed, but this wasn’t reflected in the official threat level. By the end of January, scientists in China began releasing clinical data. Case studies published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, showed 17% of the first 99 coronavirus cases needed critical care. Eleven patients died. Another Chinese study, in the same magazine, warned starkly of a global spread and urged: “Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.”

Edmunds recalled that “from about mid January onwards, it was absolutely obvious that this was serious, very serious.” Graham Medley, a professor of infectious diseases modelling at the London School and chairman of SPI-M, agreed. He said that the committee was “clear that this was going to be big from the first meeting.” At the end of January, his committee moved into “wartime” mode, he said, reporting directly into SAGE.

Dr Jon Read, a senior lecturer in biostatistics at the University of Lancaster, also a member of SPI-M, said by the end of January it was apparent the virus had “pandemic potential” and that death rates for the elderly were brutal. “From my perspective within the sort of modelling community, everybody’s aware of this, and we’re saying that this is probably going to be pretty bad,” he said.

But the scientists did not articulate their fears forcefully to the government, minutes of committee meetings reveal.

On January 21, scientists on NERVTAG endorsed the elevation of the UK risk warning from COVID-19 from “very low” to “low.” SAGE met formally for the first time the following day about the coronavirus threat. So did COBRA, which was chaired by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who would contract the virus himself in late March. He told reporters after the meeting: “The clinical advice is that the risk to the public remains low.”

In response to questions from Reuters, the government’s Department of Health declined to clarify how the risk levels are defined or what action, if any, they trigger. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “Increasing the risk level in the UK is a belt and braces measure which allows the government to plan for all future eventualities.”

Two days later, China put the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, into a complete lockdown. Hubei, the surrounding province, would follow. But already, 17 passenger flights had flown directly from Wuhan to Britain since the start of 2020, and 614 flights from the whole of China, according to FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking service. That meant thousands of Chinese, some of them potential carriers, had come to Britain. On April 5, scientific adviser Ferguson said he estimated only one-third of infected people reaching Britain had been detected.

As they watched China impose its lockdown, the British scientists assumed that such drastic actions would never be acceptable in a democracy like the UK. Among those modelling the outbreak, such stringent counter-measures were not, at first, examined.

“We had milder interventions in place,” said Edmunds, because no one thought it would be acceptable politically “to shut the country down.” He added: “We didn’t model it because it didn’t seem to be on the agenda. And Imperial (College) didn’t look at it either.” The NERVTAG committee agreed, noting in its minutes that tough measures in the short term would be pointless, as they “would only delay the UK outbreak, not prevent it.”

That limited approach mirrored the UK’s longstanding pandemic flu strategy. The Department of Health declined a request from Reuters for a copy of its updated pandemic plan, without providing a reason. But a copy of the 2011 “UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011,” which a spokesman said was still relevant, stated the “working presumption will be that Government will not impose any such restrictions. The emphasis will instead be on encouraging all those who have symptoms to follow the advice to stay at home and avoid spreading their illness.”

According to one senior Conservative Party politician, who was officially briefed as the crisis unfolded, the close involvement in the response to the coronavirus of the same scientific advisers and civil servants who drew up the flu plan may have created a “cognitive bias.”

“We had in our minds that COVID-19 was a nasty flu and needed to be treated as such,” he said. “The implication was it was a disease that could not be stopped and that it was ultimately not that deadly.”

While the UK was prepared to fight the flu, Asian states like China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea had built their pandemic plans with lessons learned from fighting the more lethal SARS outbreak that began in 2002, he said. SARS had a fatality rate of up to 14%. As a result, these countries, he said, were more ready to resort to widespread testing, lockdowns and other draconian measures to keep their citizens from spreading the virus.

Scientists involved in the UK response disagree that following the government’s flu plan clouded their thinking or influenced the outbreak’s course. The plan had a “reasonable worst case” scenario as devastating as the worst predictions for COVID-19, they note.

Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, and a member of the SPI-M committee, said COVID-19 did behave differently than an expected pandemic flu - for example school closures proved to be far less effective in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. But, broadly, “the government has been consistently responsive to changing facts.”

By the end of January, the government’s chief medical adviser, Whitty, was explaining to politicians in private, according to at least two people who spoke to him, that if the virus escaped China, it would in time infect the great majority of people in Britain. It could only be slowed down, not stopped. On Jan 30, the government raised the threat level to “moderate” from “low.”

The country’s medical officers “consider it prudent for our governments to escalate planning and preparation in case of a more widespread outbreak,” a statement said at the time. Whitty did not respond to questions from Reuters for this article.

A TIME TO PREPARE

On the evening of January 31, Boris Johnson sat before a fireplace in 10 Downing Street and told the nation, in a televised address: “This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.”

He was talking of finally delivering Brexit, or what he called “this recaptured sovereignty.” Until that moment, Johnson’s premiership had been utterly absorbed by delivering on that challenge.

With Brexit done, Johnson had the chance to focus on other matters the following month, among them the emerging virus threat. But leaving the European Union had a consequence.

Between February 13 and March 30, Britain missed a total of eight conference calls or meetings about the coronavirus between EU heads of state or health ministers - meetings that Britain was still entitled to join. Although Britain did later make an arrangement to attend lower-level meetings of officials, it had missed a deadline to participate in a common purchase scheme for ventilators, to which it was invited. Ventilators, vitally important to treating the direst cases of COVID-19, have fallen into short supply globally. Johnson’s spokesman blamed an administrative error.

A Downing Street aide told Reuters that from around the end of January, Johnson concentrated his attention increasingly on the coronavirus threat, receiving “very frequent” updates at least once per day from mid February, either in person or via a daily dashboard of cases.

In the medical and scientific world, there was growing concern about the threat of the virus to the UK. A report from Exeter University, published on February 12, warned a UK outbreak could peak within four months and, without mitigation, infect 45 million people.

That worried Rahuldeb Sarkar, a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in the county of Kent, who foresaw that intensive care beds could be swamped. Even if disease transmission was reduced by half, he wrote in a report aimed at clinicians and actuaries in mid-February, a coronavirus outbreak in the UK would “have a chance of overwhelming the system.”

With Whitty stating in a BBC interview on February 13 that a UK outbreak was still an “if, not a when,” Richard Horton, a medical doctor and editor of the Lancet, said the government and public health service wasted an opportunity that month to prepare quarantine restriction measures and a programme of mass tests, and procure resources like ventilators and personal protective equipment for expanded intensive care.

Calling the lost chance a “national scandal” in a later editorial, he would testify to parliament about a mismatch between “the urgent warning that was coming from the frontline in China” and the “somewhat pedestrian evaluation” of the threat from the scientific advice to the government.

After developing a test for the new virus by January 10, health officials adopted a centralised approach to its deployment, initially assigning a single public laboratory in north London to perform the tests. But, according to later government statements, there was no wider plan envisaged to make use of hundreds of laboratories across the country, both public and private, that could have been recruited.

According to emails and more than a dozen scientists interviewed by Reuters, the government issued no requests to labs for assistance with staff or testing equipment until the middle of March, when many abruptly received requests to hand over nucleic acid extraction instruments, used in testing. An executive at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford said he could have carried out up to 1,000 tests per day from February. But the call never came.

“You would have thought that they would be bashing down the door,” said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. By April 5, Britain had carried out 195,524 tests, in contrast to at least 918,000 completed a week earlier in Germany.

Nor was there an effective effort to expand the supply of ventilators. The Department of Health told Reuters in a statement that the government started talking to manufacturers of ventilators about procuring extra supplies in February. But it was not until March 16, after it was clear supplies could run out, that Johnson launched an appeal to industry to help ramp up production.

Charles Bellm, managing director of Intersurgical, a global supplier of medical ventilation products based outside London, said he has been contacted by more than a dozen governments around the world, including France, New Zealand and Indonesia. But there had been no contact from the British government. “I find it somewhat surprising, I have spoken to a lot of other governments,” he said.

Countering such criticism, Hancock, the health minister, said the government is on track to deliver about 10,000 more ventilators in the coming weeks. One reason Britain was behind some countries on testing, he said, was the absence of a large diagnostics industry at the outbreak of the epidemic. “We didn’t have the scale.”

GAME OVER

It was during the school half-term holidays in February that frontline doctor Nicky Longley began to realise that early efforts to contain the disease were likely doomed.

For weeks now, doctors and public health workers had been watching out for people with flu-like symptoms coming in from China. Longley, an infectious diseases consultant at London’s Hospital for Tropical Diseases, was part of a team that staffed a public health service helpline for those with symptoms. The plan, she said, had been to make all effort to catch every case and their contacts. And “to start with, it looked like it was working.”

But then, bad news. First, on Wednesday the 19th of February, came the shock news from Iran of two deaths. Then, on Friday the 21st, came a death in Italy and a bloom of cases in Lombardy and Veneto regions. Britain has close links to both countries. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy that week.

“I don’t think anybody really foresaw what was happening in Italy,” Longley said. “And I think, the minute everybody saw that, we thought: ‘This is game over now.’”

Until then, Longley said, everyone felt “there was a chance to stamp it out” even though most were sceptical it could be done long-term. But after Iran and Italy, it was obvious containment would not work. The contact tracing continued for a while. But as the cases in London built up, and the volume of calls to the helpline mushroomed, the priority began to shift to clinical care of the serious cases. “At a certain point you have to make a decision about where you put your efforts as a workforce.”

Edmunds noted that Iran and Italy had hardly reported a case until that point. “And then, all of sudden you had deaths recorded.” There was a rule of thumb that, in an outbreak’s early stages, for each death there were probably 1,000 cases in a community. “And so it was quite clear that there were at least thousands of cases in Italy, possibly tens of thousands of cases in Italy right then.”

Amid the dreadful news from Italy, the scientists at NERVTAG convened by phone that Friday, 21st February. But they decided to recommend keeping the threat level at “moderate,” where it had sat since January 30th. The minutes don’t give a detailed explanation of the decision. Edmunds, who had technical difficulties and couldn’t be heard on the call, emailed afterwards to ask the warning to be elevated to “high,” the minutes revealed. But the warning level remained lower. It’s unclear why.

“I just thought, are we still, we still thinking that it’s mild or something? It definitely isn’t, you know,” said Edmunds.

A spokesman for the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, didn’t directly respond to Reuters questions about the threat level. Asked whether, with hindsight, the scientists’ approach was the right one, the spokesperson said in a statement that “SAGE and advisers provide advice, while Ministers and the Government make decisions.”

HERD IMMUNITY

On Sunday, March 1st, Ferguson, Edmunds and other advisers spent the day with NHS public health service experts trying to work out how many hospital beds and other key resources would be needed as the outbreak exploded. By now, Italian data was showing that a tenth of all infected patients needed intensive care.

The following day, pandemic modelling committee SPI-M produced its “consensus report” that warned the coronavirus was now transmitting freely in the UK. That Thursday, March 5, the first death in the UK was announced. Italy, which reached 827 deaths by March 11, ordered a national lockdown. Spain and France prepared to follow suit.

Johnson held out against stringent measures, saying he was following the advice of the government’s scientists. He asserted on March 9: “We are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.”

Indeed, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, had recommended that day, with no dissension recorded in its summary, that the UK reject a China-style lockdown. SAGE decided that “implementing a subset of measures would be ideal,” according to a record of its conclusions. Tougher measures could create a “large second epidemic wave once the measures were lifted,” SAGE said.

On March 12 came a bombshell for the British public. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, announced Britain had moved the threat to UK citizens from “moderate” to “high.” And he said the country had moved from trying to contain the disease to trying to slow its spread. New cases were not going to be tracked at all. “It is no longer necessary for us to identify every case,” he said. Only hospital cases would, in future, be tested for the virus. What had been an undisclosed policy was in the open: beyond a certain point, attempts to completely extinguish the virus would stop.

The same day, putting aside his jokey self, Johnson made a speech in Downing Street, flanked by two Union Jacks and evoking the spirit of Winston Churchill’s “darkest hour” address. He warned: “I must level with you, level with the British public - more families, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.”

For most Britons, it came as a shock. Several of the next day’s newspapers splashed Johnson’s words on their front pages.

Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, who chaired SAGE, said in a BBC interview on March 13 that the plan was to simply control the pace of infection. The government had, for now, rejected what he called “eye-catching measures” like stopping mass gatherings such as football games or closing schools. The “aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not to suppress it completely.” Most people would get the virus mildly, and this would build up “herd immunity” which, in time, would stop the disease’s progress.

But by now, the country was rebelling. Major institutions decided to close. After players began to get infected, the professional football leagues suspended their games. As Johnson still refused to close schools and ban mass gatherings, the Daily Mirror’s banner headline, summing up a widespread feeling, asked on March 13: “Is It Enough?”

The catalyst for a policy reversal came on March 16 with the publication of a report by Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College team. It predicted that, unconstrained, the virus could kill 510,000 people. Even the government’s “mitigation” approach could lead to 250,000 deaths and intensive care units being overwhelmed at least eight times over.

Imperial’s prediction of over half a million deaths was no different from the report by the government’s own pandemic modelling committee two weeks earlier. Yet it helped trigger a policy turn-around, both in London and in Washington, culminating seven days later in Johnson announcing a full lockdown of Britain. The report also jarred the U.S. administration into tougher measures to slow the virus’ spread.

Ferguson was now in isolation himself after catching the virus. Testifying by video link to a committee in Parliament, he explained why he and other scientific advisers had shifted from advocating partial social-distancing measures to warning that without a rigorous shutdown, the NHS would be overwhelmed. The reason, he said, lay in data coming out of Italy that showed large numbers of patients required critical care.

“The revision was that, basically, estimates of the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, which is only done in a critical care unit, roughly doubled,” he said.

Edmunds had a different explanation for the policy shift.

What allowed Britain to alter course, said Edmunds, was a lockdown in Italy that “opened up the policy space” coupled with new data. First came a paper by Edmunds’ own London School team that examined intermittent lockdowns, sent to the modelling committee on March 11 and validated by Edinburgh University. Ferguson’s revised Imperial research followed.

Woolhouse, the Edinburgh professor, confirmed the sequence.

Edmunds said these new studies together had demonstrated that if the British government imposed a lengthy period of tougher measures, perhaps relaxed periodically, then the size of the epidemic could be substantially reduced.

Still, without a vaccine or effective treatments, it’s going to be hard to avoid a substantial part of the British population getting infected, said Edmunds. “Until you get to a vaccine, there is no way of getting out of this without certainly tens of thousands of deaths,” he said. “And probably more than that.”

Now subject to intense public scrutiny, the modelling teams at universities across Britain continue to work on different scenarios for how the world can escape the virus’s clutches. According to Medley, the chairman of the SPI-M pandemic modelling committee, no one now doubts, for all the initial reservations, that a lockdown was essential in Britain.

Medley added: “At the moment we don’t know what’s going to happen in six months. All we know is that unless we stop transmission now, the health service will collapse. Yep, that’s the only thing we know for sure.”",www.reuters.com,center,AJhBLCxXAEMFgjdz

Andrew announced in a statement on Wednesday that he is retreating from his royal public duties “ for the foreseeable future ” amid a controversy surrounding his relationship with the disgraced American financier , who died in an apparent suicide in a New York City federal jail in August . The Prince said in the statement that he is “ willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations , if required . ”
Attorney Gloria Allred , who is representing several of Epstein ’ s alleged victims , told the BBC that she was “ glad ” that the prince appeared to signal he was open to cooperating with authorities but expressed confusion about what he would do now . “ Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify , or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so ? ” she asked on the BBC . In a statement to TIME , Allred added , “ My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being ‘ required ’ to do so . ”
Andrew also expressed regret over his association with Epstein and sympathy for Epstein ’ s alleged victims in the statement . He added that the “ circumstances relating to ( his ) former association ” with Epstein had “ become a major disruption ” to the royal family ’ s work and the charities he supports .
In an exclusive televised interview with the BBC at Buckingham Palace broadcast in the U.K. Saturday , Queen Elizabeth ’ s son was questioned about his relationship with Epstein and allegations made by a woman who said he had sex with her when she was 17 . Epstein died in an apparent suicide in a New York City federal jail in August .
During last week ’ s BBC Interview Andrew had said that he didn ’ t regret his entire relationship with Epstein , instead noting that the people he met and opportunities he got because of Epstein were “ actually very useful . ”
Although it is not the first time that Andrew , who currently stands eighth in line to the British throne , has faced controversy , it is undoubtedly the most serious . Here ’ s what to know about the Duke of York , his past controversies and his links with Epstein .
Now 59 years old , Prince Andrew is the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip . In 1986 , he married Sarah Ferguson , who came from a well-connected family and was initially well liked by the press and public for her fun and outgoing character . The pair had two daughters , Princess Beatrice in 1988 and Princess Eugenie in 1990 , before their divorce in 1996 .

Public opinion began to turn against Ferguson after a series of incidents , including an undercover sting in which she was caught on camera offering access to Prince Andrew in return for £500,000 in 2010 . In 2011 , it was revealed that Ferguson had accepted $ 15,000 from Epstein in order to pay off her debts . The duchess has tweeted in support of her ex-husband , saying “ Andrew is a true and real gentleman and is stoically steadfast to not only his duty but also his kindness and goodness . ”
As is traditional for many male members of the Royal Family , Andrew has had a successful military career , joining the Royal Navy in 1979 . He was also a pilot in the Falklands War , where he took part in missions in the conflict from April until September 1982 ; an experience he raised in his interview with the BBC . Since 2015 , he has held the rank of Vice Admiral .
Andrew is also a chancellor at the University of Huddersfield . On Monday , a panel from the university ’ s student union voted unanimously to lobby the Duke to resign his post at the university . Andrew is also actively involved with or the patron of several charities and trusts . Several partners of his charitable activities are now reconsidering their ties . Buckingham Palace confirmed that accounting firm KPMG is not renewing its sponsorship of the Duke ’ s entrepreneurial scheme Pitch @ Palace , according to the Guardian . Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca also told British media outlets that it was reviewing its involvement in the scheme .
Prince Andrew is no stranger to controversy . His judgment has come under scrutiny several times , including his past meetings with Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi ’ s son Saif ; his connection to Timur Kulibayev , the son-in-law of the then-president of Kazakhstan who purchased one of Andrew ’ s properties for £3 million more than its asking price ; and his hosting of the son-in-law of Tunisia ’ s ousted president , Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali at Buckingham Palace .
In 2011 , Andrew stood down as Britain ’ s “ special representative ” for trade and investment , amid increasing criticism of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein . He had held the post since 2001 , with the purpose to promote U.K. trade interests abroad . The numerous foreign trips that Andrew took as part of this role , including trips to the U.S. where he had interacted with Epstein , were heavily criticized for their cost , earning him the moniker “ Air Miles Andy. ” During his interview with the BBC , Andrew attempted to dispel his reputation as a “ Party Prince. ” “ I was single for quite a long time in the early 1980s , and after I got married I was happy . I ’ ve never felt the need to go and party , ” he said . “ Certainly going to Jeffrey ’ s was not about parties . Absolutely not . ”
On Monday , further controversy surrounding the prince broke when a former political aide to ex-prime minister David Cameron alleged that Andrew had used the n— word in a 2012 conversation at Buckingham Palace . The London Evening Standard reported that unnamed palace sources denied that the incident took place . Separately , former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said in a radio interview over the weekend that the Duke had made “ unbelievable ” offensive and racist comments about Arab people after attending a state banquet with members of the Saudi royal family in October 2007 . The Evening Standard reported that a palace spokesman responded to the claims regarding Smith ’ s allegations by saying that the Duke “ does not tolerate racism in any form . ”
Virginia Giuffre ( sometimes referred to as Virginia Roberts ) has alleged that Epstein “ made her ” have sex with Andrew “ several times. ” Giuffre said she had sex with the prince , whom she said she called “ Andy , ” on three occasions that she detailed in an affidavit from a federal court filing in the Southern District of Florida—including at the London home of Epstein ’ s former girlfriend and longtime friend Ghislaine Maxwell and at Epstein ’ s New York City mansion when she was 17 in 2001 .
A widely-circulated picture shows a smiling Andrew with his left arm around Giuffre ’ s waist . Giuffre alleged in court filings that it was taken at Maxwell ’ s London home shortly before the first time he had sex with her , according to her affidavit .
Maxwell , who was a British socialite for many years , has denied the allegations of wrongdoing .
Andrew has repeatedly denied Giuffre ’ s allegations , saying that they never engaged in any sexual activity and that he does not recall meeting her .
Andrew is just one of many wealthy and powerful men that Giuffre has said she had sex with at the behest of Epstein or Maxwell . All of her allegations have been denied .
Epstein ’ s death effectively ended his criminal prosecution but his alleged victims have called for prosecutors to continue investigating potential co-conspirators . Epstein had previously settled several civil lawsuits over alleged abuse .
In response to Giuffre ’ s allegations , Andrew told the BBC interviewer , “ I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady. ” He said that on March 10 , the day Giuffre said Andrew had sex with her , he had taken one of his children to a party at a popular pizza restaurant and stayed indoors with his children while he was on leave from the Royal Navy .
Part of Giuffre ’ s description of the night in question also described Prince Andrew as “ profusely sweating ” while they danced in a nightclub . Andrew responded by saying that it was “ almost impossible for me to sweat ” at the time due to suffering what he described as “ an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at . ”
Regarding a photograph of Giuffre and Andrew together that was provided by Giuffre to the press earlier this year , the Duke was unable to explain it and said that he had no memory of the photograph being taken . Andrew said that while it could not be determined whether the photograph was faked , he said that he did not believe the photograph was taken in London due to his choice of attire and said that “ public displays of affection are not something that I do . ”
Responding to Giuffre ’ s other allegations , Andrew denied having sex with her in New York at Epstein ’ s mansion and on Epstein ’ s private island . Andrew also denied being present in these locations at the times that Giuffre has alleged . “ I ’ ve been through it and through it and through it over and over again , and nothing . It never happened , ” said Andrew .
Andrew also said that until 2006 when an arrest warrant was issued against Epstein , he had no idea about allegations that Epstein was involved in alleged sex trafficking .
“ At the time , there was no indication to me , or anybody else , that that was what he was doing . Certainly when I saw him in the U.S. or when I was staying in his houses in the U.S. , there was absolutely no indication , ” Andrew responded . When asked if he would be willing to testify under legal oath , Andrew said he would be duty bound to do so “ in the right circumstances . There ’ s just as much closure for me as there is for everybody else . ”
According to Andrew , he met Epstein in 1999 through Maxwell , whom he had known since she was a college student in the U.K. Andrew says that he saw Epstein about twice a year , and if Andrew was in the U.S. on a visit or trip as part of his role representing international trade , Epstein would offer up the use of his houses for him to stay in . Andrew also confirmed that he had traveled on Epstein ’ s private plane , visited Epstein ’ s private island and home in Palm Beach , Fla. , and visited Maxwell ’ s house in London ’ s Belgravia neighborhood .
Andrew invited Maxwell and Epstein to a party hosted by Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle in June 2000 , at a celebration commemorating four royal birthdays . The pair was also invited that same year to a shooting weekend at Sandringham House , one of the Queen ’ s country homes , reportedly to celebrate Maxwell ’ s birthday .
In May 2006 , an arrest warrant was issued for Epstein for sexual assault of a minor ; two months later in July , Epstein attended Andrew ’ s daughter Princess Beatrice ’ s 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle . During the BBC interview , Andrew said that he had invited Maxwell to this event , and that Epstein had come as her plus-one . Andrew also said that he was not aware of Epstein ’ s arrest warrant in the U.S. at the time the invitation for the party had been sent out .
What has Prince Andrew said about his friendship with Epstein ?
“ We were friends because of other people , ” said Prince Andrew in the BBC interview , referring to Maxwell several times as the main reason for the connection between the two men . “ It would be a considerable stretch to say that we were very , very close friends . But he had this extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together , and that ’ s the bit that I remember . Going to the dinner parties where you would meet academics , politicians , people from the United Nations . It was a cosmopolitan group of what I would describe as U.S. eminence . ”
Giuffre has accused Maxwell of acting as Epstein ’ s “ madame ” and “ co-conspirator ” in court documents released earlier this year from a 2015 defamation lawsuit she brought against Maxwell . In those documents , Giuffre alleged that Maxwell was “ one of the main women ” whom Epstein used “ to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities . ”
Maxwell has denied Giuffre ’ s allegations in both public statements and legal filings .
Andrew said that he ceased contact with Epstein after he became aware Epstein was under investigation in 2006 , and says he was not in touch with the banker until 2010 . In December 2010 , a few months after Epstein ’ s release from prison after 13 months , Andrew stayed with him at his house in New York . “ I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted , it was inappropriate for us to be seen together , ” said Andrew . He said that during this visit , he only saw Epstein for a dinner party , a walk in the park during which the two were photographed together and crossing paths in a corridor in the house .
Andrew said that it was during the walk in Central Park that the pair decided they would part company , and that from that day forward , they would not have any contact . Soon after those images surfaced , Giuffre gave an interview in which she alleged Andrew had sex with her .
When asked if he regretted that trip to New York , Andrew said that he did . When asked if he regretted the whole friendship with Epstein , Andrew replied : “ Still not , because the people that I met and the opportunities I was given to learn , either by him or because of him , were actually very useful. ” Andrew said his initial reaction on hearing of Epstein ’ s death earlier this year was one of shock .
Giuffre said in her affidavit that Buckingham Palace ’ s denial that Andrew had any sexual contact with her is “ false and hurtful . ”
“ Given what he knows and has seen , I was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about everything , ” she said , according to court documents .
Giuffre reiterated her position earlier this year when she said publicly about Andrew that “ he knows exactly what he ’ s done and I hope he comes clean about it . ”
Lawyers who have represented Giuffre did not respond to a request for comment on Monday .
The Duke ’ s interview has received fierce backlash from observers and commentators both in the U.K. and in the U.S. , with one commentator calling it “ not so much a car crash but an articulated lorry [ semi-truck ] crash . ”
In the interview , Andrew said he will continue to work with his chosen charities . However , there have been calls for charities associated with the Duke to cut their ties with him .
Lawyers based in the U.S. representing Epstein ’ s victims have also strongly criticized the interview , with one calling for him to speak to the FBI about his involvement with Epstein .","Prince Andrew, said in his statement stepping back from public life that he is willing to help law enforcement in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein “if required”—but lawyers for the convicted sex offender’s accusers remain unconvinced that the Duke of York is serious about being questioned by investigators.

Andrew announced in a statement on Wednesday that he is retreating from his royal public duties “for the foreseeable future” amid a controversy surrounding his relationship with the disgraced American financier, who died in an apparent suicide in a New York City federal jail in August. The Prince said in the statement that he is “willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”

Attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing several of Epstein’s alleged victims, told the BBC that she was “glad” that the prince appeared to signal he was open to cooperating with authorities but expressed confusion about what he would do now. “Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so?” she asked on the BBC. In a statement to TIME, Allred added, “My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being ‘required’ to do so.”

Andrew also expressed regret over his association with Epstein and sympathy for Epstein’s alleged victims in the statement. He added that the “circumstances relating to (his) former association” with Epstein had “become a major disruption” to the royal family’s work and the charities he supports.

In an exclusive televised interview with the BBC at Buckingham Palace broadcast in the U.K. Saturday, Queen Elizabeth’s son was questioned about his relationship with Epstein and allegations made by a woman who said he had sex with her when she was 17. Epstein died in an apparent suicide in a New York City federal jail in August.

During last week’s BBC Interview Andrew had said that he didn’t regret his entire relationship with Epstein, instead noting that the people he met and opportunities he got because of Epstein were “actually very useful.”

Although it is not the first time that Andrew, who currently stands eighth in line to the British throne, has faced controversy, it is undoubtedly the most serious. Here’s what to know about the Duke of York, his past controversies and his links with Epstein.

Who is Prince Andrew’s family?

Now 59 years old, Prince Andrew is the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. In 1986, he married Sarah Ferguson, who came from a well-connected family and was initially well liked by the press and public for her fun and outgoing character. The pair had two daughters, Princess Beatrice in 1988 and Princess Eugenie in 1990, before their divorce in 1996.

Public opinion began to turn against Ferguson after a series of incidents, including an undercover sting in which she was caught on camera offering access to Prince Andrew in return for £500,000 in 2010. In 2011, it was revealed that Ferguson had accepted $15,000 from Epstein in order to pay off her debts. The duchess has tweeted in support of her ex-husband, saying “Andrew is a true and real gentleman and is stoically steadfast to not only his duty but also his kindness and goodness.”

As is traditional for many male members of the Royal Family, Andrew has had a successful military career, joining the Royal Navy in 1979. He was also a pilot in the Falklands War, where he took part in missions in the conflict from April until September 1982; an experience he raised in his interview with the BBC. Since 2015, he has held the rank of Vice Admiral.

Andrew is also a chancellor at the University of Huddersfield. On Monday, a panel from the university’s student union voted unanimously to lobby the Duke to resign his post at the university. Andrew is also actively involved with or the patron of several charities and trusts. Several partners of his charitable activities are now reconsidering their ties. Buckingham Palace confirmed that accounting firm KPMG is not renewing its sponsorship of the Duke’s entrepreneurial scheme Pitch@Palace, according to the Guardian. Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca also told British media outlets that it was reviewing its involvement in the scheme.

Has Prince Andrew been involved in any previous controversies?

Prince Andrew is no stranger to controversy. His judgment has come under scrutiny several times, including his past meetings with Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif; his connection to Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the then-president of Kazakhstan who purchased one of Andrew’s properties for £3 million more than its asking price; and his hosting of the son-in-law of Tunisia’s ousted president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali at Buckingham Palace.

In 2011, Andrew stood down as Britain’s “special representative” for trade and investment, amid increasing criticism of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. He had held the post since 2001, with the purpose to promote U.K. trade interests abroad. The numerous foreign trips that Andrew took as part of this role, including trips to the U.S. where he had interacted with Epstein, were heavily criticized for their cost, earning him the moniker “Air Miles Andy.” During his interview with the BBC, Andrew attempted to dispel his reputation as a “Party Prince.” “I was single for quite a long time in the early 1980s, and after I got married I was happy. I’ve never felt the need to go and party,” he said. “Certainly going to Jeffrey’s was not about parties. Absolutely not.”

The Evening Standard reported that a palace spokesman responded to the claims regarding Smith’s allegations by saying that the Duke “does not tolerate racism in any form.”

What are the allegations against Prince Andrew?

Virginia Giuffre (sometimes referred to as Virginia Roberts) has alleged that Epstein “made her” have sex with Andrew “several times.” Giuffre said she had sex with the prince, whom she said she called “Andy,” on three occasions that she detailed in an affidavit from a federal court filing in the Southern District of Florida—including at the London home of Epstein’s former girlfriend and longtime friend Ghislaine Maxwell and at Epstein’s New York City mansion when she was 17 in 2001.

Maxwell, who was a British socialite for many years, has denied the allegations of wrongdoing.

Andrew has repeatedly denied Giuffre’s allegations, saying that they never engaged in any sexual activity and that he does not recall meeting her.

Andrew is just one of many wealthy and powerful men that Giuffre has said she had sex with at the behest of Epstein or Maxwell. All of her allegations have been denied.

great_britain,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2019/9/6/20851302/brexit-boris-johnson-parliament-elections-corbyn-explained,"The week in Brexit drama, explained",2019-09-06,"Jen Kirby, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan","The Brexit debate set off another wild week in British politics that started with Parliament rebelling against Prime Minister Boris Johnson , continued with Johnson trying ( and failing ) to call new elections , and ended with Johnson declaring he ’ d “ rather be dead in a ditch ” than delay Brexit .
So , you know , just another week in UK politics these days .
And that ’ s what all this drama has really been about : politics . This week ’ s hijinks had less to do with the actual substantive debate about Brexit and more to do with the political power games surrounding it .
That ’ s because the UK is more or less in the same situation it has been in for the past year : The only Brexit deal on offer is the deeply unpopular one negotiated by former Prime Minister Theresa May . Parliament has repeatedly rejected it , along with all other Brexit options . The only thing Parliament does agree on is that it wants to avoid leaving the EU without a deal .
That leaves exiting the EU without a plan on the October 31 deadline as the default option . But because Parliament doesn ’ t want a no-deal departure — or the potential economic consequences that go with it — and because Parliament can ’ t figure out what it does want in a Brexit plan , it is trying to stall for more time .
And that ’ s the only thing that ’ s really changed : there ’ s now a prime minister ( Johnson ) at 10 Downing Street who staked his political fortune on the promise of delivering Brexit , “ do or die , ” by October 31 .
That set the stage for the contentious battle between him and Parliament that played out this week .
For those of you who have better things to do than to follow the day-to-day shenanigans of British politics , here ’ s a rundown of what happened this week and how it may ( or may not ) affect the future of Brexit .
Before we get to Parliament , we have to talk about Boris Johnson . Johnson , who took over as prime minister in July , has promised he will pull the UK out of the European Union by October 31 , with or without a deal in place outlining the terms of the divorce .
The deal that currently exists is the one that former Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the EU . Johnson and his band of Brexiteers oppose this deal because they see it as trapping the UK in the EU , without any say over the rules — Brexit without the exit , so to speak .
They mainly object to a provision referred to as the “ Irish backstop , ” which is a plan to guarantee that no matter the future EU-UK relationship , there will be no border checks or physical infrastructure on the politically sensitive border between Northern Ireland ( part of the UK ) and Ireland ( a country that will remain part of the EU ) . The need for this has to do with the conflict in Northern Ireland , known as the Troubles , which formally ended with a 1998 peace agreement . An open border was a critical part of that truce .
The EU has said getting rid of the backstop is nonnegotiable unless the UK can come up with a legitimate and viable alternative . The UK has not come up with a legitimate and viable alternative , so the EU is not renegotiating anything . Which means the same old deal is the only deal that exists right now .
However , Johnson is arguing — to both Parliament and the British public — that he can get a better deal , if only Parliament will get out of his way . He claims that as long as the EU knows the UK is desperate to avoid a no-deal Brexit , the bloc has no incentive to budge .
But , Johnson argues , once the EU realizes the UK is deadly serious about leaving without a potential deal , the EU will finally crack and give the UK the concessions it desires .
There are a few problems with Johnson ’ s argument . First , while he ’ s correct in assessing that the EU definitely doesn ’ t want a no-deal Brexit because it will be bad for it economically , the reality is that it will still be way worse for the UK than the EU .
And while Brexiteers have embraced the idea that a no-deal exit is the “ ripping the Band-Aid right off ” approach , it isn ’ t — not really . A better analogy is that the process of Brexiting is like trying to take an egg out of an omelet : a clean separation is basically impossible . That ’ s why we ’ re hearing all those predictions of food shortages and recessions if there ’ s no deal in place : it ’ s not easy to just ghost a decades-long trading and economic partner .
The UK will almost certainly still need to reach an actual deal with the EU after the no-deal , and you might be able to guess who might have all the leverage at that point ( hint : it ’ s not the UK ) .
The rebellion : Parliament tries to block a no-deal Brexit . Boris fights back — and loses .
Members of Parliament ( MPs ) , through numerous votes , have made it clear that they don ’ t want to put the country through the stress of a no-deal Brexit . They want to leave with a deal — just not the deal that ’ s actually available .
Johnson was well-aware of Parliament ’ s anti-no-deal proclivities . So he wanted to make it as hard as possible for MPs to foil his plan to leave on October 31 at all costs .
But the way he did it was controversial . He announced that he was going to temporarily suspend — or “ prorogue ” — Parliament for five weeks , starting as soon as September 9 and lasting until October 14 . Remember , the Brexit deadline is October 31 , so Parliament would have about one week in September , and then a little more than two weeks in October .
Proroguing is not usually controversial . It ’ s used to mark the end of one parliamentary session and the start of the other , and it ’ s often a thing that happens when a new government takes over , giving it time to set a new agenda .
But Johnson suspended Parliament for five weeks , an unprecedented duration that very much looked like an attempt to limit the time Parliament had to plot against him and block a no-deal Brexit .
In response , the opposition Labour Party and other smaller opposition parties returned from their summer breaks ready to rally together to get something done as quickly as possible . And — most critically — they peeled off a handful of Conservative Party members who broke with Johnson to “ take control of the order paper . ”
What that means is that backbench MPs — those who aren ’ t part of Johnson ’ s government — get to set the agenda . Usually , it ’ s the government ( Johnson ) who get to control what gets done in Parliament . Obviously , his government isn ’ t going to put forward a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit , so these MPs had to seize power so they could do it instead .
Parliament did this successfully on Tuesday , which gave members the chance to introduce that no-deal Brexit bill and vote on it Wednesday . In response , Johnson ’ s whip expelled the 21 Conservative rebels — basically kicked them out of the party — for their disloyalty , which also happened to completely tank Johnson ’ s majority in Parliament .
But it did little to stop Parliament ’ s plan , and MPs successfully advanced the bill to stop a no-deal Brexit , dealing Johnson his second defeat as prime minister in two days . It ’ s been a pretty awful first week of work for the new prime minister .
Oh , and it somehow got worse for Johnson after that .
Okay ! So Parliament just stopped a no-deal Brexit . That ’ s great news , right ?
The actual bill — known as the Benn bill , for the Labour MP Hilary Benn who introduced it — requires the prime minister to seek an extension from the European Union if he doesn ’ t have a new deal by October 19 , or unless Parliament explicitly votes for a no-deal . The suggested extension is three months , putting the new deadline at about January 31 , 2020 .
All 27 EU leaders would have to unanimously agree to such an extension ( they might , they might not , they may set a different date , who knows ) and Parliament will also have to approve the extension that Johnson , or some other prime minister , brings back . It can ’ t stop a no-deal Brexit , but it binds the prime minister , by law , to at least go back to the EU and try to get an extension .
It ’ s not yet a law , though it ’ s expected to become one before Parliament is officially prorogued .
The problem is that Johnson says he ’ s not going to do it . He ’ s not going to ask for an extension , even if the law says he has to .
He called the delay “ pointless ” and blamed Parliament for undercutting his negotiating position . It ’ s not clear what would happen if he actually refused to follow through , but the simple answer is it would probably spark a constitutional crisis . But the UK is not quite at that point yet .
That ’ s because Johnson is trying to get around it in another way : elections . He ’ s saying , “ let ’ s take it back to the people. ” He asked Parliament for permission to call new elections , essentially giving the power back to voters to decide if they want his version of Brexit — get out , and get on with it — or Parliament ’ s continued dilly-dallying , which Johnson and his supporters claim are really just attempts to stop Brexit altogether .
Johnson asked for elections to be held on October 15 , about two weeks ahead of the Brexit deadline . But he can ’ t just get them — he needs two-thirds of Parliament ( around 434 MPs ) to go along with his plan , thanks to the Fixed-Term Parliament Act 2011 .
And here ’ s where Parliament foiled him again . It said no ( well , members mostly abstained ) , but the end result was the same : no elections . At least not yet .
Elections are going to happen — it ’ s just a matter of when . And that ’ s some tricky , tricky business for a whole lot of reasons .
Maybe the biggest one is timing : Again , Johnson wants an election on October 15 , before the Brexit deadline . This is more or less the earliest it can be ; by that same Fixed-Term Parliament Act , elections can ’ t be sooner than 25 working days after Parliament dissolves . It doesn ’ t have to dissolve immediately , and it can be longer than that , but that ’ s the soonest elections can happen through Johnson ’ s route of asking for one .
( There ’ s another way to get to elections , which is through a no-confidence vote in Johnson ; that gives Parliament 14 days to form a new government . If it can ’ t , then elections can start 25 days later . )
But Johnson wants elections as soon as possible so he can hopefully get rid of enough of those meddling MPs to be able to make Brexit happen .
Johnson ’ s also betting on the fact that the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn — the guy most likely to challenge Johnson for the prime ministership — is unpopular right now . Like , really unpopular . More Brits said they ’ d support a no-deal Brexit over having Corbyn as prime minister in a recent poll — in other words , they ’ d rather risk a recession than have him as prime minister .
The reasons for this are complicated . Corbyn ’ s basically a socialist , and he freaks out more moderate Labour members and Conservatives who are less enthusiastic about Brexit and dislike Johnson but are positively terrified of a Corbyn government . ( He ’ s got other issues , too . ) Corbyn has retained support with the active base of his party , which is how he ’ s managed to remain in control .
Corbyn , and by default his party , also haven ’ t handled Brexit particularly well . Corbyn ’ s strategy was to muddle through , attack Conservatives where he could , stop any no-deal Brexit plans , and get to elections so he could get power and be the one to negotiate Brexit .
Corbyn is also kind of at odds with many of the more moderate voters in his party . He ’ s always been skeptical of the EU , and he ’ s pro-Brexit at heart . And while there are definitely Labour voters who agree with him on that , the core of his party opposes Brexit .
Corbyn ’ s fence-sitting created an opening for the much smaller Liberal Democrats . They ’ re staunchly anti-Brexit and want to hold a second referendum . They ’ ve surged in popularity because of this stance .
Labour and Lib Dems will likely have to fight for the same votes in any elections . They could work together , but that means a lot of compromise , which is difficult in elections where everyone wants power . But that doesn ’ t solve the problem of Corbyn himself , so even with an alliance , it ’ s still not clear they could take down the Conservatives , according to recent polling .
After the motion to hold new elections was defeated on Wednesday , Johnson mused that the reason Corbyn voted against the measure “ was that he doesn ’ t think he will win . ”
Harold Clarke , a polling expert and politics professor at the University of Texas in Dallas , agreed with Johnson ’ s assessment . “ They ’ ve got good reason to be scared , ” he told me of the Labour Party . “ They can do the math , just like I do . ”
Well , not quite . They just want to be very strategic about when they go for them . Labour has said they don ’ t want to have elections until this no-deal Brexit bill is officially law , ideally binding Johnson to seek an extension he doesn ’ t want .
But this is not a foolproof plan , either . ( For one , if Johnson does win an outright majority in new elections , he could always repeal the law . ) What many Brexit opponents want Labour to do is wait until a Johnson , without a majority in Parliament and no new Brexit plan , must ask the EU for an extension . This would postpone a dangerous crash-out and force Johnson into breaking the core promise of his premiership : that ’ d he take the UK out of the EU on October 31 , do or die .
That Johnson would be a lot less formidable to run against , and Conservatives could potentially face a serious challenge from the upstart Brexit Party , which , well , you can guess what they want .
Nobody really knows . It ’ s pretty clear that when the elections do happen ( Johnson ’ s expected to try again on Monday , Labour has indicated it won ’ t support the motion , again ) will be the closest thing to a second referendum voters are going to get — who you vote for is an expression of whether you want to leave the EU or remain .
Pro-Leave ( the EU ) and pro-Remain ( in the EU ) voters don ’ t evenly divide across traditional party lines of the Conservatives and Labour . That ’ s created some strange partnerships and elevated different parties — the new Brexit party , the Liberal Democrats — that ’ s eroded the domination , or started to change the character of , those two major parties .
And the UK is still almost evenly split between Leave and Remain supporters . Which means that even an election might not necessarily offer any more clarity on what the country should do about Brexit . But it might be the best chance .
Just one last thing : This thing about Boris ’ s brother . What ’ s the deal with that ?
Johnson ’ s brother , Jo Johnson , announced Thursday that he was resigning from Parliament and the government ( he was the universities minister ) because he was torn between family loyalty and the “ national interest . ”
It ’ s been an honour to represent Orpington for 9 years & to serve as a minister under three PMs . In recent weeks I ’ ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest - it ’ s an unresolvable tension & time for others to take on my roles as MP & Minister . # overandout — Jo Johnson ( @ JoJohnsonUK ) September 5 , 2019
In other words , he loves his brother Boris but can ’ t support his Brexit plan .
He ’ s not the only Conservative member to defect or resign this week , but his resignation is definitely eye-catching because , siblings . It has also handed Labour and other Johnson opponents a pretty sweet attack line : Even your own brother doesn ’ t trust you to run this country .
To be fair , the Johnsons have been open-ish about their political disagreements : Johnson ’ s sister Rachel ran as an anti-Brexit candidate in the European Parliamentary elections earlier this year . But they ’ ve been careful to separate opposition to Brexit ( or at least disagreements on the issue ) from opposition to Boris .
Jo Johnson ’ s resignation has complicated that balance a bit . As if this could get even more complicated .","The Brexit debate set off another wild week in British politics that started with Parliament rebelling against Prime Minister Boris Johnson, continued with Johnson trying (and failing) to call new elections, and ended with Johnson declaring he’d “rather be dead in a ditch” than delay Brexit.

So, you know, just another week in UK politics these days.

And that’s what all this drama has really been about: politics. This week’s hijinks had less to do with the actual substantive debate about Brexit and more to do with the political power games surrounding it.

That’s because the UK is more or less in the same situation it has been in for the past year: The only Brexit deal on offer is the deeply unpopular one negotiated by former Prime Minister Theresa May. Parliament has repeatedly rejected it, along with all other Brexit options. The only thing Parliament does agree on is that it wants to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.

That leaves exiting the EU without a plan on the October 31 deadline as the default option. But because Parliament doesn’t want a no-deal departure — or the potential economic consequences that go with it — and because Parliament can’t figure out what it does want in a Brexit plan, it is trying to stall for more time.

Everyone, that is, except Boris Johnson.

And that’s the only thing that’s really changed: there’s now a prime minister (Johnson) at 10 Downing Street who staked his political fortune on the promise of delivering Brexit, “do or die,” by October 31.

That set the stage for the contentious battle between him and Parliament that played out this week.

For those of you who have better things to do than to follow the day-to-day shenanigans of British politics, here’s a rundown of what happened this week and how it may (or may not) affect the future of Brexit.

The catalyst: Boris’s big promise

Before we get to Parliament, we have to talk about Boris Johnson. Johnson, who took over as prime minister in July, has promised he will pull the UK out of the European Union by October 31, with or without a deal in place outlining the terms of the divorce.

The deal that currently exists is the one that former Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the EU. Johnson and his band of Brexiteers oppose this deal because they see it as trapping the UK in the EU, without any say over the rules — Brexit without the exit, so to speak.

They mainly object to a provision referred to as the “Irish backstop,” which is a plan to guarantee that no matter the future EU-UK relationship, there will be no border checks or physical infrastructure on the politically sensitive border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and Ireland (a country that will remain part of the EU). The need for this has to do with the conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles, which formally ended with a 1998 peace agreement. An open border was a critical part of that truce.

The EU has said getting rid of the backstop is nonnegotiable unless the UK can come up with a legitimate and viable alternative. The UK has not come up with a legitimate and viable alternative, so the EU is not renegotiating anything. Which means the same old deal is the only deal that exists right now.

However, Johnson is arguing — to both Parliament and the British public — that he can get a better deal, if only Parliament will get out of his way. He claims that as long as the EU knows the UK is desperate to avoid a no-deal Brexit, the bloc has no incentive to budge.

But, Johnson argues, once the EU realizes the UK is deadly serious about leaving without a potential deal, the EU will finally crack and give the UK the concessions it desires.

There are a few problems with Johnson’s argument. First, while he’s correct in assessing that the EU definitely doesn’t want a no-deal Brexit because it will be bad for it economically, the reality is that it will still be way worse for the UK than the EU.

And while Brexiteers have embraced the idea that a no-deal exit is the “ripping the Band-Aid right off” approach, it isn’t — not really. A better analogy is that the process of Brexiting is like trying to take an egg out of an omelet: a clean separation is basically impossible. That’s why we’re hearing all those predictions of food shortages and recessions if there’s no deal in place: it’s not easy to just ghost a decades-long trading and economic partner.

The UK will almost certainly still need to reach an actual deal with the EU after the no-deal, and you might be able to guess who might have all the leverage at that point (hint: it’s not the UK).

Which brings us back to the British Parliament.

The rebellion: Parliament tries to block a no-deal Brexit. Boris fights back — and loses.

Members of Parliament (MPs), through numerous votes, have made it clear that they don’t want to put the country through the stress of a no-deal Brexit. They want to leave with a deal — just not the deal that’s actually available.

Johnson was well-aware of Parliament’s anti-no-deal proclivities. So he wanted to make it as hard as possible for MPs to foil his plan to leave on October 31 at all costs.

But the way he did it was controversial. He announced that he was going to temporarily suspend — or “prorogue” — Parliament for five weeks, starting as soon as September 9 and lasting until October 14. Remember, the Brexit deadline is October 31, so Parliament would have about one week in September, and then a little more than two weeks in October.

Proroguing is not usually controversial. It’s used to mark the end of one parliamentary session and the start of the other, and it’s often a thing that happens when a new government takes over, giving it time to set a new agenda.

But Johnson suspended Parliament for five weeks, an unprecedented duration that very much looked like an attempt to limit the time Parliament had to plot against him and block a no-deal Brexit.

In response, the opposition Labour Party and other smaller opposition parties returned from their summer breaks ready to rally together to get something done as quickly as possible. And — most critically — they peeled off a handful of Conservative Party members who broke with Johnson to “take control of the order paper.”

What that means is that backbench MPs — those who aren’t part of Johnson’s government — get to set the agenda. Usually, it’s the government (Johnson) who get to control what gets done in Parliament. Obviously, his government isn’t going to put forward a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit, so these MPs had to seize power so they could do it instead.

Parliament did this successfully on Tuesday, which gave members the chance to introduce that no-deal Brexit bill and vote on it Wednesday. In response, Johnson’s whip expelled the 21 Conservative rebels — basically kicked them out of the party — for their disloyalty, which also happened to completely tank Johnson’s majority in Parliament.

But it did little to stop Parliament’s plan, and MPs successfully advanced the bill to stop a no-deal Brexit, dealing Johnson his second defeat as prime minister in two days. It’s been a pretty awful first week of work for the new prime minister.

Oh, and it somehow got worse for Johnson after that.

Okay! So Parliament just stopped a no-deal Brexit. That’s great news, right?

No, that’s not exactly what happened.

Then why did you just say that’s what happened?

Sorry, I know. Just stick with me here.

The actual bill — known as the Benn bill, for the Labour MP Hilary Benn who introduced it — requires the prime minister to seek an extension from the European Union if he doesn’t have a new deal by October 19, or unless Parliament explicitly votes for a no-deal. The suggested extension is three months, putting the new deadline at about January 31, 2020.

All 27 EU leaders would have to unanimously agree to such an extension (they might, they might not, they may set a different date, who knows) and Parliament will also have to approve the extension that Johnson, or some other prime minister, brings back. It can’t stop a no-deal Brexit, but it binds the prime minister, by law, to at least go back to the EU and try to get an extension.

It’s not yet a law, though it’s expected to become one before Parliament is officially prorogued.

The problem is that Johnson says he’s not going to do it. He’s not going to ask for an extension, even if the law says he has to.

He called the delay “pointless” and blamed Parliament for undercutting his negotiating position. It’s not clear what would happen if he actually refused to follow through, but the simple answer is it would probably spark a constitutional crisis. But the UK is not quite at that point yet.

That’s because Johnson is trying to get around it in another way: elections. He’s saying, “let’s take it back to the people.” He asked Parliament for permission to call new elections, essentially giving the power back to voters to decide if they want his version of Brexit — get out, and get on with it — or Parliament’s continued dilly-dallying, which Johnson and his supporters claim are really just attempts to stop Brexit altogether.

Johnson asked for elections to be held on October 15, about two weeks ahead of the Brexit deadline. But he can’t just get them — he needs two-thirds of Parliament (around 434 MPs) to go along with his plan, thanks to the Fixed-Term Parliament Act 2011.

And here’s where Parliament foiled him again. It said no (well, members mostly abstained), but the end result was the same: no elections. At least not yet.

So you’re saying there’s a chance for elections?

Elections are going to happen — it’s just a matter of when. And that’s some tricky, tricky business for a whole lot of reasons.

Maybe the biggest one is timing: Again, Johnson wants an election on October 15, before the Brexit deadline. This is more or less the earliest it can be; by that same Fixed-Term Parliament Act, elections can’t be sooner than 25 working days after Parliament dissolves. It doesn’t have to dissolve immediately, and it can be longer than that, but that’s the soonest elections can happen through Johnson’s route of asking for one.

(There’s another way to get to elections, which is through a no-confidence vote in Johnson; that gives Parliament 14 days to form a new government. If it can’t, then elections can start 25 days later.)

But Johnson wants elections as soon as possible so he can hopefully get rid of enough of those meddling MPs to be able to make Brexit happen.

Johnson’s also betting on the fact that the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn — the guy most likely to challenge Johnson for the prime ministership — is unpopular right now.

Education Minister Anne Milton tweeted her resignation just half an hour before the leadership result was due to be revealed, insisting the UK ""must leave the EU in a responsible manner"".

And International Development Secretary Rory Stewart confirmed he would be returning to the backbenches, where he would be spending more time ""serving Cumbria"" and ""walking"".

David Gauke, another vocal opponent of a no-deal Brexit, announced he was resigning as justice secretary.

They join the likes of Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan and Culture Minister Margot James who have all said they disagree too strongly with Mr Johnson's Brexit strategy to work closely with him.

Boris Johnson will become our next prime minister.

A sentence that might thrill you. A sentence that might horrify you. A sentence that 12 months ago even his most die-hard fans would have found hard to believe.

But it's not a sentence, unusually maybe for politics, that won't bother you either way.

Because whatever you think of Boris Johnson, he is a politician that is hard to ignore.

With a personality, and perhaps an ego, of a scale that few of his colleagues can match. This is the man who even as a child wanted to be ""world king"".

Now, he is the Tory king, and the Brexiteers are the court.

The EU Commission's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he was looking forward to working with Mr Johnson ""to facilitate the ratification of the withdrawal agreement and achieve an orderly Brexit"".

The new Tory leader has previously said the agreement Mrs May reached with the EU was ""dead"", having been rejected three times by MPs.

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit co-ordinator, said the parliament would hold an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday in response to Mr Johnson's election.

Jeremy Corbyn reacted to the result by tweeting that Mr Johnson had ""won the support of fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative Party members"".

""The people of our country should decide who becomes the prime minister in a general election,"" he added.

Speaking to the BBC later, Mr Corbyn said Labour planned to table a motion of no confidence in Mr Johnson. Asked when that would be, he replied: ""It will be an interesting surprise for you all.""

What happens now?

Wednesday 12:00 BST onwards: Theresa May takes part in her last Prime Minister's Questions. After lunch she will make a short farewell speech outside No. 10 before travelling to see the Queen to tender her resignation.

Boris Johnson will then arrive for an audience at Buckingham Palace where he will be invited to form a government.

After that he will make a speech in Downing Street before entering the building for the first time as prime minister.

Later, he will begin announcing his most senior cabinet appointments, such as chancellor, home secretary and foreign secretary, and will make and take his first calls from other world leaders.

Thursday: Mr Johnson is expected to make a statement to Parliament about his Brexit strategy and take questions from MPs. Parliament will break up for its summer recess later.

The new PM will also continue announcing his new cabinet.

Newly-elected Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Johnson had ""shown time and time again that he isn't fit to be the prime minister of our country"".

First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Johnson, but said she had ""profound concerns"" about him becoming prime minister.

The new leader also received congratulations from Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose support has kept the Conservatives in government since the 2017 general election.

She said the pact - known as a confidence and supply agreement - continued and would be reviewed over the coming weeks ""to explore the policy priorities of both parties"".

Leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson, who backed Mr Hunt in the campaign, also sent her congratulations, adding that the new PM had ""an enormous task ahead of him"".

In the often divisive Brexit world of ""them and us"" it's easy to forget that, beyond Brexit, EU leaders still see the UK as a close partner and ally. Today's messages of congratulation to Boris Johnson from across Europe were a timely reminder.

Whatever happens with Brexit, France, Germany, Poland et al still very much hope to work closely with the UK on international issues like Russia sanctions, Iran, and human rights protection.

But EU leaders' welcoming tone does not signal a willingness to accept whatever Prime Minister Johnson might demand in terms of changes to the Brexit deal.

He's right when he says a no-deal Brexit is bad for Brussels, but he overestimates EU wiggle room. Amendments will only be forthcoming if EU leaders deem them workable and are convinced the new prime minister commands a majority in Parliament to get an agreement through once and for all.",www.bbc.com,center,vHxXGDsZBaWAy9mC

Thatcher made history

Thatcher won the nation's top job only six years after declaring in a television interview, ""I don't think there will be a woman prime minister in my lifetime.""

During her time at the helm of the British government, she emphasized moral absolutism, nationalism, and the rights of the individual versus those of the state -- famously declaring ""There is no such thing as society"" in 1987.

Nicknamed the ""Iron Lady"" by the Soviet press after a 1976 speech declaring that ""the Russians are bent on world dominance,"" Thatcher later enjoyed a close working relationship with U.S. President Reagan, with whom she shared similar conservative views.

But the British cold warrior played a key role in ending the conflict by giving her stamp of approval to Soviet Communist reformer Mikhail Gorbachev shortly before he came to power.

A grocer's daughter

Thatcher -- born in October 1925 in the small eastern England market town of Grantham -- came from a modest background, taking pride in being known as a grocer's daughter. She studied chemistry at Oxford, but was involved in politics from a young age, giving her first political speech at 20, according to her official biography.

She was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, when the party was in opposition.

She made history four years later, becoming prime minister when the Conservatives won the elections of 1979, the first of three election victories to which she led her party.

As British leader, Thatcher took a firm stance with the European Community -- the forerunner of the European Union -- demanding a rebate of money London contributed to Brussels.

Her positions on other issues, both domestic and foreign, were just as firm, and in one of her most famous phrases, she declared at a Conservative Party conference that she had no intention of changing her mind.

""To those waiting with bated breath for that favorite media catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say: 'You turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning,'"" she declared, to cheers from party members.

The United Kingdom fought a short, sharp war against Argentina over the Falklands Islands under Thatcher in 1982, responding with force when Buenos Aires laid claim to the islands.

Announcing that Britain had recaptured South Georgia Island from Argentina, Thatcher appealed to nationalist sentiments, advising the press: ""Just rejoice at the news and congratulate our forces.""

A journalist shouted a question at her as she turned to go back into 10 Downing Street: ""Are we going to war with Argentina, Mrs. Thatcher?""

She paused for an instant, then offered a single word: ""Rejoice.""

Controversy over Falklands war

The conflict was not without controversy, even in Britain.

A British submarine sank Argentina's only cruiser, the General Belgrano, in an encounter that left 358 Argentines dead. The sinking took place outside of Britain's declared exclusion zone.

In her first term, Thatcher reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to business, a move that led to a sharp rise in unemployment. By 1986, unemployment had reached 3 million.

But Thatcher won landslide re-election in 1983 on the heels of the Falklands victory, her Conservative Party taking a majority of seats in parliament with 42% of the vote. Second-place Labour took nearly 28%, while the alliance that became the Liberal Democrats took just over 25%.

A year later, she escaped an IRA terrorist bombing at her hotel at the Conservative Party conference in Brighton.

She was re-elected in 1987 with a slightly reduced majority.

She was ultimately brought down, not by British voters, but by her own Conservative party.

Brought down by the poll tax

She was forced to resign in 1990 during an internal leadership struggle after she introduced a poll tax levied on community residents rather than property.

The unpopular tax led to rioting in the streets.

She married her husband, Denis Thatcher, a local businessman who ran his family's firm before becoming an executive in the oil industry, in 1951 -- a year after an unsuccessful run for Parliament. The couple had twins, Mark and Carol, in 1953.

She was elected to Parliament in 1959 and served in various positions, including education secretary, until her terms as prime minister.

Thatcher was awarded the U.S. Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush in 1991, a year after she stepped down as prime minister. She was named Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven after leaving office.

She retired from public life after a stroke in 2002 and suffered several smaller strokes after that. Her husband died in June 2003.

Though her doctors advised against public speaking, a frail Thatcher attended Reagan's 2004 funeral, saying in a prerecorded video that Reagan was ""a great president, a great American, and a great man.""

""And I have lost a dear friend,"" she said.

In the years that followed she encountered additional turmoil. In 2004, her son Mark was arrested in an investigation of an alleged plot by mercenaries to overthrow the president of Equatorial Guinea in west Africa.

Economists cautioned that the strong bounce was to some extent a reflection of one-off factors

Britain's double-dip recession has ended after the economy grew 1 per cent between the second and third quarters, much more robustly than economists had expected.

The strong rise in gross domestic product will come as a relief to the coalition government, whose austerity programme has come in for fierce criticism as the economy has faltered. Sterling rose 0.5 per cent after the data were released.

David Cameron, the prime minister, who would have seen the figures 24 hours earlier, appeared to hint that GDP figures would be good on Wednesday during prime minister's questions in parliament.

The quarterly growth rate was the strongest in five years, though the economy is still no bigger than it was a year ago. George Osborne, the chancellor, said: ""There is still a long way to go, but these figures show we are on the right track.""

Economists cautioned that the strong bounce was to some extent a reflection of one-off factors, such as the unwinding of the impact from the jubilee bank holiday, which depressed output in the second quarter, and the Olympics. The sales of tickets alone added about 0.2 percentage points to GDP, the Office for National Statistics said.

Nonetheless, most were expecting more modest growth of 0.6 per cent. They were surprised by the strength of the service sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the UK economy, and grew 1.3 per cent in the third quarter. All five sections of the service sector grew.

The output of the production industries, including oil extraction and manufacturing, rose 1.1 per cent. However, output in the small but suffering construction sector fell 2.5 per cent.

Vicky Redwood, an analyst at Capital Economics, said the data could ""tip the balance"" on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and persuade them not to renew quantitative easing next month when the current round comes to an end.

However, she said the underlying momentum in the economy was still weak. ""As the Olympic effects unwind, it is still possible that the economy contracts again in the fourth quarter.

great_britain,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39431070,Brexit: The UK's letter triggering Article 50,,,"Here is the full text of Theresa May 's letter to European Council president Donald Tusk , beginning the start of Brexit negotiations .
On 23 June last year , the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union . As I have said before , that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans . Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states . On the contrary , the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper . Instead , the referendum was a vote to restore , as we see it , our national self-determination . We are leaving the European Union , but we are not leaving Europe - and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent .
Earlier this month , the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union ( Notification of Withdrawal ) Bill . The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March .
Today , therefore , I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom . I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom 's intention to withdraw from the European Union . In addition , in accordance with the same Article 50 ( 2 ) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community , I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom 's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community . References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community .
This letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty 's Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom 's departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy - as your closest friend and neighbour - with the European Union once we leave . We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too .
It is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner , and with as little disruption as possible on each side . We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values , leading in the world , and defending itself from security threats . We want the United Kingdom , through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union , to play its full part in achieving these goals . We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union .
The Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition , giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union - and indeed from third countries around the world - as much certainty as possible , as early as possible .
I would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions , but before I do so , I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home , in the United Kingdom .
As I have announced already , the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament - the European Communities Act 1972 - that gives effect to EU law in our country . This legislation will , wherever practical and appropriate , in effect convert the body of existing European Union law ( the `` acquis '' ) into UK law . This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom . The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation , and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow . We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union , also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty , in particular for businesses . We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union , and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave .
From the start and throughout the discussions , we will negotiate as one United Kingdom , taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so . When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom , we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration .
The United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation . To achieve this , we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU .
If , however , we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms . In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened . In this kind of scenario , both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change , but it is not the outcome that either side should seek . We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome .
It is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership , taking in both economic and security cooperation , but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world , projecting its values and defending itself from security threats . And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent .
Looking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin , I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible .
i . We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully , in a spirit of sincere cooperation . Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you , to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament . That is why the United Kingdom does not seek membership of the single market : we understand and respect your position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no `` cherry picking '' . We also understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU : we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy . We also know that UK companies will , as they trade within the EU , have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part - just as UK companies do in other overseas markets .
ii . We should always put our citizens first . There is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake , but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens . There are , for example , many citizens of the remaining member states living in the United Kingdom , and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union , and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights .
iii . We should work towards securing a comprehensive agreement . We want to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU , taking in both economic and security cooperation . We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the UK 's rights and obligations as a departing member state , in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom 's continuing partnership with the EU . But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU .
iv . We should work together to minimise disruption and give as much certainty as possible . Investors , businesses and citizens in both the UK and across the remaining 27 member states - and those from third countries around the world - want to be able to plan . In order to avoid any cliff-edge as we move from our current relationship to our future partnership , people and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements . It would help both sides to minimise unnecessary disruption if we agree this principle early in the process .
v. In particular , we must pay attention to the UK 's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland . The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom . We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries , to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us , and to make sure that the UK 's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland . We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland , and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement .
vi . We should begin technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible , but we should prioritise the biggest challenges . Agreeing a high-level approach to the issues arising from our withdrawal will of course be an early priority . But we also propose a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union . This should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries . This will require detailed technical talks , but as the UK is an existing EU member state , both sides have regulatory frameworks and standards that already match . We should therefore prioritise how we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment , and how we resolve disputes . On the scope of the partnership between us - on both economic and security matters - my officials will put forward detailed proposals for deep , broad and dynamic cooperation .
vii . We should continue to work together to advance and protect our shared European values . Perhaps now more than ever , the world needs the liberal , democratic values of Europe . We want to play our part to ensure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world , projecting its values and defending itself from security threats .
As I have said , the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU , taking in both economic and security cooperation . At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world , Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens . Likewise , Europe 's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War . Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake . The United Kingdom 's objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February .
We recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty . But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU . We start from a unique position in these discussions - close regulatory alignment , trust in one another 's institutions , and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades . It is for these reasons , and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides , that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty .
The task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us . After all , the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations , and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy . Together , I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK 's rights and obligations as a departing member state , while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity , security and global power of our continent .","Here is the full text of Theresa May's letter to European Council president Donald Tusk, beginning the start of Brexit negotiations.

This letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty's Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy - as your closest friend and neighbour - with the European Union once we leave. We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too.

I would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom.

The process in the United Kingdom

As I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament - the European Communities Act 1972 - that gives effect to EU law in our country. This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the ""acquis"") into UK law.

But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.

Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union

The United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation. To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.

If, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms. In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.

It is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats. And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent.

Proposed principles for our discussions

Looking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible.

i. We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation. Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you, to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament.

The task before us

At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens.

Boris Johnson has unexpectedly ruled himself out as a candidate for Britain ’ s next prime minister , after the justice secretary , Michael Gove , sent shockwaves through Westminster with a last-minute bid for the Conservative leadership .
Gove had been chairing Johnson ’ s leadership campaign , after the two men worked shoulder to shoulder in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU .
But with just hours to go before formal nominations closed at noon on Thursday , Gove announced that he no longer believed Johnson was the right man for the job , and that he would launch his own bid to be the next prime minister .
Despite having been the leading public face in the victorious Vote Leave campaign , Johnson quickly concluded he could not command enough support from his party , after a series of key lieutenants , including the business minister Nick Boles and the pro-Brexit MP Dominic Raab , defected to the Gove camp .
He stuck to plans to hold a mid-morning press conference at a London hotel , and delivered a defiant speech saying Britain should take last week ’ s Brexit vote as an opportunity to “ think globally ” , and “ lift our eyes to the horizon ” . But he concluded by saying he would no longer put his name forward .
“ Having consulted colleagues and in view of the circumstances in parliament , I have concluded that person can not be me , ” he said , stunning MPs who had assembled to show their support .
Johnson ’ s backers , who had gathered in the hotel to lend their support to the former mayor , appeared shocked by his announcement , after he spent much of his speech setting out a pitch to be a one-nation Tory .
“ This is not a time to quail , it is not a crisis , nor should we see it as an excuse for wobbling or self-doubt , ” Johnson said of Britain ’ s vote to leave the EU , before he announced he was not planning to stand .
Gove is now widely regarded as the main rival to Theresa May , the home secretary , who had launched her own campaign earlier on Thursday with a pledge that “ Brexit means Brexit ” , and that there would be no general election until 2020 .
The other contenders are the work and pensions secretary , Stephen Crabb , the former defence secretary Liam Fox , and the pro-Brexit energy minister Andrea Leadsom .
The first round of voting will take place on 5 July , with the weakest candidate eliminated in successive rounds , until the field is whittled down to two candidates , who will be presented to the Conservatives ’ grassroots members . The result will be announced on 9 September .

“ His role now will be to champion that cause ; to ensure that those commitments made by our leaders to the people and the message sent by the people to our leaders is heard. ” They added that he would fight to ensure that politics does not return to “ business as usual ” .

Gove ’ s allies said he had had growing doubts about Johnson ’ s ability to build a future government in recent days , and over how he would manage the complex negotiations that will be required to extricate Britain from the EU . They suggested he lacked the “ focus and grip ” , to succeed in No 10 .
Johnson ’ s backers in parliament suggested the late timing of Gove ’ s intervention was a long-planned act of treachery . “ Anyone can see who has wielded the knife , and how it has been wielded , ” a source said .
Gove ’ s statement said : “ I have repeatedly said that I do not want to be prime minister . That has always been my view . But events since last Thursday have weighed heavily with me . ”
He added : “ I wanted to help build a team behind Boris Johnson so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future . ”
Ed Vaizey , one of the MPs who attended a meeting with Gove on Thursday morning , said : “ He was ready to back Boris ; but the closer it got , the harder he thought about it , he thought , it ’ s not the right person . Follow that through to its conclusion : the logic is , if he doesn ’ t think Boris can do it , he has to step up to the plate and do it . ”
Vaizey added : “ I think he will be a better prime minister than Theresa May . ”","Main public face of Brexit makes shock announcement hours after his key ally Michael Gove launched his own campaign

Gove’s allies said he had had growing doubts about Johnson’s ability to build a future government in recent days, and over how he would manage the complex negotiations that will be required to extricate Britain from the EU. They suggested he lacked the “focus and grip”, to succeed in No 10.

Johnson’s backers in parliament suggested the late timing of Gove’s intervention was a long-planned act of treachery. “Anyone can see who has wielded the knife, and how it has been wielded,” a source said.

Gove’s statement said: “I have repeatedly said that I do not want to be prime minister. That has always been my view. But events since last Thursday have weighed heavily with me.”

He added: “I wanted to help build a team behind Boris Johnson so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future.”

Ed Vaizey, one of the MPs who attended a meeting with Gove on Thursday morning, said: “He was ready to back Boris; but the closer it got, the harder he thought about it, he thought, it’s not the right person. Follow that through to its conclusion: the logic is, if he doesn’t think Boris can do it, he has to step up to the plate and do it.”

Vaizey added: “I think he will be a better prime minister than Theresa May.”",www.theguardian.com,left,4FZqkd7NQMw7SJOg

British authorities have made eight arrests in their investigation into Wednesday's attack in London, police said Thursday morning.

Mark Rowley, the national lead for counterterrorism policing, told reporters that there were four dead, including the attacker, and 29 people have been treated in hospitals. Seven people are in critical condition, he said.

Police had earlier said there were five dead including the attacker.

Overnight, police raided properties, including in London and in the city of Birmingham, which is located in central England to the northwest of London. Rowley said police have searched six addresses in connection with the investigation.

""It is still our belief — which continues to be born out by our investigation — that this attacker acted alone yesterday and was inspired by international terrorism,"" he said, reading from a statement. ""To be explicit — at this stage, we have no specific information about further threats to the public.""

The attack happened midday Wednesday, near the U.K. Parliament building. An assailant killed two civilians and a police officer before being shot to death, British authorities say.

Police described it as a terrorist incident Wednesday. Rowley said police believe they know, but aren't ready to release, the name of the man they believe was a single attacker.

Rowley requested that journalists refrain from ""unnecessary reporting"" while investigators check into the suspect's background and any associates. He said police suspect the attack was inspired by Islamist extremism.

With the passing of Margaret Thatcher, we’ve lost not only one of conservatism’s heroes. We’ve lost one of the greatest figures of modern times, a woman who battled incredible odds to become prime minister, and then turned her country around after decades of decline.

I had the honor of working for Lady Thatcher in her private office from 2000 to 2002. Like anyone who has had that privilege, I had the opportunity to observe firsthand how fully she dedicated her life to serving her country. She was a true leader in every sense of the word, and Britain not to mention the world is safer, stronger and more secure because of it.

Well did Lady Thatcher deserve the nickname “the Iron Lady.” She displayed an iron will, to be sure, but she also possessed that great presence and spirit that made her a titan on the world stage.

Every time I visited Lady Thatcher, which I did for many years after she retired from politics, I found her to be cheerful and contented, with a clear spring in her step. Indeed, my former boss succeeded in outliving many of her own obituary writers.

They learned that Margaret Thatcher was someone you underestimated at your peril. You could never count the Iron Lady out.

Her concern for Britain, the “Special Relationship” between the United Kingdom and the United States, and the future of the free world remained undimmed throughout her life. It was always a deeply moving experience to meet with her, a figure of great conviction and principle, who had devoted her life to helping her country regain its position of leadership on the world stage.

For the current generation of leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, Lady Thatcher remains a role model of fortitude, principle and leadership at a time of economic upheaval and mounting threats to international security. Her great wisdom and example are sorely needed now as much as they were when she came to power in 1979.

It seems almost providential that her tenure in office would coincide with that of Ronald Reagan’s. The two of them worked so well together that they soon made the stagnation and malaise of the 1970s seem like a distant memory for both of their respective nations. By standing up to communism, they broke the back of the Soviet Union and brought the Cold War to an end without, as they say, firing a shot.

Lady Thatcher knew that liberal policies simply didn’t work. As she famously declared back in 1976: “Socialist governments traditionally do make a financial mess. They always run out of other people’s money.”

She won three general elections outright for a reason, and not just because the left was heavily split. It was because she offered a clear-cut set of policies based upon core conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise. Lady Thatcher understood the issues that Middle England really cares about: the economy, taxes, immigration, and law and order among them. She went to great lengths to support the creation of small businesses, while reducing burdensome regulations and cutting the level of business and personal taxation. She also understood the importance of maintaining and investing in a strong defense.

She offers many important lessons for today’s would-be leaders on the right. A conservative party can win, but only if it sticks to conservative values. Otherwise it becomes an empty shell that succeeds only in alienating its own base and destroying its very identity.

We will miss Lady Thatcher, but we remain hugely grateful for her example. Her legacy will serve as a living inspiration to conservatives all over the world.

He is expected to face a formal challenge from his MPs once a rival leadership candidate is chosen .
Corbyn walked into a fresh firestorm Thursday when he appeared to compare the Israeli government to ISIS -- at the launch of a report into alleged anti-Semitism within his party .
`` Our Jewish friends are no more responsible for the actions of Israel or the Netanyahu government than our Muslim friends are for those of various self-styled Islamic states or organizations , '' Corbyn said , speaking at the launch of a report commissioned to investigate accusations of anti-Semitism within Labour 's ranks .

""Our Jewish friends are no more responsible for the actions of Israel or the Netanyahu government than our Muslim friends are for those of various self-styled Islamic states or organizations,"" Corbyn said, speaking at the launch of a report commissioned to investigate accusations of anti-Semitism within Labour's ranks.

His comments drew swift criticism in Britain and Israel, with Israeli politicians calling on British Labour MPs to dump the embattled leader.

The inquiry was instigated in response to an anti-Semitism controversy that gripped the party earlier this year, after it was revealed that an MP had shared an image on social media, prior to taking office, which called for Israel to be relocated to the United States.

Wednesday, in the first Parliamentary session since the referendum, Cameron told Corbyn in a fiery exchange that he should step down ""in the national interest.""

""It might be in my party's interest for him to sit there. It's not in the national interest, and I would say, for heaven's sake man, go.""

May: 'No second referendum'

Amid the post-referendum turmoil, members of the public, as well as MPs, have called for a second, do-over referendum before the government formally begins the process of leaving the European Union.

But although she campaigned to remain, May said Thursday that there could be no revisiting the vote.

""Brexit means Brexit. The campaign was fought. The vote was held. Turnout was high, and the public gave their verdict,"" she said.

""There may be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door. And no second referendum.""",www.cnn.com,left,3bxu1aOOGmX08IuW

Trump reignited the feud with Khan in an interview with The Sun newspaper , saying the Mayor of London “ has done a terrible job ” when it comes to terrorism and crime . “ I think he has done a bad job on crime , if you look , all of the horrible things going on there , with all of the crime that is being brought in , ” he said .
Khan called the comments “ preposterous ” on the BBC ’ s Today program on Friday , claiming that violent crime has risen across the country and London has been forced to tackle the issue with a smaller police budget .
But crime in London persists on epidemic proportions as murder rate soared by 44 percent , with 157 homicides committed compared to 109 the previous year , according to official statistics from the Metropolitan Police .
A former ambassador to the U.S. , Sir Christopher Meyer , was the victim of a violent attack against him at a central London underground station this week . “ I ’ m absolutely shocked by the level of the brutality , ” his wife , Baroness Meyer , told the Times of London . “ They really beat him . It ’ s appalling — like something you would see in a war zone .
Earlier this year , for the first time in modern history , London overtook New York in the number of murders . In February , London ’ s police investigated 15 murders while New York saw 11 homicides . In March , the Metropolitan Police murder numbers increased further to 22 , while NYPD ’ s jumped to 21 . The City of New York has since taken back the lead however .
London is also facing the rise of shocking acid attacks , skyrocketing by more than 78 per cent over the past two years , with 465 such offenses in 2017 , up from 260 in 2015 , according to police figures obtained by the Evening Standard .
This led to frustrated Londoners airing their concerns about the spiraling crime in the city , all while Khan remains preoccupied with feuding with Trump .
“ This guy spends his week getting a balloon of Donald Trump in a nappy put in the air in central London instead of helping us with severe issues . I just think he ’ s so worried about himself , his reputation and PR rather than portraying the country , the city in the best way can be and making it safe for the citizens , ” London business leader Mark Wright , who won the UK 's version of The Apprentice , told Fox News .
“ I think he embarrassed himself , he ’ s embarrassed Britain because no matter what you think of Donald Trump , it ’ s irrelevant . America is the most powerful country in the world , the office of president has got to be respected no matter who that person is and that wasn ’ t done and I was very disappointed , ” he added .
`` This guy spends his week getting a balloon of Donald Trump in a nappy put in the air in central London instead of helping us with severe issues . '' — Businessman and the Apprentice winner Mark Wright
Wright ’ s comments echo recent remarks by former New York mayor , now attorney for Trump , Rudy Giuliani , under whose tenure the city ’ s crime rate dropped by more than half and murders decreased by two thirds thanks to tough zero-tolerance policing – a measure Khan once vehemently opposed yet was forced to reintroduce amid the crime epidemic .
“ Sadiq Khan should be ashamed of himself . He ’ s so busy attacking President Trump ’ s visit and , in the meantime , crime is spiraling in London . Maybe he should just do his job instead of attacking a world leader , ” Giuliani told Britain ’ s Sunday Express .
He added : “ I would not like to go to a country where someone with the authority of a mayor was rallying people against them . It ’ s highly inappropriate . He ’ s probably suffering from some of the criticisms that President Trump has made of him , which are valid . ”
Since the beginning of the year over 50 people were fatally stabbed in the streets of the capital of Britain . Just this Thursday , a 17-year-old girl was fatally stabbed in London . Nearly 1,300 stabbings occurred in London up to the end of April . Stabbings in London are at their highest level in six years , with around 21 percent rise from the previous year .
“ I ’ m a bit ashamed to be living in Britain today with how Sadiq Khan has led the city carry on with Trump here . He ’ s the worst mayor we had in history in London . It ’ s easier now to get a knife or a deadly weapon than it ’ s to get Starbucks . You can get a knife anywhere here at the moment , ” Wright said .
“ He ’ s in no position to be throwing rocks in glass houses , ” the businessman added .
`` It ’ s easier now to get a knife or a deadly weapon than it ’ s to get Starbucks . You can get a knife anywhere here at the moment . '' — Businessman and the Apprentice winner Mark Wright
In comparison , under the leadership of Boris Johnson between 2008 and 2016 , the murder rate halved in the city up until 2014 before it increased minimally during the last years of his tenure .
Stabbings also significantly decreased , albeit only since 2012 , reaching its lowest level just before Johnson left the office , according to the Metropolitan Police figures .
The aunt of Kelva Smith , who was fatally stabbed in the abdomen in March this year , told the BBC that knife crime was “ out of control ” in London .
Last month , a mother grilled Khan over the growing crime in the city , pointing out that a victim was stabbed almost in front of a closed police station . “ [ It ] happened outside that police station that is closed down , my local police station . There are no [ police officers ] on our street . Londoners , we do n't feel safe . Our communities do not feel safe , ” she told Khan .
“ You give me statistics , Mr Khan and that 's fair enough . But for me as a parent , I 'm telling you , we do not feel safe . We do n't feel safe in London , ” she added . “ Please do n't give me statistics . Give me known facts so I can let my son out in the streets of London and feel safe . ”
`` Give me known facts so I can let my son out in the streets of London and feel safe. ” — A mother told Sadiq Khan during an open forum last month .
Khan dismissed the criticism of the woman , saying the police force in London is “ under-resourced ” to ensure safety .
The mayor has also bemoaned Trump ’ s visit just a day before on financial grounds , saying the city lacks the financial resources to provide safety during the visit , even though Trump is spending the majority of his time away from the capital . This is all while Khan encouraged millions of Londoners to march against the president , adding additional strain to his “ under-resourced ” police force .
Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation Ken Marsh told the Evening Standard that the security costs for the Trump visit could run in to tens of millions of dollars . The state visit of President Barack Obama , thanks to nearly non-existent protests , cost just over $ 3 million , with only half of that sum actually spent on ensuring safety during the visit .
“ That just sums him up , ” Wright told to Fox News about the costs of policing that could have been saved had the protests been not encouraged by the mayor . “ I don ’ t think he ’ s got any business knowledge . He doesn ’ t think for the people , I don ’ t see him as a caring , forward-thinking individual . He ’ s very self-obsessed . And that ’ s the qualities he called out in Trump , but I think he ’ s only generalizing himself . ”
Despite the overwhelming problems in the city , Khan is favorite to win the second term in 2020 , mostly because no senior Conservative party leaders appears willing to step up and challenge him .
Yet Khan must be aware of his slipping popularity . Only half of Londoners believe he 's a good mayor , according to a YouGov poll in May – a decrease by almost 10 percent compared to last year – while almost a third of residents think he ’ s doing a bad job .
“ I think he should be sacked . I think he ’ s a disgrace for mayor . If I don ’ t do my job properly I lose my job . He ’ s not doing his job properly , he ’ s disrespecting the most powerful office in the world and he ’ s only doing it only to gain himself politically , ” Wright said .","London Mayor Sadiq Khan slammed President Trump’s criticism of him as “preposterous” after allowing a giant Trump balloon at anti-Trump protests in London, but critics question whether the mayor should be devoting his energy to tackling crime rather than “embarrassing” the city in front of the whole world.

In March, the Metropolitan Police murder numbers increased further to 22, while NYPD’s jumped to 21. The City of New York has since taken back the lead however.

London is also facing the rise of shocking acid attacks, skyrocketing by more than 78 per cent over the past two years, with 465 such offenses in 2017, up from 260 in 2015, according to police figures obtained by the Evening Standard.

This led to frustrated Londoners airing their concerns about the spiraling crime in the city, all while Khan remains preoccupied with feuding with Trump.

“This guy spends his week getting a balloon of Donald Trump in a nappy put in the air in central London instead of helping us with severe issues. I just think he’s so worried about himself, his reputation and PR rather than portraying the country, the city in the best way can be and making it safe for the citizens,” London business leader Mark Wright, who won the UK's version of The Apprentice, told Fox News.

“I think he embarrassed himself, he’s embarrassed Britain because no matter what you think of Donald Trump, it’s irrelevant. America is the most powerful country in the world, the office of president has got to be respected no matter who that person is and that wasn’t done and I was very disappointed,” he added.

Wright’s comments echo recent remarks by former New York mayor, now attorney for Trump, Rudy Giuliani, under whose tenure the city’s crime rate dropped by more than half and murders decreased by two thirds thanks to tough zero-tolerance policing – a measure Khan once vehemently opposed yet was forced to reintroduce amid the crime epidemic.

“Sadiq Khan should be ashamed of himself. He’s so busy attacking President Trump’s visit and, in the meantime, crime is spiraling in London. Maybe he should just do his job instead of attacking a world leader,” Giuliani told Britain’s Sunday Express.

He added: “I would not like to go to a country where someone with the authority of a mayor was rallying people against them. It’s highly inappropriate. He’s probably suffering from some of the criticisms that President Trump has made of him, which are valid.”

Since the beginning of the year over 50 people were fatally stabbed in the streets of the capital of Britain. Just this Thursday, a 17-year-old girl was fatally stabbed in London. Nearly 1,300 stabbings occurred in London up to the end of April. Stabbings in London are at their highest level in six years, with around 21 percent rise from the previous year.

“I’m a bit ashamed to be living in Britain today with how Sadiq Khan has led the city carry on with Trump here. He’s the worst mayor we had in history in London. It’s easier now to get a knife or a deadly weapon than it’s to get Starbucks. You can get a knife anywhere here at the moment,” Wright said.

“He’s in no position to be throwing rocks in glass houses,” the businessman added.

In comparison, under the leadership of Boris Johnson between 2008 and 2016, the murder rate halved in the city up until 2014 before it increased minimally during the last years of his tenure.

Stabbings also significantly decreased, albeit only since 2012, reaching its lowest level just before Johnson left the office, according to the Metropolitan Police figures.

The aunt of Kelva Smith, who was fatally stabbed in the abdomen in March this year, told the BBC that knife crime was “out of control” in London.

Last month, a mother grilled Khan over the growing crime in the city, pointing out that a victim was stabbed almost in front of a closed police station. “[It] happened outside that police station that is closed down, my local police station. There are no [police officers] on our street. Londoners, we don't feel safe. Our communities do not feel safe,” she told Khan.

“You give me statistics, Mr Khan and that's fair enough. But for me as a parent, I'm telling you, we do not feel safe. We don't feel safe in London,” she added. “Please don't give me statistics. Give me known facts so I can let my son out in the streets of London and feel safe.”

""Give me known facts so I can let my son out in the streets of London and feel safe.” — A mother told Sadiq Khan during an open forum last month.

Khan dismissed the criticism of the woman, saying the police force in London is “under-resourced” to ensure safety.

The mayor has also bemoaned Trump’s visit just a day before on financial grounds, saying the city lacks the financial resources to provide safety during the visit, even though Trump is spending the majority of his time away from the capital. This is all while Khan encouraged millions of Londoners to march against the president, adding additional strain to his “under-resourced” police force.

Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation Ken Marsh told the Evening Standard that the security costs for the Trump visit could run in to tens of millions of dollars. The state visit of President Barack Obama, thanks to nearly non-existent protests, cost just over $3 million, with only half of that sum actually spent on ensuring safety during the visit.

“That just sums him up,” Wright told to Fox News about the costs of policing that could have been saved had the protests been not encouraged by the mayor. “I don’t think he’s got any business knowledge. He doesn’t think for the people, I don’t see him as a caring, forward-thinking individual. He’s very self-obsessed. And that’s the qualities he called out in Trump, but I think he’s only generalizing himself.”

Despite the overwhelming problems in the city, Khan is favorite to win the second term in 2020, mostly because no senior Conservative party leaders appears willing to step up and challenge him.

Yet Khan must be aware of his slipping popularity. Only half of Londoners believe he's a good mayor, according to a YouGov poll in May – a decrease by almost 10 percent compared to last year – while almost a third of residents think he’s doing a bad job.

“I think he should be sacked. I think he’s a disgrace for mayor. If I don’t do my job properly I lose my job. He’s not doing his job properly, he’s disrespecting the most powerful office in the world and he’s only doing it only to gain himself politically,” Wright said.",www.foxnews.com,right,wooKtL68bOtHEEQp

'Political ruin'

Turning to Brexit, the election had given more power to Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, and to Conservatives in Scotland, Mr Osborne said.

He said this shift would change the debate, because the DUP were committed to avoiding a hard border with Ireland.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has called for a new approach to Brexit, prioritising free trade and the economy over restricting immigration.

United Kingdom voters sent shockwaves across Europe and beyond with their vote to exit the European Union. The ""Brexit"" vote stunned the country's political elite, the financial markets and British bookmakers, all of whom had expected a very close vote in favor of remaining in the European Union.

Instead, Britain now finds itself in uncharted waters, and looking for a new captain. Prime Minister David Cameron, just days after vowing that ""Britain never quits,"" says he'll be stepping down by October.

""I fought this campaign in the only way I know how, which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel, head, heart and soul,"" he said outside the prime minister's office at 10 Downing St.

""But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.""

Cameron will stay on as a caretaker, but said a new prime minister should be in place by the time his Conservative Party holds a party conference in October.

How are financial markets reacting?

The British pound plunged to 31-year lows, stock markets around the world churned, and the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, stepped forward to reassure markets and bankers that nothing will be changing immediately. He said the Bank of England has 250 billion pounds in assistance at the ready, and will take all necessary measures to maintain market stability.

How will the U.K. and the EU divorce?

The vote itself does not immediately remove Britain from the EU, which is based in Brussels. The British government must notify the EU of its intention to withdraw from the union, which will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, one of the EU's fundamental documents.

Article 50 envisions a two-year window to negotiate the terms of Britain's withdrawal, and to set in place whatever new agreements can be reached. There are provisions for extending the two-year period, if all members agree. Much remains unknown, as this has never happened before in the EU, which now has 28 members, including the U.K.

Cameron's announcement that he'll be gone within months suggests that this negotiating process won't begin in earnest until the fall.

Who are the winners and losers?

The biggest loser is Cameron, who just last year was being hailed for his electoral skills after bringing the Conservative Party a clear governing majority. Cameron decided to hold the EU referendum because he thought it would be a way of getting the Euro-skeptics in his own party to ""stop banging on about Europe,"" as he once said.

Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary College London University, said before the vote that ""it would be remarkable if someone who had taken the party back into power, then managed to win a majority against all odds, found himself kicked out within a year because he gambled on something he never wanted to do in the first place.""

That prediction is now coming to pass.

Other losers include Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was roundly criticized for his ""half-hearted"" support of remaining in the EU. Labour mobilized its resources fairly late in the game, and voters in many Labour strongholds cast ballots in large numbers in favor of the Brexit. Corbyn finds himself in the uncomfortable position of a pro-workers rights politician who's seen as out of touch with his rank and file.

(CNSNews.com) - President Donald Trump insulted the mayor of London as he arrived in England Monday morning for a three-day state visit.

In two tweets, written as Air Force One touched down, Trump wrote:

""Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly 'nasty' to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me'.""

Khan began the war of words with an op-ed in the Observer, calling Donald Trump ""one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat.""

Khan blamed Trump for stoking the rise of the ""far right"" around the world.

According to Khan:

Trump is seen as a figurehead of this global far-right movement. Through his words and actions, he has given comfort to far-right political leaders, and it’s no coincidence that his former campaign manager, Steve Bannon, has been touring the world, spreading hateful views and bolstering the far right wherever he goes. That’s why it’s so un-British to be rolling out the red carpet this week for a formal state visit for a president whose divisive behaviour flies in the face of the ideals America was founded upon – equality, liberty and religious freedom.

A Labour victory would have been a disaster for Britain ’ s economy and its standing in the world . Had Corbyn won , there would have been no guarantee of a successful Brexit , not least because the Labour leadership had fiercely opposed Britain leaving the European Union ahead of the UK ’ s 2016 referendum on EU membership .
The political uncertainty generated by this election must not derail the Brexit process . The Conservative government has pledged to deliver Brexit by the end of March 2019 , and negotiations with the European Union are due to formally begin on June 19 , with Britain ’ s negotiators seeking to ensure the best possible free trade deal with the EU .
If the Brexit negotiations are a success , Britain can emerge two years from now as a truly sovereign global power while maintaining strong economic and trading ties to European partners .
The British government will also need to negotiate a series of free trade agreements with partners across the world , from Canada and India to Australia and New Zealand . A free trade deal with the United States will be a top priority . Both the White House and Congress have already expressed strong support for such an agreement , which would advance prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic .
Brexit offers the promise of a revitalized Britain , one that is far better able to stand alongside the United States in the defense of the free world . Whatever the outcome from the hung parliament scenario , Britain ’ s leaders must guarantee that they will implement the will of the British people by ensuring that their nation completely leaves the European Union by the end of March 2019 .

A Labour victory would have been a disaster for Britain’s economy and its standing in the world. Had Corbyn won, there would have been no guarantee of a successful Brexit, not least because the Labour leadership had fiercely opposed Britain leaving the European Union ahead of the UK’s 2016 referendum on EU membership.

The political uncertainty generated by this election must not derail the Brexit process. The Conservative government has pledged to deliver Brexit by the end of March 2019, and negotiations with the European Union are due to formally begin on June 19, with Britain’s negotiators seeking to ensure the best possible free trade deal with the EU.

If the Brexit negotiations are a success, Britain can emerge two years from now as a truly sovereign global power while maintaining strong economic and trading ties to European partners.

The British government will also need to negotiate a series of free trade agreements with partners across the world, from Canada and India to Australia and New Zealand. A free trade deal with the United States will be a top priority. Both the White House and Congress have already expressed strong support for such an agreement, which would advance prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.

Brexit offers the promise of a revitalized Britain, one that is far better able to stand alongside the United States in the defense of the free world. Whatever the outcome from the hung parliament scenario, Britain’s leaders must guarantee that they will implement the will of the British people by ensuring that their nation completely leaves the European Union by the end of March 2019.

A Brexit Britain will be a powerful force for freedom and prosperity on the world stage, and a robust ally for the United States.",www.foxnews.com,right,kBa3lPjTA5c2xg31

His conflicting statements about the Savile scandal raised questions

He explains in a letter what he knew and when

The former director general of the BBC, in a letter to a British lawmaker, tried to explain what he knew about a journalistic investigation into claims of abuse by Jimmy Savile, a late children's TV presenter.

A slew of sexual abuse allegations against Savile, a BBC star and household name in Britain, have emerged over the past month. A second scandal broke with the news that the BBC show ""Newsnight"" had been investigating similar allegations but dropped the case in late 2011.

This week, Mark Thompson, who was director general of the BBC at the time of the ""Newsnight"" investigation, provided apparently conflicting statements on what he knew about the allegations and when.

""I was not notified or briefed about the 'Newsnight' investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation,"" Thompson said in a statement Monday. ""During my time as director general of the BBC, I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile.""

Thompson is now the incoming chief executive at the Times.

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50117284,Brexit: No 10 to push again for vote on Boris Johnson's deal,,,"MPs must be given `` a straight up-and-down vote '' on the PM 's Brexit deal later , No 10 says , but it is not clear whether the Speaker will allow it .
John Bercow is due to announce his decision at about 15:30 BST .
The PM tried to bring his deal to the Commons for a vote on Saturday , but his strategy was dealt a blow when MPs backed moves to delay approval instead .
The Speaker has previously ruled out repeatedly bringing back votes on the same matter more than once .
BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mr Bercow looked set to reject the PM 's demand .
Following Saturday 's special sitting , and under the Benn Act , Boris Johnson was forced to send a letter asking the EU for an extension to the Brexit date beyond 31 October - although he did not sign it .
Mr Johnson reached a new deal with the EU last week , but it needs to be approved by the UK Parliament - he wants MPs to say a clear `` yes '' or `` no '' to that on Monday afternoon .
The legislation which would implement Brexit - called the Withdrawal Agreement Bill ( WAB ) - will also be introduced on Monday and must begin the process of parliamentary scrutiny .
Labour 's shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has said his party will push for changes when the bill is brought to Parliament , for example , demanding a UK-wide customs union with the EU and single market alignment , and backing moves to put the deal to a referendum .
The DUP has so far refused to support Mr Johnson 's deal - and Labour has attempted to reach out to it - but the Northern Irish party 's chief whip , Jim Shannon , told Sky News a customs union was `` something that we can not support and will not support '' .
He said the party was meeting to discuss its strategy , but added : `` I believe that will be the stance we will have later on when we see the wording . ''
The prime minister 's spokesman has reiterated the government 's opposition to a customs union and another referendum , saying : `` Both of those have been voted on on a number of occasions in the House of Commons and neither have been successful . ''
The prime minister 's deal ditches the backstop - the controversial `` insurance policy '' designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border .
Instead it will , in effect , draw a new customs border in the Irish Sea , because goods which could then travel onwards to Ireland will have to pay a duty tax .
Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay told a Lords committee Northern Irish businesses would also have to complete export declarations to send any goods to the UK mainland .
The EU is now considering how to respond to the UK 's request for a delay , but BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said it was `` virtually impossible '' for MEPs to approve the deal at the European Parliament session this week as they would not sign it off until all necessary steps had been taken in the UK Parliament .
He said the Strasbourg parliament could hold a special session next week to approve the deal , but it was more likely they would do it at the next planned session on 13 November - meaning an extension would be needed .
On Saturday , instead of answering the question , `` Do you support the deal or not ? '' MPs effectively chose to change the question , backing the so-called Letwin amendment instead , which delays approval for the deal until the WAB is passed .
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said he `` very much hoped '' the Speaker would allow the government a second chance to get MPs to give a straightforward `` yes '' or `` no '' .
`` What the Oliver Letwin amendment did is mean that Parliament has n't given its explicit positive support for the deal , '' Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
`` It was an observation on the deal happening and I think what people need is a substantive vote . ''
Former Conservative minister , now independent MP , Justine Greening said the proper process through Parliament had to be followed in order for the WAB - a `` huge bill '' - to be given sufficient scrutiny .
`` We all know that rushed law is bad law , this is the political rewiring of our country and it has to be done properly , '' she told the BBC .
But Mr Sunak said : `` The substance of the withdrawal agreement has been public for a very long time , the bits that have changed - the backstop and the political declaration - were published last week .
`` Parliament has shown time and time again ... an ability to move very quickly when it wants to . We can sit late sit , at weekends . And that 's of course what we should do . ''
A straight vote on the deal today seems unlikely because the government did n't pull the vote on Saturday - they walked away from it . So , theoretically , the Commons did give a view on the issue , and it ca n't be asked to give a different one today - let 's see .
The government is desperate to have a vote on the whole shebang as soon as possible to show momentum , before getting into days of scrutiny where MPs will try to make changes to the deal .
That 's not just because they are worried about losing more votes - this government has barely won any - but because if MPs make any major changes to the legislation , then it might mean PM has to go back to EU and ask for a different deal - you can imagine how much No 10 wants that .
It also , of course , eats up time , making it harder and harder as the hours tick by for the government to be able to stick to the 31 October deadline - still not impossible , but looking increasingly unlikely .
If the WAB ends up not getting through or being changed , there is very little chance the government will be able to avoid a delay , so the smart bet is that No 10 will just go back to pushing very hard for an election .
Once a delay is agreed , it will be hard for opposition parties to block one - lots of individual MPs do n't want it , but the government is prepared to hold a vote of no confidence in itself , or go for a simple majority vote if they ca n't get it through under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 's two-thirds bar .
The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM 's Brexit deal that will take the country out of the EU - in UK law .
It has to secure the backing of a majority of MPs - and then of peers in the House of Lords . And a vote for the Brexit deal itself is no guarantee of a vote for the legislation required to implement it .
The bill gives legal effect to the withdrawal deal , as well as any agreed transition period , and fulfils requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit . It will also allow ministers to make `` divorce payments '' to the EU foreseen under the current deal .
MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill .
If the government can not get the bill through Parliament the default legal position is that the UK can not ratify the deal , and so would leave on 31 October without a deal . However , that is dependent on no extension beyond that date having been already agreed with the EU .
Passing the Letwin amendment meant the Benn Act was triggered because Parliament had not approved a deal - or approved no-deal - by the law 's 19 October deadline .
That meant Mr Johnson had to send an extension request to Brussels , which he did , but left it unsigned - and accompanied it with a second , signed letter which said he believed a delay would be a mistake .
On Sunday , ministers insisted the government believed it still had sufficient support in the Commons to pass the deal and remained committed to a 31 October departure .

'Substantive vote'

On Saturday, instead of answering the question, ""Do you support the deal or not?"" MPs effectively chose to change the question, backing the so-called Letwin amendment instead, which delays approval for the deal until the WAB is passed.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said he ""very much hoped"" the Speaker would allow the government a second chance to get MPs to give a straightforward ""yes"" or ""no"".

What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?

The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal that will take the country out of the EU - in UK law.

It has to secure the backing of a majority of MPs - and then of peers in the House of Lords. And a vote for the Brexit deal itself is no guarantee of a vote for the legislation required to implement it.

The bill gives legal effect to the withdrawal deal, as well as any agreed transition period, and fulfils requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. It will also allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal.

MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill.

If the government cannot get the bill through Parliament the default legal position is that the UK cannot ratify the deal, and so would leave on 31 October without a deal. However, that is dependent on no extension beyond that date having been already agreed with the EU.

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47704451,"Brexit options 'narrowing', says health secretary",,,"The options for Brexit `` are narrowing '' , Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said , after MPs voted to seize control of the parliamentary timetable .
The PM was dealt a fresh blow as the government was defeated by 27 votes on Monday , on a plan designed to find out the kind of deal MPs would support .
Mr Hancock said the government would listen to MPs but `` ca n't pre-commit to following whatever they vote for '' .
He told Radio 4 's Today programme that the Commons had rejected no deal and a second referendum , and urged MPs to back the PM 's Brexit deal .
Jacob Rees-Mogg , chairman of the Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs the European Research Group ( ERG ) , is among the group of pro-Brexit MPs who the prime minister has been trying to persuade to back her deal .
On his ConservativeHome podcast , he said : `` I have always thought that no deal is better than Mrs May 's deal , but Mrs May 's deal is better than not leaving at all . ''
Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive How did my MP vote on 25 March ? Enter a postcode , or the name or constituency of your MP Seat vacant
But the Democratic Unionists , whose 10 MPs prop up Mrs May 's government , urged Tory Brexiteers to continue to `` stand firm '' in their opposition to the prime minister 's deal unless there were `` significant changes '' .
Their Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson suggested extending negotiations by a year was preferable to accepting the deal on offer as this would allow the UK to `` have a say on the things which affect us during that time '' .
`` Surely this is a better strategy than volunteering to be locked into the prison of the withdrawal deal with the cell door key in the pocket of Michel Barnier , '' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph .
On Monday night , MPs voted in favour of Conservative backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin 's cross-party amendment , which will allow MPs to put forward motions relating to Brexit - most likely a series of so-called indicative votes .
Because of this , MPs will be able to vote on a number of options on Wednesday - likely to include a `` softer Brexit '' , a customs union with the EU and another referendum - designed to test the will of Parliament to see what , if anything , commands a majority .
Richard Harrington , Alistair Burt and Steve Brine resigned to join the rebels , with Mr Harrington accusing the government of `` playing roulette with the lives and livelihoods '' of Britons .
The prime minister said she was `` sceptical '' about the process - as it was not guaranteed to produce a majority for any one course of action - and she would not commit the government to abiding by the result .
`` The votes could lead to an outcome that is un-negotiable with the EU , '' she told MPs .
Mr Hancock told Today : `` In the previous votes there have been a multitude of potential different options - the sorts of options , like a second referendum , which I think would be a bad idea , that 's been rejected .
`` The idea of having a no deal…the Commons is absolutely clear it wo n't allow and will legislate against it if necessary . That means that the options are narrowing . ''
Commons Speaker John Bercow said Sir Oliver Letwin will table a business motion at 16:00 GMT and MPs will have until the end of Tuesday to put forward matters for consideration under indicative votes .
The exact method of indicative voting will be debated on Wednesday , Mr Bercow said .
When asked if the prime minister will abide by the indicative votes , Mr Hancock said it was important for the government to listen to MPs .
`` But we ca n't pre-commit to following whatever they vote for , because they might vote for something that is completely impractical , '' he said .
But Labour 's Hilary Benn said MPs have to take responsibility for the Brexit process .
Mr Benn , chairman of the Commons Exiting the European Union Committee , told the Today programme : `` If the government is n't going to do its job then Parliament is going to have to take responsibility , and that is what we are doing on Wednesday . ''
So , is the EU jumping up and down with glee at the prospect of indicative votes in Westminster on Wednesday ?
For months , even years now , Brussels has been urging the UK to `` tell us what you want , want you really , really want ! '' And yet there is no sudden outbreak of Brexit joy across the Channel .
EU governments know well enough by now that Wednesday 's votes may not end up providing a clear picture of Brexit .
Even if they did , European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will point out that the EU 's only `` interlocutor '' - or opposite number - remains Her Majesty 's government , led by Theresa May , and not UK MPs .
Would she be willing to shuttle as a go-between on behalf of Parliament , which has chosen to ignore her negotiated Brexit deal ? Not likely .
Mr Burt , who resigned as Foreign Office minister on Monday night , said in a statement that he had opted to defy the whip `` for the country 's sake '' .
He said the UK was `` running out of time '' to find an alternative and added that Parliament should seek other options without the instruction of party whips and the government `` should adopt any feasible outcome as its own '' .
Mr Brine , who quit as a health minister , said he believed the PM 's deal was the `` best of the options '' and for those who do not like the deal `` maybe they will realise that the House of Commons is prepared to act and anything from here , as far as they 're concerned , gets softer '' .
Tuesday : Theresa May has a meeting of her cabinet . Tuesday had been considered as a possible day for the so-called third meaningful vote on Mrs May 's withdrawal deal . But , on Monday , the PM said the deal did not have enough support to get through the Commons `` as things stand '' .

The options for Brexit ""are narrowing"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said, after MPs voted to seize control of the parliamentary timetable.

The PM was dealt a fresh blow as the government was defeated by 27 votes on Monday, on a plan designed to find out the kind of deal MPs would support.

Thirty Conservative MPs rebelled, including three ministers.

Mr Hancock said the government would listen to MPs but ""can't pre-commit to following whatever they vote for"".

He told Radio 4's Today programme that the Commons had rejected no deal and a second referendum, and urged MPs to back the PM's Brexit deal.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs the European Research Group (ERG), is among the group of pro-Brexit MPs who the prime minister has been trying to persuade to back her deal.

On his ConservativeHome podcast, he said: ""I have always thought that no deal is better than Mrs May's deal, but Mrs May's deal is better than not leaving at all.""

But the Democratic Unionists, whose 10 MPs prop up Mrs May's government, urged Tory Brexiteers to continue to ""stand firm"" in their opposition to the prime minister's deal unless there were ""significant changes"".

Their Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson suggested extending negotiations by a year was preferable to accepting the deal on offer as this would allow the UK to ""have a say on the things which affect us during that time"".

""Surely this is a better strategy than volunteering to be locked into the prison of the withdrawal deal with the cell door key in the pocket of Michel Barnier,"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

Ministerial resignations

On Monday night, MPs voted in favour of Conservative backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin's cross-party amendment, which will allow MPs to put forward motions relating to Brexit - most likely a series of so-called indicative votes.

Because of this, MPs will be able to vote on a number of options on Wednesday - likely to include a ""softer Brexit"", a customs union with the EU and another referendum - designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority.

Richard Harrington, Alistair Burt and Steve Brine resigned to join the rebels, with Mr Harrington accusing the government of ""playing roulette with the lives and livelihoods"" of Britons.

The prime minister said she was ""sceptical"" about the process - as it was not guaranteed to produce a majority for any one course of action - and she would not commit the government to abiding by the result.

""The votes could lead to an outcome that is un-negotiable with the EU,"" she told MPs.

Mr Hancock told Today: ""In the previous votes there have been a multitude of potential different options - the sorts of options, like a second referendum, which I think would be a bad idea, that's been rejected.

""The idea of having a no deal…the Commons is absolutely clear it won't allow and will legislate against it if necessary. That means that the options are narrowing.""

What is the voting process?

Commons Speaker John Bercow said Sir Oliver Letwin will table a business motion at 16:00 GMT and MPs will have until the end of Tuesday to put forward matters for consideration under indicative votes.

The exact method of indicative voting will be debated on Wednesday, Mr Bercow said.

When asked if the prime minister will abide by the indicative votes, Mr Hancock said it was important for the government to listen to MPs.

""But we can't pre-commit to following whatever they vote for, because they might vote for something that is completely impractical,"" he said.

But Labour's Hilary Benn said MPs have to take responsibility for the Brexit process.

Mr Benn, chairman of the Commons Exiting the European Union Committee, told the Today programme: ""If the government isn't going to do its job then Parliament is going to have to take responsibility, and that is what we are doing on Wednesday.""

No EU joy over new Brexit votes

So, is the EU jumping up and down with glee at the prospect of indicative votes in Westminster on Wednesday?

For months, even years now, Brussels has been urging the UK to ""tell us what you want, want you really, really want!"" And yet there is no sudden outbreak of Brexit joy across the Channel.

EU governments know well enough by now that Wednesday's votes may not end up providing a clear picture of Brexit.

Even if they did, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will point out that the EU's only ""interlocutor"" - or opposite number - remains Her Majesty's government, led by Theresa May, and not UK MPs.

Would she be willing to shuttle as a go-between on behalf of Parliament, which has chosen to ignore her negotiated Brexit deal? Not likely.

Mr Burt, who resigned as Foreign Office minister on Monday night, said in a statement that he had opted to defy the whip ""for the country's sake"".

He said the UK was ""running out of time"" to find an alternative and added that Parliament should seek other options without the instruction of party whips and the government ""should adopt any feasible outcome as its own"".

Mr Brine, who quit as a health minister, said he believed the PM's deal was the ""best of the options"" and for those who do not like the deal ""maybe they will realise that the House of Commons is prepared to act and anything from here, as far as they're concerned, gets softer"".

What's happening this week?

Tuesday: Theresa May has a meeting of her cabinet. Tuesday had been considered as a possible day for the so-called third meaningful vote on Mrs May's withdrawal deal. But, on Monday, the PM said the deal did not have enough support to get through the Commons ""as things stand"".

Wednesday: This is when indicative votes would be held - we don't know yet whether MPs will be free to vote how they want or be directed along party lines. The prime minister is also due to address the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. MPs will also vote on changing the Brexit date in UK law from 29 March.

Thursday: A possible opportunity for meaningful vote three. The prime minister may hope that Brexiteers will finally decide to throw their weight behind her deal.

Friday: This is written into law as the day the UK leaves the EU, although the PM has said she will pass legislation this week to remove it. The earliest Brexit is likely to happen is now 12 April.

Parliament will also be asked to vote on Wednesday on a law postponing the Brexit date from 29 March.

Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the amended legislation would include two potential exit dates - 12 April and 22 May - depending on whether the withdrawal agreement was passed by the end of 29 March.

MPs involved in the bid on Monday night say if there is a majority for a plan that's not the prime minister's deal then there would be ""uproar"" if Theresa May tried to ignore it.

It is possible, of course, that Brexiteers who have been resisting the prime minister's deal so far take fright at Parliament having more control of the process, and are more likely to come in line.

That's because, generally, the make-up of MPs are more likely to back a softer deal than the one on offer.

So faced with the choice of Theresa May's compromise this week, or a much longer wrangle to a closer relationship with the EU than the prime minister has negotiated, it is not impossible that the numbers will move in her favour.

Can Boris Johnson win the vote?

The winning post for votes in the House of Commons is 320 if everyone turns up - seven Sinn Fein MPs don't sit and the Speaker and three deputies don't vote.

There are currently 287 voting Conservative MPs. The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them.

Then, if the DUP won't support his deal, he'll need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all.

This time it's likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal.

What is in the deal?

Most of the deal is the same as the one agreed by Theresa May last year - the main change is the Northern Ireland proposal.

The UK will continue to abide by EU rules until the end of 2020, and possibly longer, to allow businesses to adjust

The UK will still pay an estimated £33bn ""divorce bill""

Northern Ireland will be aligned to the EU single market

Northern Ireland will instead remain a part of the UK's customs territory, so it will be included in any future trade deals struck by the government after Brexit

The DUP's objections

In a statement, the Democratic Unionists said Northern Ireland's main East-West trade route would still be subject to EU customs rules, ""notwithstanding that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK customs territory"".

""All goods would be subject to a customs check regime regardless of their final destination,"" the statement added, and the plan for a joint EU/UK committee would give the EU a ""veto"" on which goods would be exempt from tariffs or not.

""This is not acceptable within the internal borders of the United Kingdom,"" the DUP said.

That could trigger the Benn Act, forcing a lengthy delay, and could encourage some opposition MP to trigger a motion of no confidence, paving the way for a general election.

It's going to be a titanic tussle on Saturday.

The seat of Houghton and Sunderland South in northeast England was the first to complete the traditional election-night ritual: Votes in each of the 650 constituencies are counted by hand and the candidates — each wearing a bright rosette in the color of their party — line up onstage as a returning officer reads out the results. Houghton and Sunderland South went to Labour, as expected.

Among the early Scottish National Party winners was 20-year-old student Mhairi Black, who becomes Britain's youngest lawmaker since the 17th century. She defeated Douglas Alexander, Labour's 47-year-old foreign policy spokesman and one of the party's most senior figures. Black is the youngest lawmaker since Christopher Monck entered Parliament in 1667 at age 13.

The UK Independence Party ran third in opinion polls, but the exit poll predicted it would win just two seats because its support isn't concentrated in specific areas. Leader Nigel Farage has said he will resign if he does not win the seat of Thanet South — an outcome that looked a distinct possibility.

Britain's economy — recovering after years of turmoil that followed the 2008 financial crisis — was at the core of many voters' concerns. The results suggest that many heeded Cameron's entreaties to back the Conservatives as the party of financial stability.

Public questions at television debates made plain that many voters distrusted politicians' promises to safeguard the economy, protect the National Health Service from severe cutbacks and control the number of immigrants from eastern Europe.

In Whitechapel, one of London's poorest communities, voters struggling in the wake of the worst recession since the 1930s wanted a change in leadership.

""The first priority is the economy, the second one is creating more jobs, and the third is living expenses — they're going higher and higher,"" said Shariq ul-Islam, a 24-year-old student.

Just a few minutes away in the City of London, the traditional financial district where many bankers earn enormous salaries, Christopher Gardner, a 34-year-old finance industry official, put his trust in the Conservatives.

""There are some issues that have been caused by austerity previously,"" he said. ""They're the only people that I'm confident will resolve that.""

Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said Churchill , Britain 's leader for most of World War II , would say in response to Wednesday 's action , `` 'What is happening ? I was always in favor of a European future for my country . ' He would criticize it a lot . ''
Thatcher , too , despite her long-running feuds with the EU during the 1980s to pay less and get more in return , was at heart a pro-European , he said in an interview with The Associated Press .
Verhofstadt , who will be closely involved in the exit negotiations as the main representative of the European Parliament , insisted that May 's six-page letter triggering the talks carried an underlying message of regret .
`` You ask yourself , after you have read the letter 'Why is Britain going outside the European Union ? ' Because in every chapter , in every chapter of the letter she defends the European Union and : 'Oh , it was so good , but OK , we have to go out . ' ''
The European Parliament itself put out strong negotiating lines Wednesday , which are closely aligned to the tack chief negotiator EU Michel Barnier is expected to take .
Although Verhofstadt technically will be subordinate to Barnier during the talks expected to start around the end of May , he represents the veto power of the legislature .
`` If the outcome of the negotiations is not in conformity with the points and conditions we have made public today , yeah , then we will use our veto power , it is clear , '' he said .
EU officials and leaders of many member nations have made it clear that the first priority will be finding agreement on the future rights of the 3 million EU citizens living in Britain and the 1 million Britons living elsewhere in the bloc .
Verhofstadt hopes to have that issue settled by the end of the year to provide clarity for those 4 million people . A residency agreement could be sealed off as a done deal before it would need to be rubber-stamped as part of the overall withdrawal package , he said .

Will all kinds of national and parliamentary approvals needed , he thinks it would be impossible .
Instead , Verhofstadt thinks it 's likely there will be an extended transition period of `` I do n't know , two , three , four years — we say no more than three years — to discuss , to detail the content of this future relationship . ''
Since British voters approved the referendum to leave the EU in June , Verhofstadt senses the pendulum swinging back on the continent to appreciation for the union 's merits .

“ I have done my best , ” May said in a speech outside 10 Downing St. , as close aides and her husband Philip looked on , before acknowledging that it was not good enough .
Concluding her remarks , she struggled to contain her emotions and her voice broke as she expressed “ enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love . ”

“I have done my best,” May said in a speech outside 10 Downing St., as close aides and her husband Philip looked on, before acknowledging that it was not good enough.

Concluding her remarks, she struggled to contain her emotions and her voice broke as she expressed “enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.”

Then she turned and strode through the famous black door of No. 10.

May will stay on as a caretaker prime minister until the new leader is chosen, a process the Conservatives aim to complete by late July. The new party leader will become prime minister without the need for a general election.

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47715933,Brexit: MPs prepare for votes in bid to break deadlock,,,"MPs are awaiting the results of votes on eight different proposals for the future of Brexit .
Options they are considering include leaving without a deal , a customs union and a confirmatory referendum .
Speaker John Bercow will announce what support there is for each later after MPs took over the Commons timetable .
Theresa May has promised to stand down as prime minister if her own deal is approved , prompting several Tory Brexiteers to say they will back it .
Meanwhile , MPs have approved the legislation required to change the date of Brexit from 29 March - after the EU agreed to give the UK an extension last week .
Friday had long been the day written into law for the UK to leave the EU but the Commons approved a statutory instrument - by 441 votes to 105 - changing the deadline to 22 May if a withdrawal agreement is passed this week ; or 12 April if it is not .
The prime minister is still trying to drum up support for her withdrawal agreement despite it being voted down by a large margin twice and the DUP saying they still can not vote for it .
The government is seeking the support of MPs for the Commons to convene on Friday , if necessary , amid reports a third vote on the PM 's deal could be held then .

MPs are awaiting the results of votes on eight different proposals for the future of Brexit.

Options they are considering include leaving without a deal, a customs union and a confirmatory referendum.

Speaker John Bercow will announce what support there is for each later after MPs took over the Commons timetable.

Theresa May has promised to stand down as prime minister if her own deal is approved, prompting several Tory Brexiteers to say they will back it.

Meanwhile, MPs have approved the legislation required to change the date of Brexit from 29 March - after the EU agreed to give the UK an extension last week.

Friday had long been the day written into law for the UK to leave the EU but the Commons approved a statutory instrument - by 441 votes to 105 - changing the deadline to 22 May if a withdrawal agreement is passed this week; or 12 April if it is not.

The prime minister is still trying to drum up support for her withdrawal agreement despite it being voted down by a large margin twice and the DUP saying they still cannot vote for it.

The government is seeking the support of MPs for the Commons to convene on Friday, if necessary, amid reports a third vote on the PM's deal could be held then.

But Mr Bercow reiterated his earlier warnings that the PM's deal could not come back for a vote if it had not significantly changed.

He said the government ""should not seek to circumvent my ruling"" by introducing procedures that could reverse his judgement.

But a Downing Street spokesman said there had been a ""significant development"" at the summit in Brussels last week, after Mrs May agreed ""extra reassurances"" over the Irish backstop with the EU, and the date of exit had changed.

MPs are currently voting on a statutory instrument to confirm a delay, after the UK was given until 12 April to propose a different way forward if the current agreement cannot get through Parliament and until 22 May to finalise Brexit if the deal is passed.

Earlier on Wednesday, MPs took control of parliamentary business from the government for several hours as they attempt to find a majority for the next steps in the Brexit process.

Bercow's intervention versus May's deal

Never afraid of stoking controversy, the Speaker has again infuriated many Tory MPs with his latest surprise pronouncement to the Commons.

Just as it seemed the government was poised to try and get its Brexit deal through again, John Bercow took it upon himself to tick ministers off before they had even tried.

Why? Because last week he ruled the deal could not be brought back to the Commons for a third time without ""substantial"" changes.

No 10 will only bring the deal back for a third vote if it thinks it could pass. That probably requires DUP backing and a guarantee some Labour MPs will vote for it too.

As it stands, there isn't yet a majority for the deal, but the mood is shifting fast.

What options are MPs voting on?

Groups have put forward different options for the UK's future relationship with the EU, with several based on the assumption Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU will be approved - albeit with changes to the controversial Northern Ireland backstop.

Several MPs, including Tory Michael Fabricant and Lib Dem Jo Swinson, posted images of their forms on social media.

How are MPs likely to vote?

Conservative MPs were given a free vote, meaning they were able to support or reject any proposal without pressure from party whips. Cabinet ministers will be abstaining.

The decision followed warnings that more than a dozen ministers might quit if they were told they had to follow party orders.

Labour MPs are being whipped to support the party's own proposal, as well as motions on a customs union, Common Market 2.0 and a confirmatory public ballot.

Mr Starmer told the Commons any deal ""needs further democratic approval"" before being enacted.

And the economic system isn’t fair.” “Is there a feeling that being part of the E.U. is directly responsible for some of that?” “Yes, because we were contributing 10 billion pounds a year, which is quite a lot of money.” Paul is talking about a membership fee that the U.K. pays to be a part of the E.U. “Where is the money going? What are they doing with it?” The answer? It’s complicated. Benefits sometimes come back home in indirect ways. Take Liverpool, 60 miles south. In 2008, the E.U. named it European Capital of Culture. That brought in millions of visitors, who brought in millions of pounds. “The city has just transformed itself. And I think because of that, that opportunity within the city is much greater. I think it inspires people to become something that they want to become.” Poppy, like the majority of young people, voted against Brexit. Now, she’s joined a new movement that’s pushing for a second referendum, with an option to remain in the E.U. They call it a “people’s vote.” This effort is hard to miss, even in regions that voted heavily for Brexit. Like here, in County Durham, in the northeast of England. “Richard, and then Jamie.” “People have every right to change their minds when presented with fresh facts, with new evidence and with a greater sense of certainty about what Brexit means.” “The people voted for Brexit because they are disenfranchised as a whole. The political system is broken.” “My personal view is that we now know what Brexit looks like. We didn’t two and a half years ago.” “Democracy isn’t a static, one-off event in time. Democracy is a process.” A messy one, it seems, at least for the moment, where all sides say they feel cheated. “We had the ‘people’s vote’ on the 23rd of June, 2016. I knew what I was voting for. If other people didn’t know what they were voting for, it’s because they didn’t do their homework. We were asked if we wanted to leave. We said ‘yes.’ The government seems to be going completely against the will of the people. They need to listen to us.” [applause] “The will of the people can change. The will of the people has changed. The will of the people cannot be undermined by a vote of the people.” “Because the people are ultimately sovereign. That’s what democracy is all about.” In an attempt to settle a question, the E.U. referendum has unsettled a nation. “Brexit means exit. Brexit means exit. Brexit means exit. Brexit means exit — are you listening, Mrs. May? Are you listening?”",www.nytimes.com,left,c9DoSpsZdCfFcYY5

Speaking to Britain ’ s Sunday Telegraph , Eurosceptic and counter-Islamification campaigner Mr. Wilders said Britain would lead by example by voting to leave the European Union , and in doing so would “ liberate Europe ” for the second time in a century , making clear reference to Britain ’ s key role in resisting German expansionism during the Second World War .
Mr. Wilders said : “ Like in the 1940s , once again Britain could help liberate Europe from another totalitarian monster , this time called ‘ Brussels ’ . Again , we could be saved by the British… If people see that a country can leave , and the lights do not go out , there is not a war , and a country does not go bankrupt , but even flourishes . If Britain proves that this theory can become a reality , it would have an enormous effect . ”
Several countries are thought to be likely candidates for similar referendums to Britain , should she succeed in her bid to break free from the Union . Austria and Poland are thought to be possibilities , and Mr. Wilders added the Netherlands to the list .
Speaking of the ‘ Patriotic Spring ’ coming in Europe , a reaction to the authoritarian and undemocratic European Union , Mr. Wilders said the “ genie ” of populist , pro-freedom politics was “ now out of the bottle ” .
Mr. Wilders leads the Netherland ’ s Party for Freedom , and frequently uses the metaphor of spring blossoming to describe an awakening interest in the West in self-determinism , freedom , and national identity . His party consistently tops the polls in Holland , yet the other parties in parliament , both mainstream and alternative , shun him as a pariah and have sworn to keep him out of government even if he forms the largest party at next year ’ s elections .
Writing exclusively for Breitbart earlier this year , he hailed a ‘ Patriotic Spring ’ and drew comparisons to 1980s Communist Europe , when “ Poland struggled to be Poland ” . Mr. Wilders wrote he saw the same thing happening in Europe and the United States again today .
On the spreading discontent with the centralisation of political authority in Brussels , Mr. Wilders said yesterday the Eastern European states were most sensitive to totalitarianism , having only recently liberated themselves . He remarked :
“ The eastern Europeans have already experienced what it is like to live under totalitarianism , they know what Moscow rule meant . Nobody knows that better than the Poles , the Czechs the Slovaks and the Hungarians .
“ So they know , when they see another totalitarian monster – this time it ’ s dressed up a little differently ; this time it ’ s called Brussels instead of Moscow – but it still wants to take their national sovereignty and identity and change their country . And people are saying : ‘ enough is enough ’ . ”
Brexit isn ’ t the only forthcoming political event Mr. Wilders has a keen eye on . Citizens of Austria voted yesterday to elect a new president , in a straight run-off between a left-Green candidate and right-wing populist Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer .
The latest counts last night showed the pair perfectly matched at 50 per cent each , with just the postal votes to count this morning . Mr. Wilders said of the contest :
“ Just like a Brexit , a Freedom Party victory would be an enormous incentive for people all over Europe to see that we are not parties on the fringe of politics , that we are not only the biggest party in respective countries but even provide the head of state , the elected President .
“ It ’ s a reality and you ’ d better face it and deal with it . This will be the future in many European countries ” .
Mr. Wilders ’ remarks echo those he made in an exclusive interview with Breitbart London last year . When asked on his thoughts about the British referendum on the European Union — at that point still 18 months away — Mr. Wilders said :
“ I am inspired by the British referendum , and I hope it will inspire the rest of Europe when Britain votes to leave the European Union . You are lucky enough to be out of the Eurozone – in Holland we have had billions in austerity measures , taxes being raised , just to pay for the countries in Southern Europe who are unwilling to raise taxes . It is a wealth transfer union .
“ The European project has very little support outside of the political elite . Holland is like the United Kingdom , with so many laws coming from the European Union instead of our parliament or cabinet . Europe should be a continent of nation states who are free trading , with our own identities , not a bunch of Eurocrats nobody voted for .

The prime minister , who will also not attend , said he wants to “ get on with delivering the priorities of the British people . ”

Parliamentary Labour Party meets this evening for the first time since its comprehensive election defeat , with candidates to replace leader Jeremy Corbyn already jostling for position
The City of London warned against a hasty Brexit agreement that could damage services -- which make up about 80 % of the U.K. economy .
“ The December 2020 deadline is ambitious and it is critical the services sector is not sacrificed in the rush to get a deal ” said Catherine McGuinness , policy chief at the City of London Corporation , which administers the financial district . “ This is just the beginning of the Brexit process . ”
The future framework deal with the EU must focus on “ securing maximum market access and developing a structure for the U.K. economy to prosper in the years ahead , ” she said .
Boris Johnson said he wants a “ new and generous ” spirit of cross-party cooperation as he pledged to get Brexit out of the way and concentrate on the U.K. ’ s domestic priorities .
“ We are going to be able to get on with delivering the priorities of the British people , ” the premier told the House of Commons . “ After three-and-a-half years of wrangling and division , we in this government will do whatever we can to reach out across this House to find common ground , to heal the divisions of our country and to find a new and generous spirit in which we conduct all our political dealings . ”
Johnson also said Parliament “ should resist the calls of those who would break up the United Kingdom , ” a reference to calls ( see 2:45 p.m. ) from the Scottish National Party for a second referendum on Scottish independence .
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reiterated her plan to demand the right to hold another independence referendum .
“ This is a watershed moment for Scotland , ” Sturgeon told lawmakers in Edinburgh on Tuesday . “ So this week I will take the next steps to secure Scotland ’ s right to choose . ”
Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she will submit a so-called Section 30 request for the transfer of power with the aim of holding a referendum in 2020 . After her Scottish National Party won 48 of the 59 seats in Scotland in last week ’ s election , Sturgeon has said she has the mandate for another vote on breaking away from the rest of the U.K. in the wake of Brexit .
There ’ s support from business for Boris Johnson ’ s decision to explicitly rule out in legislation any chance of an extension to the Brexit transition phase beyond the end of 2020 .
“ Business has had enough of uncertainty and shares the prime minister ’ s ambition for a fast EU trade deal , ” Carolyn Fairbairn , Director-General of the country ’ s biggest business lobby , the Confederation of British Industry , said in a statement . “ Speed and ambition can go hand in hand if the right approach is taken . There ’ s no time to lose , with a top priority being to build a best-in-class trade architecture , with business round the table , enabling EU trade talks to begin early in the new year . ”
Barry Gardiner , Labour ’ s trade spokesman , told ███ Radio he thinks the party ’ s next leader should be a woman and suggested she should be from the Midlands or Northern England -- a verdict that would rule out two potential candidates , the party ’ s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer , who ’ s one of the favorites , and its foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry , whose constituency is in London .
“ I think it is natural that it should be a woman , ” Gardiner said , before adding it ’ s important that it should be someone from “ those northern towns , the midlands , the industrial heartlands ” that have traditionally voted Labour . “ There are many , many women in our party from those areas where we can see leadership potential , ” he said .
Gardiner , who was born in Scotland though represents a London constituency in Parliament , said he ’ s “ not made any decision whatsoever ” as to whether he will stand for leader or deputy leader .

Boris Johnson issued a strong message that his government will remain focused on Brexit by banning his ministers from attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next month. The prime minister, who will also not attend, said he wants to “get on with delivering the priorities of the British people.”

City Warns Over Rush to Deal (3:45 p.m.)

The City of London warned against a hasty Brexit agreement that could damage services -- which make up about 80% of the U.K. economy.

“The December 2020 deadline is ambitious and it is critical the services sector is not sacrificed in the rush to get a deal” said Catherine McGuinness, policy chief at the City of London Corporation, which administers the financial district. “This is just the beginning of the Brexit process.”

The future framework deal with the EU must focus on “securing maximum market access and developing a structure for the U.K. economy to prosper in the years ahead,” she said.

Johnson Calls for Divisions to be Healed (3:15 p.m.)

Boris Johnson said he wants a “new and generous” spirit of cross-party cooperation as he pledged to get Brexit out of the way and concentrate on the U.K.’s domestic priorities.

“We are going to be able to get on with delivering the priorities of the British people,” the premier told the House of Commons. “After three-and-a-half years of wrangling and division, we in this government will do whatever we can to reach out across this House to find common ground, to heal the divisions of our country and to find a new and generous spirit in which we conduct all our political dealings.”

Johnson also said Parliament “should resist the calls of those who would break up the United Kingdom,” a reference to calls (see 2:45 p.m.) from the Scottish National Party for a second referendum on Scottish independence.

Sturgeon Calls for Scottish Referendum (2:45 p.m.)

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reiterated her plan to demand the right to hold another independence referendum.

“This is a watershed moment for Scotland,” Sturgeon told lawmakers in Edinburgh on Tuesday. “So this week I will take the next steps to secure Scotland’s right to choose.”

Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she will submit a so-called Section 30 request for the transfer of power with the aim of holding a referendum in 2020. After her Scottish National Party won 48 of the 59 seats in Scotland in last week’s election, Sturgeon has said she has the mandate for another vote on breaking away from the rest of the U.K. in the wake of Brexit.

Business Lobby Supports Ban on Brexit Extension (2 p.m.)

There’s support from business for Boris Johnson’s decision to explicitly rule out in legislation any chance of an extension to the Brexit transition phase beyond the end of 2020.

“Business has had enough of uncertainty and shares the prime minister’s ambition for a fast EU trade deal,” Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General of the country’s biggest business lobby, the Confederation of British Industry, said in a statement. “Speed and ambition can go hand in hand if the right approach is taken. There’s no time to lose, with a top priority being to build a best-in-class trade architecture, with business round the table, enabling EU trade talks to begin early in the new year.”

Gardiner: Next Labour Leader Should Be Woman (1:25 p.m.)

Barry Gardiner, Labour’s trade spokesman, told Bloomberg Radio he thinks the party’s next leader should be a woman and suggested she should be from the Midlands or Northern England -- a verdict that would rule out two potential candidates, the party’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer, who’s one of the favorites, and its foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry, whose constituency is in London.

“I think it is natural that it should be a woman,” Gardiner said, before adding it’s important that it should be someone from “those northern towns, the midlands, the industrial heartlands” that have traditionally voted Labour. “There are many, many women in our party from those areas where we can see leadership potential,” he said.

Gardiner, who was born in Scotland though represents a London constituency in Parliament, said he’s “not made any decision whatsoever” as to whether he will stand for leader or deputy leader.

EU Warns of Brexit Cliff-Edge (1 p.m.)

Lidington stressed that it was unacceptable for Russia to fail to honor a formal request to extradite Lugovoi .
The findings related to Putin -- even if his involvement is viewed as probable rather than definitively proved -- will offer some comfort to Litvinenko 's widow , Marina . She said outside the High Court on Thursday she was `` pleased that the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr. Putin of his murder have been proved true in an English court . ''
In an interview later in the day with CNN , she accused Putin of direct involvement .
`` Putin himself personally protected Lugovoi . He himself , '' she said . `` He provided his immunity . ... He protected him . He grant him to be a member of parliament . It means he took all this responsibility . ''
Litvinenko was a former Russian security agent who came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistleblower on the FSB , the successor agency to the KGB , the former Soviet secret police and intelligence agency .

In Owen 's report , he quotes a Russian saying , `` There is no such thing as a former KGB man . ''
After leaving the FSB , Litvinenko blamed the service for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia 's invasion of Chechnya later that year .
All or any of the above may have been sufficient reason to kill a man seen by his former FSB colleagues as a traitor -- a man who once even published an article , cited in Owen 's report , that accused Putin of being a pedophile .
In a deathbed statement , read to the media by a friend , Litvinenko blamed Putin for ordering his poisoning , saying the rare radioactive substance polonium-210 was slipped into his tea at a meeting with the two suspects in Mayfair in 2006 .
He said : `` You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate , Mr. Putin , in your ears for the rest of your life . ''
The Kremlin has always denied the accusation , as did Lugovoi and Kovtun , whom the Russian government refuses to extradite to Britain . But the Kremlin 's case is n't helped by the compelling evidence against it .

''","London (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin probably approved the operation by Russian agents to kill former FSB spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, a detailed UK inquiry has concluded.

Retired High Court Judge Robert Owen, who conducted the inquiry, wrote that he was ""sure"" that two former Russian agents poisoned the 44-year-old at a London hotel with highly radioactive polonium-210.

And Owen wrote that he was also sure that the two men who allegedly poisoned Litvinenko -- former KGB and FSB employee Andrei Lugovoi and former Russian army officer Dmitri Kovtun -- were acting on behalf of others, probably the Russian spy service, the FSB.

""The FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr. Patrushev and also by President Putin,"" Owen wrote. Nikolai Patrushev was head of the FSB in 2006.

Former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium, his tea spiked during a meeting with two former Russian security servicemen.

He had said the Russian Federal Security Service orchestrated a series of bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia's invasion of Chechnya later that year.

In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK inquiry as politically motivated. ""We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicized and has darkened the general atmosphere of our bilateral relations,"" spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday.

UK Home Secretary Theresa May told Parliament on Thursday that Interpol notices and European arrest warrants were in place so that the main suspects would be arrested if they traveled abroad.

And at the request of Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Russian Ambassador Alexander Vladimirovich Yakovenko was summoned to the UK Foreign Office to meet with David Lidington, the minister responsible for Russia.

""The Minister set out the UK Government's deep concern regarding the findings of the independent Litvinenko Inquiry report,"" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. ""He made clear that the inquiry's conclusion concerning the Russian State's probable involvement in this murder was deeply disturbing, demonstrating a flagrant disregard for UK law, international law and standards of conduct, and the safety of UK citizens. The Minister said that this would further complicate bilateral relations, undermine trust, and damage Russia's reputation internationally.""

Lidington stressed that it was unacceptable for Russia to fail to honor a formal request to extradite Lugovoi.

She said outside the High Court on Thursday she was ""pleased that the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr. Putin of his murder have been proved true in an English court.""

In an interview later in the day with CNN, she accused Putin of direct involvement.

""Putin himself personally protected Lugovoi. He himself,"" she said. ""He provided his immunity. ... He protected him. He grant him to be a member of parliament. It means he took all this responsibility.""

Who was Alexander Litvinenko?

Litvinenko was a former Russian security agent who came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistleblower on the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB, the former Soviet secret police and intelligence agency. (FSB stands for its name in Russian, Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopastnosti, which translates as Federal Security Service .)

According to his wife, he then started working for Britain's security services.

Litvinenko had many enemies. His last job at the FSB was heading up its anti-corruption department. It was in the chaos of the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which may have brought him into conflict with ruthless colleagues.

In Owen's report, he quotes a Russian saying, ""There is no such thing as a former KGB man.""

After leaving the FSB, Litvinenko blamed the service for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia's invasion of Chechnya later that year.

All or any of the above may have been sufficient reason to kill a man seen by his former FSB colleagues as a traitor -- a man who once even published an article, cited in Owen's report, that accused Putin of being a pedophile.

What caused his death?

In a deathbed statement, read to the media by a friend, Litvinenko blamed Putin for ordering his poisoning, saying the rare radioactive substance polonium-210 was slipped into his tea at a meeting with the two suspects in Mayfair in 2006.

He said: ""You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.""

The Kremlin has always denied the accusation, as did Lugovoi and Kovtun, whom the Russian government refuses to extradite to Britain. But the Kremlin's case isn't helped by the compelling evidence against it.

Polonium-210 occurs naturally, but scientists say the high concentrations found in the Litvinenko case indicate production at a nuclear reactor, or perhaps a particle accelerator -- the kinds of facilities, in other words, controlled by a state.

Russia isn't the only country capable of producing polonium-210. But the radioactive trail left by the substance was traced across London, while three British Airways aircraft that had flown a number of routes, including London to Moscow, were reported to be contaminated with an unnamed radioactive substance.

Whom does the family hold responsible?

Litvinenko's family blames Putin, whom Litvinenko criticized repeatedly.

Marina Litvinenko and her legal team pointed the finger at Putin repeatedly in statements to the inquiry, which was set up in February 2014 by May, the home secretary.

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49493632,Parliament to Be Suspended in September,,,"Parliament will be suspended just days after MPs return to work in September - and only a few weeks before the Brexit deadline .
Boris Johnson said a Queen 's Speech would take place after the suspension , on 14 October , to outline his `` very exciting agenda '' .
But it means the time MPs have to pass laws to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would be cut .
House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said it was a `` constitutional outrage '' .
The Speaker , who does not traditionally comment on political announcements , continued : `` However it is dressed up , it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of [ suspending Parliament ] now would be to stop [ MPs ] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country . ''
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said : `` Suspending Parliament is not acceptable , it is not on . What the prime minister is doing is a smash and grab on our democracy to force through a no deal , '' he said .
He said when MPs return to the Commons next Tuesday , `` the first thing we 'll do is attempt legislation to prevent what [ the PM ] is doing '' , followed by a vote of no confidence `` at some point '' .
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Westminster on Wednesday evening chanting `` stop the coup '' and carrying anti-Brexit placards and EU flags .
The demonstration , which was organised hours beforehand , started outside Parliament before spreading towards Downing Street .
At the scene , BBC correspondent Richard Galpin described the atmosphere as peaceful and lively .
He said `` good-natured '' protesters on College Green broke through barriers which had been in place to separate live TV crews from members of the public - before traffic on Parliament Square was blocked by some people who sat down in the road .
Several protesters he spoke to indicated this was only the beginning of the disruption , with more demonstrations being organised for the weekend .
Three Conservative members of the Queen 's Privy Council took the request to suspend Parliament to the monarch 's Scottish residence in Balmoral on Wednesday morning on behalf of the prime minister .
It has now been approved , allowing the government to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday 9 September and no later than Thursday 12 September , until Monday 14 October .
Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg , who was at the meeting with the Queen , said the move was a `` completely proper constitutional procedure . ''
Earlier , Mr Johnson said suggestions the suspension was motivated by a desire to force through a no deal were `` completely untrue '' .
He said he did not want to wait until after Brexit `` before getting on with our plans to take this country forward '' , and insisted there would still be `` ample time '' for MPs to debate the UK 's departure .
`` We need new legislation . We 've got to be bringing forward new and important bills and that 's why we are going to have a Queen 's Speech , '' Mr Johnson added .
Shutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it .
The decision to do it now is highly controversial because opponents say it would stop MPs being able to play their full democratic part in the Brexit process .
A number of high profile figures , including former Prime Minister John Major , have threatened to go to the courts to stop it , and a legal challenge led by the SNP 's justice spokeswoman , Joanna Cherry , is already working its way through the Scottish courts .
After the announcement , Sir John said he had `` no doubt '' Mr Johnson 's motive was to `` bypass a sovereign Parliament that opposes his policy on Brexit '' , and he would continue to seek legal advice .
BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was established precedent to prorogue Parliament before a Queen 's Speech , albeit generally more briefly , and rarely , if ever , at such a constitutionally charged time .
He said it was `` Her Majesty 's Government '' in name only and it was her role to take the advice of her ministers , so she would prorogue Parliament if asked to .
It is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen 's exercise of her personal prerogative powers .
But anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - who previously won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50 - has made a judicial review application to the courts about Mr Johnson 's decision .
She told the BBC 's Clive Coleman : `` If the intention of using this prorogation - and the effect - is that it limits Parliament sovereignty , then we believe that 's illegal and unconstitutional . ''
This has been an extraordinarily long Parliamentary session , and governments have the right to shut up shop and return to announce their proposals in a new one , with all the golden carriages , fancy Westminster costumes , banging of doors and splendour that goes with it .
But that new timetable means Parliament will be suspended for longer than had been expected - it 's only a matter of days , but those are days that might matter enormously .
Boris Johnson secured his place in No 10 by promising he 'd do whatever it takes to leave the EU at Halloween , so this decisive and intensely risky plan will satisfy many of those who backed him .
But some others in his government are worried - moving now , even with the accompanying controversy , he sets the stage and the terms for an epic fight with MPs on all sides .
The PM says he wants to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal , but it is `` do or die '' and he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline .
That position has prompted a number of opposition MPs to come together to try to block a possible no deal , and on Tuesday they announced that they intended to use parliamentary process to do so .
But with Parliament set to be suspended , opponents have only a few days next week to push for their changes .
Senior Tory backbencher and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the move by Mr Johnson could lead to a vote of no confidence - something opposition parties have left on the table as another option to stop no deal .
`` There is plenty of time to do that if necessary [ and ] I will certainly vote to bring down a Conservative government that persists in a course of action which is so unconstitutional , '' he said .
Scotland 's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs must come together to stop the plan next week , or `` today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy '' .
Mr Johnson has written to MPs to outline his plan , adding : `` There will be a significant Brexit legislative programme to get through but that should be no excuse for a lack of ambition ! ''
He mentioned the NHS , tackling crime , infrastructure investment and the cost of living as important issues .
He also called on Parliament to show `` unity and resolve '' in the run up to the 31 October so the government `` stands a chance of securing a new deal '' with the EU .
But a senior EU source told the BBC 's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming the bloc 's position was clear and was not contingent on the machinations of the UK Parliament .
There has been considerable anger at Mr Johnson 's move from across the political spectrum .
The leader of the Liberal Democrats , Jo Swinson , said it was a `` dangerous and unacceptable course of action '' .
`` He knows the people would not choose a no deal and that elected representatives would n't allow it . He is trying to stifle their voices , '' she said .
The leader of the SNP in Westminster , Ian Blackford , accused Mr Johnson of `` acting like a dictator '' , while First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said he wanted to `` close the doors '' on democracy .
Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said setting out a legislative programme via a Queen 's Speech was what `` all new governments do '' .
US President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Mr Johnson , saying it `` would be very hard '' for Mr Corbyn to seek a no-confidence vote against the PM , `` especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the UK has been looking for '' .
Brexit Party MEP Alex Phillips said MPs `` only had themselves to blame '' for the move .
She told ███ : `` They have made themselves the obstacle in front of delivering the referendum result . Boris Johnson is saying he now needs to remove that obstacle , and quite right too . ''
The leader of the DUP , Arlene Foster , also welcomed the decision to suspend Parliament and have a Queen 's Speech , but said the terms of her party 's confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives would now be reviewed .
`` This will be an opportunity to ensure our priorities align with those of the government , '' she added .
Parliament is normally suspended - or prorogued - for a short period before a new session begins . It is done by the Queen , on the advice of the prime minister .
Parliamentary sessions normally last a year , but the current one has been going on for more than two years - ever since the June 2017 election .
When Parliament is prorogued , no debates and votes are held - and most laws that have n't completed their passage through Parliament die a death .
This is different to `` dissolving '' Parliament - where all MPs give up their seats to campaign in a general election .
The last two times Parliament was suspended for a Queen 's Speech that was not after a general election the closures lasted for four and 13 working days respectively .
If this prorogation happens as expected , it will see Parliament closed for 23 working days .
MPs have to approve recess dates , but they can not block prorogation .","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: ""We're not going to wait until October 31st""

He said when MPs return to the Commons next Tuesday, ""the first thing we'll do is attempt legislation to prevent what [the PM] is doing"", followed by a vote of no confidence ""at some point"".

Hundreds of protesters gathered in Westminster on Wednesday evening chanting ""stop the coup"" and carrying anti-Brexit placards and EU flags.

The demonstration, which was organised hours beforehand, started outside Parliament before spreading towards Downing Street.

At the scene, BBC correspondent Richard Galpin described the atmosphere as peaceful and lively.

He said ""good-natured"" protesters on College Green broke through barriers which had been in place to separate live TV crews from members of the public - before traffic on Parliament Square was blocked by some people who sat down in the road.

Several protesters he spoke to indicated this was only the beginning of the disruption, with more demonstrations being organised for the weekend.

Three Conservative members of the Queen's Privy Council took the request to suspend Parliament to the monarch's Scottish residence in Balmoral on Wednesday morning on behalf of the prime minister.

It has now been approved, allowing the government to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday 9 September and no later than Thursday 12 September, until Monday 14 October.

Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was at the meeting with the Queen, said the move was a ""completely proper constitutional procedure.""

Earlier, Mr Johnson said suggestions the suspension was motivated by a desire to force through a no deal were ""completely untrue"".

He said he did not want to wait until after Brexit ""before getting on with our plans to take this country forward"", and insisted there would still be ""ample time"" for MPs to debate the UK's departure.

""We need new legislation. We've got to be bringing forward new and important bills and that's why we are going to have a Queen's Speech,"" Mr Johnson added.

Legal precedent and challenge

Shutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it.

The decision to do it now is highly controversial because opponents say it would stop MPs being able to play their full democratic part in the Brexit process.

A number of high profile figures, including former Prime Minister John Major, have threatened to go to the courts to stop it, and a legal challenge led by the SNP's justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, is already working its way through the Scottish courts.

After the announcement, Sir John said he had ""no doubt"" Mr Johnson's motive was to ""bypass a sovereign Parliament that opposes his policy on Brexit"", and he would continue to seek legal advice.

BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was established precedent to prorogue Parliament before a Queen's Speech, albeit generally more briefly, and rarely, if ever, at such a constitutionally charged time.

He said it was ""Her Majesty's Government"" in name only and it was her role to take the advice of her ministers, so she would prorogue Parliament if asked to.

It is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen's exercise of her personal prerogative powers.

But anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - who previously won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50 - has made a judicial review application to the courts about Mr Johnson's decision.

She told the BBC's Clive Coleman: ""If the intention of using this prorogation - and the effect - is that it limits Parliament sovereignty, then we believe that's illegal and unconstitutional.""

This has been an extraordinarily long Parliamentary session, and governments have the right to shut up shop and return to announce their proposals in a new one, with all the golden carriages, fancy Westminster costumes, banging of doors and splendour that goes with it.

But that new timetable means Parliament will be suspended for longer than had been expected - it's only a matter of days, but those are days that might matter enormously.

Boris Johnson secured his place in No 10 by promising he'd do whatever it takes to leave the EU at Halloween, so this decisive and intensely risky plan will satisfy many of those who backed him.

But some others in his government are worried - moving now, even with the accompanying controversy, he sets the stage and the terms for an epic fight with MPs on all sides.

The PM says he wants to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal, but it is ""do or die"" and he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline.

That position has prompted a number of opposition MPs to come together to try to block a possible no deal, and on Tuesday they announced that they intended to use parliamentary process to do so.

But with Parliament set to be suspended, opponents have only a few days next week to push for their changes.

Senior Tory backbencher and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the move by Mr Johnson could lead to a vote of no confidence - something opposition parties have left on the table as another option to stop no deal.

""There is plenty of time to do that if necessary [and] I will certainly vote to bring down a Conservative government that persists in a course of action which is so unconstitutional,"" he said.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs must come together to stop the plan next week, or ""today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy"".

Mr Johnson has written to MPs to outline his plan, adding: ""There will be a significant Brexit legislative programme to get through but that should be no excuse for a lack of ambition!""

He mentioned the NHS, tackling crime, infrastructure investment and the cost of living as important issues.

He also called on Parliament to show ""unity and resolve"" in the run up to the 31 October so the government ""stands a chance of securing a new deal"" with the EU.

But a senior EU source told the BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming the bloc's position was clear and was not contingent on the machinations of the UK Parliament.

'Utterly scandalous'

There has been considerable anger at Mr Johnson's move from across the political spectrum.

Former Tory Chancellor Philip Hammond called it ""profoundly undemocratic"".

The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, said it was a ""dangerous and unacceptable course of action"".

""He knows the people would not choose a no deal and that elected representatives wouldn't allow it. He is trying to stifle their voices,"" she said.

The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, accused Mr Johnson of ""acting like a dictator"", while First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said he wanted to ""close the doors"" on democracy.

Others, though, have defended the plan.

Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said setting out a legislative programme via a Queen's Speech was what ""all new governments do"".

US President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Mr Johnson, saying it ""would be very hard"" for Mr Corbyn to seek a no-confidence vote against the PM, ""especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the UK has been looking for"".

Brexit Party MEP Alex Phillips said MPs ""only had themselves to blame"" for the move.

She told BBC News: ""They have made themselves the obstacle in front of delivering the referendum result. Boris Johnson is saying he now needs to remove that obstacle, and quite right too.""

The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, also welcomed the decision to suspend Parliament and have a Queen's Speech, but said the terms of her party's confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives would now be reviewed.

""This will be an opportunity to ensure our priorities align with those of the government,"" she added.

Prorogation in a nutshell

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What does proroguing Parliament mean?

Parliament is normally suspended - or prorogued - for a short period before a new session begins. It is done by the Queen, on the advice of the prime minister.

Parliamentary sessions normally last a year, but the current one has been going on for more than two years - ever since the June 2017 election.

When Parliament is prorogued, no debates and votes are held - and most laws that haven't completed their passage through Parliament die a death.

This is different to ""dissolving"" Parliament - where all MPs give up their seats to campaign in a general election.

The last two times Parliament was suspended for a Queen's Speech that was not after a general election the closures lasted for four and 13 working days respectively.

If this prorogation happens as expected, it will see Parliament closed for 23 working days.

MPs have to approve recess dates, but they cannot block prorogation.",www.bbc.com,center,o35YVXBvMTRDDNfH

The BBC , which organized the debate , set the stage for fireworks by choosing to host it in Yorkshire , home to an ornery tribe of English people who combine the bluntness of Philadelphia with Texas 's independent streak .
Instead of debating one another , as in a U.S. presidential debate , the leaders of what are currently the country 's three biggest parties in parliament -- Miliband , Prime Minister David Cameron and Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg -- each appeared on stage separately for a 30-minute grilling from audience members , alone and unprotected .

`` I do n't agree with you , sir , '' Cameron replied , trying to deflect the anger .
It 's not as if the British leader does not appreciate the anger boiling up in the electorate . This week he made a desperate pledge to pass a law making it illegal for him to raise taxes in order to placate those who do n't trust his promises .

Though his austerity medicine has been a tough dose for the British people , Cameron argues that the economy is finally recovering , and his best hope of remaining Prime Minister may lie in the fact that voters may not be ready to trust Labour with the nation 's purse strings again .
By the end of his time on the stage Thursday , Cameron , despite putting in one of the best performances of his campaign , looked rattled -- his upper lip was soaked in sweat .
Miliband was up next , and drew guffaws when he insisted the last Labour government had not overspent . That elicited the audience member 's skeptical response : `` How can you say that ? You are frankly just lying . ''
In the end , Miliband had little option but to plead he was not like every other politician who talks big at election time but does n't deliver .
`` I 'm not the guy who makes all those easy promises , '' he said , before almost stumbling to the ground in an undignified exit from the stage .
Clegg , for his part , has never recovered from breaking a promise to oppose a rise in tuition fees for university students , and his own parliamentary seat in the north of England is now under threat . His party is expected to see its tally of seats drastically cut , so much so that it may be mathematically impossible for the Liberal Democrats to prolong the coalition they made with the Tories in 2010 .
`` Have you got any plans for next week when you 're unemployed and your party 's an irrelevance ? '' one voter asked .
Things have always been tough for politicians in the U.K . Voters famously thanked Winston Churchill for winning World War II by unceremoniously booting him out of office and choosing Labour in 1945 .
And there was plenty of grumbling at the premierships of Tory Margaret Thatcher and Labourite Tony Blair when they were in power , even as voters kept returning them with huge majorities that no one today has any chance in matching .
Blair , in fact , won a hope-and-change-style mandate in 1997 , but partly due to his support for the Iraq war , the love affair cooled . In some ways his tenure was the root of the disaffection being seen today .
The one exception to the political antipathy may be in Scotland , where there is a fresh , dynamic political leader rallying the people to her cause . Nicola Sturgeon has taken the campaign by storm -- and could wipe Labour out of its north-of-the-English-border heartland just six months after her Scottish Nationalists lost an independence referendum .
The SNP surge is in many ways part of the disillusionment with politics in London that has led some Britons to flirt with smaller parties like the UK Independence Party , which opposes the EU , and the Greens -- potentially crimping the ability of Labour and the Conservatives to win enough seats for a majority .
According to a YouGov survey in January , only 1 in 10 Britons believes that U.K. politicians want to do what is best for the country .
Seventy-two percent , meanwhile , thought politics was dominated by self-seeking politicians determined to protect the rich and powerful .
Things are considerably better in the United States , where a February 2014 Pew Research poll found that 24 % of the public trust the government in Washington always or most of the time .","Leeds, United Kingdom (CNN) If politicians feel unloved in America, they should try Britain.

Instead of debating one another, as in a U.S. presidential debate, the leaders of what are currently the country's three biggest parties in parliament -- Miliband, Prime Minister David Cameron and Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg -- each appeared on stage separately for a 30-minute grilling from audience members, alone and unprotected. Veteran BBC presenter and the evening's moderator David Dimbleby smoothly made sure that each one was fed to the lions.

Deadly serious contest

Financial Times columnist Matthew Engel said that having the party leaders make separate appearances made them seem like ""defendants in a gangland trial who have to be kept apart for fear they will slit each others throats.""

Miliband wasn't the only one to face an audience member questioning his veracity.

Cameron's suave political persona was no match for one voter who told the prime minister that anyone who believed his promises on Britain's state-run health service must have ""half a brain.""

""I don't agree with you, sir,"" Cameron replied, trying to deflect the anger.

""Well you're wrong,"" the man said.

It's not as if the British leader does not appreciate the anger boiling up in the electorate. This week he made a desperate pledge to pass a law making it illegal for him to raise taxes in order to placate those who don't trust his promises.

Though his austerity medicine has been a tough dose for the British people, Cameron argues that the economy is finally recovering, and his best hope of remaining Prime Minister may lie in the fact that voters may not be ready to trust Labour with the nation's purse strings again.

By the end of his time on the stage Thursday, Cameron, despite putting in one of the best performances of his campaign, looked rattled -- his upper lip was soaked in sweat.

Miliband was up next, and drew guffaws when he insisted the last Labour government had not overspent. That elicited the audience member's skeptical response: ""How can you say that? You are frankly just lying.""

In the end, Miliband had little option but to plead he was not like every other politician who talks big at election time but doesn't deliver.

""I'm not the guy who makes all those easy promises,"" he said, before almost stumbling to the ground in an undignified exit from the stage.

Clegg, for his part, has never recovered from breaking a promise to oppose a rise in tuition fees for university students, and his own parliamentary seat in the north of England is now under threat. His party is expected to see its tally of seats drastically cut, so much so that it may be mathematically impossible for the Liberal Democrats to prolong the coalition they made with the Tories in 2010.

An irrelevant party?

""Have you got any plans for next week when you're unemployed and your party's an irrelevance?"" one voter asked.

""Charming,"" Clegg replied.

Things have always been tough for politicians in the U.K. Voters famously thanked Winston Churchill for winning World War II by unceremoniously booting him out of office and choosing Labour in 1945.

And there was plenty of grumbling at the premierships of Tory Margaret Thatcher and Labourite Tony Blair when they were in power, even as voters kept returning them with huge majorities that no one today has any chance in matching.

Blair, in fact, won a hope-and-change-style mandate in 1997, but partly due to his support for the Iraq war, the love affair cooled. In some ways his tenure was the root of the disaffection being seen today.

The one exception to the political antipathy may be in Scotland, where there is a fresh, dynamic political leader rallying the people to her cause. Nicola Sturgeon has taken the campaign by storm -- and could wipe Labour out of its north-of-the-English-border heartland just six months after her Scottish Nationalists lost an independence referendum.

The SNP surge is in many ways part of the disillusionment with politics in London that has led some Britons to flirt with smaller parties like the UK Independence Party, which opposes the EU, and the Greens -- potentially crimping the ability of Labour and the Conservatives to win enough seats for a majority.

According to a YouGov survey in January, only 1 in 10 Britons believes that U.K. politicians want to do what is best for the country.

Seventy-two percent, meanwhile, thought politics was dominated by self-seeking politicians determined to protect the rich and powerful.

Things are considerably better in the United States, where a February 2014 Pew Research poll found that 24% of the public trust the government in Washington always or most of the time.",www.cnn.com,left,dCRlRKqqIKP6gWfW

The easy bit?

By BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar

For Theresa May getting her cabinet behind her plan for another push towards a Brexit deal was the easy bit.

Ministers agreed legislation to deliver Brexit should be the vehicle for compromises to bring enough Labour MPs on board to counteract the still strong rebellion by those on her own side.

The plan supersedes the idea of so-called indicative votes in the Commons on Brexit options.

The problem is that opposition on the Conservative side has probably hardened, not softened, since her last failed attempt.

The hope in Downing Street is that those wanting another referendum or a form of Brexit that keeps us closer to the EU may back this bill and try and get their way during later detailed debate.

The emphasis now is on hope and perhaps not very much of it.

Ms Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today that She said Labour was still pushing for a customs union with the EU and close alignment with the single market after Brexit.

However, Commons leader and Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom said she would back the bill ""so long as it continues to be leaving the European Union"", which she defined as being outside both of those structures.

If the bill passes its first parliamentary hurdle - known as second reading - in early June, MPs will then have an opportunity to propose changes as they examine it in detail.

British House of Commons Speaker John Bercow — whose bellowing voice and strongly expressed rulings have brought him international prominence presiding over heated Brexit negotiations in Parliament — on Tuesday stood by his stance that Mr. Trump ’ s political views run counter to British values and did not deserve a hearing in Westminster .
Mr. Bercow ’ s visit comes at a time of particular turbulence in London , with the country divided over Brexit and a fierce leadership battle underway to succeed resigning Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May .
But despite the massive , spirited street protests that greeted Mr. Trump ’ s visit to Britain last summer , Mr. Bercow ’ s pointed comments may be out of step with the British people as new polling data show a clear plurality of Brits support the idea of the American president stopping by for a visit .
Mr. Bercow denied Mr. Trump the opportunity to speak before Parliament on his first working visit to London last year — despite having granted the same honor to former President Obama . Mr. Bercow argued that inviting Mr. Trump would run contrary to Parliament ’ s longstanding “ opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary . ”
Since then , nothing has happened to reverse his judgment , Mr. Bercow said .
“ I have nothing to add to or subtract from what I said in February 2017 , ” he said Tuesday . “ Nothing has happened since then to cause me to change my mind . ”
Mr. Bercow said that the White House has not formally requested an opportunity for Mr. Trump to address Parliament when he visits London next week , though it ’ s clear he would deny such a request if it were made .
While Mr. Bercow ’ s opinion hasn ’ t changed , it seems the British people on balance support Mr. Trump ’ s trip . A YouGov poll released this week found that 46 % of Brits believe Mr. Trump ’ s visit to London should go forward , compared to 40 % who want it to be called off . Forty-one percent said they think it ’ s appropriate for Mr. Trump to meet with Queen Elizabeth II , compared to just 35 % who supported such a meeting last year .

The Brexit Party won 29 seats , making it one of the most powerful forces inside the EU and surpassing the bloc of Mrs. May ’ s Conservatives .
Mrs. May said Tuesday the results underscore the need for Parliament to accept a Brexit compromise that avoids a headlong , chaotic departure with an incalculable impact on the election .
“ Of course the European election results were deeply disappointing for the party , ” she told reporters in Britain . “ What it shows is the importance of actually delivering Brexit . I think the best way of doing that is with a deal but it will be for my successor and for Parliament to find a way forward to get a consensus and I hope that those election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver Brexit . ”
As the nation barrels toward its Oct. 31 exit from the EU , Mr. Bercow suggested in remarks Tuesday in Washington to the Brookings Institution that the Brexit fight may just be getting started . A Conservative MP since 1997 and speaker for the past decade , Mr. Bercow said Parliament will be emboldened over the coming months as lawmakers try to put their own fingerprints on the process , potentially complicating the job of Mrs. May ’ s successor .
“ As to where we go from here , my own view about it is [ that ] we have to wait to see who emerges as the next prime minister , ” he said Tuesday . “ But the appetite of the House to have its say has recently been whetted and that appetite is not exhausted . Indeed , some would say it ’ s voracious . The House will want to have its say and the idea the House won ’ t have its say is just for the birds . Parliament is a big player in this . ”
As for his continued blackballing of Mr. Trump , a stance that has generated controversy back home , Mr. Bercow argued that there ’ s no “ unbreakable norm ” requiring an American president to make such an appearance .
Because this will be a state visit , Mr. Trump ’ s schedule , as outlined by British officials , includes a number of events with the royal family , including a state banquet at Buckingham Palace and a D-Day event at Portsmouth where the queen will be accompanied by Prince Charles .
Mrs. May and Mr. Trump will attend a breakfast with business leaders and share a dinner at the residence of the U.S. ambassador . The schedule so far does not include a visit to Parliament or a major public policy address by Mr. Trump .
Mr. Obama was given the chance to speak to lawmakers in the prestigious Westminster Hall in 2011 , Mr. Bercow said , because of his popularity across Europe and the historic nature of his election .
“ President Obama was invited to address both houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall ad that was very well received , his address was very well received , ” Mr. Bercow said . “ He was a comparatively popular president in Europe and indeed … in the U.K. And he was also , of course , the first black president of the United States . ”","Britain’s colorful speaker of Parliament said Tuesday that President Trump once again won’t be welcome to speak in the hallowed legislative chamber during his state visit next month, telling an audience in Washington he hasn’t changed his low opinion of the U.S. president.

I think the best way of doing that is with a deal but it will be for my successor and for Parliament to find a way forward to get a consensus and I hope that those election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver Brexit.”

As the nation barrels toward its Oct. 31 exit from the EU, Mr. Bercow suggested in remarks Tuesday in Washington to the Brookings Institution that the Brexit fight may just be getting started. A Conservative MP since 1997 and speaker for the past decade, Mr. Bercow said Parliament will be emboldened over the coming months as lawmakers try to put their own fingerprints on the process, potentially complicating the job of Mrs. May’s successor.

“As to where we go from here, my own view about it is [that] we have to wait to see who emerges as the next prime minister,” he said Tuesday. “But the appetite of the House to have its say has recently been whetted and that appetite is not exhausted. Indeed, some would say it’s voracious. The House will want to have its say and the idea the House won’t have its say is just for the birds. Parliament is a big player in this.”

As for his continued blackballing of Mr. Trump, a stance that has generated controversy back home, Mr. Bercow argued that there’s no “unbreakable norm” requiring an American president to make such an appearance.

Because this will be a state visit, Mr. Trump’s schedule, as outlined by British officials, includes a number of events with the royal family, including a state banquet at Buckingham Palace and a D-Day event at Portsmouth where the queen will be accompanied by Prince Charles.

Mrs. May and Mr. Trump will attend a breakfast with business leaders and share a dinner at the residence of the U.S. ambassador. The schedule so far does not include a visit to Parliament or a major public policy address by Mr. Trump.

Mr. Obama was given the chance to speak to lawmakers in the prestigious Westminster Hall in 2011, Mr. Bercow said, because of his popularity across Europe and the historic nature of his election.

“President Obama was invited to address both houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall ad that was very well received, his address was very well received,” Mr. Bercow said. “He was a comparatively popular president in Europe and indeed … in the U.K. And he was also, of course, the first black president of the United States.”

great_britain,Daily Mail,2,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4359418/PM-gathers-Cabinet-ahead-Article-50-triggered.html,Historic moment for Britain as Article 50 letter is FINALLY delivered to the EU headquarters,2017-03-29,"James Tapsfield, Tim Sculthorpe","EU leaders have set up a titanic showdown with Theresa May after they rushed to dismiss key UK demands within hours of the historic Article 50 letter being delivered .
In a day of high political drama , the Prime Minister was cheered to the rafters by Tory MPs in the Commons as she declared that her envoy Sir Tim Barrow had handed the formal Brexit notification to European Council president Donald Tusk in the Belgian capital .
Giving an upbeat assessment of the country 's prospects once it regains control after 44 years tied to the EU , Mrs May stressed she wanted to forge a 'deep and special special ' bond with our old partners .
But the letter also included chilling threats about the 'fragile ' condition of the bloc , making clear that giving Britain a bad deal would be a 'costly mistake ' causing serious damage to the EU 's own prosperity and security .
The tensions between the two sides were underlined when German Chancellor Angela Merkel flatly rejected Mrs May 's call for the talks on a mooted £50billion divorce bill to happen at the same time as negotiations on a future trade deal .
Outgoing French president Francois Hollande upped the stakes with a warning Brexit would be 'economically painful ' .
The point of no return for Brexit was reached at 12.20pm today UK time , as the handover between Sir Tim and Mr Tusk happened at his HQ in Brussels .
Mrs May 's confirmation that the deed had been done , fully nine months after the referendum , was greeted with cheers of approval in the jam-packed Commons chamber . Meanwhile , outside parliament Europhile protesters were still vainly demanding a rethink .
European Council president Donald Tusk was handed the historic Article 50 letter by the UK 's representative Sir Tim Barrow in Brussels today
MPs roared their approval as Theresa May arrived at the Commons today for PMQs . She told the House that triggering Article 50 was a 'great turning point ' for the country
Sir Tim handed the letter bearing Mrs May 's signature to Mr Tusk at around 12.20pm UK time , taking us past the point of no return on Brexit
Mrs May told MPs there is now 'no turning back ' from the decision to leave the EU , and said it was an opportunity to forge a country that 'works for everyone not the privileged few ' .
Donald Tusk voiced sadness at the formal notification and urged people not to 'pretend it is a happy day ' . He insisted the EU would negotiate 'as one ' and act to 'preserve our interests ' .
The PM 's letter put the government on a collision course with Brussels by demanding that the divorce arrangements should be discussed at the same time as a future trade deal . The EU 's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is preparing to present the UK with a £50billion bill and is arguing that it should be settled before other issues are considered .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel flatly dismissed the prospect of the negotiations being carried out in parallel , insisting the first task was to 'disentangle our interlinked relationship ' .
Mrs May warned that the EU was 'fragile ' and could put its own survival at stake if it treated the UK badly , hinting that Britain could reduce cooperation over security and terrorism .
Downing Street risked infuriating Tory Eurosceptics by indicating that there will be no restrictions on EU migrants or welfare before we formally leave the bloc in 2019 .
The PM cautioned Brussels against forcing the introduction of a 'hard border ' between Northern Ireland and the Republic , pointing out that would put the peace agreement at risk .
Mrs May told the House of Commons that she was 'giving effect to the democratic will of the UK people ' .
'The Article 50 process is now underway ... In accordance with the wishes of the people , the United Kingdom is leaving the EU .
'This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back . '
She added : 'At moments like this , a great turning point in our nation 's story , the choices we make will define the character of our nation .
'We can choose to say the task will be too great , we can choose to turn our face to the past and say it ca n't be done .
'Or we can look forward and in believe in the enduring power of the British spirit .
' I choose to believe in Britain and that our best days are to come . '
MAY REFUSES TO COMMIT TO SIGNIFICANT DROP IN IMMIGRATION TO UK POST-BREXIT Theresa May has admitted that immigration to Britain will not come down until after the UK has left the EU in 2019 - but refused to commit to a 'significant ' drop . Asked if net migration would come down considerably , the Prime Minister told the BBC 's Andrew Neil that there were 'so many variables ' that influenced the situation . However May did insist that the UK would 'see a difference in the number of people coming in ' after Britain finally leaves the bloc in March 2019 . She said : 'For a lot of people when they voted last year immigration was one of the issues . Now obviously we want to see net migration coming down . Theresa May has refused to commit to a significant reduction in immigration once Britain has left the European Union 'Now , when we leave [ the bloc ] we ’ ll be able to put rules in place decided here about the basis on which people can come from inside the European Union . ' Asked if this meant immigration would be significantly lower after Brexit , May said : Well , I think what we will see a difference in the number of people coming in . 'But I was Home Secretary for six years and when you look at immigration you constantly have to look at this issue because there are so many variables . 'What we will be able to do , as a result of leaving the EU , is to have control of our borders , is to set those rules for people coming from outside . 'We haven ’ t been able to do that so we ’ ll be able to have control on those numbers , set the rules for that , as we ’ ve been able to set the rules for others in the past . '
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has flatly rejected Mrs May 's call for divorce talks and trade negotiations to be held at the same time , saying the two sides must 'disentangle ' before forging a new relationship
Sir Tim delivering the letter to Mr Tusk at the council HQ in Brussels today confirmed that we are walking away from the EU
Downing Street released an image of the letter to Mr Tusk invoking the process for taking the UK out of the Brussels club
The historic six-page letter launching the break-up process was handed over more than nine months after the people delivered their verdict in the EU referendum .
It confirmed that Britain will be leaving the single market , but called for a broad free trade agreement , and urges an early deal to guarantee rights for EU nationals already here and Britons living on the continent .
The missive also included a chilling warning to Brussels against trying to take revenge on the UK for leaving .
KEY POINTS IN THE LETTER PAVING THE WAY FOR OUR POST-BREXIT FUTURE Theresa May has triggered Article 50 today , meaning Britain will leave the EU in two years ' time . This is what has happened so far : ON THE DIVORCE BILL : In her letter , the PM said she wanted the divorce settlement with the EU - which could include a hotly-disputed £50billion payment demand - negotiated in parallel with a future trade deal . This is a flashpoint with the EU as its leaders say the settlement must be sorted out first .

ON SECURITY : Significantly , Mrs May linked Britain 's security contribution to Europe with a future trade deal . No 10 say this is a statement of fact but it will be seen in Europe as a threat .

Mrs May warned Brussels against forcing the introduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic . Although that will now by the UK 's land border with the EU , such a move could undermine the peace agreement . ON EU NATIONALS ' RIGHTS AND IMMIGRATION : The PM made clear that one of her main priorities is getting an early deal on reciprocal rights for EU citizens in Britain and vice versa . She stopped short of setting a cut-off point for EU migrant , with signs that free movement will stay in place until we leave in 2019 .
'At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world , Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens , ' the letter said .
'Likewise , Europe 's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War .
'Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake . '
In a clear threat about the consequences of trying to punish the UK for leaving , Mrs May wrote : 'If we leave the EU without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms .
'In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened .
'In this kind of scenario , both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change , but it is not the outcome that either side should seek . We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome . '
Mrs May told MPs the UK was preparing for all outcomes from the talks . She has stressed that she will walk away from the table if the EU does not offer a good deal .
'Government will be working across all departments to ensure that we have preparations in place whatever the outcome will be , ' she told the House .
'But as I made clear in my letter to ( Donald ) Tusk , that while both the European Union and the UK could cope if there was no agreement , that would not be the ideal situation , it is not what we will be working for and we should be actively working to get the right and proper deal for both sides . '
In an interview with the BBC 's Andrew Neil tonight , Mrs May reiterated arguments tested in more than three hours in front of MPs .
She said the UK 's involvement in Europol would be 'part of the package ' up for negotiation with the EU .
And she refused to be drawn on whether the UK could agree to a huge divorce bill , although she did insist we would not pay huge sums year after year .
Mrs May also refused to promise that immigration will fall dramatically after Brexit , merely stating that levels are currently too high .
She admitted transitional periods would be needed - including potentially on free movement from Europe - after 2019 .
Asked if free movement would end within two years , Mrs May replied : 'We want to have the agreements done in two years . There may then be a period when we are implementing those arrangements . '
The Premier said : 'What voters wanted to know what was the UK Government was taking control of our borders . '
Mrs May dismissed the Vote Leave promise - famously painted on Boris Johnson 's campaign bus - to plough £350million into the NHS , telling Neil : 'Points were made on both sides of the argument .
'We are now at the point where we are putting things into practice . '
Mrs May added : ' I did campaign for Remain and I did vote to Remain but I also said I did n't think the sky would fall in if we left the European Union and it has n't . '
Mr Tusk was still wielding the Article 50 letter from Mrs May when he held a press conference in Brussels this afternoon
Having confirmed on Twitter that he had received the Article 50 letter , Donald Tusk voiced his sadness by adding : 'We already miss you . '
The European Union was swift in its response to Mrs May 's letter after it had arrived .
Council president Mr Tusk made an immediate jibe on Twitter about the nine months it had taken Mrs May to begin the process .
And in a hastily arranged press statement he urged people not to 'pretend this is a happy day in Brussels or London ' .
He insisted the EU will act 'constructively ' but 'as one ' and was determined to 'preserve our interests ' . Outgoing French president Francois Hollande warned that the outcome would be 'painful ' for Britain .
Heralding a potentially titanic clash over the timetabling of negotiations , German Chancellor Angela Merkel flatly rejected the PM 's call for talks on the divorce and future trade arrangements to be held in parallel .
'The negotiations must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship ... and only when this question is dealt with , can we , hopefully soon after , begin talking about our future relationship , ' Mrs Merkel said in Berlin .
French President Francois Hollande struck a tough tone , warning that Brexit would be 'economically painful ' for Britain , the first country to leave the bloc .
The European Parliament 's chief negotiator Guy Verhofstadt reiterated the order the negotiations must take and said MEPs were ready to veto any deal that was considered too generous to the UK .
'We will never accept that the UK is starting trade negotiations with other countries before the withdrawal . Until the withdrawal , the UK is a full member of the EU with all the right but also all the obligations , ' he said .
'The Parliament need to sign off the final agreement or agreements . Naturally , it will never outside the union be better than inside the union . That is not a question of revenge , that is a question of logic of the European Union , of the European Treaties , of the European project . '
The Commons chamber was packed to the rafters as Mrs May laid out her plan for pushing through the EU divorce
Sir Tim , the UK 's representative to the EU , passed on the letter at the European Council headquarters in Brussels at around 12.20 British time
Mrs May briefed the Cabinet on the task ahead this morning , having put her signature to the letter last night before it was transported to Belgium on the Eurostar by diplomats and guards .
The timeline set out in the Lisbon Treaty now means that the UK will officially leave the EU when Big Ben strikes midnight at the end of March 29 , 2019 .
In a bid to spike the guns of nationalists in Scotland , Mrs May told the Commons this afternoon that Edinburgh , Cardiff and Belfast would be stronger after Brexit .
She told MPs : 'No decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be removed from them .
' I expect the devolved administrations will see significant increases in their decision making powers as a result of this process . '
In a plea for unity , Mrs May said the UK should be 'no longer defined by the vote we cast , but by our determination to make a success of the result ' .
'We are one great union of people and nations with a proud history and a bright future , ' she added .
'This great national moment needs a great national effort , ' she said .
Mrs May said Britain would continue to be willing allies and close friends with Europe . She said : 'With European security more fragile today than at any time since the cold war , weakening our cooperation and not standing up for European values would be a costly mistake .
'Our decision to leave the European Union was no rejection of European values . '
Mrs May 's letter to Mr Tusk made clear she was implementing the 'democratic decision ' of the referendum and setting out Britain 's objectives . The PM is pictured in an interview with Andrew Neil on the BBC tonight
The Prime Minister told the BBC she would not agree to a fresh Scottish independence referendum before Brexit is complete
Mrs May 's letter to Mr Tusk made clear she was implementing the 'democratic decision ' of the referendum and setting out Britain 's objectives .
'We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too , ' it said .
'It is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner , and with as little disruption as possible on each side .
'We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values , leading in the world , and defending itself from security threats .
Brexiteers David Davis and Boris Johnson were in the chamber for the PM 's statement hailing a bright future for the UK
The Commons was packed for PMQs today , which was followed by Mrs May 's historic statement on triggering Article 50
'We want the United Kingdom , through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union , to play its full part in achieving these goals . '
In the first sign of potential controversy , Mrs May said Britain believed it was 'necessary ' to negotiate the future trade deal alongside the divorce - something the EU does not agree with .
POUND HOLDS FIRM AS PM TRIGGERS BREXIT PROCESS The pound was virtually unchanged against the US dollar The pound held firm against the dollar and the euro as Theresa May triggered Brexit today and gave a rousing speech about the UK 's bright future . On the day Article 50 was invoked the pound was virtually unchanged against the US dollar at 1.24 and was up against the euro at 1.15 . The response came as the Prime Minister told the Commons : 'This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back ' . The FTSE 100 index rose 30 points or 0.41 per cent to 7,373.72 .
She said : 'The Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition , giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union – and indeed from third countries around the world – as much certainty as possible , as early as possible . '
The letter also urged the EU to avoid putting Britain in a situation where the fluid border between Northern Ireland and the Republic was at risk - pointing out that could imperil the peace process .
'The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom , ' it said .
'We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries , to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us , and to make sure that the UK 's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland . We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland , and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement . '
The Prime Minister 's official spokesman denied the Prime Minister was making an agreement on trade dependent on security , or that the inclusion of the two factors was a threat . He said : 'It is a simple statement of fact . '
The spokesman said any future security arrangement , or its collapse in the event of no deal , only related to EU institutions such as the European Arrest Warrant or Europol .
Nato and most intelligence sharing is not changed by EU membership , he said .
Mrs May 's spokesman said the Government remained eager to agree a deal on citizens ' rights as soon as possible .
But he risked infuriating Tory Eurosceptics by signalling that free movement could continue unfettered until March 2019 .
He said : 'We wish to get an early deal in relation to residency rights and all other matters in relation to that .
'The fact is we are going to honour our obligations while we are full members of the European Union . '
Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage celebrated the formal notification that we are leaving the EU with a pint at a pub in Westminster this afternoon
Meanwhile jubilant Ukip MEPs staged a party in Brussels to mark the beginning of the end for our EU membership
Mrs May remains committed to negotiating the divorce deal and the future arrangements in parallel – within the two year time frame .
Her spokesman said this was set out within the terms of Article 50 , despite the EU 's insistence today the two things must be negotiated in sequence .
DO N'T PUT NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE IN JEOPARDY , WARNS PM Theresa May 's letter urged the EU not to put Britain in a position where the fluid border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is at risk . The missive to Donald Tusk pointed out that changing the arrangements could imperil the peace process . 'The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom , ' it said . 'We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries , to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us , and to make sure that the UK 's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland . 'We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland , and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement . '
He said : 'We wish to get a comprehensive agreement . We are negotiating for a full and comprehensive agreement . '
Sat in the cabinet office of Downing Street , May last night signed her name under the watchful eye of Sir Robert Walpole , the country 's first ever Prime Minister .
Afterwards she telephoned Mr Tusk , along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to inform them about her approach .
A Downing Street spokesman said : 'In separate calls , they agreed that a strong EU was in everyone 's interests and that the UK would remain a close and committed ally .
'They also agreed on the importance of entering into negotiations in a constructive and positive spirit , and of ensuring a smooth and orderly exit process . '
The exact location of the handover of the letter was kept a closely-guarded secret amid fears of disruption by Europhiles .
It has emerged that Britain will obey Brussels free movement rules for up to two more years .
Ministers had considered using the official notification as a 'cut-off point ' , denying new EU arrivals the automatic right to stay here . But sources last night confirmed that this idea had been dropped and the timing of the cut-off will form part of the Brexit negotiations .
The decision on free movement last night raised fears of a rush by EU migrants to beat the deadline .
A government source insisted the Prime Minister had not avoided an early confrontation with Brussels in order to ease the opening of negotiations .
'We have not ducked anything , ' the source said . 'The fact is that we have not got a reciprocal deal on the rights of citizens abroad so we can not set a date for the start of a new system . '
Another source said the Home Office was concerned about the practical difficulties of enforcing a cut-off date before the introduction of a new post-Brexit immigration regime .

Theresa May officially invoked Article 50 by signing a letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk in Downing Street last night , under the watchful eye of Britain 's first Prime Minister Robert Walpole
Sources last night said a date was unlikely to be set until a deal on reciprocal citizen rights has been agreed .
The European Parliament yesterday threatened to block a final Brexit deal if the UK tried to introduce a cut-off before its full departure from the EU .
A resolution setting out MEPs ' demands will be voted on next week and will include a provision for 'non-discrimination ' against EU citizens in the UK .
ARTICLE 50 : WHAT HAPPENS NEXT Theresa May finally triggered Article 50 today and started the process of Britain 's departure . The process is irreversible , and our membership will expire on March 29 , 2019 even if there is no deal . The EU will issue its first formal response on Friday and the 27 remaining members are set to meet in late April . The first major summit is likely to be later in the spring - but substantive talks could be delayed by elections in Germany in the Autumn . The final deal is expected to emerge by the end of next year in time for a series of votes on ratification Brussels , London and around Europe . If the talks collapse at any point in the two years , Britain could face leaving the EU without a deal at all . While a transitional period is thought likely , Britain will cease to be a full member of the EU at the end of March 29,2019 . That will be 1,009 days after polling day in the EU referendum .
A source who has seen the document said : 'The Parliament will demand that EU free movement law is applied until the day the UK leaves . '
The Article 50 process has never been used before . Ministers believe that , after today , the UK 's departure from the organisation it joined in 1973 will be irrevocable .
Mr Tusk will set out the EU 's 'draft negotiation guidelines ' by the end of the week before sending them to the 27 remaining states for consultation .
EU leaders will meet on April 29 at an extraordinary European Council summit to agree a mandate for chief negotiator Michel Barnier and clear the way for talks to begin in earnest in May .
Mr Hammond risked fuelling tensions with Cabinet colleagues today by giving a cautious assessment of what the government will be able to negotiate from Brussels .
'We 've already made it clear that we accept that , because of our requirements , because of the requirements the British people specified in the referendum result , we will not be members of the European single market , we will not be full members of the European customs union and not being members of those entities has some consequences , it carries some significance and the European Union understands that , ' he said .
' I think the fact that we set that out very clearly has sent a clear signal to our European partners that we understand that we ca n't cherry pick , we ca n't have our cake and eat it , that by deciding to leave the European Union and negotiate a future relationship with the EU as an independent nation , there will be certain consequences of that and we accept those . '
But Mr Hammond voiced confidence that the UK would create a new 'special relationship ' with the EU encompassing trade , security and education .
' I am very confident that we will not get an outcome which would be a worst-case outcome for everybody . That would be ridiculous , ' he said .
'We are going to get a deal . The question is about the shape and nature of that deal . '
Jeremy Corbyn ramped up the pressure on the PM by saying it will be a 'failure of historic proportions ' if she does not manage to protect jobs and living standards in the negotiation .
'The British people made the decision to leave the European Union and Labour respects that decision , ' the Labour leader said .
'Britain is going to change as a result . The question is how . The Conservatives want to use Brexit to turn our country into a low wage tax haven . Labour is determined to ensure we can rebuild and transform Britain , so no one and no community is left behind .
'It will be a national failure of historic proportions if the Prime Minister comes back from Brussels without having secured protection for jobs and living standards . '

Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme the government was making 'preposterous ' claims about what it could achieve .

The EU 's chief negotiator Michel Barnier , on a visit to Valetta , said today was the start of a 'very long and difficult road ' .
But far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has warned that the EU 'undeniably ' intends to punish Britain over Brexit and the bloc wants the split to be 'as painful as possible ' .
The National Front leader , who is standing on a fiercely anti-Brussels ticket , said European leaders could 'feel ' other members want to break away and want to avoid a 'domino effect ' .
The landmark document ( pictured ) will be handed over by Britain 's EU ambassador Sir Tim Barrow and represents the first act of an irreversible Brexit process
However , speaking to BBC 's Newsnight , Ms Le Pen said she expected Britain to ultimately secure a good deal during negotiations to leave the EU , which formally begin on Wednesday .
Asked if the UK will be punished for triggering Article 50 , she said : 'That 's undeniably the intention of the EU . The EU wants the divorce to be as painful as possible . That 's simply because they can feel that other nations of Europe want to leave this political structure .
'They do n't want a domino effect . Blackmail did n't work , project fear did n't work either . So they have to try to make the separation as painful as possible . Will they succeed ? I do n't think so . '
Ms Le Pen said Britain 's position will be favourable after leaving the EU as it will be able to protect itself from 'uncontrolled globalisation ' .

The EU council president said the Brexit process would be about 'damage control ' for both sides .

History : This is the letter that triggered Brexit and sets out Britain 's key priorities for negotiations over the next two years","Advertisement

EU leaders have set up a titanic showdown with Theresa May after they rushed to dismiss key UK demands within hours of the historic Article 50 letter being delivered.

In a day of high political drama, the Prime Minister was cheered to the rafters by Tory MPs in the Commons as she declared that her envoy Sir Tim Barrow had handed the formal Brexit notification to European Council president Donald Tusk in the Belgian capital.

Giving an upbeat assessment of the country's prospects once it regains control after 44 years tied to the EU, Mrs May stressed she wanted to forge a 'deep and special special' bond with our old partners.

But the letter also included chilling threats about the 'fragile' condition of the bloc, making clear that giving Britain a bad deal would be a 'costly mistake' causing serious damage to the EU's own prosperity and security.

The tensions between the two sides were underlined when German Chancellor Angela Merkel flatly rejected Mrs May's call for the talks on a mooted £50billion divorce bill to happen at the same time as negotiations on a future trade deal.

Outgoing French president Francois Hollande upped the stakes with a warning Brexit would be 'economically painful'.

The point of no return for Brexit was reached at 12.20pm today UK time, as the handover between Sir Tim and Mr Tusk happened at his HQ in Brussels.

Mrs May's confirmation that the deed had been done, fully nine months after the referendum, was greeted with cheers of approval in the jam-packed Commons chamber. Meanwhile, outside parliament Europhile protesters were still vainly demanding a rethink.

On another day of intense political action:

Mrs May told MPs there is now 'no turning back' from the decision to leave the EU, and said it was an opportunity to forge a country that 'works for everyone not the privileged few'.

Donald Tusk voiced sadness at the formal notification and urged people not to 'pretend it is a happy day'. He insisted the EU would negotiate 'as one' and act to 'preserve our interests'.

The PM's letter put the government on a collision course with Brussels by demanding that the divorce arrangements should be discussed at the same time as a future trade deal. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is preparing to present the UK with a £50billion bill and is arguing that it should be settled before other issues are considered.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel flatly dismissed the prospect of the negotiations being carried out in parallel, insisting the first task was to 'disentangle our interlinked relationship'.

Mrs May warned that the EU was 'fragile' and could put its own survival at stake if it treated the UK badly, hinting that Britain could reduce cooperation over security and terrorism.

Downing Street risked infuriating Tory Eurosceptics by indicating that there will be no restrictions on EU migrants or welfare before we formally leave the bloc in 2019.

The PM cautioned Brussels against forcing the introduction of a 'hard border' between Northern Ireland and the Republic, pointing out that would put the peace agreement at risk.

Mrs May told the House of Commons that she was 'giving effect to the democratic will of the UK people'.

'The Article 50 process is now underway... In accordance with the wishes of the people, the United Kingdom is leaving the EU.

'This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back.'

She added: 'At moments like this, a great turning point in our nation's story, the choices we make will define the character of our nation.

'We can choose to say the task will be too great, we can choose to turn our face to the past and say it can't be done.

'Or we can look forward and in believe in the enduring power of the British spirit.

'I choose to believe in Britain and that our best days are to come.'

MAY REFUSES TO COMMIT TO SIGNIFICANT DROP IN IMMIGRATION TO UK POST-BREXIT Theresa May has admitted that immigration to Britain will not come down until after the UK has left the EU in 2019 - but refused to commit to a 'significant' drop. Asked if net migration would come down considerably, the Prime Minister told the BBC's Andrew Neil that there were 'so many variables' that influenced the situation. However May did insist that the UK would 'see a difference in the number of people coming in' after Britain finally leaves the bloc in March 2019. She said: 'For a lot of people when they voted last year immigration was one of the issues. Now obviously we want to see net migration coming down. Theresa May has refused to commit to a significant reduction in immigration once Britain has left the European Union 'Now, when we leave [the bloc] we’ll be able to put rules in place decided here about the basis on which people can come from inside the European Union.' Asked if this meant immigration would be significantly lower after Brexit, May said: Well, I think what we will see a difference in the number of people coming in. 'But I was Home Secretary for six years and when you look at immigration you constantly have to look at this issue because there are so many variables. 'What we will be able to do, as a result of leaving the EU, is to have control of our borders, is to set those rules for people coming from outside. 'We haven’t been able to do that so we’ll be able to have control on those numbers, set the rules for that, as we’ve been able to set the rules for others in the past.'

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has flatly rejected Mrs May's call for divorce talks and trade negotiations to be held at the same time, saying the two sides must 'disentangle' before forging a new relationship

Sir Tim delivering the letter to Mr Tusk at the council HQ in Brussels today confirmed that we are walking away from the EU

Downing Street released an image of the letter to Mr Tusk invoking the process for taking the UK out of the Brussels club

The historic six-page letter launching the break-up process was handed over more than nine months after the people delivered their verdict in the EU referendum.

It confirmed that Britain will be leaving the single market, but called for a broad free trade agreement, and urges an early deal to guarantee rights for EU nationals already here and Britons living on the continent.

The missive also included a chilling warning to Brussels against trying to take revenge on the UK for leaving.

KEY POINTS IN THE LETTER PAVING THE WAY FOR OUR POST-BREXIT FUTURE Theresa May has triggered Article 50 today, meaning Britain will leave the EU in two years' time. This is what has happened so far: ON THE DIVORCE BILL: In her letter, the PM said she wanted the divorce settlement with the EU - which could include a hotly-disputed £50billion payment demand - negotiated in parallel with a future trade deal. This is a flashpoint with the EU as its leaders say the settlement must be sorted out first.

ON SECURITY: Significantly, Mrs May linked Britain's security contribution to Europe with a future trade deal. No 10 say this is a statement of fact but it will be seen in Europe as a threat.

Although that will now by the UK's land border with the EU, such a move could undermine the peace agreement.

Although that will now by the UK's land border with the EU, such a move could undermine the peace agreement. ON EU NATIONALS' RIGHTS AND IMMIGRATION: The PM made clear that one of her main priorities is getting an early deal on reciprocal rights for EU citizens in Britain and vice versa. She stopped short of setting a cut-off point for EU migrant, with signs that free movement will stay in place until we leave in 2019.

'At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens,' the letter said.

'Likewise, Europe's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War.

'Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake.'

In a clear threat about the consequences of trying to punish the UK for leaving, Mrs May wrote: 'If we leave the EU without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms.

'In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.

'In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.'

Mrs May told MPs the UK was preparing for all outcomes from the talks. She has stressed that she will walk away from the table if the EU does not offer a good deal.

'Government will be working across all departments to ensure that we have preparations in place whatever the outcome will be,' she told the House.

'But as I made clear in my letter to (Donald) Tusk, that while both the European Union and the UK could cope if there was no agreement, that would not be the ideal situation, it is not what we will be working for and we should be actively working to get the right and proper deal for both sides.'

In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil tonight, Mrs May reiterated arguments tested in more than three hours in front of MPs.

She said the UK's involvement in Europol would be 'part of the package' up for negotiation with the EU.

And she refused to be drawn on whether the UK could agree to a huge divorce bill, although she did insist we would not pay huge sums year after year.

Mrs May also refused to promise that immigration will fall dramatically after Brexit, merely stating that levels are currently too high.

She admitted transitional periods would be needed - including potentially on free movement from Europe - after 2019.

Asked if free movement would end within two years, Mrs May replied: 'We want to have the agreements done in two years. There may then be a period when we are implementing those arrangements.'

The Premier said: 'What voters wanted to know what was the UK Government was taking control of our borders.'

Mrs May dismissed the Vote Leave promise - famously painted on Boris Johnson's campaign bus - to plough £350million into the NHS, telling Neil: 'Points were made on both sides of the argument.

'We are now at the point where we are putting things into practice.'

Mrs May added: 'I did campaign for Remain and I did vote to Remain but I also said I didn't think the sky would fall in if we left the European Union and it hasn't.'

Mr Tusk was still wielding the Article 50 letter from Mrs May when he held a press conference in Brussels this afternoon

Having confirmed on Twitter that he had received the Article 50 letter, Donald Tusk voiced his sadness by adding: 'We already miss you.'

The European Union was swift in its response to Mrs May's letter after it had arrived.

Council president Mr Tusk made an immediate jibe on Twitter about the nine months it had taken Mrs May to begin the process.

And in a hastily arranged press statement he urged people not to 'pretend this is a happy day in Brussels or London'.

He insisted the EU will act 'constructively' but 'as one' and was determined to 'preserve our interests'. Outgoing French president Francois Hollande warned that the outcome would be 'painful' for Britain.

Heralding a potentially titanic clash over the timetabling of negotiations, German Chancellor Angela Merkel flatly rejected the PM's call for talks on the divorce and future trade arrangements to be held in parallel.

'The negotiations must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship... and only when this question is dealt with, can we, hopefully soon after, begin talking about our future relationship,' Mrs Merkel said in Berlin.

French President Francois Hollande struck a tough tone, warning that Brexit would be 'economically painful' for Britain, the first country to leave the bloc.

The European Parliament's chief negotiator Guy Verhofstadt reiterated the order the negotiations must take and said MEPs were ready to veto any deal that was considered too generous to the UK.

'We will never accept that the UK is starting trade negotiations with other countries before the withdrawal. Until the withdrawal, the UK is a full member of the EU with all the right but also all the obligations,' he said.

'The Parliament need to sign off the final agreement or agreements. Naturally, it will never outside the union be better than inside the union. That is not a question of revenge, that is a question of logic of the European Union, of the European Treaties, of the European project.'

The Commons chamber was packed to the rafters as Mrs May laid out her plan for pushing through the EU divorce

Sir Tim, the UK's representative to the EU, passed on the letter at the European Council headquarters in Brussels at around 12.20 British time

Mrs May briefed the Cabinet on the task ahead this morning, having put her signature to the letter last night before it was transported to Belgium on the Eurostar by diplomats and guards.

The timeline set out in the Lisbon Treaty now means that the UK will officially leave the EU when Big Ben strikes midnight at the end of March 29, 2019.

In a bid to spike the guns of nationalists in Scotland, Mrs May told the Commons this afternoon that Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast would be stronger after Brexit.

She told MPs: 'No decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be removed from them.

'I expect the devolved administrations will see significant increases in their decision making powers as a result of this process.'

In a plea for unity, Mrs May said the UK should be 'no longer defined by the vote we cast, but by our determination to make a success of the result'.

'We are one great union of people and nations with a proud history and a bright future,' she added.

'This great national moment needs a great national effort,' she said.

Mrs May said Britain would continue to be willing allies and close friends with Europe. She said: 'With European security more fragile today than at any time since the cold war, weakening our cooperation and not standing up for European values would be a costly mistake.

'Our decision to leave the European Union was no rejection of European values.'

Mrs May's letter to Mr Tusk made clear she was implementing the 'democratic decision' of the referendum and setting out Britain's objectives. The PM is pictured in an interview with Andrew Neil on the BBC tonight

The Prime Minister told the BBC she would not agree to a fresh Scottish independence referendum before Brexit is complete

Mrs May's letter to Mr Tusk made clear she was implementing the 'democratic decision' of the referendum and setting out Britain's objectives.

'We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too,' it said.

'It is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side.

'We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats.

Brexiteers David Davis and Boris Johnson were in the chamber for the PM's statement hailing a bright future for the UK

The Commons was packed for PMQs today, which was followed by Mrs May's historic statement on triggering Article 50

'We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals.'

In the first sign of potential controversy, Mrs May said Britain believed it was 'necessary' to negotiate the future trade deal alongside the divorce - something the EU does not agree with.

POUND HOLDS FIRM AS PM TRIGGERS BREXIT PROCESS The pound was virtually unchanged against the US dollar The pound held firm against the dollar and the euro as Theresa May triggered Brexit today and gave a rousing speech about the UK's bright future. On the day Article 50 was invoked the pound was virtually unchanged against the US dollar at 1.24 and was up against the euro at 1.15. The response came as the Prime Minister told the Commons: 'This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back'. The FTSE 100 index rose 30 points or 0.41 per cent to 7,373.72 .

She said: 'The Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union – and indeed from third countries around the world – as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.'

The letter also urged the EU to avoid putting Britain in a situation where the fluid border between Northern Ireland and the Republic was at risk - pointing out that could imperil the peace process.

'The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom,' it said.

'We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.'

The Prime Minister's official spokesman denied the Prime Minister was making an agreement on trade dependent on security, or that the inclusion of the two factors was a threat. He said: 'It is a simple statement of fact.'

The spokesman said any future security arrangement, or its collapse in the event of no deal, only related to EU institutions such as the European Arrest Warrant or Europol.

Nato and most intelligence sharing is not changed by EU membership, he said.

Mrs May's spokesman said the Government remained eager to agree a deal on citizens' rights as soon as possible.

But he risked infuriating Tory Eurosceptics by signalling that free movement could continue unfettered until March 2019.

He said: 'We wish to get an early deal in relation to residency rights and all other matters in relation to that.

'The fact is we are going to honour our obligations while we are full members of the European Union.'

Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage celebrated the formal notification that we are leaving the EU with a pint at a pub in Westminster this afternoon

Meanwhile jubilant Ukip MEPs staged a party in Brussels to mark the beginning of the end for our EU membership

Mrs May remains committed to negotiating the divorce deal and the future arrangements in parallel – within the two year time frame.

Her spokesman said this was set out within the terms of Article 50, despite the EU's insistence today the two things must be negotiated in sequence.

DON'T PUT NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE IN JEOPARDY, WARNS PM Theresa May's letter urged the EU not to put Britain in a position where the fluid border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is at risk. The missive to Donald Tusk pointed out that changing the arrangements could imperil the peace process. 'The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom,' it said. 'We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. 'We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.'

He said: 'We wish to get a comprehensive agreement. We are negotiating for a full and comprehensive agreement.'

Sat in the cabinet office of Downing Street, May last night signed her name under the watchful eye of Sir Robert Walpole, the country's first ever Prime Minister.

Afterwards she telephoned Mr Tusk, along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to inform them about her approach.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'In separate calls, they agreed that a strong EU was in everyone's interests and that the UK would remain a close and committed ally.

'They also agreed on the importance of entering into negotiations in a constructive and positive spirit, and of ensuring a smooth and orderly exit process.'

The exact location of the handover of the letter was kept a closely-guarded secret amid fears of disruption by Europhiles.

It has emerged that Britain will obey Brussels free movement rules for up to two more years.

Ministers had considered using the official notification as a 'cut-off point', denying new EU arrivals the automatic right to stay here. But sources last night confirmed that this idea had been dropped and the timing of the cut-off will form part of the Brexit negotiations.

The decision on free movement last night raised fears of a rush by EU migrants to beat the deadline.

A government source insisted the Prime Minister had not avoided an early confrontation with Brussels in order to ease the opening of negotiations.

'We have not ducked anything,' the source said. 'The fact is that we have not got a reciprocal deal on the rights of citizens abroad so we cannot set a date for the start of a new system.'

Another source said the Home Office was concerned about the practical difficulties of enforcing a cut-off date before the introduction of a new post-Brexit immigration regime.

Sir Tim Barrow arrived at the European Council building in Brussels at 8.51am British time, carrying a diplomatic bag that contained the letter

Theresa May officially invoked Article 50 by signing a letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk in Downing Street last night, under the watchful eye of Britain's first Prime Minister Robert Walpole

Sources last night said a date was unlikely to be set until a deal on reciprocal citizen rights has been agreed.

The European Parliament yesterday threatened to block a final Brexit deal if the UK tried to introduce a cut-off before its full departure from the EU.

A resolution setting out MEPs' demands will be voted on next week and will include a provision for 'non-discrimination' against EU citizens in the UK.

ARTICLE 50: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT Theresa May finally triggered Article 50 today and started the process of Britain's departure. The process is irreversible, and our membership will expire on March 29, 2019 even if there is no deal. The EU will issue its first formal response on Friday and the 27 remaining members are set to meet in late April. The first major summit is likely to be later in the spring - but substantive talks could be delayed by elections in Germany in the Autumn. The final deal is expected to emerge by the end of next year in time for a series of votes on ratification Brussels, London and around Europe. If the talks collapse at any point in the two years, Britain could face leaving the EU without a deal at all. While a transitional period is thought likely, Britain will cease to be a full member of the EU at the end of March 29,2019. That will be 1,009 days after polling day in the EU referendum.

A source who has seen the document said: 'The Parliament will demand that EU free movement law is applied until the day the UK leaves.'

The Article 50 process has never been used before. Ministers believe that, after today, the UK's departure from the organisation it joined in 1973 will be irrevocable.

Mr Tusk will set out the EU's 'draft negotiation guidelines' by the end of the week before sending them to the 27 remaining states for consultation.

EU leaders will meet on April 29 at an extraordinary European Council summit to agree a mandate for chief negotiator Michel Barnier and clear the way for talks to begin in earnest in May.

Mr Hammond risked fuelling tensions with Cabinet colleagues today by giving a cautious assessment of what the government will be able to negotiate from Brussels.

'We've already made it clear that we accept that, because of our requirements, because of the requirements the British people specified in the referendum result, we will not be members of the European single market, we will not be full members of the European customs union and not being members of those entities has some consequences, it carries some significance and the European Union understands that,' he said.

'I think the fact that we set that out very clearly has sent a clear signal to our European partners that we understand that we can't cherry pick, we can't have our cake and eat it, that by deciding to leave the European Union and negotiate a future relationship with the EU as an independent nation, there will be certain consequences of that and we accept those.'

But Mr Hammond voiced confidence that the UK would create a new 'special relationship' with the EU encompassing trade, security and education.

'I am very confident that we will not get an outcome which would be a worst-case outcome for everybody. That would be ridiculous,' he said.

'We are going to get a deal. The question is about the shape and nature of that deal.'

Jeremy Corbyn ramped up the pressure on the PM by saying it will be a 'failure of historic proportions' if she does not manage to protect jobs and living standards in the negotiation.

'The British people made the decision to leave the European Union and Labour respects that decision,' the Labour leader said.

'Britain is going to change as a result. The question is how. The Conservatives want to use Brexit to turn our country into a low wage tax haven. Labour is determined to ensure we can rebuild and transform Britain, so no one and no community is left behind.

'It will be a national failure of historic proportions if the Prime Minister comes back from Brussels without having secured protection for jobs and living standards.'

Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was flanked by Tory MP Nicky Morgan and Labour's Chris Leslie at the protest today

Prime Minister Theresa May left Downing Street for the House of Commons just after 11am today, carrying her folder of briefing notes

Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was making 'preposterous' claims about what it could achieve.

He said today the 'phony war' would end and the public would start to see what Brexit really means.

Mr Clegg lambasted Labour for refusing to vote against legislation authorising Article 50.

MORE THAN 50,000 EU LAWS TO BE PUT ON UK STATUTE BOOKS The government is set to enshrine more than 50,000 EU laws into the domestic statute books, research has revealed. Figures from Thomson Reuters, show some 52,741 pieces of Brussels legislation have been passed since 1990 alone. They are set to be transposed into UK law as part of the Great Repeal Bill, which is being unveiled tomorrow.

'You can only hold the government to account if you are prepared to vote against the government,' he said.

French presidential favourite Emmanuel Macron said he did not want to 'punish' Britain.

'The question is not to punish the UK for a vote made by British people,' he said at a meeting with London Mayor Sadiq Khan in Paris.

'My priority will be to protect the European Union, the interests of the European Union, and the interests of European citizens.

'And my deep wish is to have Great Britain with the European Union in another relationship.

'I think especially on defence matters it's important to work together.'

The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, on a visit to Valetta, said today was the start of a 'very long and difficult road'.

But far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has warned that the EU 'undeniably' intends to punish Britain over Brexit and the bloc wants the split to be 'as painful as possible'.

The National Front leader, who is standing on a fiercely anti-Brussels ticket, said European leaders could 'feel' other members want to break away and want to avoid a 'domino effect'.

The landmark document (pictured) will be handed over by Britain's EU ambassador Sir Tim Barrow and represents the first act of an irreversible Brexit process

However, speaking to BBC's Newsnight, Ms Le Pen said she expected Britain to ultimately secure a good deal during negotiations to leave the EU, which formally begin on Wednesday.

Asked if the UK will be punished for triggering Article 50, she said: 'That's undeniably the intention of the EU. The EU wants the divorce to be as painful as possible. That's simply because they can feel that other nations of Europe want to leave this political structure.

'They don't want a domino effect. Blackmail didn't work, project fear didn't work either. So they have to try to make the separation as painful as possible. Will they succeed? I don't think so.'

Ms Le Pen said Britain's position will be favourable after leaving the EU as it will be able to protect itself from 'uncontrolled globalisation'.

AS THE BREXIT TALKS BEGIN, MEET THE KEY PLAYERS ON BOTH SIDES TEAM UK David Davis The Brexit Secretary is a veteran of EU battles. He was Europe Minister under John Major before a long spell in the wilderness on the back benches. His EU shadow in the 1990s was Michel Barnier and the pair will now face off again in the talks to come. Oliver Robbins Oliver Robbins is Britain's most senior un-elected diplomat. He is Mr Davis's permanent secretary and will be the Brexit Secretary's right hand man. A civil service high flyer, he works as Mrs May's 'sherpa' at summits and is tipped for the top. Sir Tim Barrow Britain's EU ambassador was dropped into the job at short notice earlier this year after his predecessor resigned. A veteran of diplomacy in Russia, Sir Tim has been a high flyer during a long career. He will be one of Mrs May's closest advisers in the talks. TEAM EUROPE Michel Barnier The European Commission's chief negotiator will be the public face of the EU's talks. He has struck a tough position from the outset. Mr Barnier knows David Davis well from their time sparring in the 1990s during Maastricht battles. Sabine Weyand A little known German official, Sabine Weyand is a senior trade deal negotiator for the EU. She has experience Britain lacks. Ms Weyand will be across detail and the UK delegation will have to take care not to be left behind. Guy Verhofstadt The chief negotiator for the European Parliament may appear a fringe player at the start but he will be a loud presence in the media. Later, the European Parliament holds a veto on the final deal - meaning Verhofstadt must be squared.

Remoaners warn the 'phony war' will be over once Article 50 is triggered as rebels led by Nick Clegg step up resistance to Brexit

Nick Clegg warned the 'phony war' against Brexit was over with the triggering of Article 50 as remoaners stepped up their campaign.

Opponents of quitting the EU are camped out around the Palace of Westminster today to demand Theresa May secure the softest Brexit possible.

Protests were held to mark the historic day ahead of the crucial moment at around 12.30pm.

Former Deputy PM Nick Clegg warned the 'phony war' against Brexit was over with the triggering of Article 50 as remoaners stepped up their campaign

Former deputy prime minister Mr Clegg told Talk Radio:'The phony war now ends and the reality bites, because we have to negotiate with 27 other governments and parliaments, all with their own needs and priorities.

'From now on in, people like Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and Nigel Farage, making all these promises and expectations of a utopia – they'll have to deliver it.'

He added: 'My job regarding the British people is the expectations which have been raised, £350 million for the NHS, a cornucopia of new trade deals, the same benefits outside the single market than in – my job is to hold them to account.'

Gloomy Donald Tusk responds to Britain's Article 50 letter with a warning that Brexit is little more than a test of 'damage control'

Donald Tusk has insisted this is not a 'happy day' in London or Brussels in a gloomy response to Britain's Article 50 letter.

The EU council president said the Brexit process would be about 'damage control' for both sides.

In his initial response to the letter from Theresa May, Mr Tusk warned of 'difficult negotiations' in the months ahead.

He vowed to protect the interests of the remaining 27 EU members but insisted there was nothing to 'win' for either side.

And he said: 'What can I add to this? We already miss you.'

Donald Tusk has insisted this is not a 'happy day' in London or Brussels in a gloomy response to Britain's Article 50 letter

In a brief statement in Brussels, Mr Tusk said: 'There is no reason to pretend this is a happy day, neither in Brussels nor in London.

After all, most Europeans including almost half the British voters wished we would stay together not drift apart. As for me, I will not pretend that I am happy today.

'But paradoxically, there is also something positive in Brexit. Brexit has made us, the community of 27, more determined and more united than before.

'I am fully confident of this, especially after the Rome declaration. We will remain determined and united during the difficult negotiations ahead.

Theresa May's Article 50 letter vows to bring home the nation's 'self determination' to make sure we 'put our citizens first'

This is Britain's divorce letter to Brussels that today triggered Article 50 and promised to seize back 'self-determination' from the EU so the UK can 'put our citizens first'.

The six-page document reveals that Theresa May will withdraw full cooperation on cross-border crime, security and terrorism unless Europe does a trade deal that suits Britain.

The historic letter was handed to European Council president Donald Tusk in Brussels by Theresa May's envoy Sir Tim Barrow at 12.30pm today after crossing the Channel by train under armed guard.

In it Mrs May told Mr Tusk he must not to punish the UK for choosing to leave the EU and also confirms that the government will pay Brussels a multi-billion pound bill to leave.

Theresa May's Article 50 letter was handed over personally by Britain's EU ambassador Sir Tim Barrow to EU Council President Donald Tusk

The Prime Minister also sets out six key areas for negotiation over the next two years - and repeatedly warns that the EU needs to do a trade deal - telling Mr Tusk it would be a 'costly mistake' not to.

And in an attempt to save the Union she said more powers should be given to devolved powers in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast and any Brexit deal must not 'harm' the Republic of Ireland.

Minutes after the letter was handed over Mrs May told the Commons: 'In accordance with the wishes of the people, the United Kingdom is leaving the EU. This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back.'

At the same time a sombre Donald Tusk held up the letter during a short press conference and said: 'There is no reason to pretend this is a happy day. We already miss you. Thank you and goodbye'.

Four of her cabinet ministers resigned today , including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab , setting up a very difficult vote in Parliament over the plan :
The morning after the night before was a rough one for British Prime Minister Theresa May . On Wednesday night , she announced that she ’ d won her cabinet ’ s backing for her draft proposal on how the U.K. should pull out of the European Union . On Thursday morning , May ’ s Brexit secretary , the man who led her negotiating team in Brussels to hammer out that draft , quit , along with another member of her cabinet and several junior ministers . Dominic Raab , the second of May ’ s Brexit secretaries to quit the role in as many years , said the draft agreement reached with Brussels would effectively leave Britain beholden to the rules and regulations of the European Union and even give the EU the power to stop the U.K. from extricating itself down the road . He said he could not “ in good conscious support the terms ” of the deal he helped to craft . Raab wasn ’ t the only member of May ’ s government to walk out on Thursday . Her Junior Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara , junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman , and parliamentary private secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan also stepped down .
Prospects for approval for May ’ s draft agreement look slim — and chances it will come to a vote at all are less than solid , too . May could well face a vote of no confidence before Parliament even gets a chance to consider the draft agreement :
BREAKING Eurosceptic Tory leader Jacob Rees-Mogg to submit letter of no confidence in Theresa May as Conservative leader later today , sources confirm — Christopher Hope ( @ christopherhope ) November 15 , 2018
That may be a little premature , according to Sky News reporter Kate McCann :
I understand Brady DID NOT confirm number of letters with the chief whip , so that sounds like a meeting to prepare the ground . Source with knowledge of the meeting said they don ’ t believe he ’ s hit the magic 48 … yet . — Kate McCann ( @ KateEMcCann ) November 15 , 2018
Still , Rees-Mogg pointed out what he clearly sees as May ’ s failings in the agreement and asks , “ Should I not write to my right honourable friend , the member for Altringham , and sail west ? ”
This has some parallels to the Nancy Pelosi leadership fight in the US . There seem to be a number of Tories unhappy with May , but not too many people ready to challenge for leadership , even among the hardline Brexiters . Raab insisted that he wants May to remain in place :
I think she needs a Brexit secretary that will pursue the deal that she wants to put to the country with conviction . I don ’ t feel I can do that in good conscience . But I respect her , I hold her in high esteem , I think she should continue , but I do think we need to change course on Brexit .
The issues created by the draft agreement go well beyond resigning ministers . After having reviewed the draft agreement , Scotland ’ s first minister declared that it would result in a new and successful Scottish independence vote :
It was “ reasonable ” to think that the timing of a possible new vote on secession would depend on how Britain ’ s current political chaos over Brexit played out , she told Scotland ’ s devolved parliament . “ That time will come , and when it does I have no doubt that the people of Scotland will choose to be independent , ” she said .
Sturgeon and others in the Scots parliament were angered by terms in the agreement that they claim benefit Northern Ireland at their expense . “ This is not an academic or abstract argument , ” Sturgeon declared , “ but has real consequences for jobs and living standards in Scotland. ” She also called for David Mundell to resign from May ’ s cabinet , as he had promised to do in a letter to the leader of the Scottish Conservative Party weeks earlier if a deal emerged that “ threatened the integrity of the UK ’ s internal market . ”
May gamely tried selling the plan to a skeptical Commons , but ended up admitting that the deal could lock the entire UK into the backstop EU customs-union arrangement for the foreseeable future . The problem , May said , is that this is the best deal that could be arranged — and the only deal that gets the UK back its territorial sovereignty :
Theresa May has admitted she “ shares concerns ” that the UK could be locked into the backstop arrangement , amid testy exchanges in the House of Commons following the departure of two cabinet ministers . … Iain Duncan Smith , the former Tory leader , said he had serious misgivings about the backstop , saying the UK maintained the “ sovereign right to leave bodies like Nato and the UN ” but would not have that right over the backstop arrangement . In her reply to Smith , May accepted that coming out of the backstop would require mutual consent . “ I won ’ t make any bones about that , ” she said . “ Across the house there are concerns in relations to the backstop and I share some of their concerns , these have not been easy decisions to take . It has been necessary and would be necessary in any deal we were striking . ”
It looks like the Tories won ’ t be satisfied with just control over immigration . If May presses ahead with this deal , the Tories might turn to new leadership with more hardline Brexit views , which will likely produce a crash-out of the EU and a hard border in Ireland .","Just a day after declaring her cabinet united behind her in pursuing a new Brexit plan, UK prime minister Theresa May stands on the brink of political oblivion.

He said he could not “in good conscious support the terms” of the deal he helped to craft. Raab wasn’t the only member of May’s government to walk out on Thursday. Her Junior Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara, junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman, and parliamentary private secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan also stepped down.

Prospects for approval for May’s draft agreement look slim — and chances it will come to a vote at all are less than solid, too. May could well face a vote of no confidence before Parliament even gets a chance to consider the draft agreement:

BREAKING Eurosceptic Tory leader Jacob Rees-Mogg to submit letter of no confidence in Theresa May as Conservative leader later today, sources confirm — Christopher Hope (@christopherhope) November 15, 2018

That may be a little premature, according to Sky News reporter Kate McCann:

I understand Brady DID NOT confirm number of letters with the chief whip, so that sounds like a meeting to prepare the ground. Source with knowledge of the meeting said they don’t believe he’s hit the magic 48 … yet. — Kate McCann (@KateEMcCann) November 15, 2018

Still, Rees-Mogg pointed out what he clearly sees as May’s failings in the agreement and asks, “Should I not write to my right honourable friend, the member for Altringham, and sail west?”

This has some parallels to the Nancy Pelosi leadership fight in the US. There seem to be a number of Tories unhappy with May, but not too many people ready to challenge for leadership, even among the hardline Brexiters. Raab insisted that he wants May to remain in place:

I think she needs a Brexit secretary that will pursue the deal that she wants to put to the country with conviction. I don’t feel I can do that in good conscience. But I respect her, I hold her in high esteem, I think she should continue, but I do think we need to change course on Brexit.

The issues created by the draft agreement go well beyond resigning ministers. After having reviewed the draft agreement, Scotland’s first minister declared that it would result in a new and successful Scottish independence vote:

It was “reasonable” to think that the timing of a possible new vote on secession would depend on how Britain’s current political chaos over Brexit played out, she told Scotland’s devolved parliament. “That time will come, and when it does I have no doubt that the people of Scotland will choose to be independent,” she said.

Sturgeon and others in the Scots parliament were angered by terms in the agreement that they claim benefit Northern Ireland at their expense. “This is not an academic or abstract argument,” Sturgeon declared, “but has real consequences for jobs and living standards in Scotland.” She also called for David Mundell to resign from May’s cabinet, as he had promised to do in a letter to the leader of the Scottish Conservative Party weeks earlier if a deal emerged that “threatened the integrity of the UK’s internal market.”

May gamely tried selling the plan to a skeptical Commons, but ended up admitting that the deal could lock the entire UK into the backstop EU customs-union arrangement for the foreseeable future. The problem, May said, is that this is the best deal that could be arranged — and the only deal that gets the UK back its territorial sovereignty:

Theresa May has admitted she “shares concerns” that the UK could be locked into the backstop arrangement, amid testy exchanges in the House of Commons following the departure of two cabinet ministers. … Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, said he had serious misgivings about the backstop, saying the UK maintained the “sovereign right to leave bodies like Nato and the UN” but would not have that right over the backstop arrangement. In her reply to Smith, May accepted that coming out of the backstop would require mutual consent. “I won’t make any bones about that,” she said. “Across the house there are concerns in relations to the backstop and I share some of their concerns, these have not been easy decisions to take. It has been necessary and would be necessary in any deal we were striking.”

It looks like the Tories won’t be satisfied with just control over immigration. If May presses ahead with this deal, the Tories might turn to new leadership with more hardline Brexit views, which will likely produce a crash-out of the EU and a hard border in Ireland.",www.hotair.com,right,AkY1pJsygl5Ibxez

A less than united Kingdom

Mark Easton, BBC home editor

The EU referendum has revealed an ancient, jagged fault line across the United Kingdom. It is a scar that has sliced through conventional politics and traditional social structures, and it is far from clear whether the kingdom can still call itself united.

The referendum was ostensibly about membership of the European Union. But voters took it to be asking a different question: what kind of country do you want Britain to be?

Yesterday seemed to offer a fork in the road: one path (Remain) promised it would lead to a modern world of opportunity based on interdependence; the other (Leave) was advertised as a route to an independent land that would respect tradition and heritage.

Which path people took depended on the prism through which they saw the world.
