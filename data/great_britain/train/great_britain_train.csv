It is a longer delay than UK Prime Minister Theresa May asked for, but shorter than most EU leaders wanted.

By extending the Brexit deadline to 31 October, they have prompted headlines of ""Halloween Brexit"" and fuelled controversy over UK participation in next month's European elections.

So what will happen next? I've boiled it down to a short summary - and a longer analysis.

With the clock ticking again, Theresa May wants Parliament to finally agree on the UK's withdrawal from the EU preferably before 23 May, to avoid the UK taking part in elections to the European Parliament.

Her plan is first to try to get a cross-party agreement with the opposition Labour Party.

If that fails, there could be a series of votes in Parliament on alternatives to her deal, such as holding a second referendum. But agreement has so far proved elusive, so it's entirely possible the UK will be back where it started at the end of extra time.

The granting of six more months looks like an extension of the UK's Brexit crisis, rather than an imminent end to the uncertainty.

The two big questions now are:

Can UK politicians reach a consensus on how to leave the EU, after more than two years of failing to do so?

Can Mrs May survive as prime minister and leader of the governing Conservative Party, after yet another delay to Britain's departure?

On the first question there has to be little reason for optimism.

Britain's politicians are now broadly divided into three camps:

Those enthusiastic ""Brexiteers"" on the right of the Conservative Party who want to leave the EU sooner rather than later, even if that means doing so without any kind of deal

Those who see Brexit as a question of damage limitation and who would prefer the UK to stay close to the EU after departure

Those who now see Brexit as such a disaster they want it reversed altogether, either by another referendum, or if necessary by Parliament simply calling a halt to the whole process itself.

As time has gone on and tempers have frayed, MPs have, if anything, hardened in their positions rather than become more willing to compromise. So finding agreement won't be easy in the months ahead.

Complicating what is undoubtedly the UK's most profound political crisis since World War Two, Brexit is also an issue that provokes powerful divisions not just between the two main parties, Conservative and Labour, but within them too.

More on Brexit:

As to Mrs May's survival, it's hard to say. There is now turmoil in the Conservative Party.

Its pro-Brexit wing is furious with Mrs May for the delays to the UK's departure and her attempts to reach out to Labour and the possibility, therefore, of a Brexit that would leave the UK too closely tied to the EU for their tastes.

But moderate Conservatives are in turn furious with the Brexiteers for what they see as their utter unreasonableness. I can assure you the language they actually use about their colleagues is far stronger, but unfit for this website.

So even if Mrs May were to go, her replacement would face the same problem: how to meet the massive geopolitical challenge of charting Britain's future relationship with the EU, and therefore its place in the world, while faced with a bitterly divided party and Parliament.

So what happens next?

Anyone hoping this extension will be boring, and that UK politics will return to some kind of normality, is likely to be disappointed.

Rather, what follows is likely to be more of the same: an angry stalemate fought against the backdrop of a profoundly divided country more sceptical than ever about the very fitness of the political system.

There is an increasing sense inside Parliament and beyond that things cannot go on as they are.

Here, in no particular order, are the options over the next six months:

Mrs May's deal, a different deal, no deal, a government collapse followed by a general election or a second referendum and further delay.

But ask any British politician how all this ends and they will tell you they simply don't know. It's perfectly possible that by 31 October they still won't have an answer.",www.bbc.com,center,RMapmemlRMXce4wN

great_britain,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/world/2019/3/12/18259917/brexit-deal-theresa-may-parliament-vote,Theresa May’s Brexit deal fails — again,2019-03-12,"Jen Kirby, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan","The UK Parliament voted Tuesday , 242 to 391 , against the British prime minister ’ s proposed agreement , rejecting it with less than three weeks to go before the Brexit deadline of March 29 , 2019 .
The outcome wasn ’ t totally shocking , as May basically put forward the same deal that members of Parliament ( MPs ) rejected in January . She was unable to win major concessions from the European Union on the agreement , specifically when it came to the “ Irish backstop , ” a guarantee that a “ hard ” border won ’ t be put in place between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the EU and UK break up . The EU did offer some last-minute legal assurances that the backstop would be temporary , but this did not really alter the terms of the backstop and the Brexit agreement .
May ’ s loss is not as dramatic as the previous vote in January , when Parliament rejected her Brexit deal by 230 votes — the worst defeat for the British government in modern history . But it ’ s still humiliating , and almost guarantees that May won ’ t make a third attempt to get this deal passed before March 29 . And it leaves the UK without a clear path forward .
This is also just the beginning of what could be a wild week in Westminster . May promised two additional votes on Brexit if Parliament once again voted down the agreement . The first of these is set for Wednesday , when MPs will vote on whether to leave the EU on March 29 without a deal — basically a self-inflicted “ no-deal Brexit ” that means the UK would crash out of the bloc without any transition period , to potentially chaotic consequences .
If they decide that they don ’ t want to leave the EU without a deal — which seems likely — MPs are expected to vote Thursday on whether to seek a short-term extension to the deadline . This would effectively postpone the divorce , likely for two or three months . But all EU member states would have to unanimously agree to move the deadline — and it might come with conditions .
An extension also does not solve the question that is still tearing the UK apart : How the heck will the UK break up with the EU ?
May ’ s plan is dead , for now . Parliament has to decide whether to move forward without a deal , or ask for a delay .
May ’ s plan looked headed for defeat even before members of Parliament voted Tuesday . She failed to win major concessions — such as time limits — from the EU on the contentious issue of the Irish backstop .
The Irish backstop ensures there will be no physical checkpoints or controls on the border between Northern Ireland ( part of the UK and soon to be an ex-EU member ) and the Republic of Ireland , an independent country that ’ s also an EU member state . That open border is critical to protecting a 20-year peace process in Northern Ireland .
But here ’ s why the backstop is a sore point : If the UK and EU can ’ t figure out their future relationship after Brexit , the UK will have to follow the bloc ’ s customs rules , and Northern Ireland will have to adhere to EU regulations even more closely . Opponents of the backstop see this as “ trapping ” the UK in a relationship with the European bloc indefinitely .
EU leaders did give May some extra legal assurances on Tuesday — basically add-ons to the Brexit deal — to help guarantee the temporary nature of the backstop , and to make clear that the backstop wouldn ’ t be the default option for the EU-UK ’ s permanent future relationship . The UK also included a unilateral statement that said it could seek to get out of the backstop if the EU operated in bad faith . This seemed mostly a concession May gave to herself , but the EU didn ’ t object to the UK ’ s unilateral statement .
These addendums to the deal would empower the UK to seek recourse from independent arbiters if it felt the EU wasn ’ t negotiating in good faith as they tried to define their future relationship and protect the Irish border .
But as soon as May tried to sell these additions as major “ legal changes , ” the UK ’ s attorney general , Geoffrey Cox , quickly spoiled the celebration . His legal advice , published before the vote on Tuesday , said that the core of the backstop remained “ unchanged. ” The new assurances lessened the risk that the UK would be stuck in the backstop indefinitely , he concluded , but since the actual Brexit deal didn ’ t change , the UK remained bound by its original terms .
This legal advice dashed any chance May had of winning support from hardline Brexiteers — those who want a decisive split with the EU — in her Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party , the conservative party from Northern Ireland that keeps May ’ s government in power . The majority of the opposition Labour Party , never eager to give May a victory , joined them to kill the deal .
MPs are also gambling that other votes later this week — one on a no-deal Brexit , and another on an extension — might offer a better opportunity for MPs who find fault with May ’ s deal to try to push a different plan through .
On Wednesday , Parliament will vote on whether it wants to leave the EU without a deal on March 29 . The deeply divided government can ’ t agree on much , but MPs have agreed in the past that they want to leave the EU with a deal in place , so the no-deal exit seems likely to get defeated .
If the no-deal measure is rejected , then , on Thursday , Parliament will vote on whether to seek a limited extension to Article 50 , the provision of the EU treaty under which the UK is withdrawing from the bloc . May has indicated that this would be a short-term extension , which would simply postpone Brexit for a few months . There is also a chance that May may just go ahead an ask for an extension herself , without a full vote in Parliament , according to recent reports .
But any extension , of any length , will require approval from the EU member states .
“ If the UK asks for an extension , it will be a short extension ; everything suggests that , ” Michael Leigh , a fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former EU commissioner , told me last week .
That ’ s likely to mean two months . European parliamentary elections are taking place at the end of May , and the EU has signaled that if the UK plans to leave the EU , it must do so before those votes , between May 23 and 26 . Otherwise , the UK will be legally bound to participate and put up candidates in those elections .
But even a short-term delay may force the EU to ask the UK : What ’ s this extension good for ?
EU leaders had previously been reluctant to grant the UK an extension unless a legitimate reason existed — something that could fundamentally change the Brexit outcome , such as another referendum vote on whether to remain in the EU or new general elections .
Moving the deadline so the UK could continue arguing didn ’ t seem likely before , but the EU also wants to avoid the chaos of a no-deal scenario , which would still be bad for the EU ( if much worse for the UK ) . The EU likely doesn ’ t want to take the blame for that fallout , especially if it ’ s within its power to avoid , by just pushing back the deadline . Still , all 27 EU member states would have to unanimously approve the extension .
The EU would likely make a final decision at the European Council summit starting March 21 , just eight days before the Brexit deadline .
An extension wouldn ’ t eliminate a no-deal scenario , just postpone the possibility . And if May does get two more months , she will almost certainly have to pursue a new Brexit strategy .
Up until this point , the prime minister has tried to maintain Conservative Party unity while also delivering on Brexit . She is trying to avoid a catastrophic no-deal Brexit that the Brexiteers are willing to risk , but she also won ’ t entertain the proposals embraced by the Remainers in her party , specifically a second referendum .
Something is going to have to give . What that is , well , is anyone ’ s guess .
Some reports have suggested May might cut her own deal with hardline Brexiteers . She could potentially promise that if they vote for the withdrawal agreement on a possible third go-around , she ’ ll step down as prime minister and allow someone else within the party to negotiate the future EU-UK relationship . ( This is complicated by the EU ’ s stance on Tuesday that there would be no third chances . )
Or she might finally accept that she ’ ll never woo the Brexiteers , and move instead to build a cross-party coalition with the opposition Labour Party to get a Brexit plan passed . That will almost certainly mean a softer Brexit — one in which the UK promises up front to keep following some EU rules , such as staying in a permanent customs union . That ’ s a position Labour largely supports , though it would require May to abandon some of her Brexit “ red lines . ”
That scenario is still a few steps away . As it stands now , the only Brexit plan on offer is still something the UK Parliament refuses to accept . Parliament can change course this week — but a delay won ’ t break the current Brexit impasse .","Theresa May’s Brexit deal has been defeated — again.

The UK Parliament voted Tuesday, 242 to 391, against the British prime minister’s proposed agreement, rejecting it with less than three weeks to go before the Brexit deadline of March 29, 2019.

The outcome wasn’t totally shocking, as May basically put forward the same deal that members of Parliament (MPs) rejected in January.

But any extension, of any length, will require approval from the EU member states.

“If the UK asks for an extension, it will be a short extension; everything suggests that,” Michael Leigh, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former EU commissioner, told me last week.

That’s likely to mean two months. European parliamentary elections are taking place at the end of May, and the EU has signaled that if the UK plans to leave the EU, it must do so before those votes, between May 23 and 26. Otherwise, the UK will be legally bound to participate and put up candidates in those elections.

But even a short-term delay may force the EU to ask the UK: What’s this extension good for?

EU leaders had previously been reluctant to grant the UK an extension unless a legitimate reason existed — something that could fundamentally change the Brexit outcome, such as another referendum vote on whether to remain in the EU or new general elections.

Moving the deadline so the UK could continue arguing didn’t seem likely before, but the EU also wants to avoid the chaos of a no-deal scenario, which would still be bad for the EU (if much worse for the UK). The EU likely doesn’t want to take the blame for that fallout, especially if it’s within its power to avoid, by just pushing back the deadline. Still, all 27 EU member states would have to unanimously approve the extension.

The EU would likely make a final decision at the European Council summit starting March 21, just eight days before the Brexit deadline.

An extension wouldn’t eliminate a no-deal scenario, just postpone the possibility. And if May does get two more months, she will almost certainly have to pursue a new Brexit strategy.

Up until this point, the prime minister has tried to maintain Conservative Party unity while also delivering on Brexit. She is trying to avoid a catastrophic no-deal Brexit that the Brexiteers are willing to risk, but she also won’t entertain the proposals embraced by the Remainers in her party, specifically a second referendum.

Something is going to have to give. What that is, well, is anyone’s guess.

Some reports have suggested May might cut her own deal with hardline Brexiteers. She could potentially promise that if they vote for the withdrawal agreement on a possible third go-around, she’ll step down as prime minister and allow someone else within the party to negotiate the future EU-UK relationship. (This is complicated by the EU’s stance on Tuesday that there would be no third chances.)

Or she might finally accept that she’ll never woo the Brexiteers, and move instead to build a cross-party coalition with the opposition Labour Party to get a Brexit plan passed. That will almost certainly mean a softer Brexit — one in which the UK promises up front to keep following some EU rules, such as staying in a permanent customs union. That’s a position Labour largely supports, though it would require May to abandon some of her Brexit “red lines.”

That scenario is still a few steps away. As it stands now, the only Brexit plan on offer is still something the UK Parliament refuses to accept. Parliament can change course this week — but a delay won’t break the current Brexit impasse.",www.vox.com,left,Igtn7GwsQgcY97RX

Updated at 10 a.m. ET

After receiving formal permission from the queen, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said Friday that she will forge a government after a snap-election gamble that cost her Conservative Party its parliamentary majority.

""I will now form a government,"" May said in front of No. 10 Downing St. moments after speaking with Queen Elizabeth II, ""a government that can provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country.""

Noting the ""crucial Brexit talks that begin in just 10 days,"" May said the new government will work to fulfill the will of U.K. voters who decided last year to leave the European Union.

May also promised that her government will ""keep our nation safe and secure,"" after recent attacks in London and Manchester, by ""cracking down on the ideology of Islamist extremism and all those who support it and giving the police and the authorities the powers they need to keep our country safe.""

In the new government, May plans to ally with the small Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland.

The U.K. is facing a hung Parliament and May has resisted calls to resign, after her Tories lost 12 seats and the rival Labour Party picked up 29. One electoral district is still not final. May had called for Thursday's snap election just seven weeks ago, rather than waiting until the next scheduled national election in 2020.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said May should resign.

""The prime minister called the election because she wanted a mandate,"" Corbyn said. ""Well the mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence. I would've thought that's enough to go, actually. And make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.""

May took a gamble in April by calling for the snap election. She had hoped to boost the Conservatives' majority in Parliament and get a stronger mandate in negotiating the Brexit from the European Union.

But that gamble did not pay off, as concerns about social programs and security issues replaced Brexit as the main talking points in the U.K.

Now with 318 seats, May's Conservatives falls about eight seats short of the 326 needed for an outright majority in the U.K.'s 650-seat House of Commons. Corbyn's Labour Party now has 262 seats. Before the election, the Conservatives had 330 and Labour 229.

The election results create uncertainty surrounding the negotiations over Britain's exit from the European Union. Negotiations with European officials had been set to begin on June 19.

Reuters reports that Gunther H. Oettinger, a European Commission budget and human resources commissioner, expressed doubt about the talks starting as planned.

Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey both handed in their resignation on Thursday , less than 24 hours after May said she had secured cabinet approval for a draft Brexit agreement . These high-profile departures come as the United Kingdom and European Union attempt to hash out the terms of the UK ’ s exit — or “ Brexit ” — after Britons voted in a June 2016 referendum to leave .
The two sides have until March 29 , 2019 , to reach an agreement and get it ratified by both parliaments . On that date , the UK ’ s membership in the EU will expire , deal or no deal , with potentially catastrophic results : Air travel in the UK could grind to an immediate halt , British supermarkets could run out of food ... the list goes on .
May and the EU are desperately trying to avoid a no-deal scenario . After months of stalled negotiations , the two sides finally thought they had reached a breakthrough this week that solved some of the thorniest issues of the divorce , and provided for a transition period so they could work out a future trade deal .
On Wednesday , May called her new draft plan the “ best agreement that could be negotiated , ” and the apparent backing of her cabinet cleared the way for it to move forward .
But the latest dramatic resignations reveal the obstacles that May faces in finalizing the withdrawal . May ’ s Conservative Party is split between hardliner “ Brexiteers ” who want a clean break with the European Union , and others who are angling for a less disruptive , “ softer ” Brexit , which would involve closer ties with the EU .
The “ hard ” Brexit camp was agitating against May ’ s latest proposed Brexit deal before the text had even been released . They see it as a betrayal , and they fear it will leave Britain subject indefinitely to the rules and regulations of the EU .
May is still moving forward with the draft agreement , saying it ’ s basically this or nothing — but it will be difficult since factions within her own party , and the opposition Labour Party , have opposed it . She ’ s also up against a significant leadership challenge , as hardliners are calling for a “ no confidence ” vote .
May insisted at a press conference on Thursday that despite the challenges , she ’ s going to see this deal through . But it ’ s clear these latest resignations have thrown everything into turmoil .
“ Right now we ’ re in a moment of high uncertainty , but I wouldn ’ t fully discount the current Brexit deal , ” Abraham Newman , a political scientist at Georgetown ’ s Walsh School of Foreign Service , told me . “ This is like a high Game of Thrones , or House of Cards moment where the hard Brexiteers are trying to leverage their power . ”
Britons voted , 52 to 48 percent , to leave the European Union in June 2016 . Those who campaigned for a Brexit argued that the UK would regain its sovereignty , including more control over its territory when it came to migration .
The “ Remain ” camp — those who wanted to stay within the EU — saw this as somewhat wishful thinking , and argued that extracting the UK from its decades-long membership in the bloc would be a cumbersome , unpredictable process .
That has proved to be the case since May , in March 2017 , formally trigged Article 50 , a part of the Lisbon Treaty that governs the EU , to initiate the exit process from Europe . That set off a two-year timeline to reach a Brexit deal , with the deadline set for March 29 , 2019 .
The core question in these negotiations is which ( if any ) EU treaties and laws will continue to apply to the UK after it ’ s left . But while that may sound fairly simple , it ’ s anything but .
And one of the biggest hurdles to negotiating a deal with the EU is that the UK government itself first has to decide what kind of relationship it wants the country to have post-divorce .
The two competing visions for what that relationship should look like are usually referred to as “ hard Brexit ” and “ soft Brexit . ”
In this scenario , the UK envisions a clean break with the EU , and would then try to negotiate some sort of free trade deal with the EU . The UK gains control over things like immigration and borders , but it also loses the perks of being part of the European Union single market and customs union , which eliminate tariffs and many other trade barriers for EU member states .
That arrangement would make the more hardcore anti-immigration Brexiteers happy but would also likely be incredibly disruptive to businesses and the country ’ s economy .
A “ soft ” Brexit involves a much less severe break with the EU . Broadly speaking , the UK would stay close to the EU and retain access to the single market and customs union . This would soften the blow to the British economy when Brexit becomes official , and it ’ s something Remainers — though they never wanted to leave in the first place — tend to favor if Brexit has to happen .
The caveat , though , is that the UK would also have to abide by many of the EU laws and regulations that govern the single market and customs union . And since it would no longer be an EU member , the UK would have little or no say in what those rules are or how they ’ re applied .
Hard Brexiteers hate this approach because they consider it to be a Brexit in name only that would fail to restore the UK ’ s full sovereignty over its own affairs and leave the country at the whims of decision-makers in Brussels , where the EU is headquartered .
May ’ s Conservative Party is sharply divided between those who favor a hard Brexit and those who prefer some sort of agreement that eases the UK out of the EU . And it ’ s because of this split that May is facing resistance from her own party over this latest Brexit draft deal , which they don ’ t see as sufficiently Brexit-y enough .
The nearly 600-page draft Brexit deal , published Wednesday , tackles exactly how and when the EU and the UK will break up . Here are some of the key takeaways :
A transition period to figure out a future a UK-EU trade deal
This proposed withdrawal agreement calls for a 21-month transition period , until December 31 , 2020 , where all of the UK will remain in single customs territory as the EU and the UK work out this new trade relationship , though the transition period can be extended past 2020 date .
A “ backstop ” safeguarding an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland
Most critically , this plan provides a safeguard solution to the Irish border question — which had previously brought the UK and EU negotiations to a standstill . The UK ’ s membership in the EU helped preserve an open border between Northern Ireland ( which is part of the UK ) and the Republic of Ireland ( which is part of the EU ) .
This is a critical pillar of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement , which ended decades of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland between the largely Protestant population who wanted to stay within the UK , and Catholics , who identified more closely with the Republic of Ireland .
Brexit threatened this open border and the past two decades of relative peace , so both sides agreed to include a “ backstop ” — basically , a guarantee that even if the EU and the UK don ’ t reach a trade agreement , an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland will remain in place , no matter what .
The “ backstop plan ” will call for the entire UK to stay in the EU customs union for goods . But Northern Ireland will still remain within some parts of the EU single market , which means it will have to follow somewhat stricter regulatory standards compared to the rest of the UK .
This has created a brand new Brexit metaphor : the “ swimming pool. ” Think of Northern Ireland in the deep end , having to follow more EU regulations , and the rest of the UK in the shallow end , with less stringent rules .
The UK will also have to follow this arrangement until an independent panel is assured there ’ s no chance of any return to a hard Irish border , but it can ’ t unilaterally withdraw from the setup .
The status of millions of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU
Broadly speaking , EU nationals who ’ ve lived in the UK for five years can remain with their families . Britons will also be allowed to stay in the EU country where they currently live .
This is how much the UK will pay the EU for forcing everyone to go through this whole process . This is expected to be at least 39 billion pounds , which is about $ 50 billion .
There is also a short political declaration attached to the withdrawal agreement that offers the broad guidelines for the future EU-UK relationship , which will be hammered out after the UK formally leaves the EU on March 29 .
Think of it this way : This proposed Brexit deal is laying out the terms of the divorce . Once that ’ s finalized , the EU and UK can sit down and figure out their post-breakup relationship , specifically what kind of trade relationship they want .
May presented the draft Brexit proposal to her cabinet on Wednesday over the course of a five-hour session , and appeared to win their support .
“ When you strip away the detail , the choice before us is clear , ” May told reporters after the meeting . “ This deal , which delivers on the vote of the referendum , which brings us back control of our money , laws and borders , ends free movement , protects jobs , security , and our union — or leave with no deal , or no Brexit at all . ”
But the resignations of her cabinet ministers— including her Brexit secretary , who was the second Brexit secretary to quit her government — showed just how split her party is over this proposed plan .
Raab ’ s departure , in particular , is extremely destabilizing for May , as he was literally supposed to help negotiate the deal he now rejects . He ’ s also fairly conservative himself , and May hoped he could help sell her Brexit plan to more skeptical hardliners in her party .
“ I can not reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country our manifesto at the last election , ” Raab wrote to May in his resignation letter . “ This is , at its heart , a matter of public trust . ”
Today , I have resigned as Brexit Secretary . I can not in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU . Here is my letter to the PM explaining my reasons , and my enduring respect for her . pic.twitter.com/tf5CUZnnUz — Dominic Raab ( @ DominicRaab ) November 15 , 2018
Raab is not alone , and in addition to McVey and a few junior ministers , more resignations are still possible , emboldened by Raab .
The bottom line : Hardline Brexiteers in May ’ s party loathe this proposal . They see it as tying the UK to the EU indefinitely and sacrificing the sovereignty Brexit was supposed to help reinstate . Instead , the UK could be forced to submit to EU rules and regulations without any benefit of decision-making power . One conservative lawmaker called it a “ Hotel California ” deal , as in you can check out but can never really leave ( the EU ) .
May has supporters within her party who agree that this deal is basically the best the UK can get if it wants to leave the EU and minimize economic pain and avoid a no-deal scenario .
And then there ’ s the Labour Party . Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has also rejected the deal , calling it a “ leap into the dark. ” May will likely need Labour votes to pass the deal if enough hardline Tory members abandon her . But Corbyn and Labour ( which have their own divisions on Brexit ) are mostly free to let May and the Conservatives implode .
“ They want the Tories to sit on this and die , ” Newman , the Georgetown professor , told me .
Now Theresa May ’ s deal is in trouble — as is her prime ministership
May defended her Brexit deal in Parliament on Thursday , getting hounded by criticism on all sides . But she continued to repeat her message : that this is the best that the UK can do if it wants a deal , and it still wants to Brexit .
That has not stopped those who oppose it from trying to find a different path forward , specifically the hardliners . Not only have they said they ’ ll vote down this proposal in Parliament , but some are now calling for a “ no confidence ” vote .
This is basically a rebellion from within May ’ s own party . These MPs are claiming that they no longer believe she ’ s capable of carrying out her duties because of what they see as a shoddy Brexit deal , and are now undertaking a formal process to try to remove her .
Members of Parliament have to submit formal letters to the party ’ s parliamentary committee and lay out their case against May . A total of 48 letters can trigger a “ no confidence ” vote , but it would require a majority of her Conservative Party ( at least 158 members ) to force her to resign from the prime ministership .
Jacob Rees-Mogg , a vocal Brexiteer , is leading the charge , joined by a growing number of hardline Tories who ’ ve said May has broken her promises on Brexit and so is unfit to lead . May ’ s opponents reportedly haven ’ t reached the threshold to trigger that “ no confidence ” vote yet , but it ’ s still early .
But a lot of this is for show . Even if a no-confidence vote happens , it seems unlikely that May will lose her job . As this turmoil makes painfully clear , the Tories are fractured , so finding a replacement who would have majority support is its own challenge . May , then , is in a terrible position , but she made clear on Thursday she plans to fight for her deal .
“ It ’ s still feasible that May will hold on , ” Newman said , “ and once the alternatives are put in front of the leaders of the party , they ’ ll continue down this road of the current deal . ”
The European Union is , in some ways , backing up May , basically saying , figure it out at home , but this deal is “ the best we can do . ”
A summit is still scheduled for the end of November , where EU and UK negotiators will finalize the Brexit deal and get the sign-off of the EU member states . ( Though some EU countries , including France , are not all that thrilled with the draft agreement either . )
If this chaos in May ’ s government intensifies , it could threaten that November summit , leaving the UK and the EU at loggerheads and inching closer to no-deal Brexit .
But this might also be the hardline Brexiteers ’ last stand before they , and other skeptics , accept reality : It may be a choice between this flawed plan and the UK leaving the EU empty-handed .","Two ministers have resigned from UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet, throwing her government into chaos and threatening the future of a proposed Brexit deal.

The central issue the UK is warring over

Britons voted, 52 to 48 percent, to leave the European Union in June 2016. Those who campaigned for a Brexit argued that the UK would regain its sovereignty, including more control over its territory when it came to migration.

The “Remain” camp — those who wanted to stay within the EU — saw this as somewhat wishful thinking, and argued that extracting the UK from its decades-long membership in the bloc would be a cumbersome, unpredictable process.

That has proved to be the case since May, in March 2017, formally trigged Article 50, a part of the Lisbon Treaty that governs the EU, to initiate the exit process from Europe. That set off a two-year timeline to reach a Brexit deal, with the deadline set for March 29, 2019.

What’s in May’s draft Brexit proposal

The nearly 600-page draft Brexit deal, published Wednesday, tackles exactly how and when the EU and the UK will break up. Here are some of the key takeaways:

A transition period to figure out a future a UK-EU trade deal

This proposed withdrawal agreement calls for a 21-month transition period, until December 31, 2020, where all of the UK will remain in single customs territory as the EU and the UK work out this new trade relationship, though the transition period can be extended past 2020 date.

A “backstop” safeguarding an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland

Most critically, this plan provides a safeguard solution to the Irish border question — which had previously brought the UK and EU negotiations to a standstill. The UK’s membership in the EU helped preserve an open border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which is part of the EU).

This is a critical pillar of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland between the largely Protestant population who wanted to stay within the UK, and Catholics, who identified more closely with the Republic of Ireland.

Brexit threatened this open border and the past two decades of relative peace, so both sides agreed to include a “backstop” — basically, a guarantee that even if the EU and the UK don’t reach a trade agreement, an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland will remain in place, no matter what.

The “backstop plan” will call for the entire UK to stay in the EU customs union for goods. But Northern Ireland will still remain within some parts of the EU single market, which means it will have to follow somewhat stricter regulatory standards compared to the rest of the UK.

This has created a brand new Brexit metaphor: the “swimming pool.” Think of Northern Ireland in the deep end, having to follow more EU regulations, and the rest of the UK in the shallow end, with less stringent rules.

The UK will also have to follow this arrangement until an independent panel is assured there’s no chance of any return to a hard Irish border, but it can’t unilaterally withdraw from the setup.

The status of millions of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU

Broadly speaking, EU nationals who’ve lived in the UK for five years can remain with their families. Britons will also be allowed to stay in the EU country where they currently live.

Divorce settlement

This is how much the UK will pay the EU for forcing everyone to go through this whole process. This is expected to be at least 39 billion pounds, which is about $50 billion.

An outline for future negotiations

There is also a short political declaration attached to the withdrawal agreement that offers the broad guidelines for the future EU-UK relationship, which will be hammered out after the UK formally leaves the EU on March 29.

Think of it this way: This proposed Brexit deal is laying out the terms of the divorce. Once that’s finalized, the EU and UK can sit down and figure out their post-breakup relationship, specifically what kind of trade relationship they want.

So what’s the problem here?

May presented the draft Brexit proposal to her cabinet on Wednesday over the course of a five-hour session, and appeared to win their support.

“When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear,” May told reporters after the meeting. “This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings us back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security, and our union — or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.”

But the resignations of her cabinet ministers— including her Brexit secretary, who was the second Brexit secretary to quit her government — showed just how split her party is over this proposed plan.

Raab’s departure, in particular, is extremely destabilizing for May, as he was literally supposed to help negotiate the deal he now rejects. He’s also fairly conservative himself, and May hoped he could help sell her Brexit plan to more skeptical hardliners in her party.

Instead, he’s decided he’s had enough.

“I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country our manifesto at the last election,” Raab wrote to May in his resignation letter. “This is, at its heart, a matter of public trust.”

Today, I have resigned as Brexit Secretary. I cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU. Here is my letter to the PM explaining my reasons, and my enduring respect for her. pic.twitter.com/tf5CUZnnUz — Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) November 15, 2018

Raab is not alone, and in addition to McVey and a few junior ministers, more resignations are still possible, emboldened by Raab.

The bottom line: Hardline Brexiteers in May’s party loathe this proposal. They see it as tying the UK to the EU indefinitely and sacrificing the sovereignty Brexit was supposed to help reinstate. Instead, the UK could be forced to submit to EU rules and regulations without any benefit of decision-making power. One conservative lawmaker called it a “Hotel California” deal, as in you can check out but can never really leave (the EU).

May has supporters within her party who agree that this deal is basically the best the UK can get if it wants to leave the EU and minimize economic pain and avoid a no-deal scenario.

And then there’s the Labour Party. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has also rejected the deal, calling it a “leap into the dark.” May will likely need Labour votes to pass the deal if enough hardline Tory members abandon her. But Corbyn and Labour (which have their own divisions on Brexit) are mostly free to let May and the Conservatives implode.

“They want the Tories to sit on this and die,” Newman, the Georgetown professor, told me.

Now Theresa May’s deal is in trouble — as is her prime ministership

May defended her Brexit deal in Parliament on Thursday, getting hounded by criticism on all sides. But she continued to repeat her message: that this is the best that the UK can do if it wants a deal, and it still wants to Brexit.

That has not stopped those who oppose it from trying to find a different path forward, specifically the hardliners. Not only have they said they’ll vote down this proposal in Parliament, but some are now calling for a “no confidence” vote.

This is basically a rebellion from within May’s own party. These MPs are claiming that they no longer believe she’s capable of carrying out her duties because of what they see as a shoddy Brexit deal, and are now undertaking a formal process to try to remove her.

Members of Parliament have to submit formal letters to the party’s parliamentary committee and lay out their case against May. A total of 48 letters can trigger a “no confidence” vote, but it would require a majority of her Conservative Party (at least 158 members) to force her to resign from the prime ministership.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, a vocal Brexiteer, is leading the charge, joined by a growing number of hardline Tories who’ve said May has broken her promises on Brexit and so is unfit to lead. May’s opponents reportedly haven’t reached the threshold to trigger that “no confidence” vote yet, but it’s still early.

But a lot of this is for show. Even if a no-confidence vote happens, it seems unlikely that May will lose her job. As this turmoil makes painfully clear, the Tories are fractured, so finding a replacement who would have majority support is its own challenge. May, then, is in a terrible position, but she made clear on Thursday she plans to fight for her deal.

“It’s still feasible that May will hold on,” Newman said, “and once the alternatives are put in front of the leaders of the party, they’ll continue down this road of the current deal.”

The European Union is, in some ways, backing up May, basically saying, figure it out at home, but this deal is “the best we can do.”

A summit is still scheduled for the end of November, where EU and UK negotiators will finalize the Brexit deal and get the sign-off of the EU member states. (Though some EU countries, including France, are not all that thrilled with the draft agreement either.)

If this chaos in May’s government intensifies, it could threaten that November summit, leaving the UK and the EU at loggerheads and inching closer to no-deal Brexit.

But this might also be the hardline Brexiteers’ last stand before they, and other skeptics, accept reality: It may be a choice between this flawed plan and the UK leaving the EU empty-handed.",www.vox.com,left,CYJbe7DGSHfLib2v

USA TODAY

LONDON — A British man described by the Islamic State as one of its soldiers was named by police Thursday as the terrorist who unleashed a one-man wave of murder and mayhem on the city's famous Westminster Bridge and Parliament square, killing four and injuring dozens.

Khalid Masood, 52, has a lengthy rap sheet but no known terror convictions, police announced.

An American tourist was among the fatalities in Wednesday's carnage, his family said Thursday. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, claimed responsibility for the attack, calling Masood its ""soldier.""

Eight people were arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts, and police said the investigation was continuing. Masood, fatally shot by officers at the scene, had a ""range"" of previous convictions for assault, possession of offensive weapons and other offenses, London Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

""Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack,"" the statement said.

Masood plowed his car into a crowd on the iconic Westminster Bridge before ramming his vehicle into a gate outside Parliament and fatally stabbing a police officer, authorities said.

Metropolitan Police said the latest victim, a 75-year-old man, died Thursday in the hospital. Among the other fatalities included a Utah man on a trip with his wife to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary, his family confirmed Thursday. Kurt Cochran's wife, Melissa, was hospitalized with serious injuries in the attack.

""A great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the London terror attack'"" President Trump tweeted. ""My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.""

Also killed were Keith Palmer, 48, the police officer with 15 years of service, and Aysha Frade, a British mother and schoolteacher.

American, teacher, policeman: These are the London terror attack victims

Before Masood was publicly identified, Prime Minister Theresa May said the attacker was British-born and known to security officers. She said the man had been investigated by MI5, the domestic security agency, ""some years ago"" regarding concerns about violent extremism.

""He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic — he was not part of the current intelligence picture,"" she said, adding there was ""no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot.""

The prime minister said the best response to the attack was ""millions of acts of normality.""

“This country will not be cowed by these terrorists,"" she said.

May's call was heeded. Tourists streamed across Westminster Bridge on Thursday, hours after it was reopened to pedestrians and traffic. Stuart Elliott, 62, and his wife Vilma Elliott, 59, from Newcastle in northern England, were in London celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary. They traveled to the British capital Thursday morning.

""We were shocked, definitely,"" said Stuart Elliott, a gas technician. ""But life just carries on.""

""It was all booked for us to come,"" his wife added.

Hundreds of people gathered Thursday as dusk fell in Trafalgar Square in central London for a vigil to remember the victims.

Speakers included Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. Many people lit candles.

Ken Hooper, 62, a retired police officer with Surrey Police, a county just south of London, wiped away tears following the ceremony.

""The whole thing is absolutely despicable,"" he said. ""I came here to pay my respects. We'll go on for their sakes. It's unbelievable. We'll all pull together and they won't win. When a police officer is killed, it's awful to hear. It's like family.""

Chris Kay, 31, a seminars manager in the legal industry who works nearby, said when the attack happened, ""the first thing that went through my mind is how is this city going to react. Hopefully it will bring everyone together and make us stronger.""

Mike Kelly, 63, a retired teacher, travelled from the county of Kent, south of London, specifically for the vigil.

""I came because when I heard the prime minister this morning say 'we are not afraid,' I thought 'she's quite right'.""

He said his son is a detective in the Metropolitan Police and is working on the investigation. He applauded the emergency services for their response, and said he would continue as normal.

""These people won't prevail,"" he said.

What we know about the London terror attack victims

British media reported the car used in the attack — a gray Hyundai i40 — was rented in Birmingham, a city of more than 1 million people about 125 miles northwest of London. Anti-terrorism forces swept into the city, and seven of the suspects were arrested there.

Queen Elizabeth II said she and her husband, Prince Philip, would not be able to officially open New Scotland Yard, the London police headquarters, as planned Thursday ""for very understandable reasons.""

""My thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathy are with all those who have been affected by yesterday's awful violence,"" she said in a message to Craig Mackey, the acting commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.

Of the 40 people injured in the incident, 29 required hospitalization and five remained in critical condition late Thursday. May said 12 Britons were taken to hospitals. The others include three French teenagers, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one American, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian and two Greeks, she said.

Three police officers were injured as they returned from an event to recognize their bravery, May said, adding two were in serious condition.

Both houses of Parliament resumed normal operations Thursday. A minute's silence to honor the victims was held shortly after 9:30 a.m. local time. The crime scene and surrounding area remained cordoned off and police asked people to steer clear of the areas close to Parliament. A candlelit vigil will be held in Trafalgar Square later Thursday, the office of London's mayor announced.

""We are not afraid,"" May said in her address to Parliament. ""Our resolve will never waiver in the face of terrorism. And we meet here, in the oldest of all Parliaments, because we know that democracy — and the values it entails — will always prevail.""

Tony Thompson hopes the United Kingdom votes on Thursday to leave the European Union . Standing in a green smock behind his meat counter in the town of Romford , a short train ride from central London , the 58-year-old butcher explains why in four words .
`` Got to stop immigration , '' says Thompson . `` It 's only an island . You can only get so many people on an island , ca n't you ? ''
Thompson says immigration has cost him . He had a butcher shop in London 's famed East End , but over time , his white , British-born clients moved out and were replaced by Muslims from Somalia , Pakistan and India . They had no use for an English butcher — they could eat only halal meat .
`` That 's when I noticed a lot of change , '' says Thompson , `` because my business went under . ''
Thompson insists he is not a racist — he has four mixed-race sons — but he thinks communities and the culture are changing too fast .
`` It 's like the English are being pushed out to the coasts , '' he says , `` and main towns , even Birmingham and those places , it 's not England anymore . ''
Thursday 's vote is officially about leaving a giant trading block of 28 nations with more than 500 million people , but most in the so-called `` Leave '' camp are — like Thompson — focused on immigration . They say membership in the EU permits too many foreigners to flow too freely into their country .
Romford is part of the London borough of Havering , which YouGov , an online polling firm , estimates is the most anti-European area in the country . Although the vast majority of people in Havering are white , the percentage of minorities has more than doubled since 2001 , according to government figures .
Lawrence Webb , a councilman in the area , says rapid growth has frustrated locals . A journey that used to take ten minutes across the borough now takes 30 . Big houses , Webb says , have been replaced by a series of apartments .
`` It has nothing to do with color and race necessarily , '' says Webb , who is with the nationalist UK Independence Party , which is campaigning hard for a British exit — or `` Brexit '' — from the EU . `` People perceive that their quality of life is diminished . ''
Drive five hours west of Romford through rolling hills dotted with sheep , and you arrive in Aberystwyth , which sits in a cove along the Welsh coast looking out toward Ireland . Aberyswyth looks like a classic British seaside town , with a fading pier stretching out into the ocean and the remains of a castle on a nearby hillside .
YouGov 's polling found that the area around the city was the most EU-friendly region in the United Kingdom .
Even though Aberystwyth is far from London , it feels more diverse than Romford . Consider Shumana Palit , who works as a server at Ultracomida , a Spanish restaurant and deli .
`` I 'm originally from Wales , so I 'm half-Welsh , and my father 's from India , '' Palit says as she prepares a coffee behind the counter . `` My husband 's half-Spanish , half-French . ''
Palit says a major reason the city has an unusually cosmopolitan feel is because of Aberystwyth University , which has a large population of international students .
`` It feels very European when you 're here , '' she says , `` it does n't feel like somewhere that wants to be cut off from Europe . ''
Instead of seeing membership in the EU as a problem — as butcher Tony Thompson does — many businesses here see it as crucial to their success , because it allows them to trade freely with the continent . Ultracomida owner Paul Grimwood places 30 orders a week from Spain , which is comparatively easy because the EU operates as a single market . Grimwood says that a Brexit would make things harder , and that it would drive down the value of the British pound and raise his costs by 20 percent .
In some parts of the country , people complain that working-class immigrants are driving down wages . But Cameron Singhclare , an economics student at the university , says foreigners in Aberystwyth are different , and less of a competitive threat .
`` The majority who came here are students or academics or professionals , and maybe that 's why there is less resentment about migration from the EU , '' says Singhclare , who rooms with a Bulgarian .
Toby Bragg , who works at Summit Cycles in town , has spent much of his career in the U.K. and Europe working with people of different nationalities . He says his fellow citizens who do n't like the changing ethnic makeup of the country have short memories .
`` We 're essentially an island , '' says Bragg . `` If you look back through history , we 've been colonized , overtaken , invaded , assimilated many , many different ways .
`` I get the idea that for some people there 's this very English England — which probably never existed or ever will . ''","From London To The Welsh Coast, Sharp Disagreements On 'Brexit'

""I'm originally from Wales, so I'm half-Welsh, and my father's from India,"" Palit says as she prepares a coffee behind the counter. ""My husband's half-Spanish, half-French.""

Palit says a major reason the city has an unusually cosmopolitan feel is because of Aberystwyth University, which has a large population of international students.

""It feels very European when you're here,"" she says, ""it doesn't feel like somewhere that wants to be cut off from Europe.""

Instead of seeing membership in the EU as a problem — as butcher Tony Thompson does — many businesses here see it as crucial to their success, because it allows them to trade freely with the continent. Ultracomida owner Paul Grimwood places 30 orders a week from Spain, which is comparatively easy because the EU operates as a single market. Grimwood says that a Brexit would make things harder, and that it would drive down the value of the British pound and raise his costs by 20 percent.

In some parts of the country, people complain that working-class immigrants are driving down wages. But Cameron Singhclare, an economics student at the university, says foreigners in Aberystwyth are different, and less of a competitive threat.

""The majority who came here are students or academics or professionals, and maybe that's why there is less resentment about migration from the EU,"" says Singhclare, who rooms with a Bulgarian.

Toby Bragg, who works at Summit Cycles in town, has spent much of his career in the U.K. and Europe working with people of different nationalities. He says his fellow citizens who don't like the changing ethnic makeup of the country have short memories.

""We're essentially an island,"" says Bragg. ""If you look back through history, we've been colonized, overtaken, invaded, assimilated many, many different ways.

""I get the idea that for some people there's this very English England — which probably never existed or ever will.""

Leading up to the Brexit vote, I, like so many others, was sure Britain would vote to remain in the European Union. I was certain the endless pummeling by experts, the endless fear-mongering, would all pay off like it did for the Scottish referendum.

I was wrong, and happily so.

The Leave campaign received 52 percent of the vote, while Remain garnered 48 percent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union.

And you know what? Britons did the right thing.

Democracy is tricky. It relies on a proper balance between elite consensus and populist outcomes. You can't have a direct democracy, and the majority of people is not a body qualified enough to make most decisions that a government makes. That's why you need a ruling elite.

Most of the time, this ruling elite is a good thing. But sometimes a ruling elite can go bad. It can close in on itself. It can become ideological. It can grow its own set of values and mores distinct from those of the people it is supposed to serve. In that case, the elite and the people become adversaries.

This is the disease of democracies, and it had infected Britain.

For decades, British and European elites have stuck up their nose at the rest of the British people. The argument for Brexit was always an argument about national sovereignty expressed democratically through a parliament. The British people have fought for literally 800 years to get a sovereign parliament. They fought kings, they fought popes, they fought Hitler, all to have a sovereign parliament.

This kind of disease needs to be treated, because the longer it endures, the sicker a democracy becomes. And when that happens, there are several possible outcomes: The first is the elite become self-searching, self-aware, realize that they haven't been serving their people well, and rethink and readjust. That first scenario almost never happens, because many elites look down on the rest of society.

The second is the elites ignore their people for so long that the whole system implodes. The people are so fed up with the elites, they're driven to do something really dramatic. One obvious example of this playing out in recent history is the rise of Donald Trump in America.

No doubt some people would call Brexit dramatic, or even drastic. The voters did something reckless to get back at their leadership.

But what's really important here is that the British people have done something eminently responsible. They voted for liberal democracy in response to elites that have been out of touch for decades and have tried to ram an unpopular, doomed-from-the-start project of a Federal Europe down their throats.

At the moment , it 's looking like Prime Minister David Cameron 's Conservative Party is set to lose seats , but will still have more than any other party . That could leave Cameron with a precarious hold on power — or let Labour Party leader Ed Miliband swoop in and try to form a shaky government of his own .
Either way , it 's likely to be an unusual situation for a country that does not have a history of the kind of drawn-out coalition formation negotiations that are common in some parts of Europe .
The UK has a bunch of political parties represented in its parliament . Of them , two are running for a shot to run the country , two are running for a serious chance at influencing the direction of the country , and the rest are really just there to make a point . Here are brief profiles of the four most important parties in the race ; further down we 'll cover the minor players .
Conservative Party : The traditional right-wing party in Britain , the Tories have been the dominant force in the Commons since 2010 , with Cameron and his Chancellor of the Exchequer ( sort of like the treasury secretary in the US , but way more powerful ) George Osborne imposing a severe austerity package on the country in the wake of the financial crisis , a policy which many economists believed hampered the recovery .
While the Conservatives fell far behind in polls in the middle of their tenure , the economy has since started growing more quickly , and they 've pulled slightly ahead . FiveThirtyEight 's model predicts they 'll lose 21 seats for a total of 281 — below the 326 needed for a majority , but enough to keep them as the biggest party in the Commons .
Labour Party : In power from 1997 to 2010 , Labour — the social democratic party of Britain , with a strong base of support in the union movement — surprised many by electing Ed Miliband , who had served in defeated Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's cabinet as secretary of state for energy and climate change , as leader , besting Ed 's brother David , who was Brown 's foreign secretary and the favorite to succeed him . Ed is widely considered to the left of both Brown and Brown 's predecessor , Tony Blair , condemning Blair 's participation in the Iraq War and criticizing Blair 's `` New Labour '' platform as insufficiently tough on big business . ( Blair , in turn , has vocally criticized Miliband . ) But his platform — which he has dubbed `` One Nation Labour '' — is also populist in ways that are n't traditionally left-wing . Most notably , Miliband is considerably more skeptical of immigration than Brown or Blair were .
Liberal Democrats : Formed out of a merger of the Liberal Party — which , along with the Conservatives , was one of Britain 's two major parties until the rise of Labour in the 1920s — and the Social Democratic Party ( a short-lived party founded by members of Labour 's right wing in the 1980s ) , the Liberal Democrats are probably best summarized as the UK 's center party , but the details are more complicated . They were the only major party to oppose the Iraq War , and are more supportive of civil liberties than Labour or the Tories . In the 2010 election , they even carved out some positions to the left of Labour on social spending , such as a promise to abolish tuition fees for universities ( which Blair had introduced in 1998 ) .
But after that election left neither Conservatives nor Labour with a majority , Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg opted to enter a coalition with the Conservatives that — while putting Liberals in power for the first time since World War I — made them complicit in the Tories ' austerity measures , including tuition fee increases . ( Clegg eventually admitted and apologized for breaking promises on that issue . ) The result is that many left-leaning Lib Dem supporters have abandoned the party , and FiveThirtyEight 's model predicts it 'll lose 30 of its 56 seats . Due to the UK 's first-past-the-post election system , Lib Dems typically get fewer seats than their share of the national vote would suggest ; in 2010 , for example , they got 23 percent of the vote ( not far behind Labour with 29 percent , or the Conservatives with 36.1 percent ) but less than 9 percent of the seats . Part of their coalition deal with the Conservatives included a national referendum on a proportional representation system meant to ameliorate this problem , but Britons voted overwhelmingly against the Lib Dems ' proposed reform .
Scottish National Party : This is the big regional player to watch . The majority party in the Scottish Parliament , the SNP was dealt a heavy setback this past fall when the referendum on Scottish independence for which it had fought so hard resulted in a victory for unionists . The SNP 's two main priorities will be increasing the autonomy of Scotland 's regional government and pushing back on austerity . Like all British separatist and irredentist parties , the SNP is strongly social democratic , and has run to Labour 's left on spending issues . It 's expected to gain massively this election , rocketing from 6 seats to 46 , according to FiveThirtyEight 's model ( out of only 59 total seats in Scotland ) , overtaking the Lib Dems as the third biggest party in Parliament .
The UK has a bicameral parliamentary government , and general elections determine the composition of the lower house , the House of Commons . The upper house , the House of Lords , is n't elected , and is instead composed of a mix of hereditary nobility , barons and baronesses given lifetime appointments , and the clergy . But it 's also far less powerful than the elected lower house , the House of Commons , and in most cases ca n't reject legislation that has passed the Commons . So what matters , for the most part , is who controls the Commons , with the head of the biggest party in the Commons typically becoming prime minister .
The Commons ' 650 seats each correspond to a geographical election district known as a `` constituency . '' There are 533 constituencies in England , 59 in Scotland , 40 in Wales , and 18 in Northern Ireland . The number of people in each varies between the four countries , with median constituency populations of 72,400 in England , 69,000 in Scotland , 66,800 in Northern Ireland , and 56,800 in Wales . The upshot is that the Scots , Northern Irish , and Welsh are slightly overrepresented relative to the English . This is a source of some discontent in England , as is the fact that members of Parliament ( MPs ) from outside England get to vote on policies that affect the English , but due to the local Scottish , Northern Irish , and Welsh parliaments , English MPs do n't get the same kind of influence in Scotland , Northern Ireland , and Wales .
You can think of constituencies as somewhat similar to House districts in the US , and the general elections work in much the same way . Each party fields a candidate , the constituency votes , and the candidate with a plurality wins . But there are a few crucial differences . For one thing , primary elections are n't a thing in the UK . Parties pick their candidates using a variety of internal processes that give the leadership and other elites overwhelming power . Partly due to the centralized candidate selection process , the US convention of candidates living in their constituencies is much less strong in the UK . Generally , party leaders run in safe districts to ensure they 'll make it into Parliament , regardless of where they 're actually from .
Every five years , as of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 . Before the act , parliaments lasted for a maximum of five years , but the prime minister had wide latitude in calling early elections if he or she so desired . There were also a number of other ways an early election could be triggered , such as by Parliament failing to pass a spending bill ( an event known as `` loss of supply '' ) . Now only three things can spur an election : reaching the five-year mark ( as happened this time around ) , a two-thirds vote of the Commons calling for a new election , or a majority vote of the Commons saying that `` this House has no confidence in Her Majesty ’ s Government . '' The result is that the prime minister has much less power to control the timing of elections .
The race also features a clutch of small parties , catering either to narrow ideological constituencies or to regional interests that are simply too small to really change the balance of power .
Democratic Unionist Party : The DUP is the dominant Protestant unionist ( that is , in favor of staying in the UK ) party in Northern Ireland . It was the only major Northern Irish party to oppose the Good Friday Accords of 1998 , due to its provisions allowing the early release of IRA terrorists and because it let the Provisional IRA 's political arm , Sinn Féin , participate in the Northern Irish Parliament . However , since the deal , the DUP has become the largest party in the local parliament and currently governs alongside Sinn Féin in a power-sharing arrangement . The party has traditionally been very socially conservative . It was founded by the far-right minister Ian Paisley , who once ran a campaign called `` Save Ulster From Sodomy '' to fight the decriminalization of homosexuality . ( Paisley was also heavily involved in Protestant paramilitary operations during the Troubles . ) FiveThirtyEight 's model projects it to stay at eight seats in the new parliament .
Sinn Féin : Formerly the political wing of the Provisional IRA , Sinn Féin has attempted , since the peace of 1998 , to transition into being a respectable social democratic nationalist party akin to the SNP , competing in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . However , because it does n't recognize the legitimacy of the British government over Northern Ireland , Sinn Féin practices a policy of abstention in the House of Commons : while it runs in elections , its members do n't take their seats or participate in parliamentary business in any way . FiveThirtyEight 's model projects it 'll stay at five seats .
Plaid Cymru : Like the SNP , but for Wales . Plaid Cymru favors Welsh independence , bilingualism through greater use of the Welsh language , and social democracy . It 's considerably less successful than its Scottish counterpart , and is only the third largest party in the Welsh Assembly . FiveThirtyEight 's model projects that it will gain one seat for a total of four , out of 40 Welsh seats total .
Social Democratic and Labour Party : This is the more moderate Catholic Irish nationalist party , relative to Sinn Féin . During the Troubles it was the dominant nationalist party , and consistently rejected violence , in stark contrast to the Sinn Féin/IRA strategy . It was hugely influential in the 1998 peace accords , with leader John Hume winning a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in the negotiations , but has since lost ground after Sinn Féin rejected violence . Like other nationalist parties , it 's social democratic , but unlike the SNP or Plaid Cymru it maintains close ties to the Labour Party , which does n't contest elections in Northern Ireland . FiveThirtyEight 's model projects it will stay at three seats .
Ulster Unionist Party : This is the more moderate alternative to the DUP . While still strongly in favor of union with Britain , and right-leaning on other issues , it stands apart from the DUP for its much greater enthusiasm for the peace process . Its former leader , David Trimble , shared the Nobel with the SDLP 's John Hume for his role in the Good Friday Accords . The UUP has historically been the largest unionist party , but just as the SDLP lost ground to Sinn Féin after Good Friday , the UUP has lost ground to the DUP . FiveThirtyEight 's model projects it will get one seat .
Green Party : The British arm of the Green movement , the Green Party of England and Wales stands apart not just for its environmental views but for its left-wing platform on economic , defense , and social issues . The party calls for a basic income , a wealth tax , withdrawal from NATO , unilateral nuclear disarmament , decriminalization of drugs and prostitution , abolition of the monarchy , looser immigration controls , and an end to `` reliance on economic growth . '' FiveThirtyEight 's model projects it will stay at one seat .
United Kingdom Independence Party : A conservative party devoted to withdrawal from the European Union and harsh controls on immigration , the UKIP is currently the most-represented party from Britain in the European Parliament , with 23 seats out of 73 . But it 's struggled to gain a foothold in the Commons . Its leader , Nigel Farage , has a long history of racist and/or xenophobic provocations , like defending UKIP politicians who call Chinese women `` chinky '' and calling for a ban on HIV-positive people entering the UK . FiveThirtyEight 's model predicts UKIP will lose one of its two seats in the Commons this election .
Respect Party : A socialist party , Respect is usually equated with its leader , George Galloway , who 's been a hugely controversial figure in British politics for decades for his strident opposition to Israel and support for Saddam Hussein , to whom he once said , `` Sir , I salute your courage , your strength , your indefatigability . '' Galloway was a Labour MP for decades before being expelled in the aftermath of the Iraq War for calling on British soldiers to `` refuse to obey illegal orders . '' He then was elected as the sole Respect MP in 2005 from a heavily Muslim district in London ; his Labour opponent , Oona King , accused Galloway and Respect of using anti-Semitic attacks on her Jewish heritage to win .
Galloway lost in 2010 , and then won a special election ( `` by-election , '' in British parlance ) in 2012 to a seat representing part of the city of Bradford in northern England . He 's since continued to court controversy by saying that if Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had sex with women in their sleep , that is n't really rape ( `` not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion '' ) , and for abruptly walking out of a debate at Oxford simply because his opponent was Israeli . He 's running for reelection to his current seat in a characteristically ugly race that has seen him accuse his Labour opponent Naz Shah of lying about her forced marriage in Pakistan ; Shah has accused him of sending someone to impersonate her dead father to dig up marriage records .
Okay , but who 's going to be in charge at the end ?
Hard to say ! What 's nearly certain is that the election will result in a hung parliament , or one in which no party has a majority . At that point there are two options . There could be another coalition government , where two or more parties constituting a majority agree to a joint platform and share power .
But that appears unlikely . Taking Sinn Féin 's abstentions into account , 323 seats are needed for a majority . While Conservatives and Lib Dems were able to piece together a coalition last time around , FiveThirtyEight 's model projects they 'll only have a total of 307 seats . Even with the 10 expected MPs from the DUP , UKIP , and UUP added in ( which would be a tough coalition to manage , especially with the Lib Dems still there ) , they come up short .
Labour also has a tough task ahead , though perhaps not quite as tough . If you add up their expected seats with those of SNP , Plaid Cymru , SDLP , and the Greens , you get 326 seats . Huzzah ! But there 's a big problem here . With the exception of the Greens , those are all parties that are dedicated to the dissolution of the United Kingdom . Naturally , Labour does n't like the idea of governing in coalition with them . Miliband has explicitly ruled out any sort of deal with the SNP , saying , `` If the price of having a Labour government is a deal or coalition with the SNP , it ’ s not going to happen . '' He 's said the same goes for Plaid Cymru .
Leaders Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru and Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP have said that Labour has to deal with them , sooner or later . Wood stated that Plaid would be open to working with Labour , provided their budget avoids cuts that hurt the poor . `` We 've offered out our hand to Ed Miliband in order to set up that alternative government and he 's arrogantly pushed that hand away , '' Wood told the BBC . Sturgeon similarly expects concessions on spending , saying , `` I ’ m just facing up to reality . A minority government can ’ t govern without support from other parties . Either Ed Miliband will accept that , or he won ’ t . '' SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell has taken a less confrontational stance , saying he 'll support a Miliband government , but that `` along with the SNP and Plaid Cymru , [ we ] will ensure that the next Labour government remains true to its values . ''
Okay , but Miliband says he wo n't make a deal . What then ?
The other option is a minority government , in which either Cameron or Miliband is prime minister and passes legislation by appealing to other parties on a case-by-case basis . This could also include formal deals short of a full coalition , such as a `` confidence and supply agreement , '' in which parties agree to support the government 's budget and to not vote for `` no-confidence '' motions that would topple the government . But Miliband has suggested even that much would be a deal too far for Labour .
That leaves a `` vote-by-vote '' situation , in which the government , led by either Cameron or Miliband , is constantly scrounging for support from other parties . Historically , this kind of situation has n't lasted for long . The Conservative Party lost its majority in December 1996 and called elections mere months later . Similarly , a deal between the ruling Labour Party and Liberals collapsed in September 1978 , and the Labour government was toppled by a no-confidence vote the following May . A Labour minority government elected in February 1974 was so unstable that elections were called again that October .
But it 's harder to call early elections because of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 . Basically , either two-thirds of the House of Commons would have to vote for a new election , or a majority would have to vote no confidence in the government . The latter is certainly possible if the parties in opposition think they 'd do better in a rematch . But it 's likely they 'll enjoy their influence in the opposition , and the minority government is the one that 'll grow frustrated with their lack of power . Theoretically the government could team up with some of the opposition to vote no confidence in itself , but that 'd look pretty bad .
Let 's say both the Conservatives and Labour want a minority government . Who gets it ?
Again , hard to say . David Cameron stays in power until he 's able to recommend a successor to the Queen ( or until he resigns ) . His first big test will be the `` Queen 's Speech , '' scheduled for May 27 . This is an event held annually in which the Queen addresses Parliament and lays out the government 's proposed agenda . There is then a debate over that agenda and a vote . It used to be that a failure to win a Queen 's Speech vote meant a government fell . That 's no longer the case , but there would be considerable pressure on a prime minister who lost a Queen 's Speech vote to resign . `` The Fixed-term Parliaments Act says defeat on this motion does not necessarily qualify as a no-confidence motion , but the weight of political history means that defeat will lead directly to resignation , '' the Guardian 's Alan Travis explains .
If Cameron loses the vote , then Labour would almost certainly call a no-confidence vote and , upon winning , have 14 days to win a confidence vote on its own . If the Conservatives ' vote fails , and Labour 's fails two weeks later , then new , early elections are called .
That 's the formal process . But in practice there 's going to be tons of negotiating among all of the parties , and the main action wo n't be happening in formal venues . It 's even possible that the Queen 's Speech will be delayed if the Crown wants to give the parties more time to work things out . The situation at the moment , with an election all but guaranteeing a tenuous minority government , is truly unprecedented . As the Independent 's Matt Dathan notes , the only previous time Elizabeth II has skipped a Queen 's Speech was in 1963 , when she was pregnant with Prince Edward .
Definitely . Travis , Dathan , and the BBC all have great explainers on the government formation process . The BBC also has a good rundown of what the various parties have said about possible deals . Do n't expect them to keep all their pledges , but the list is a good guide to their negotiating postures after the elections .
I ca n't recommend FiveThirtyEight 's projections highly enough ; they 're the most rigorous I 've seen on the race . Credit goes to Chris Hanretty , Ben Lauderdale and Nick Vivyan of electionforecast.co.uk , who designed the model . For more basic information on the British system of government , try this piece I wrote for the Washington Post before the 2010 election .","This Thursday, the United Kingdom goes to the polls to elect all 650 members of the House of Commons. At the moment, it's looking like Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party is set to lose seats, but will still have more than any other party. That could leave Cameron with a precarious hold on power — or let Labour Party leader Ed Miliband swoop in and try to form a shaky government of his own.

Either way, it's likely to be an unusual situation for a country that does not have a history of the kind of drawn-out coalition formation negotiations that are common in some parts of Europe.

Who is running?

The UK has a bunch of political parties represented in its parliament. Of them, two are running for a shot to run the country, two are running for a serious chance at influencing the direction of the country, and the rest are really just there to make a point. Here are brief profiles of the four most important parties in the race; further down we'll cover the minor players.

The contenders

Conservative Party: The traditional right-wing party in Britain, the Tories have been the dominant force in the Commons since 2010, with Cameron and his Chancellor of the Exchequer (sort of like the treasury secretary in the US, but way more powerful) George Osborne imposing a severe austerity package on the country in the wake of the financial crisis, a policy which many economists believed hampered the recovery.

While the Conservatives fell far behind in polls in the middle of their tenure, the economy has since started growing more quickly, and they've pulled slightly ahead. FiveThirtyEight's model predicts they'll lose 21 seats for a total of 281 — below the 326 needed for a majority, but enough to keep them as the biggest party in the Commons.

Labour Party: In power from 1997 to 2010, Labour — the social democratic party of Britain, with a strong base of support in the union movement — surprised many by electing Ed Miliband, who had served in defeated Prime Minister Gordon Brown's cabinet as secretary of state for energy and climate change, as leader, besting Ed's brother David, who was Brown's foreign secretary and the favorite to succeed him. Ed is widely considered to the left of both Brown and Brown's predecessor, Tony Blair, condemning Blair's participation in the Iraq War and criticizing Blair's ""New Labour"" platform as insufficiently tough on big business. (Blair, in turn, has vocally criticized Miliband.) But his platform — which he has dubbed ""One Nation Labour"" — is also populist in ways that aren't traditionally left-wing. Most notably, Miliband is considerably more skeptical of immigration than Brown or Blair were.

The influencers

Liberal Democrats: Formed out of a merger of the Liberal Party — which, along with the Conservatives, was one of Britain's two major parties until the rise of Labour in the 1920s — and the Social Democratic Party (a short-lived party founded by members of Labour's right wing in the 1980s), the Liberal Democrats are probably best summarized as the UK's center party, but the details are more complicated. They were the only major party to oppose the Iraq War, and are more supportive of civil liberties than Labour or the Tories. In the 2010 election, they even carved out some positions to the left of Labour on social spending, such as a promise to abolish tuition fees for universities (which Blair had introduced in 1998).

But after that election left neither Conservatives nor Labour with a majority, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg opted to enter a coalition with the Conservatives that — while putting Liberals in power for the first time since World War I — made them complicit in the Tories' austerity measures, including tuition fee increases. (Clegg eventually admitted and apologized for breaking promises on that issue.) The result is that many left-leaning Lib Dem supporters have abandoned the party, and FiveThirtyEight's model predicts it'll lose 30 of its 56 seats. Due to the UK's first-past-the-post election system, Lib Dems typically get fewer seats than their share of the national vote would suggest; in 2010, for example, they got 23 percent of the vote (not far behind Labour with 29 percent, or the Conservatives with 36.1 percent) but less than 9 percent of the seats. Part of their coalition deal with the Conservatives included a national referendum on a proportional representation system meant to ameliorate this problem, but Britons voted overwhelmingly against the Lib Dems' proposed reform.

Scottish National Party: This is the big regional player to watch. The majority party in the Scottish Parliament, the SNP was dealt a heavy setback this past fall when the referendum on Scottish independence for which it had fought so hard resulted in a victory for unionists. The SNP's two main priorities will be increasing the autonomy of Scotland's regional government and pushing back on austerity. Like all British separatist and irredentist parties, the SNP is strongly social democratic, and has run to Labour's left on spending issues. It's expected to gain massively this election, rocketing from 6 seats to 46, according to FiveThirtyEight's model (out of only 59 total seats in Scotland), overtaking the Lib Dems as the third biggest party in Parliament.

Who's up for election this year, exactly?

The UK has a bicameral parliamentary government, and general elections determine the composition of the lower house, the House of Commons. The upper house, the House of Lords, isn't elected, and is instead composed of a mix of hereditary nobility, barons and baronesses given lifetime appointments, and the clergy. But it's also far less powerful than the elected lower house, the House of Commons, and in most cases can't reject legislation that has passed the Commons. So what matters, for the most part, is who controls the Commons, with the head of the biggest party in the Commons typically becoming prime minister.

How does the election work?

The Commons' 650 seats each correspond to a geographical election district known as a ""constituency."" There are 533 constituencies in England, 59 in Scotland, 40 in Wales, and 18 in Northern Ireland. The number of people in each varies between the four countries, with median constituency populations of 72,400 in England, 69,000 in Scotland, 66,800 in Northern Ireland, and 56,800 in Wales. The upshot is that the Scots, Northern Irish, and Welsh are slightly overrepresented relative to the English. This is a source of some discontent in England, as is the fact that members of Parliament (MPs) from outside England get to vote on policies that affect the English, but due to the local Scottish, Northern Irish, and Welsh parliaments, English MPs don't get the same kind of influence in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales.

You can think of constituencies as somewhat similar to House districts in the US, and the general elections work in much the same way. Each party fields a candidate, the constituency votes, and the candidate with a plurality wins. But there are a few crucial differences. For one thing, primary elections aren't a thing in the UK. Parties pick their candidates using a variety of internal processes that give the leadership and other elites overwhelming power. Partly due to the centralized candidate selection process, the US convention of candidates living in their constituencies is much less strong in the UK. Generally, party leaders run in safe districts to ensure they'll make it into Parliament, regardless of where they're actually from.

How often do elections take place?

Every five years, as of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. Before the act, parliaments lasted for a maximum of five years, but the prime minister had wide latitude in calling early elections if he or she so desired. There were also a number of other ways an early election could be triggered, such as by Parliament failing to pass a spending bill (an event known as ""loss of supply""). Now only three things can spur an election: reaching the five-year mark (as happened this time around), a two-thirds vote of the Commons calling for a new election, or a majority vote of the Commons saying that ""this House has no confidence in Her Majesty’s Government."" The result is that the prime minister has much less power to control the timing of elections.

What are the minor parties running?

The race also features a clutch of small parties, catering either to narrow ideological constituencies or to regional interests that are simply too small to really change the balance of power.

Democratic Unionist Party: The DUP is the dominant Protestant unionist (that is, in favor of staying in the UK) party in Northern Ireland. It was the only major Northern Irish party to oppose the Good Friday Accords of 1998, due to its provisions allowing the early release of IRA terrorists and because it let the Provisional IRA's political arm, Sinn Féin, participate in the Northern Irish Parliament. However, since the deal, the DUP has become the largest party in the local parliament and currently governs alongside Sinn Féin in a power-sharing arrangement. The party has traditionally been very socially conservative. It was founded by the far-right minister Ian Paisley, who once ran a campaign called ""Save Ulster From Sodomy"" to fight the decriminalization of homosexuality. (Paisley was also heavily involved in Protestant paramilitary operations during the Troubles.) FiveThirtyEight's model projects it to stay at eight seats in the new parliament.

Sinn Féin: Formerly the political wing of the Provisional IRA, Sinn Féin has attempted, since the peace of 1998, to transition into being a respectable social democratic nationalist party akin to the SNP, competing in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, because it doesn't recognize the legitimacy of the British government over Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin practices a policy of abstention in the House of Commons: while it runs in elections, its members don't take their seats or participate in parliamentary business in any way. FiveThirtyEight's model projects it'll stay at five seats.

Plaid Cymru: Like the SNP, but for Wales. Plaid Cymru favors Welsh independence, bilingualism through greater use of the Welsh language, and social democracy. It's considerably less successful than its Scottish counterpart, and is only the third largest party in the Welsh Assembly. FiveThirtyEight's model projects that it will gain one seat for a total of four, out of 40 Welsh seats total.

Social Democratic and Labour Party: This is the more moderate Catholic Irish nationalist party, relative to Sinn Féin. During the Troubles it was the dominant nationalist party, and consistently rejected violence, in stark contrast to the Sinn Féin/IRA strategy. It was hugely influential in the 1998 peace accords, with leader John Hume winning a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in the negotiations, but has since lost ground after Sinn Féin rejected violence. Like other nationalist parties, it's social democratic, but unlike the SNP or Plaid Cymru it maintains close ties to the Labour Party, which doesn't contest elections in Northern Ireland. FiveThirtyEight's model projects it will stay at three seats.

Ulster Unionist Party: This is the more moderate alternative to the DUP. While still strongly in favor of union with Britain, and right-leaning on other issues, it stands apart from the DUP for its much greater enthusiasm for the peace process. Its former leader, David Trimble, shared the Nobel with the SDLP's John Hume for his role in the Good Friday Accords. The UUP has historically been the largest unionist party, but just as the SDLP lost ground to Sinn Féin after Good Friday, the UUP has lost ground to the DUP. FiveThirtyEight's model projects it will get one seat.

Green Party: The British arm of the Green movement, the Green Party of England and Wales stands apart not just for its environmental views but for its left-wing platform on economic, defense, and social issues. The party calls for a basic income, a wealth tax, withdrawal from NATO, unilateral nuclear disarmament, decriminalization of drugs and prostitution, abolition of the monarchy, looser immigration controls, and an end to ""reliance on economic growth."" FiveThirtyEight's model projects it will stay at one seat.

United Kingdom Independence Party: A conservative party devoted to withdrawal from the European Union and harsh controls on immigration, the UKIP is currently the most-represented party from Britain in the European Parliament, with 23 seats out of 73. But it's struggled to gain a foothold in the Commons. Its leader, Nigel Farage, has a long history of racist and/or xenophobic provocations, like defending UKIP politicians who call Chinese women ""chinky"" and calling for a ban on HIV-positive people entering the UK. FiveThirtyEight's model predicts UKIP will lose one of its two seats in the Commons this election.

Respect Party: A socialist party, Respect is usually equated with its leader, George Galloway, who's been a hugely controversial figure in British politics for decades for his strident opposition to Israel and support for Saddam Hussein, to whom he once said, ""Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability."" Galloway was a Labour MP for decades before being expelled in the aftermath of the Iraq War for calling on British soldiers to ""refuse to obey illegal orders."" He then was elected as the sole Respect MP in 2005 from a heavily Muslim district in London; his Labour opponent, Oona King, accused Galloway and Respect of using anti-Semitic attacks on her Jewish heritage to win.

Galloway lost in 2010, and then won a special election (""by-election,"" in British parlance) in 2012 to a seat representing part of the city of Bradford in northern England. He's since continued to court controversy by saying that if Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had sex with women in their sleep, that isn't really rape (""not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion""), and for abruptly walking out of a debate at Oxford simply because his opponent was Israeli. He's running for reelection to his current seat in a characteristically ugly race that has seen him accuse his Labour opponent Naz Shah of lying about her forced marriage in Pakistan; Shah has accused him of sending someone to impersonate her dead father to dig up marriage records.

Okay, but who's going to be in charge at the end?

Hard to say! What's nearly certain is that the election will result in a hung parliament, or one in which no party has a majority. At that point there are two options. There could be another coalition government, where two or more parties constituting a majority agree to a joint platform and share power.

But that appears unlikely. Taking Sinn Féin's abstentions into account, 323 seats are needed for a majority. While Conservatives and Lib Dems were able to piece together a coalition last time around, FiveThirtyEight's model projects they'll only have a total of 307 seats. Even with the 10 expected MPs from the DUP, UKIP, and UUP added in (which would be a tough coalition to manage, especially with the Lib Dems still there), they come up short.

Labour also has a tough task ahead, though perhaps not quite as tough. If you add up their expected seats with those of SNP, Plaid Cymru, SDLP, and the Greens, you get 326 seats. Huzzah! But there's a big problem here. With the exception of the Greens, those are all parties that are dedicated to the dissolution of the United Kingdom. Naturally, Labour doesn't like the idea of governing in coalition with them. Miliband has explicitly ruled out any sort of deal with the SNP, saying, ""If the price of having a Labour government is a deal or coalition with the SNP, it’s not going to happen."" He's said the same goes for Plaid Cymru.

Leaders Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru and Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP have said that Labour has to deal with them, sooner or later. Wood stated that Plaid would be open to working with Labour, provided their budget avoids cuts that hurt the poor. ""We've offered out our hand to Ed Miliband in order to set up that alternative government and he's arrogantly pushed that hand away,"" Wood told the BBC. Sturgeon similarly expects concessions on spending, saying, ""I’m just facing up to reality. A minority government can’t govern without support from other parties. Either Ed Miliband will accept that, or he won’t."" SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell has taken a less confrontational stance, saying he'll support a Miliband government, but that ""along with the SNP and Plaid Cymru, [we] will ensure that the next Labour government remains true to its values.""

Okay, but Miliband says he won't make a deal. What then?

The other option is a minority government, in which either Cameron or Miliband is prime minister and passes legislation by appealing to other parties on a case-by-case basis. This could also include formal deals short of a full coalition, such as a ""confidence and supply agreement,"" in which parties agree to support the government's budget and to not vote for ""no-confidence"" motions that would topple the government. But Miliband has suggested even that much would be a deal too far for Labour.

That leaves a ""vote-by-vote"" situation, in which the government, led by either Cameron or Miliband, is constantly scrounging for support from other parties. Historically, this kind of situation hasn't lasted for long. The Conservative Party lost its majority in December 1996 and called elections mere months later. Similarly, a deal between the ruling Labour Party and Liberals collapsed in September 1978, and the Labour government was toppled by a no-confidence vote the following May. A Labour minority government elected in February 1974 was so unstable that elections were called again that October.

But it's harder to call early elections because of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. Basically, either two-thirds of the House of Commons would have to vote for a new election, or a majority would have to vote no confidence in the government. The latter is certainly possible if the parties in opposition think they'd do better in a rematch. But it's likely they'll enjoy their influence in the opposition, and the minority government is the one that'll grow frustrated with their lack of power. Theoretically the government could team up with some of the opposition to vote no confidence in itself, but that'd look pretty bad.

Let's say both the Conservatives and Labour want a minority government. Who gets it?

Again, hard to say. David Cameron stays in power until he's able to recommend a successor to the Queen (or until he resigns). His first big test will be the ""Queen's Speech,"" scheduled for May 27. This is an event held annually in which the Queen addresses Parliament and lays out the government's proposed agenda. There is then a debate over that agenda and a vote. It used to be that a failure to win a Queen's Speech vote meant a government fell. That's no longer the case, but there would be considerable pressure on a prime minister who lost a Queen's Speech vote to resign. ""The Fixed-term Parliaments Act says defeat on this motion does not necessarily qualify as a no-confidence motion, but the weight of political history means that defeat will lead directly to resignation,"" the Guardian's Alan Travis explains.

If Cameron loses the vote, then Labour would almost certainly call a no-confidence vote and, upon winning, have 14 days to win a confidence vote on its own. If the Conservatives' vote fails, and Labour's fails two weeks later, then new, early elections are called.

That's the formal process. But in practice there's going to be tons of negotiating among all of the parties, and the main action won't be happening in formal venues. It's even possible that the Queen's Speech will be delayed if the Crown wants to give the parties more time to work things out. The situation at the moment, with an election all but guaranteeing a tenuous minority government, is truly unprecedented. As the Independent's Matt Dathan notes, the only previous time Elizabeth II has skipped a Queen's Speech was in 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Edward.

I'm still confused. Can I read more?

Definitely. Travis, Dathan, and the BBC all have great explainers on the government formation process. The BBC also has a good rundown of what the various parties have said about possible deals. Don't expect them to keep all their pledges, but the list is a good guide to their negotiating postures after the elections.

( Rebecca Naden/Reuters )
The question looms large over the future of the Tory party , British politics , and Brexit .
‘ Can Boris Beat Boris ? ” the Remainer classes have been wondering since Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt emerged two weeks ago from the scrum of Tory leadership hopefuls to take their campaigns to the party grassroots , which will finally choose between them . It ’ s not so much a question as a heartfelt plea from leading figures in the May Cabinet , including Theresa May herself and chancellor Philip Hammond , many Tory placeholders ( thirty is the latest figure ) lower down , their sympathizers in the media , the establishment , and the metropolitan chattering classes .
With less than two weeks to go before by the 22nd of July , when the votes will be counted , it ’ s starting to look like Boris may try to beat himself , but he won ’ t come near to succeeding .
That ’ s because Boris is the firm — no , undislodgeable — favorite of most Tory activists . And that in turn is not only because they have long liked his deceptively Bertie Wooster-ish public persona , but because he has become a progressively firmer Brexiteer in the three years since he declared for Leave in the 2016 referendum . And , finally , achieving Brexit is what the Tory leadership election is all about .
For exactly the same reason , Boris is deeply disliked — loathed , despised , horribly murdered in their dreams — by Remainers everywhere .
That dislike has grown into a pathological and scarcely sane hatred among those ultra-Remainers in influential positions who use the most vicious language to level the most extravagant allegations against him in the hope of upsetting his apple cart . They felt a tremulous excitement a mere two weeks ago when , against all the odds , it seemed that he might have unexpectedly beaten himself . It was reported that his neighbors had called the police to complain that sounds of screaming and shouting were coming from the apartment of his girlfriend , Carrie Symonds . The neighbors feared , they later said , that she was at risk of domestic violence .
Still better — sorry , far worse — the neighbors had recorded the shouts from the flat , which included “ get off me ” and “ you have no respect for money ” from Ms. Symonds but also “ get off my fu * * ing laptop ” from Boris . After calling the police , moreover , they then responsibly handed the tape to the Guardian newspaper . Later reports revealed that the police had visited the Boris-and-Carrie apartment to check on the domestic situation and found no reason for concern . Their neighbors on the other hand did give rise to concern or at least to greater curiosity . They turned out to be left-wing Remainer “ luvvies ” in receipt of a playwrighting grant from the EU and in the grip of terminal anti-Boris hysteria .
Before we tut-tut too loudly , let ’ s admit that the idea of EU playwrighting grants has a kind of loony charm — reminiscent of the suggestion from Barrie Humphries , in his guise as Sir Les Patterson , Australia ’ s cultural attaché to the Court of Saint James , of an Aussie government ’ s “ poem-development grant. ” Once again real life competes with satire and causes us to ponder more deeply the complaining neighbors . Was their call to the cops a case of doing research for their pro-EU play — What Every Woman Knows about Brexiteers perhaps , or All ’ s Well That Ends Brexit ?
We must await enlightenment until the play ’ s first night . . . if there is one .
Boris and Ms. Symonds , meanwhile , remain together , and both have refused to discuss their private lives . Instead of doing so , they carelessly mislaid a photograph , later found and published by others , that showed them gazing mistily into each other ’ s eyes in a garden . A potential scandal was thus transformed into a modern rom-com : Love Conquers the Media . The innocent explanation of this row , as one friendly columnist wrote drily , is that they are “ a married couple ” — which they reportedly intend to be once his divorce is finalized . Unless Ms. Symonds now storms out in tears before July 22nd , Boris is safe .
But the mainstream media , including more or less conservative columnists and reporters , reluctant to let the story die , carried on discussing it in the context of their reflections on domestic violence and how important it was for politicians and the Tory party to repudiate such heinous crimes . Boris ’ s surviving rival for the Tory leadership , Jeremy Hunt , called on him several times to explain what had happened and , more generally , to submit himself to more debates and cross-examinations by the media . If he failed to do so , Hunt opined , he would , regrettably , incur the shameful charge of cowardice .
Boris wisely declined to indict himself in this way , since denying he was guilty of domestic abuse would have both linked him to it and invited the famous retort from Mandy Rice-Davies of Profumo scandal fame : “ Well , he would , wouldn ’ t he ? ” He was also able to put the story behind him because the lust of his media critics to find him guilty of spouse-abuse was so obvious that it more or less excused him . Boris ’ s sins may be scarlet — infidelity , mistresses , etc . — but they are sins modern culture indulges almost as much as it condemns moralizing criticism of them .
Boris moved determinedly to change the subject back to Brexit , and he was helped by a series of clumsy fluffs from Hunt on the topic , one suggesting Leavers were Little Englanders , that seemed to indicate his conversion from Remainer to Leaver was less than skin-deep . Neither his charges of “ cowardice ” nor these verbal miscues derailed Hunt ’ s campaign , but they slightly damaged his twin reputation as Boy Scout and Safe Pair of Hands . And , of course , he never looked close to beating Boris .
Once Hunt no longer seemed a serious obstacle to him , Boris ’ s enemies in the Remainer media set about destroying his personal reputation ( which includes but goes beyond his political reputation ) so thoroughly that even if he wins the Tory leadership , he will be too damaged to govern or maybe even to secure and retain the premiership . Article after article — including one in the Times based on interviews with his former girlfriends — ransacked the thesaurus in search of synonyms for “ fool ” and “ villain. ” Words like “ poltroon , ” “ liar , ” “ fraud , ” “ irresponsible , ” “ unreliable , ” etc. , were scattered freely like black confetti over the news and comment pages . Any pretense of impartiality or fairness was cast aside in order to denigrate not only Boris but also anyone who supported him . No evidence needed ; righteous indignation more than enough justification .
Sorry to say this , Yanks , but low though Fleet Street journalism can sink , one could see in this still-deeper descent into the Slough of Despond the influence of American journalism in the pursuit of Trump .
Despite being subjected to such an onslaught , Boris has refrained from responding in kind to personal attacks since he resigned from Theresa May ’ s Cabinet following her initial betrayal of Brexit at Chequers last year . His long , quiet campaign for the leadership has been rooted in principled disagreement with government policy and expressed in moderate terms . Much of the time he ’ s been rebutting malicious attacks with jokes . He apparently wants to preserve his overall image as a Happy Warrior for the general-election campaign . He ’ s kept himself under wraps .
By the weekend just gone , support for Boris among Tory activists had scarcely wobbled despite the dying scandal-mania . The papers were full of front-page reports about Boris ’ s former rivals queuing up for cabinet jobs and civil servants who had helped May negotiate her Withdrawal Agreement either leaving for well-paid city positions or being promised ambassadorships to get them out of Whitehall to make room for Leave-minded bureaucrats . The Boris–Hunt election drama may drag on for another ten days , but it became “ the most colossal bore ” ten days ago .
Even if Boris has seemingly won , the battle over Brexit is not done .
Back in the pre-historic 1940s , a Labour MP remarked about left-wing firebrand Aneurin Bevan : “ Of course , Nye is his own worst enemy . ”
“ Not while I ’ m alive , ‘ e ain ’ t , ” retorted the great anti-Communist Labour foreign secretary Ernie Bevin .
Similarly , since Boris can ’ t beat Boris , and since the media has failed to do so , others are lining up to do it for him .
There is still in theory a potential majority for Remain among all MPs . But such is the power of the executive in Parliament that a prime minister determined to achieve Brexit by October 31st , as Boris has promised to do , may well pull it off even if he has to “ prorogue ” ( in effect , suspend ) Parliament beyond that date to do so . Remainers on all sides have therefore set their minds to working out how to prevent Boris becoming PM even if he wins the Tory leadership contest .
Academics such as those in the Constitutional Unit at University College London have set out a series of hopeful scenarios in which hardline Tory rebels vote against a Boris government on a confidence motion , thus precipitating its fall , or even manage to block his appointment by informing the Queen that he won ’ t get their votes and so can ’ t command a majority in the Commons . After all , say the gifted academics accurately , the Tory party has a majority too small to withstand a sizeable rebellion .
Hardline Tory Remainers like Dominic Grieve , a former attorney general and anti-Brexit fanatic , have welcomed this academic encouragement by stating publicly that they will cross the floor to the opposition benches to prevent the government pushing through a no-deal Brexit . ( And just in case you think the description “ anti-Brexit fanatic ” applied to Grieve is too harsh , he has been advocating votes against legislation and spending unrelated to Brexit to ensure either that Brexit can ’ t happen or that if it does , it will damage the country and particular groups more harshly . )
Other reports claim that the chancellor , Philip Hammond , promised to allow Prime Minister May ’ s “ legacy ” spending plans to go ahead , even though he regards them as wildly beyond the U.K. ’ s means , in return for her blocking Brexit at all costs . Thus , it was suggested that the government whips would allow a de facto “ free vote ” on one of Grieve ’ s poison-pill amendments earlier today . We ’ ll never know if this report was accurate because , to Grieve ’ s frustration , his amendment was rejected by the deputy speaker and was never debated . Interestingly , that was the third such amendment from the guerrilla Remainers not to make it to debate . So nervousness about these tactics may be growing among parliamentary officials .
As will be obvious to a normal person , there are a number of problems with the approaches of Grieve and Hammond , starting with the fact that they are transparently fanatical . That alone would deter some anti-Brexit Tories from going along with them — and there are at most only 30 hardline rebels to start with .
Also , if they were to mount a rebellion aimed at preventing Boris ’ s becoming PM , that would be seen by voters as the surest sign that Remainers and by extension this Parliament were setting their collective face like flint ( and unmasked ) against the clear popular will as demonstrated in the referendum . That prospect would frighten many rebellious MPs on both sides of the House from going along with it . And small numbers count in this delicate game .
If only a handful of Labour MPs in constituencies that voted Leave heavily in 2016 were either to vote for a Boris-led Government or even merely to abstain in a no-confidence vote , Boris and Brexit would survive . As for preventing Boris from using such aggressive tactics as “ proroguing ” Parliament to get Brexit through — a move last used in 1949 by Attlee ’ s Labour government to get its nationalization program through — the hardline Remainers have been so willing to junk such long-established constitutional conventions as the speaker ’ s impartiality and cabinet ’ s collective responsibility in order to derail Brexit that their claim that prorogation would be illegal and unconstitutional rings both hollow and tinny .
That said , we probably won ’ t know until late summer if the parliamentary guerrillas of Remain are able to stop Boris or Brexit or both . Even if they succeed in those aims , however , Boris will still not be beaten .
Suppose , for instance , that Boris were to lose a key vote . An ignored point in all these scenarios is that Boris would remain Tory leader in charge of the Tory machine even if he were to lose the prime ministership in a parliamentary vote of confidence . What would then happen is that his government would remain in office for two weeks while other potential PMs tried to gather enough supporters to assemble a different majority . Given that Boris would have the backing of the Democratic Unionists and the vast majority of Tories , that would mean adding MPs from Labour , the Lib-Dems , and the Scottish and Welsh nationalists to dissident Tories to reach 319 votes . That almost certainly can ’ t happen . So at the end of two weeks , Boris would either win the second vote of confidence or lose it and precipitate a general election .
Remember that in either case Boris controls the party machine . He gets to write the Tory manifesto , including its provision on Brexit . He runs the candidate-selection and , crucially , de-selection processes . He can strike electoral deals with other parties like , well , the Brexit party . What would be his best option ?
The smart money believes that since the Tories absolutely must obtain Brexit to win an election , Boris will have to accept a modified May deal from Europe that , for instance , no longer includes the Northern Ireland backstop and thus the threat of indefinite “ vassalship ” to the EU . That might pass Parliament . Boris could then claim he had got Brexit and might just win an election later — since he is currently enjoying favorable opinion polls that suggest he could win an election with a clear working majority as former Tories return to the fold .
The fallacy with that argument is that the neither the Tory activists now voting for Boris nor the former Tories and other Leavers now joining the Brexit party would regard any deal that resembles May ’ s Withdrawal Agreement as Brexit . Maybe they ’ re wrong , but they seem determined on that point . And if Boris were to tell them that he sincerely believed his version of May ’ s deal to be Brexit , they would walk sadly away , saying something on the lines of “ Say it ain ’ t so , Boris. ” The Tory party ’ s ratings in the polls would fall back to a little above where they were on Euro-election day six weeks ago . That figure was , oh yes , 9 percent . Boris would therefore beat Boris quite handily if he were to follow the smart money .
His other option would be to go for a “ Clean Brexit ” — one in which the U.K. is no longer bound by EU regulations and the jurisdiction of the European courts — lose the parliamentary vote on it , and then fight an election with such a Brexit as his main manifesto pledge . He would make support for the Tory manifesto a condition of candidate selection , de-select those Tory MPs who had helped vote down his policy in Parliament , and wage a rip-roaring patriotic campaign to redeem the promise of the 2016 referendum .
I ’ m pretty sure this would be a magnificent example of political theatre , but it would run slap-bang right into a brick wall on which is written “ You Can ’ t Trust the Tories. ” And since the Tories have indeed not delivered Brexit , they would lack the level of public trust sufficient to give them an election victory . Theresa May and her spavined colleagues would be responsible for that distrust , but life is unfair and Boris would carry the can . He would lose millions of votes to Nigel Farage and the Brexit party , which would be waging a very similar election campaign with the advantage that the Brexit party is too new to have betrayed anyone .
I can not predict exactly how many votes each of these two parties would get in what would be a tumultuous campaign . I recently made some tongue-in-cheek predictions , disguised as a future history of the present , in the Australian magazine Quadrant . But the Brexit party is still polling above 20 percent in opinion polls ; it has just attracted 6,000 people to an impressive political rally in Birmingham ; it has an effective and popular leader in Farage ; and it has put together a strong organization and set of ideas stressing in particular a devotion to democracy that the Remainer Tories plainly lack . It can ’ t be dismissed , and it won ’ t fade away , as some optimistic Tories such as Iain Martin in the Times , fervently hope .
We can now finally answer the question with which I began : Boris can beat Boris , Nigel can beat Boris , Boris can beat Nigel , and Nigel can beat Nigel if they fail to reach an electoral deal . The same characters can also save the same characters if they reach such a deal . Its broad shape can be easily envisaged : Boris would give Brexit party candidates a free run in a number of seats now held by Labour and the Liberal Democrats — especially those Labour seats that voted heavily Leave in the referendum . Nigel in return would agree not to put up Brexit candidates in seats now held by Tories . Of course , that would all require a lot of haggling over details — would there be a joint manifesto , for instance ? And numbers—how many seats would Boris have to “ give ” Nigel ? And risks—would there be walkouts in both parties ?
But Nigel and Boris can save Nigel and Boris — and it ’ s not clear that anyone else can .","Boris Johnson, a leadership candidate for Britain’s Conservative Party, speaks during a hustings event in Britain, July 6, 2019. (Rebecca Naden/Reuters)

As for preventing Boris from using such aggressive tactics as “proroguing” Parliament to get Brexit through — a move last used in 1949 by Attlee’s Labour government to get its nationalization program through — the hardline Remainers have been so willing to junk such long-established constitutional conventions as the speaker’s impartiality and cabinet’s collective responsibility in order to derail Brexit that their claim that prorogation would be illegal and unconstitutional rings both hollow and tinny.

That said, we probably won’t know until late summer if the parliamentary guerrillas of Remain are able to stop Boris or Brexit or both. Even if they succeed in those aims, however, Boris will still not be beaten.

Suppose, for instance, that Boris were to lose a key vote. An ignored point in all these scenarios is that Boris would remain Tory leader in charge of the Tory machine even if he were to lose the prime ministership in a parliamentary vote of confidence. What would then happen is that his government would remain in office for two weeks while other potential PMs tried to gather enough supporters to assemble a different majority. Given that Boris would have the backing of the Democratic Unionists and the vast majority of Tories, that would mean adding MPs from Labour, the Lib-Dems, and the Scottish and Welsh nationalists to dissident Tories to reach 319 votes. That almost certainly can’t happen. So at the end of two weeks, Boris would either win the second vote of confidence or lose it and precipitate a general election.

Remember that in either case Boris controls the party machine. He gets to write the Tory manifesto, including its provision on Brexit. He runs the candidate-selection and, crucially, de-selection processes. He can strike electoral deals with other parties like, well, the Brexit party. What would be his best option?

The smart money believes that since the Tories absolutely must obtain Brexit to win an election, Boris will have to accept a modified May deal from Europe that, for instance, no longer includes the Northern Ireland backstop and thus the threat of indefinite “vassalship” to the EU. That might pass Parliament. Boris could then claim he had got Brexit and might just win an election later — since he is currently enjoying favorable opinion polls that suggest he could win an election with a clear working majority as former Tories return to the fold.

The fallacy with that argument is that the neither the Tory activists now voting for Boris nor the former Tories and other Leavers now joining the Brexit party would regard any deal that resembles May’s Withdrawal Agreement as Brexit. Maybe they’re wrong, but they seem determined on that point. And if Boris were to tell them that he sincerely believed his version of May’s deal to be Brexit, they would walk sadly away, saying something on the lines of “Say it ain’t so, Boris.” The Tory party’s ratings in the polls would fall back to a little above where they were on Euro-election day six weeks ago. That figure was, oh yes, 9 percent. Boris would therefore beat Boris quite handily if he were to follow the smart money.

His other option would be to go for a “Clean Brexit” — one in which the U.K. is no longer bound by EU regulations and the jurisdiction of the European courts — lose the parliamentary vote on it, and then fight an election with such a Brexit as his main manifesto pledge. He would make support for the Tory manifesto a condition of candidate selection, de-select those Tory MPs who had helped vote down his policy in Parliament, and wage a rip-roaring patriotic campaign to redeem the promise of the 2016 referendum.

I’m pretty sure this would be a magnificent example of political theatre, but it would run slap-bang right into a brick wall on which is written “You Can’t Trust the Tories.” And since the Tories have indeed not delivered Brexit, they would lack the level of public trust sufficient to give them an election victory. Theresa May and her spavined colleagues would be responsible for that distrust, but life is unfair and Boris would carry the can. He would lose millions of votes to Nigel Farage and the Brexit party, which would be waging a very similar election campaign with the advantage that the Brexit party is too new to have betrayed anyone.

I cannot predict exactly how many votes each of these two parties would get in what would be a tumultuous campaign. I recently made some tongue-in-cheek predictions, disguised as a future history of the present, in the Australian magazine Quadrant. But the Brexit party is still polling above 20 percent in opinion polls; it has just attracted 6,000 people to an impressive political rally in Birmingham; it has an effective and popular leader in Farage; and it has put together a strong organization and set of ideas stressing in particular a devotion to democracy that the Remainer Tories plainly lack. It can’t be dismissed, and it won’t fade away, as some optimistic Tories such as Iain Martin in the Times, fervently hope.

We can now finally answer the question with which I began: Boris can beat Boris, Nigel can beat Boris, Boris can beat Nigel, and Nigel can beat Nigel if they fail to reach an electoral deal. The same characters can also save the same characters if they reach such a deal. Its broad shape can be easily envisaged: Boris would give Brexit party candidates a free run in a number of seats now held by Labour and the Liberal Democrats — especially those Labour seats that voted heavily Leave in the referendum. Nigel in return would agree not to put up Brexit candidates in seats now held by Tories. Of course, that would all require a lot of haggling over details — would there be a joint manifesto, for instance? And numbers—how many seats would Boris have to “give” Nigel? And risks—would there be walkouts in both parties?

But Nigel and Boris can save Nigel and Boris — and it’s not clear that anyone else can.",www.nationalreview.com,right,o90TBRE7jYeZsCeO

great_britain,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2017/0328/As-Brexit-is-triggered-the-view-from-a-city-that-voted-to-Leave,"As Brexit is triggered, the view from a city that voted to ‘Leave’",2017-03-28,Sara Miller Llana,"This city on the North Sea , which everyone knows simply as Hull , has borne its fair share of insults over the years . “ Dull in Hull , ” to name just one , sums up the kind of mood that foretold the British vote to leave the European Union , which nearly 68 percent of Hull did .
Except that Hull , which has long fixed its gaze on its days as a fishing powerhouse , is oozing with optimism today . “ Change is happening ” is the new byword , painted across the brick walls of the city ’ s former warehouses . It ’ s the UK City of Culture 2017 , derelict buildings and dry docks are being refurbished , and a major wind turbine factory is on the rise . “ The planets have never been more aligned , ” says David Keel , chair of C4DI , a new incubator and co-working space in the waterside Fruit Market district .
Going against the dominant narrative that “ Brexit ” towns are depressed and in deep regret , Hull has turned toward a hopeful future – for some because of Brexit , for others despite it .
As Article 50 is triggered by British Prime Minister Theresa May on March 29 , officially beginning Britain ’ s divorce from the EU , Britons and their EU counterparts are nervous about facing an unprecedented challenge with huge economic and political implications , including the integrity of the United Kingdom . But expectations in this city are bubbling .
To understand the optimism , Simon Lee , a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Hull who is writing a book called “ The State of England : The Nation We ’ re In , ” says it ’ s important to recognize the motivation behind Brexit here as the ultimate protest of a city forgotten and left to feed on its maritime past . And Hull ’ s experience is a lesson in the defeating power of nostalgia and how towns that have been left behind by the political and economic forces of the 21st century are struggling for economic and cultural redemption .
“ Hull has not yet found a replacement identity , ” says Professor Lee .
Now the question , he says , is whether the City of Culture designation , and some of Hull ’ s other signs of economic and cultural renewal , will engender a new identity for the city . Some say they believe the outcome of the EU referendum might have been different had regeneration come earlier .
In early January , a 75-meter ( 82-yard ) wind turbine blade slashed Hull ’ s Queen Victoria Square in half . The “ Blade ” was one of the first art installations to kick off the UK City of Culture celebration , but it ’ s also a nod to what is equally significant for Hull : a £310 million ( $ 385 million ) Siemens turbine blade factory that ’ s created 1,000 jobs and could help position Hull ’ s offshore wind industry as a global player in renewable energy .
It ’ s one of several major investments to come to Hull in the past five years , and it marks a pivot for a city that was voted one of England ’ s “ worst places to live ” in 2003 . In March , The Sunday Times named it one of the best places to live in the UK .
The turnabout has led to some head-scratching over why Hull voted to “ Leave ” the EU with one of the country ’ s highest percentages – as well as whether timing made a difference .
SARA MILLER LLANA/THE ███ Catchy phrases that underline the optimism in Hull , England , greet visitors at the train station .
Immigration played its role here , as it did everywhere in Britain . Bypassed by some of the earlier post-colonial waves of migration , Hull saw its share of Eastern Europeans swell after the 2004 enlargement of the EU . And residents grumble about their fears that wages and the quality of education are going down because of it .
But a bigger factor was an anti-establishment protest in a place that saw its livelihood lost over the “ Cod Wars ” of the 1970s with Iceland . That killed off its deep-sea fishing industry in the North Sea , right as Britain joined the EU and became subject to the bloc ’ s common fisheries policy . For 40 years , the city has been managing a declining economy with the perception that neither Westminster nor Brussels cared .
Hull sits at the end of the train line . Poet Philip Larkin once said it was a place that only traveling salesmen or relatives would visit , recounts Russ Litten , a contemporary author and poet , during a walk around the marina on a recent day .
Coming from a family of fishermen who spent their lives on trawlers , Mr. Litten taps the psyche of the people in works like “ My People Come From the Sea , ” a poem set to electronic music . Hull is both a fiercely proud town – almost everyone tells visitors about its refusal to allow King Charles I through the city ’ s Beverley Gate in 1642 , the starting point of the English civil war – and a forgotten place . It was one of the most bombed cities of World War II , but residents lament that hardly anyone knows that . It ’ s made them a stubborn and contrarian lot , says Litten . “ If you give them a binary choice , Hull people will always vote no . They ’ ll say , ‘ The answer is no ; now what ’ s the question ? ’ ” he says .
Despite rejuvenation , both cultural and economic , official unemployment levels for Hull in September 2016 were nearly double those of Britain overall , while 12.5 percent of the population has no vocational or academic qualifications , compared with 8.6 percent for the national average . It also has fewer people with the highest qualifications : 22 percent compared with 37 percent nationally . “ There is a disconnect between regenerating buildings and the regeneration of the population , ” says Lee .
Such disparities are getting another look in the face of Brexit . New research that Annie Quick of the New Economics Foundation in London helped conduct on inequality and well-being shows that while average well-being within a community did not predict the number of people who voted to leave the EU , high well-being inequality did . Hull is on the top 10 list of well-being inequality .
Ms. Quick says that more analysis needs to be done to fully understand the data , but the findings might be telling policymakers about the sentiments of feeling “ left behind ” that have become so prominent since the vote . “ The experience of really struggling with your life , and being [ further ] down on the well-being scale in a community in which other people have a higher well-being , can really exacerbate that feeling of being left behind , ” she says .
Yet at C4DI , where pop music pumps into the reception area , Mr. Keel wonders if Hull would have voted for Brexit – or at least with such a wide margin for Leave – had some of the current changes happened sooner or the vote later . “ I think if the vote would have happened in a year ’ s time , there would have been a significantly increased awareness of the value of connecting to a wider world in Hull than there was when the vote took place , ” he says .
Despite the official triggering of Article 50 , Britain will remain in a state of prolonged expectation for the time being . It ’ s the beginning of a two-year negotiation that is expected to decide Britain ’ s future trading relationships , immigration policies , and budget obligations . No one knows if Brexit will ultimately be “ hard ” – meaning Britain loses access to the EU ’ s single market and ends free movement for EU nationals – or “ soft , ” and what that means for foreign investment and the economic outlook of the country .
Hull is polarized when it comes to those same questions .
For Tim Rix , the fifth-generation head of shipping company JR Rix & Sons , Brexit is Hull ’ s future . He has been a driving force in the revitalization of Hull , pushing for the Siemens factory , the City of Culture designation , and Brexit , he says in his office . It ’ s filled with replicas of the ships the company has employed since the 1800s , near the Hull River , which runs into the vast Humber Estuary .
Since the Brexit vote last June , businesses have seen only one direct effect , the devaluation of the pound . That ’ s been a boon for Mr. Rix , as well as local exporters . His ships , he says , whose services are bought in pounds , suddenly have become cheaper for the Continent . He believes the talk of a hard Brexit – kicking EU nationals out and leaving the EU ’ s single market – is just negotiation jostling for now , though he admits that a softer Brexit will probably anger those who based their vote on the immigration question . “ But even if we have hard Brexit , we ’ ll clear the decks , we ’ ll sort ourselves out , and we ’ ll get on with it , ” he says confidently .
SARA MILLER LLANA/THE ███ Russ Litten voted for Britain to remain in the European Union , but he ’ s still upbeat about Hull ’ s future .
Ian Kelly , chief executive of the Hull and Humber Chamber of Commerce , which officially staked a neutral position on Brexit , says there are some concerns about labor shortages , especially for agricultural companies dependent on foreign labor .
There are other firms that believe Brexit will boost their fortunes . “ There has been enormous sense of strong views on both sides . It ’ s the most striking and strong debate I ’ ve seen in politics in my lifetime . It is what we call here blowing off the fog on the Humber . It is a lot of emotion , ” he says . But “ the raw facts are ... – and I ’ m not saying it won ’ t move one way or another – the trading environment has not actually shifted as yet . ”
Daren Hale , deputy leader of the Hull City Council , says he voted to “ Remain ” because he was worried about the Siemens investment . Even though the German company has committed to staying in Hull , he says his role now is to fight to protect the firm and the jobs it will create . “ We ’ ve got a lot of reasons to be cheerful in Hull . So we ’ ve got to build on that and make sure people see that we don ’ t in a sense miss the boat when it comes to the debate on Brexit , ” he says , “ that we don ’ t allow borders to go up or tariffs to go up. ” In other words , he ’ ll be fighting for a soft Brexit .
He says politicians have a challenge ahead of them . Residents haven ’ t always realized what sorts of funding the EU provides , such as a recent stand at a rugby field that is loved by the community and significantly funded by Brussels . In that case , as in many others , he admits that local leaders have been happy to take credit that the EU should have gotten .
Lee says he fears Brexit will do little to nothing to address the issues people voted on , including desires for less migration and more attention for northern England . And he ’ s concerned that Brexit could turn the British economy into a deregulated , low-tax economy that could aggravate the north-south divide . “ When people find out that Brexit is not the land of milk and honey and the streets aren ’ t paved in gold , there is going to be an almighty backlash against it , ” he says .
A recent poll by Ipsos MORI indicates that 51 percent of Britons don ’ t have confidence in Ms. May ’ s ability to get a good deal for Britain in negotiations with Europe , compared with 44 percent who do .
Phil Fussey , who retired last year as a skipper on a crab and lobster boat , says he is in the latter group . He ’ s still so angry about the loss of the fishing industry that the return of control of British waters to him is worth the gamble . “ I voted Leave on what they ’ ve done to our fishing industry . They sold us down the river from Day 1 , ” he says , standing at St. Andrew ’ s Dock , the old fishing quarter . He expects that with Brexit , Hull can start to rebuild some of the industry . “ I ’ ll like to see waters from British fishermen coming back to the British fishermen , ” he says .
He calls the triggering of Article 50 “ party time. ” James Chapman , a builder who chairs the UK Independence Party in Hull North , calls Brexit one of “ the greatest experiences of my life. ” “ We fought the EU , the British government , and corporate business , ” he says , “ and we won. ” He said he ’ d be going “ right to the pub ” upon the triggering of Article 50 .
Kate Brown is there , too . But the waitress at the cozy Lion and Key is disappointed in the Brexit vote .

Still , she feels hopeful about the city ’ s future . She studied population and geography at university and isn ’ t sure how easy it will be to get a full-time job in Hull in that field , but she loves her life here , above all the cheap cost of living and the buzz . “ It ’ s really hard to leave here , ” she says . “ My friends and I , we all love it . ”
“ And I don ’ t know , ” she says , her eyes twinkling , “ I feel like Brexit ’ s not even going to happen . ”","This city on the North Sea, which everyone knows simply as Hull, has borne its fair share of insults over the years. “Dull in Hull,” to name just one, sums up the kind of mood that foretold the British vote to leave the European Union, which nearly 68 percent of Hull did.

It’s the UK City of Culture 2017, derelict buildings and dry docks are being refurbished, and a major wind turbine factory is on the rise. “The planets have never been more aligned,” says David Keel, chair of C4DI, a new incubator and co-working space in the waterside Fruit Market district.

Going against the dominant narrative that “Brexit” towns are depressed and in deep regret, Hull has turned toward a hopeful future – for some because of Brexit, for others despite it.

As Article 50 is triggered by British Prime Minister Theresa May on March 29, officially beginning Britain’s divorce from the EU, Britons and their EU counterparts are nervous about facing an unprecedented challenge with huge economic and political implications, including the integrity of the United Kingdom. But expectations in this city are bubbling.

To understand the optimism, Simon Lee, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Hull who is writing a book called “The State of England: The Nation We’re In,” says it’s important to recognize the motivation behind Brexit here as the ultimate protest of a city forgotten and left to feed on its maritime past. And Hull’s experience is a lesson in the defeating power of nostalgia and how towns that have been left behind by the political and economic forces of the 21st century are struggling for economic and cultural redemption.

“Hull has not yet found a replacement identity,” says Professor Lee.

Now the question, he says, is whether the City of Culture designation, and some of Hull’s other signs of economic and cultural renewal, will engender a new identity for the city. Some say they believe the outcome of the EU referendum might have been different had regeneration come earlier.

Big investments

In early January, a 75-meter (82-yard) wind turbine blade slashed Hull’s Queen Victoria Square in half. The “Blade” was one of the first art installations to kick off the UK City of Culture celebration, but it’s also a nod to what is equally significant for Hull: a £310 million ($385 million) Siemens turbine blade factory that’s created 1,000 jobs and could help position Hull’s offshore wind industry as a global player in renewable energy.

It’s one of several major investments to come to Hull in the past five years, and it marks a pivot for a city that was voted one of England’s “worst places to live” in 2003. In March, The Sunday Times named it one of the best places to live in the UK.

The turnabout has led to some head-scratching over why Hull voted to “Leave” the EU with one of the country’s highest percentages – as well as whether timing made a difference.

SARA MILLER LLANA/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR Catchy phrases that underline the optimism in Hull, England, greet visitors at the train station.

Immigration played its role here, as it did everywhere in Britain. Bypassed by some of the earlier post-colonial waves of migration, Hull saw its share of Eastern Europeans swell after the 2004 enlargement of the EU. And residents grumble about their fears that wages and the quality of education are going down because of it.

But a bigger factor was an anti-establishment protest in a place that saw its livelihood lost over the “Cod Wars” of the 1970s with Iceland. That killed off its deep-sea fishing industry in the North Sea, right as Britain joined the EU and became subject to the bloc’s common fisheries policy. For 40 years, the city has been managing a declining economy with the perception that neither Westminster nor Brussels cared.

Hull sits at the end of the train line. Poet Philip Larkin once said it was a place that only traveling salesmen or relatives would visit, recounts Russ Litten, a contemporary author and poet, during a walk around the marina on a recent day.

Coming from a family of fishermen who spent their lives on trawlers, Mr. Litten taps the psyche of the people in works like “My People Come From the Sea,” a poem set to electronic music. Hull is both a fiercely proud town – almost everyone tells visitors about its refusal to allow King Charles I through the city’s Beverley Gate in 1642, the starting point of the English civil war – and a forgotten place. It was one of the most bombed cities of World War II, but residents lament that hardly anyone knows that. It’s made them a stubborn and contrarian lot, says Litten. “If you give them a binary choice, Hull people will always vote no. They’ll say, ‘The answer is no; now what’s the question?’ ” he says.

Inequality and well-being

Despite rejuvenation, both cultural and economic, official unemployment levels for Hull in September 2016 were nearly double those of Britain overall, while 12.5 percent of the population has no vocational or academic qualifications, compared with 8.6 percent for the national average. It also has fewer people with the highest qualifications: 22 percent compared with 37 percent nationally. “There is a disconnect between regenerating buildings and the regeneration of the population,” says Lee.

Such disparities are getting another look in the face of Brexit. New research that Annie Quick of the New Economics Foundation in London helped conduct on inequality and well-being shows that while average well-being within a community did not predict the number of people who voted to leave the EU, high well-being inequality did. Hull is on the top 10 list of well-being inequality.

Ms. Quick says that more analysis needs to be done to fully understand the data, but the findings might be telling policymakers about the sentiments of feeling “left behind” that have become so prominent since the vote. “The experience of really struggling with your life, and being [further] down on the well-being scale in a community in which other people have a higher well-being, can really exacerbate that feeling of being left behind,” she says.

Yet at C4DI, where pop music pumps into the reception area, Mr. Keel wonders if Hull would have voted for Brexit – or at least with such a wide margin for Leave – had some of the current changes happened sooner or the vote later. “I think if the vote would have happened in a year’s time, there would have been a significantly increased awareness of the value of connecting to a wider world in Hull than there was when the vote took place,” he says.

The road ahead

Despite the official triggering of Article 50, Britain will remain in a state of prolonged expectation for the time being. It’s the beginning of a two-year negotiation that is expected to decide Britain’s future trading relationships, immigration policies, and budget obligations. No one knows if Brexit will ultimately be “hard” – meaning Britain loses access to the EU’s single market and ends free movement for EU nationals – or “soft,” and what that means for foreign investment and the economic outlook of the country.

Hull is polarized when it comes to those same questions.

For Tim Rix, the fifth-generation head of shipping company JR Rix & Sons, Brexit is Hull’s future. He has been a driving force in the revitalization of Hull, pushing for the Siemens factory, the City of Culture designation, and Brexit, he says in his office. It’s filled with replicas of the ships the company has employed since the 1800s, near the Hull River, which runs into the vast Humber Estuary.

Since the Brexit vote last June, businesses have seen only one direct effect, the devaluation of the pound. That’s been a boon for Mr. Rix, as well as local exporters. His ships, he says, whose services are bought in pounds, suddenly have become cheaper for the Continent. He believes the talk of a hard Brexit – kicking EU nationals out and leaving the EU’s single market – is just negotiation jostling for now, though he admits that a softer Brexit will probably anger those who based their vote on the immigration question. “But even if we have hard Brexit, we’ll clear the decks, we’ll sort ourselves out, and we’ll get on with it,” he says confidently.

SARA MILLER LLANA/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR Russ Litten voted for Britain to remain in the European Union, but he’s still upbeat about Hull’s future.

Ian Kelly, chief executive of the Hull and Humber Chamber of Commerce, which officially staked a neutral position on Brexit, says there are some concerns about labor shortages, especially for agricultural companies dependent on foreign labor.

There are other firms that believe Brexit will boost their fortunes. “There has been enormous sense of strong views on both sides. It’s the most striking and strong debate I’ve seen in politics in my lifetime. It is what we call here blowing off the fog on the Humber. It is a lot of emotion,” he says. But “the raw facts are ...– and I’m not saying it won’t move one way or another – the trading environment has not actually shifted as yet.”

Daren Hale, deputy leader of the Hull City Council, says he voted to “Remain” because he was worried about the Siemens investment. Even though the German company has committed to staying in Hull, he says his role now is to fight to protect the firm and the jobs it will create. “We’ve got a lot of reasons to be cheerful in Hull. So we’ve got to build on that and make sure people see that we don’t in a sense miss the boat when it comes to the debate on Brexit,” he says, “that we don’t allow borders to go up or tariffs to go up.” In other words, he’ll be fighting for a soft Brexit.

He says politicians have a challenge ahead of them. Residents haven’t always realized what sorts of funding the EU provides, such as a recent stand at a rugby field that is loved by the community and significantly funded by Brussels. In that case, as in many others, he admits that local leaders have been happy to take credit that the EU should have gotten.

A range of opinions

Lee says he fears Brexit will do little to nothing to address the issues people voted on, including desires for less migration and more attention for northern England. And he’s concerned that Brexit could turn the British economy into a deregulated, low-tax economy that could aggravate the north-south divide. “When people find out that Brexit is not the land of milk and honey and the streets aren’t paved in gold, there is going to be an almighty backlash against it,” he says.

A recent poll by Ipsos MORI indicates that 51 percent of Britons don’t have confidence in Ms. May’s ability to get a good deal for Britain in negotiations with Europe, compared with 44 percent who do.

Phil Fussey, who retired last year as a skipper on a crab and lobster boat, says he is in the latter group. He’s still so angry about the loss of the fishing industry that the return of control of British waters to him is worth the gamble. “I voted Leave on what they’ve done to our fishing industry. They sold us down the river from Day 1,” he says, standing at St. Andrew’s Dock, the old fishing quarter. He expects that with Brexit, Hull can start to rebuild some of the industry. “I’ll like to see waters from British fishermen coming back to the British fishermen,” he says.

He calls the triggering of Article 50 “party time.” James Chapman, a builder who chairs the UK Independence Party in Hull North, calls Brexit one of “the greatest experiences of my life.” “We fought the EU, the British government, and corporate business,” he says, “and we won.” He said he’d be going “right to the pub” upon the triggering of Article 50.

Kate Brown is there, too. But the waitress at the cozy Lion and Key is disappointed in the Brexit vote.

Still, she feels hopeful about the city’s future. She studied population and geography at university and isn’t sure how easy it will be to get a full-time job in Hull in that field, but she loves her life here, above all the cheap cost of living and the buzz. “It’s really hard to leave here,” she says. “My friends and I, we all love it.”

Sands,"Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who transformed Britain in the 1980s with a core of conservative convictions and history ’ s most formidable handbag , died Monday of a stroke . She was 87 years old .
The daughter of a provincial English grocer , Mrs. Thatcher shattered class and gender barriers to win election in 1979 as Britain ’ s first female prime minister , engineer Britain ’ s victory over Argentina in the 1982 war over the Falkland Islands , and become a critical ally and ideological soul mate of President Ronald Reagan in the West ’ s Cold War triumph over Soviet communism in Europe .

By the time she was forced to step down by an internal Conservative Party revolt in November 1990 , Mrs. Thatcher was the longest-serving prime minister since William Gladstone in the late 19th century and had the longest continuous term in power since Robert Banks Jenkinson , the Lord Liverpool , retired in 1827 .
But her plain-spoken , bulldozer style was employed in a career marked by paradoxes .

An outsider with a professional degree in chemistry , she defied the odds repeatedly in her improbable rise to Tory party leader and then to 10 Downing Street . A devoted wife with no sympathy for the modern feminist movement , she was to become the most powerful female political leader in the world , easily dominating her male counterparts both in the Cabinet and in the opposition .
And perhaps most remarkably , she used her deeply conservative beliefs to fashion a radical transformation of her country , taking on entrenched labor unions and left-wing political barons to carry out an economic and social revolution that reversed more than a decade of slow decline in Britain .
Mrs. Thatcher relished ideological combat and made no apologies for a domineering style of leadership that doomed any male politician rash enough to underestimate her intelligence or will . She introduced the verb “ to handbag ” into the English language — the brusque metaphorical dismissal of political opponents or rivals standing in one ’ s way .
“ If you just set out to be liked , you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time , and you would achieve nothing , ” she once said .
The greatest tribute to her impact may have come from her political opponents . Tony Blair was an open admirer of Mrs. Thatcher ’ s political style and used her resurrection of Britain ’ s Conservatives in the late 1970s as a blueprint for the revamping of the center-left Labor Party in the 1990s .
Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on Oct. 13 , 1925 , in Grantham in eastern England . Her father , Alfred Roberts , whom Margaret adored , ran a grocer ’ s shop and was active in local politics . Margaret and her sister , Muriel , were raised in an apartment above the shop .
Mr. Roberts , who was also a Methodist lay preacher , lost a race for alderman when the Labor Party won its first majority ever on the Grantham local council .
Mrs. Thatcher showed pronounced Tory sympathies early on , becoming president of Oxford ’ s Conservative Association soon after arriving at the school in 1944 to study chemistry . She worked briefly as a chemical researcher after graduation , at one point serving on a team that studied new methods for preserving ice cream .
But she almost immediately became involved in politics , earning her first national notice as the youngest Tory candidate in the country in failed races in 1950 and 1951 for “ safe ” Labor seats in the working-class southeast England town of Dartford .
It was during the Dartford campaigns that Margaret Roberts met Denis Thatcher , a wealthy Kent businessman whom she married in 1951 . The couple ’ s only children , twins Mark and Carol Thatcher , were born two years later .
Despite constant ribbing for his bland , deferential public persona , the discreet Mr. Thatcher proved the ideal political spouse for his strong-willed wife , financing her legal studies — she qualified as a barrister in 1953 — and providing the comfortable income that allowed Mrs. Thatcher to pursue her political career .
Modest and retiring to the last , Mr. Thatcher died in 2003 . Mrs. Thatcher in her memoirs acknowledged , “ I could never have been prime minister for more than 11 years without Denis by my side . ”
Finally awarded a safe Tory seat in 1959 , Mrs. Thatcher rose steadily in the party ranks , serving in increasingly influential posts in Conservative governments in the early 1960s under Prime Ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home and in the first half of the 1970s under Edward Heath . Her tenure as education secretary in Mr. Heath ’ s crisis-plagued government put her in direct conflict with entrenched leftist critics in the press and academia , a foretaste of her time as prime minister .
Defeated in the 1974 general election , the Tories unexpectedly dumped Mr. Heath and elected Mrs. Thatcher , making her the first woman ever to lead a major Western political party and the first to serve as leader of the opposition in the House of Commons .
Mrs. Thatcher herself would later admit she was surprised at her victory , and many of her male counterparts voted for her on the assumption they could oust her before the next general election . It would not be the first time male politicians would underestimate her .
She did not temper her style in her new post .
In early 1976 , she issued a blistering attack on the Soviet Union in language that would find its echo in Ronald Reagan ’ s “ evil empire ” speech six years later : “ The Russians are bent on world dominance , and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen . The men in the Soviet Politburo … put guns before butter , while we put just about everything before guns . ”
An angry editorial in a Soviet defense newspaper denounced Mrs. Thatcher as “ the Iron Lady , ” unwittingly bestowing on her the nickname by which she would become widely known .
The Labor government of the late 1970s presided over the low point in postwar Britain ’ s economic fortunes , an era of labor strife , economic and currency woes , and even a humiliating bailout of the near-bankrupt government treasury by the International Monetary Fund . A series of crippling strikes sounded the death knell for Labor , and Mrs. Thatcher led the Tories back into power in the May 1979 general election with a 43-seat majority .
Even her most ardent critics — never in short supply — would concede that Mrs. Thatcher ’ s 11½ years in power would transform Britain , seen in the late 1970s as the “ sick man of Europe , ” a dispirited , bloated welfare state facing what many predicted would be an irreversible decline as a major power .
“ Poor in spirit , we suffered that most demoralizing form of poverty — poverty of conviction , ” Mrs. Thatcher recalled . “ Britain was country without a cause . ”
She gave her name to the cause Britain embraced under her government . “ Thatcherism ” was an undiluted dose of private enterprise , lower taxes , deregulation , privatization of sacred government cows , British patriotism and an assertive foreign policy far more in tune with the Republican revolutionaries in Ronald Reagan ’ s Washington than with the rule-writing European Union bureaucrats in Brussels .
She saw no value in consensus for consensus ’ sake , and seemed to relish her battles with union bosses , Argentine generals , left-wing intellectuals , EU ministers and even Cabinet ministers deemed insufficiently committed to her “ conservative British revolution . ”
Convinced Britain required harsh medicine to reverse a culture of decline , Mrs. Thatcher instituted a series of painful cuts to restore the government ’ s finances and end subsidies to favored industries and constituencies . Unemployment soared and uncompetitive businesses folded , but the government stuck to its program .
Over the objections of more moderate “ wet ” Tories in her own government , Mrs. Thatcher even won plaudits for her courage , but the resulting economic hardship put the survival of her government in serious doubt three years into her first term . But her political resurrection was about to begin , courtesy of an obscure chain of islands half a world away from London .
A military junta in Argentina , plagued by deep economic woes at home , in April 1982 invaded the Falkland Islands , an archipelago in the South Atlantic long claimed by both Britain and Argentina . Without hesitation , Mrs. Thatcher dispatched a British force to reclaim the islands , winning a quick and decisive victory by June .
“ We were defending our honor as a nation and principles of fundamental importance to the whole world — above all that aggressors should never succeed and that international law should prevail over the use of force , ” she would recall in her 1993 memoir , “ The Downing Street Years . ”
“ The significance of the Falklands War was enormous , both for Britain ’ s self-confidence and for our standing in the world , ” she wrote .
The resulting surge of British national pride , coupled with the first stirrings of economic recovery and a badly divided Labor opposition , led to a stunning Thatcher victory in the June 1983 election , with the Conservatives tripling their majority to 144 seats .
As with Mr. Blair , Mrs. Thatcher enjoyed massive parliamentary majorities through Britain ’ s first-past-the-post electoral system without ever winning overwhelming popular support . Her 1983 majority came despite the fact that the Conservatives took just 42.4 percent of the vote .
The dangers of her post were brought home in October 1984 , when the Provisional Irish Republican Army bombed the Brighton hotel where the Tories were holding their annual party conference . Mrs. Thatcher barely escaped injury , but five persons were killed in the attack , including a Conservative member of Parliament .
The prime minister insisted that the conference proceed , giving her opening address as planned the day after the attack . The next year she would sign a landmark accord with the government of Ireland , giving Dublin for the first time a limited voice in the future of Northern Ireland .
If the Falklands War was the highlight of her first term , an epic domestic battle of wills dominated Mrs. Thatcher ’ s second four years in office .
Determined to break the stranglehold unions had on the British economy , she faced down a yearlong series of strikes by the powerful National Union of Mineworkers in 1984-1985 , refusing any concessions until the union leaders saw their own membership rebel .
The labor war proved an unconditional triumph for the Conservative government , which in 1985 proceeded to shut down scores of unprofitable coal mines and privatize the rest . Britain ’ s trade unions never recovered from the defeat .
In an economic reform with far-reaching political consequences , Mrs. Thatcher accelerated the sell-off of unproductive state enterprises and pushed strongly to increase homeownership among ordinary Britons . While the trade union wars left Mrs. Thatcher deeply unpopular in industrial pockets of northern England and Scotland , the vastly expanded class of middle-class homeowners would provide the backbone for her political coalition .
She prized individual initiative and private enterprise , disdaining the ambitious social engineering dreams of her leftist adversaries .
Asked about those who instinctively turn to government to solve social problems , she said in a 1987 interview , “ There is no such thing as society ” — perhaps her most widely cited quote .
She continued , “ There are individual men and women , and there are families . And no government can do anything except through people , and people must look to themselves first . It ’ s our duty to look after ourselves and then , and then to look after our neighbor . ”
She once remarked her policies were “ not based on some economics theory , but on things I and millions like me were brought up with : an honest day ’ s work for an honest day ’ s pay ; live within your means ; put by a nest egg for a rainy day ; pay your bills on time ; support the police . ”
She would prove a staunch ally of the United States , backing Presidents Reagan and George H.W . Bush in the foreign policy crises that marked the twilight of the Cold War .
She strongly supported Mr. Reagan ’ s hard line against the Soviet Union and defied Britain ’ s powerful anti-nuclear movement to station U.S. cruise missiles at bases on British soil . Unlike some European NATO allies , she backed the 1986 U.S. airstrikes in Libya ordered by Mr. Reagan after a terrorist attack on U.S. troops in Germany .
Despite her strong anti-Soviet record , she was an early champion in the West of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , famously declaring him “ a man we can do business with ” just three months after he took power in Moscow in 1984 .
She provided crucial moral and material support for Mr. Bush ’ s military campaign to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait after Iraqi troops invaded in 1990 .
“ This is no time to go wobbly , ” she told him in a telephone conversation in the critical days before the U.S.-led coalition succeeded in liberating Kuwait .
Her electoral triumph in the June 1987 general election with a 102-seat majority may have been her high-water mark , with Britain ’ s economy soaring and the Labor Party opposition in complete disarray . The slow-motion collapse of the Soviet European empire — highlighted by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 — appeared to vindicate Mrs. Thatcher ’ s and Mr. Reagan ’ s tough line .
Mrs. Thatcher continued to press her conservative domestic political agenda , including education , welfare , health and housing reforms . A new levy on local governments , slammed as a “ poll tax ” by its many opponents , would prove particularly divisive , but many of the reforms adopted in this period were endorsed and even expanded under Mr. Blair ’ s “ New Labor ” governments .
But the prime minister ’ s long and controversial tenure , fresh worries about the economy , her divisive and often hectoring personal style , and rivalries within her own Tory majority were already sewing the seeds for her political downfall .
Never beaten in an election , Mrs. Thatcher was done in by a palace coup , one she later described as “ treachery with a smiling face . ”
Politically weakened by public hostility to the poll tax and by Conservative divisions over her “ Euro-skeptic ” approach to the European Union , her government was rocked by the November 1990 resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe in protest over her European policies .
Former Cabinet minister Michael Heseltine , another male Tory rival Mrs. Thatcher had bested , then launched a party leadership challenge . Although Mrs. Thatcher led in the first round of party voting , her margin was insufficient to prevent a second round .
She vowed at first to fight on but , faced with fading support in her Cabinet , resigned before the second tally could be held . She did prevent Mr. Heseltine from winning the top post , as the Conservatives chose John Major to succeed her . Largely on the strength of her government ’ s record , Mr. Major unexpectedly would win a term of his own — with a much reduced Tory majority — in the April 1992 general election .
The Conservative revolution Mrs. Thatcher embarked on in 1979 would last 18 years , only being swept from power with Mr. Blair ’ s huge Labor win in the 1997 election .
Out of office , Mrs. Thatcher remained an outspoken Euro-skeptic and a hero to British and U.S. conservatives . She resigned from Parliament in 1992 and wrote two best-selling volumes of memoirs , “ The Downing Street Years ” and “ The Path to Power. ” She was awarded the U.S. Medal of Freedom in 1991 and was made a baroness a year later .
Her charismatic personal and political style has proved a burden for her party , which to date has been unable to produce another figure of the similar stature . Her own political pronouncements became even less frequent after she suffered a series of small strokes in 2002 , but she did deliver a moving videotaped tribute to Mr. Reagan at his 2004 funeral .
Mrs. Thatcher rarely dwelt on her status as a pioneering woman dominating as a traditional male preserve , but “ Maggie ” would prove a cultural icon as well as a political giant . She showed little sympathy for modern feminism , but political leaders from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have followed a trail Mrs. Thatcher blazed .
“ I owe nothing to Women ’ s Lib , ” she once said , but she also never showed the slightest sense of being intimidated by the powerful men with whom she worked .
“ It may be the cock that crows , ” she once noted , “ but it is the hen that lays the egg . ”","Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who transformed Britain in the 1980s with a core of conservative convictions and history’s most formidable handbag, died Monday of a stroke.

“Poor in spirit, we suffered that most demoralizing form of poverty — poverty of conviction,” Mrs. Thatcher recalled. “Britain was country without a cause.”

She gave her name to the cause Britain embraced under her government. “Thatcherism” was an undiluted dose of private enterprise, lower taxes, deregulation, privatization of sacred government cows, British patriotism and an assertive foreign policy far more in tune with the Republican revolutionaries in Ronald Reagan’s Washington than with the rule-writing European Union bureaucrats in Brussels.

She saw no value in consensus for consensus’ sake, and seemed to relish her battles with union bosses, Argentine generals, left-wing intellectuals, EU ministers and even Cabinet ministers deemed insufficiently committed to her “conservative British revolution.”

Convinced Britain required harsh medicine to reverse a culture of decline, Mrs. Thatcher instituted a series of painful cuts to restore the government’s finances and end subsidies to favored industries and constituencies. Unemployment soared and uncompetitive businesses folded, but the government stuck to its program.

Over the objections of more moderate “wet” Tories in her own government, Mrs. Thatcher even won plaudits for her courage, but the resulting economic hardship put the survival of her government in serious doubt three years into her first term. But her political resurrection was about to begin, courtesy of an obscure chain of islands half a world away from London.

A military junta in Argentina, plagued by deep economic woes at home, in April 1982 invaded the Falkland Islands, an archipelago in the South Atlantic long claimed by both Britain and Argentina. Without hesitation, Mrs. Thatcher dispatched a British force to reclaim the islands, winning a quick and decisive victory by June.

“We were defending our honor as a nation and principles of fundamental importance to the whole world — above all that aggressors should never succeed and that international law should prevail over the use of force,” she would recall in her 1993 memoir, “The Downing Street Years.”

“The significance of the Falklands War was enormous, both for Britain’s self-confidence and for our standing in the world,” she wrote.

The resulting surge of British national pride, coupled with the first stirrings of economic recovery and a badly divided Labor opposition, led to a stunning Thatcher victory in the June 1983 election, with the Conservatives tripling their majority to 144 seats.

As with Mr. Blair, Mrs. Thatcher enjoyed massive parliamentary majorities through Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system without ever winning overwhelming popular support. Her 1983 majority came despite the fact that the Conservatives took just 42.4 percent of the vote.

The dangers of her post were brought home in October 1984, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army bombed the Brighton hotel where the Tories were holding their annual party conference. Mrs. Thatcher barely escaped injury, but five persons were killed in the attack, including a Conservative member of Parliament.

The prime minister insisted that the conference proceed, giving her opening address as planned the day after the attack. The next year she would sign a landmark accord with the government of Ireland, giving Dublin for the first time a limited voice in the future of Northern Ireland.

If the Falklands War was the highlight of her first term, an epic domestic battle of wills dominated Mrs. Thatcher’s second four years in office.

Determined to break the stranglehold unions had on the British economy, she faced down a yearlong series of strikes by the powerful National Union of Mineworkers in 1984-1985, refusing any concessions until the union leaders saw their own membership rebel.

The labor war proved an unconditional triumph for the Conservative government, which in 1985 proceeded to shut down scores of unprofitable coal mines and privatize the rest. Britain’s trade unions never recovered from the defeat.

In an economic reform with far-reaching political consequences, Mrs. Thatcher accelerated the sell-off of unproductive state enterprises and pushed strongly to increase homeownership among ordinary Britons. While the trade union wars left Mrs. Thatcher deeply unpopular in industrial pockets of northern England and Scotland, the vastly expanded class of middle-class homeowners would provide the backbone for her political coalition.

She prized individual initiative and private enterprise, disdaining the ambitious social engineering dreams of her leftist adversaries.

Asked about those who instinctively turn to government to solve social problems, she said in a 1987 interview, “There is no such thing as society” — perhaps her most widely cited quote.

She continued, “There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first. It’s our duty to look after ourselves and then, and then to look after our neighbor.”

She once remarked her policies were “not based on some economics theory, but on things I and millions like me were brought up with: an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay; live within your means; put by a nest egg for a rainy day; pay your bills on time; support the police.”

She would prove a staunch ally of the United States, backing Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the foreign policy crises that marked the twilight of the Cold War.

She strongly supported Mr. Reagan’s hard line against the Soviet Union and defied Britain’s powerful anti-nuclear movement to station U.S. cruise missiles at bases on British soil. Unlike some European NATO allies, she backed the 1986 U.S. airstrikes in Libya ordered by Mr. Reagan after a terrorist attack on U.S. troops in Germany.

Despite her strong anti-Soviet record, she was an early champion in the West of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, famously declaring him “a man we can do business with” just three months after he took power in Moscow in 1984.

She provided crucial moral and material support for Mr. Bush’s military campaign to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait after Iraqi troops invaded in 1990.

“This is no time to go wobbly,” she told him in a telephone conversation in the critical days before the U.S.-led coalition succeeded in liberating Kuwait.

Her electoral triumph in the June 1987 general election with a 102-seat majority may have been her high-water mark, with Britain’s economy soaring and the Labor Party opposition in complete disarray. The slow-motion collapse of the Soviet European empire — highlighted by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 — appeared to vindicate Mrs. Thatcher’s and Mr. Reagan’s tough line.

Mrs. Thatcher continued to press her conservative domestic political agenda, including education, welfare, health and housing reforms. A new levy on local governments, slammed as a “poll tax” by its many opponents, would prove particularly divisive, but many of the reforms adopted in this period were endorsed and even expanded under Mr. Blair’s “New Labor” governments.

But the prime minister’s long and controversial tenure, fresh worries about the economy, her divisive and often hectoring personal style, and rivalries within her own Tory majority were already sewing the seeds for her political downfall.

Never beaten in an election, Mrs. Thatcher was done in by a palace coup, one she later described as “treachery with a smiling face.”

Politically weakened by public hostility to the poll tax and by Conservative divisions over her “Euro-skeptic” approach to the European Union, her government was rocked by the November 1990 resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe in protest over her European policies.

Former Cabinet minister Michael Heseltine, another male Tory rival Mrs. Thatcher had bested, then launched a party leadership challenge. Although Mrs. Thatcher led in the first round of party voting, her margin was insufficient to prevent a second round.

She vowed at first to fight on but, faced with fading support in her Cabinet, resigned before the second tally could be held. She did prevent Mr. Heseltine from winning the top post, as the Conservatives chose John Major to succeed her. Largely on the strength of her government’s record, Mr. Major unexpectedly would win a term of his own — with a much reduced Tory majority — in the April 1992 general election.

The Conservative revolution Mrs. Thatcher embarked on in 1979 would last 18 years, only being swept from power with Mr. Blair’s huge Labor win in the 1997 election.

Out of office, Mrs. Thatcher remained an outspoken Euro-skeptic and a hero to British and U.S. conservatives. She resigned from Parliament in 1992 and wrote two best-selling volumes of memoirs, “The Downing Street Years” and “The Path to Power.” She was awarded the U.S. Medal of Freedom in 1991 and was made a baroness a year later.

Her charismatic personal and political style has proved a burden for her party, which to date has been unable to produce another figure of the similar stature. Her own political pronouncements became even less frequent after she suffered a series of small strokes in 2002, but she did deliver a moving videotaped tribute to Mr. Reagan at his 2004 funeral.

Mrs. Thatcher rarely dwelt on her status as a pioneering woman dominating as a traditional male preserve, but “Maggie” would prove a cultural icon as well as a political giant. She showed little sympathy for modern feminism, but political leaders from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have followed a trail Mrs. Thatcher blazed.

“I owe nothing to Women’s Lib,” she once said, but she also never showed the slightest sense of being intimidated by the powerful men with whom she worked.

“It may be the cock that crows,” she once noted, “but it is the hen that lays the egg.”

Theresa May has said she will quit as Conservative leader on 7 June, paving the way for a contest to decide a new prime minister.

In an emotional statement, she said she had done her best to deliver Brexit and it was a matter of ""deep regret"" that she had been unable to do so.

More than a dozen other MPs are believed to be seriously considering entering the contest.

In the end, May was overwhelmed

At the start she boasted about not being a creature of Westminster's bars and cliques.

But it meant this very private politician had few true friends to help when things turned sour, and neither the powers of patronage, nor the capability to schmooze or arm twist to get people around to her point of view.

Few of her cabinet colleagues, even now, know her well at all, one saying that ""as things got harder the circle got smaller"". Another revealed that ""there was no trust, and no faith"".

Settling the Tories' decades-long dispute over Europe was always perhaps beyond just one leader. But the wounds have got more painful under her leadership, rather than fading away.

great_britain,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/world/2018/11/27/18106619/brext-deal-theresa-may-parliament-european-union,Why Brexit is tearing the United Kingdom apart,2018-11-27,"Jen Kirby, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan","British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Union leaders signed off on a Brexit plan on Sunday , which will dictate the terms of the divorce between the European Union and the United Kingdom .
Now May needs to sell the deal at home , and persuade members of the UK Parliament to back the agreement for a vote in early December . There ’ s just one problem : Most of the United Kingdom seems to despise the plan .
The debate over how the UK and the EU should split up has exposed deep and intractable fault lines in British politics . The June 2016 referendum , in which 52 percent of the UK voted to leave the European Union , exposed schisms that will likely last long after the official Brexit deadline of March 29 , 2019 .
To better understand the contours of the current debate , I reached out to Anand Menon , the director of an independent Brexit research institute called UK in a Changing Europe and a professor at King ’ s College in London . He ’ s also the co-author of the book Brexit and British Politics .
We discussed the current polarization over the Brexit , and why it doesn ’ t break down neatly along the traditional political lines of the Conservative or Labour parties . He also discussed the challenges that May faces as she tries to convince her Conservative Party and the rest of Parliament to support the agreement .
Our conversation , which has been condensed and edited for clarity , follows .
Can you put the current debate over the Brexit plan into context ?
The [ Brexit ] deal is almost a cipher for a completely different debate . We ’ re still , in a sense , fighting the referendum .
One side in Parliament is focused on defeating the deal , because they don ’ t know if any deal is as good as [ EU ] membership . They see this as a proxy for getting to a second referendum .
Then there ’ s the other side . Some of them have always wanted to leave the European Union without worrying about a trade deal . There is no deal that could have satisfied this group , and they ’ re anxious to vote it down because their aspiration is that we leave with no deal .
There are also other Tory MPs who want some kind of deal but would rather have no deal than the deal that is being offered .
The middle ground in Parliament is disappearing , and we ’ re seeing these two rival camps who are sworn enemies walking through the lobbies together because they see the chaos that would ensue from the deal being defeated as being the route to their preferred outcome .
Crashing out of the EU without a deal seems like it could be really disastrous . Why take the risk ?
There are proponents of chaos on both sides of the divide — on the far left and the far right . They think that the UK leaving the EU with no Brexit deal will create the chaos necessary for the kind of radical reform this country needs .
It ’ s not a very easy thing to say out loud , so they don ’ t tend to say it out loud . They tend to say , “ It will be fine , don ’ t worry about it , ” or , “ The implications of no deal are being exaggerated. ” What you never know when you ’ re talking to people in this debate is whether they actually mean what they say or they ’ re saying it for tactical reasons .
So is anyone in the UK Parliament enthusiastic about the deal that May and the EU have put forward ?
Because we are polarized into “ Remain ” and “ Leave ” camps in this country , no one thinks this is perfect or ideal . There are some people who are willing to go along with it , but as I said , there are a lot of people who are using this as a proxy for something else .
What we don ’ t know is whether or not this will change as we approach the actual vote around December 11 or 12 . The initial reaction to the text was hostile , but the campaigning begins now .
That ’ s going to take several forms . The prime minister is going to go around the country campaigning to ordinary people about it . It will also doubtless take the form of the odd intervention from people from the European Union saying this is the only deal on offer .
The rumors are , [ May ] is going to try to get foreign leaders , like the Japanese prime minister , to come out and say this is good . We ’ ll just have to see how it goes . There ’ s no doubt that it will be a very , very hard task to get this through Parliament at the moment .
And what about all this talk of a second referendum ? How realistic is it ?
One of the very curious things about British politics as it stands now is we face one of a number of very implausible outcomes . We might have an election . We might have a referendum . We might have no deal . The prime minister ’ s deal might be accepted .

Now May needs to sell the deal at home, and persuade members of the UK Parliament to back the agreement for a vote in early December. There’s just one problem: Most of the United Kingdom seems to despise the plan.

The debate over how the UK and the EU should split up has exposed deep and intractable fault lines in British politics. The June 2016 referendum, in which 52 percent of the UK voted to leave the European Union, exposed schisms that will likely last long after the official Brexit deadline of March 29, 2019.

To better understand the contours of the current debate, I reached out to Anand Menon, the director of an independent Brexit research institute called UK in a Changing Europe and a professor at King’s College in London. He’s also the co-author of the book Brexit and British Politics.

We discussed the current polarization over the Brexit, and why it doesn’t break down neatly along the traditional political lines of the Conservative or Labour parties. He also discussed the challenges that May faces as she tries to convince her Conservative Party and the rest of Parliament to support the agreement.

Our conversation, which has been condensed and edited for clarity, follows.

Jen Kirby

Can you put the current debate over the Brexit plan into context?

Anand Menon

The [Brexit] deal is almost a cipher for a completely different debate. We’re still, in a sense, fighting the referendum.

One side in Parliament is focused on defeating the deal, because they don’t know if any deal is as good as [EU] membership. They see this as a proxy for getting to a second referendum.

Then there’s the other side. Some of them have always wanted to leave the European Union without worrying about a trade deal. There is no deal that could have satisfied this group, and they’re anxious to vote it down because their aspiration is that we leave with no deal.

There are also other Tory MPs who want some kind of deal but would rather have no deal than the deal that is being offered.

The middle ground in Parliament is disappearing, and we’re seeing these two rival camps who are sworn enemies walking through the lobbies together because they see the chaos that would ensue from the deal being defeated as being the route to their preferred outcome.

Jen Kirby

Crashing out of the EU without a deal seems like it could be really disastrous. Why take the risk?

Anand Menon

There are proponents of chaos on both sides of the divide — on the far left and the far right. They think that the UK leaving the EU with no Brexit deal will create the chaos necessary for the kind of radical reform this country needs.

It’s not a very easy thing to say out loud, so they don’t tend to say it out loud. They tend to say, “It will be fine, don’t worry about it,” or, “The implications of no deal are being exaggerated.” What you never know when you’re talking to people in this debate is whether they actually mean what they say or they’re saying it for tactical reasons.

Jen Kirby

So is anyone in the UK Parliament enthusiastic about the deal that May and the EU have put forward?

Anand Menon

Because we are polarized into “Remain” and “Leave” camps in this country, no one thinks this is perfect or ideal. There are some people who are willing to go along with it, but as I said, there are a lot of people who are using this as a proxy for something else.

What we don’t know is whether or not this will change as we approach the actual vote around December 11 or 12. The initial reaction to the text was hostile, but the campaigning begins now.

That’s going to take several forms. The prime minister is going to go around the country campaigning to ordinary people about it. It will also doubtless take the form of the odd intervention from people from the European Union saying this is the only deal on offer.

The rumors are, [May] is going to try to get foreign leaders, like the Japanese prime minister, to come out and say this is good. We’ll just have to see how it goes. There’s no doubt that it will be a very, very hard task to get this through Parliament at the moment.

Jen Kirby

And what about all this talk of a second referendum? How realistic is it?

Anand Menon

One of the very curious things about British politics as it stands now is we face one of a number of very implausible outcomes. We might have an election. We might have a referendum. We might have no deal. The prime minister’s deal might be accepted.

They’re all massively implausible, okay? But what we know is that one of them is going to happen. That’s what makes things in Britain so odd.

Of course, you could get a referendum. It will be very, very hard because you would need government to move a bill to say there is a referendum. So it could be that some amorphous gathering of backbench MPs vote in favor of a referendum, and that’s enough to force a government to put a motion through.

Remember, the last local elections we had, the calculation was around 70 percent of Conservative voters were “leavers.” So for a Conservative government to preside over a [second] referendum that voted to remain, which it may not, but hypothetically could, would be incredibly damaging for the Conservative brand.

So it’s very hard to see circumstances in which the government would let this happen. But it might. The polling is close, and we’re uncertain about how such a referendum would go. It would be incredibly divisive.

Jen Kirby

It’s been hard to pin down the Labour Party’s position on Brexit. They’ve seemed pretty ambivalent about it.

Anand Menon

As the opposition, that’s an ability you have: You don’t have to be as specific as the government does. But I do wonder, as we go toward this parliamentary vote and Labour keeps saying, “We are going to vote against the government’s deal,” whether the media might push them into saying, “Okay, you’re going to vote against the deal. What sort of deal would you accept?”

There are huge contradictions in Labour’s policies. What Labour seems to be promising is something that the European Union simply won’t give — ending free movement of people but having a very good relationship with the single market, being inside a customs union with the EU but still being allowed to have a say over EU trade deals. None of that is on the table as far as the EU is concerned.

Jen Kirby

Does part of the opposition to this Brexit deal come down to the fact that Brexiteers who promoted leaving the European Union made promises that they ultimately couldn’t keep, or didn’t hold up to reality?

Anand Menon

The Leave campaign was all things to all men.

Some people voted to leave for contradictory reasons. One of the things the Leave camp did very, very well was it harnessed dissatisfaction with the political elite, with the politics of austerity, and those people voted to leave because they saw it as a way of getting more money for public services.

There are Conservative leavers who see Brexit as a way of shrinking the state still further. So you can’t find a solution that’s gonna please every Leaver.

That’s one of the big problems in Britain at the moment. A lot of falsehoods were spouted during the referendum, but here we are now, and the problem is there isn’t a majority for any outcome.

That’s why, in a sense, the pain of Parliament is understandable. It’s the pain of the people. We don’t have a stable majority for any outcome.

Jen Kirby

What is the public perception of the Brexit debate?

Anand Menon

The public are divided down the middle. One of the reasons they’re divided down the middle — and this is not dissimilar to the US — is because Brexit has activated a values divide.

This isn’t a traditional left-right thing. This is almost our equivalent to a culture war. If you want to predict how people voted, it’s their views on diversity, on gay rights, on gender equality, on the death penalty. It’s those values issues that people are coalescing around.

What we know about those issues is once they’ve been ignited in political debate, they’re very hard to put out again. People hold those beliefs very deeply and find it hard to change them. That’s one of the reasons why people aren’t changing their minds. It’s one of the reasons why the Brexit division is proving to be a very deep division indeed. A majority of British people now identify themselves as Leaver or Remainer rather than Labour or Tory.

At the same time, no one has a huge amount of faith in any of our political leaders because the perception is that both Theresa May and [Labour Party leader] Jeremy Corbyn just aren’t very competent at their jobs.

Finally, one of the reasons this is messy is because we have a series of crises going on at the same time, all of which, except Brexit, were brewing before the referendum, and all of which have been made worse by the referendum.

We’ve got a crisis of economics because of high levels of inequality and an enormous amount of economic pain being placed upon those least able to deal with it through austerity. We’ve got a crisis of trust in politics that I suppose goes back to Iraq, was made far worse by the MPs expenses scandal, wasn’t helped by the coalition government, and was one of the reasons why people voted to leave.

We have a constitutional crisis brewing in Scotland that was brewing before the referendum because of their referendum on independence. And even before the Brexit referendum, there was a crisis brewing in Northern Ireland. It’s been made far worse because of Brexit.

There are all these different crises swirling around at the same time. They’ve all been made worse by Brexit, but they haven’t been caused by Brexit, necessarily. That’s one of the reasons this is proving so intractable.

Jen Kirby

This division: What does it mean for the future of British politics?

Anand Menon

Oh, god. I have no clue. It is very hard to see what’s going to happen in the next two or three weeks, let alone what’s going to happen in the next two or three or 10 years.

Analysis: Confused and angry

By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley

Parliament feels like a confused and sometimes angry place today. As Theresa May fights for further assurances on the backstop, many are unconvinced. Even among Conservatives loyal to her, the mood is bleak.

One Tory MP who supported the PM's deal told me they didn't have a clue what was happening now. ""We're rewriting the pantomime,"" they added. Another pondered: ""The Conservatives made this muddle - who is going to fix it?"" One minister concluded things were at ""breaking point"".

Brexiteers speak openly of exasperation.

One source, who has been highly critical of the plan but not the PM, told me many were changing their minds now; Mrs May is now seen as the problem. It's not the first time we've heard such claims - and in the past they haven't materialised.

But this person said a number of Brexit backers who have resisted pressure to send in letters calling for a vote of no confidence in the PM as Tory leader have now changed their minds.

UK PARLIAMENT ATTACK IS THE LATEST TERROR SCARE FOR LONDON

great_britain,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46535739,Theresa May to face vote of no confidence from Tory MPs,,,"Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader .
The UK prime minister made a last-minute appeal for support at an emotional meeting of backbench MPs .
She told them she will not lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022 - but wants to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal , MPs said .
She faces a vote of confidence in her leadership after 48 Conservative MPs called for one to be held .
The majority of Conservative MPs have publicly said they will support the PM but it is a secret ballot and there were signs of nerves among party managers ahead of the vote in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster .
Voting finished at 20:00 with the result expected within the next hour .
The prime minister was greeted with applause , and the traditional banging of desks , as she went in to the committee room to address her MPs . Some of them were reported to be in tears .
She is understood to have promised not to call a `` snap general election '' and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election , partly because of what had happened at last year 's election , when she lost her majority .
But , she added : `` I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election . ''
Cabinet minister Amber Rudd said `` she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022 '' .
But Jacob Rees-Mogg , a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May , said she had received a `` half-hearted '' reception from MPs .
She had said it was not her `` intention '' to fight the next election , added Mr Rees-Mogg , which he said was a `` politician 's word '' .
Marcus Fysh , who also submitted a no confidence letter , said Mrs May `` did n't really have anything new to say '' about Brexit .
She vowed to involve more people in developing policy , the MP told ███ , but he did not think that would happen .
And he predicted that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote of all MPs - not just Conservative ones - when she tried to get her Brexit deal through the Commons .
`` Whatever happens tonight I do n't think she will be able to command the confidence of the House for the type of Brexit she is trying to pursue . ''
Minister Margot James said she was `` proud '' to have voted for the PM , tweeting a picture of her ballot paper .
Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader , undisturbed , for another 12 months .
That takes one uncertainty off the table . But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through .
Already , cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack .
The parliamentary sums do n't change on her current planned agreement with the EU . The cabinet , let alone the rest of the Commons , wo n't give their backing .
Immediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet , including several who have been touted as possible successors .
Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was `` the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29 '' , while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would `` flush out the extremists '' in his party whose Brexit agenda was `` not in the interests of the British people '' .
So far , 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her , with 34 publicly against , according to BBC research . She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive .
If Mrs May wins the confidence vote she can not be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year .
If she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand .
If Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand .
In her statement delivered early on Wednesday morning , Mrs May said : `` A leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the Parliamentary arithmetic .
`` Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country . None of that would be in the national interest . ''
She said she was making progress in her talks with EU leaders and vowed to `` deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead '' .
The Conservatives had to build a `` country that works for everyone '' and deliver `` the Brexit people voted for '' .
`` I have devoted myself unsparingly to these tasks ever since I became prime minister and I stand ready to finish the job . ''
Will there be a new prime minister if she loses the vote ?
Not immediately . She would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new Conservative leader is selected by the party , a process that could take up to six weeks .
If there are multiple candidates , Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members .
As leader of the largest party in the Commons , the new Conservative leader would then be expected to be asked to form a government and become prime minister , without a general election .
Mrs May faced repeated calls from Labour MPs for her to quit - or hold another EU referendum - at a rowdy Prime Minister 's Questions .
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said : `` The time for dithering and delay is over . The prime minister has negotiated her deal . She has told us it is the best and only deal available .
`` There can be no more excuses , no more running away . Put it before Parliament and let 's have the vote . ''
Mrs May said the vote will take place , and as Labour MPs shouted `` when ? '' at her she said : `` We 've had a meaningful vote , we had it in in the referendum in 2016 . ''
The PM added : `` And if he wants a meaningful date I 'll give him one ; 29 March 2019 when we leave the European Union . ''
Veteran pro-European MP Ken Clarke called the prospect of a leadership contest `` unhelpful , irrelevant and irresponsible '' , prompting loud cheers from the Tory benches .
But the SNP 's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Mrs May to stand down , saying her government was `` an embarrassment '' .
The challenge has been brought by Conservative MPs who think Mrs May has watered down the Brexit voters were promised in the 2016 referendum .
The PM thought she had seen off an attempt by this group of Brexiteers to get rid of her last month .
But her decision to cancel Tuesday 's Parliamentary vote on her deal at the last minute proved to be the final straw for many who had previously given her the benefit of the doubt .
There needed to be 48 MPs calling for her to go - out of 317 Conservative MPs - to trigger a confidence vote and this threshold was reached on Tuesday .
Jacob Rees-Mogg , who has led backbench calls for her to go , said : `` Theresa May 's plan would bring down the government if carried forward . But our party will rightly not tolerate it .
`` Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May 's leadership . In the national interest , she must go . ''
And Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists , who he said had lost faith in Mrs May .
Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston , who is campaigning for a further referendum , told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg 's group would `` get a kicking '' in the vote and that their `` pompous gesturing '' will be exposed .
They do n't like the deal she has struck with the EU , which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world .
Anger has focused on the so-called `` backstop '' to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland .
Mrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be `` temporary '' but the Democratic Unionist Party , which she relies on to win key votes , wants the backstop to be ditched altogether .
And her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated .
Who are the frontrunners to lead the party if she loses ?
There are many names being floated , with Home Secretary Sajid Javid , Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt , Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd among cabinet ministers rated by the bookmakers .
Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab , ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running .
But , as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says , the field of hopefuls could be much larger and , initially at least , resemble the start of a Grand National .
Whatever the outcome of the vote , Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday 's summit of EU leaders , although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership .
She has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to `` adopt relevant conclusions '' .
European Council President Donald Tusk has said the `` seriousness '' of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning .
Mrs May met Germany 's Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament .
But she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar , among others , on Wednesday to fight for her leadership .
Mrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs - many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum .
Many of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms , without a deal . They say warnings of economic doom are exaggerated .","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May smiles at gathered journalists as she awaits the result

Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader.

That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through.

Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack.

The parliamentary sums don't change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won't give their backing.

Can she survive the confidence vote?

Immediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors.

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was ""the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29"", while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would ""flush out the extremists"" in his party whose Brexit agenda was ""not in the interests of the British people"".

So far, 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her, with 34 publicly against, according to BBC research. She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive.

If Mrs May wins the confidence vote she cannot be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year.

If she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand.

If Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand.

What has Theresa May said?

In her statement delivered early on Wednesday morning, Mrs May said: ""A leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the Parliamentary arithmetic.

""Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country. None of that would be in the national interest.""

She said she was making progress in her talks with EU leaders and vowed to ""deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead"".

The Conservatives had to build a ""country that works for everyone"" and deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"".

""I have devoted myself unsparingly to these tasks ever since I became prime minister and I stand ready to finish the job.""

Will there be a new prime minister if she loses the vote?

Not immediately. She would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new Conservative leader is selected by the party, a process that could take up to six weeks.

If there are multiple candidates, Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members.

As leader of the largest party in the Commons, the new Conservative leader would then be expected to be asked to form a government and become prime minister, without a general election.

It's Wednesday, so... Prime Minister's Questions

Mrs May faced repeated calls from Labour MPs for her to quit - or hold another EU referendum - at a rowdy Prime Minister's Questions.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The time for dithering and delay is over. The prime minister has negotiated her deal. She has told us it is the best and only deal available.

""There can be no more excuses, no more running away. Put it before Parliament and let's have the vote.""

Mrs May said the vote will take place, and as Labour MPs shouted ""when?"" at her she said: ""We've had a meaningful vote, we had it in in the referendum in 2016.""

The PM added: ""And if he wants a meaningful date I'll give him one; 29 March 2019 when we leave the European Union.""

Veteran pro-European MP Ken Clarke called the prospect of a leadership contest ""unhelpful, irrelevant and irresponsible"", prompting loud cheers from the Tory benches.

But the SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Mrs May to stand down, saying her government was ""an embarrassment"".

Who is trying to oust Mrs May?

Image copyright PA Image caption Jacob Rees-Mogg: In the national interest, she must go

The challenge has been brought by Conservative MPs who think Mrs May has watered down the Brexit voters were promised in the 2016 referendum.

The PM thought she had seen off an attempt by this group of Brexiteers to get rid of her last month.

But her decision to cancel Tuesday's Parliamentary vote on her deal at the last minute proved to be the final straw for many who had previously given her the benefit of the doubt.

There needed to be 48 MPs calling for her to go - out of 317 Conservative MPs - to trigger a confidence vote and this threshold was reached on Tuesday.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has led backbench calls for her to go, said: ""Theresa May's plan would bring down the government if carried forward. But our party will rightly not tolerate it.

""Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May's leadership. In the national interest, she must go.""

And Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who he said had lost faith in Mrs May.

Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who is campaigning for a further referendum, told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg's group would ""get a kicking"" in the vote and that their ""pompous gesturing"" will be exposed.

Why are they trying to get rid of her?

They don't like the deal she has struck with the EU, which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world.

Anger has focused on the so-called ""backstop"" to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland.

Mrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be ""temporary"" but the Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to win key votes, wants the backstop to be ditched altogether.

And her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated.

Who are the frontrunners to lead the party if she loses?

Image copyright AFP Image caption Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd

There are many names being floated, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd among cabinet ministers rated by the bookmakers.

Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running.

But, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, the field of hopefuls could be much larger and, initially at least, resemble the start of a Grand National.

What does it mean for Brexit?

Whatever the outcome of the vote, Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday's summit of EU leaders, although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership.

She has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to ""adopt relevant conclusions"".

European Council President Donald Tusk has said the ""seriousness"" of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning.

Mrs May met Germany's Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament.

But she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, among others, on Wednesday to fight for her leadership.

Mrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs - many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum.

Many of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms, without a deal. They say warnings of economic doom are exaggerated.",www.bbc.com,center,Kh5Rt6k3u2kYN4Dy

The president added that Kahn reminded him of the `` terrible '' leader of his hometown , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio though `` only half his height .

The anniversary events will begin in Portsmouth , England , where the invasion was launched , and then move to Normandy , France , where Allied forces began to recapture Western Europe from the Nazis .
The day is normally a heartfelt tribute to unity and sacrifice , outweighing any national or political skirmish . But some on both sides of the Atlantic are nervous about Trump , who has shown a willingness to inject partisanship into such moments .

Trump said later that he thought Markle would be ""very good"" as a royal and claimed he only meant her comments were ""nasty.""

Trump will also make his first presidential visit to Ireland on Wednesday. Trump will spend two nights at his golf club in Doonbeg, which sits above the Atlantic. After Dublin balked at holding a meeting there, a deal was struck for Trump to meet Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at Shannon Airport.

The centerpiece of the president's visit will be two days to mark the 75th anniversary of the June 6, 1944, D-Day anniversary, likely the last significant commemoration most veterans of the battle will see. The anniversary events will begin in Portsmouth, England, where the invasion was launched, and then move to Normandy, France, where Allied forces began to recapture Western Europe from the Nazis.

The day is normally a heartfelt tribute to unity and sacrifice, outweighing any national or political skirmish. But some on both sides of the Atlantic are nervous about Trump, who has shown a willingness to inject partisanship into such moments.

Last November in France, Trump was heavily criticized for skipping a ceremony at an American military cemetery to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I when rain grounded his helicopter. European leaders, meanwhile, stood in the rain to honor the dead.",www.newsmax.com,right,WnayOCCe87PfYNmh

( It ’ s worth noting that Corbyn is much further left than Warren or Sanders . ) ” Brian Klaas , Washington Post
Some , however , contend that Johnson “ is quietly forging a new conservatism — appealing to the working poor and aspiring middle classes , tough on immigration and crime , but much more generous in spending on hospitals and schools and science… “ [ Johnson ] has done what no other conservative leader in the West has done : He has co-opted and thereby neutered the far right . The reactionary Brexit Party has all but collapsed since Boris took over . Anti-immigration fervor has calmed . The Tories have also moved back to the economic and social center… [ They ] now favor tax cuts for the poor , have a strong program for climate change , and have proposed an Australian-style immigration policy to defuse native panic… the Johnson strategy is one every other major democracy should examine. ” Andrew Sullivan , New York Magazine
“ This election could also signal the end of the United Kingdom as a political entity . Scottish nationalists gained 13 constituencies… and now occupy 48 of Scotland ’ s 59 Westminster seats .

Northern Irish nationalists , too , earned significant victories , while unionists continue to denounce Johnson ’ s Brexit deal , which erects a customs wall with Great Britain… Brexit was never a project of the whole country , and only England and Wales endorsed it . Its dependence on nostalgia , anti-immigrant sentiment and the language of global buccaneering and domestic control profoundly alienates other parts of the U.K. ” Jonathan Lis , Washington Post
“ The voters who gave Mr. Johnson the largest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher share few of the free-trade or deregulatory instincts of the Brexiteers who masterminded Mr. Johnson ’ s campaign or filled his last cabinet . These voters want safe jobs , protection from imports and the restoration of a Britain that vanished in the contrails of the global economy . That is worlds away from the agile , economically open , lightly regulated Britain that Mr. Johnson ’ s Downing Street brain trust envisions — Singapore-on-Thames , to use their preferred marketing slogan . Reconciling those two models will be difficult , if not impossible , even for an ideologically flexible prime minister. ” Mark Landler , New York Times
“ It 's important to remember that a lot of the challenges for the UK have yet to come … Johnson is hoping to secure a new trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2020 , before the end of the so-called transition period -- during which the UK will be formally out of the bloc , but still subject to all its rules and regulations . That 's a quick turnaround , especially if he seeks to diverge significantly from EU rules , as he has indicated… “ And the second phase of Brexit negotiations is set to be more trying than the last . For months we have watched Westminster for make or break votes , but the ratification process will turn our collective attention to parliaments all across the European Union -- every member state will get a vote and veto on the framework of the UK 's future relationship. ” Eliza Mackintosh , CNN
“ Every year since the referendum , the average company in Ireland — which trades heavily with Britain — has seen its growth in investment reduced by 4.2 percent , and hiring is 15 percent less than it otherwise would have been because of uncertainty , [ a new paper ] concludes . Yet even across the Atlantic , the average American company has seen investment growth limited by 0.5 percent a year and hiring slowed by 1.7 percent… If Brexit uncertainty has been damaging , what replaces it is the near certainty of weaker economic growth and diminished living standards . ” Peter S.

“ For many , [ this election ] represented a second referendum on Brexit — a chance to say , ‘ we really meant it the first time. ’ For others , many of whom were not enthusiastic about Brexit in 2016 , last night represented a chance to move on . One does not have to have been an ardent Leaver to have been appalled at the way in which the will of the people has been thwarted . Boris Johnson ’ s promise to ‘ get Brexit done ’ resonated… Then there was Corbyn himself . It should have come as no surprise that Corbyn was most unpopular with Britons who remember the dark days of the 1970s . Britain has tried Corbyn ’ s ideas before , and they resulted in disastrous inflation , economic stagnation , high unemployment , routine power-cuts , industrial strife , a reduction in national prestige , and a penchant for nationalization that led to scarcity , abysmal customer service , and a virtual end to innovation . ”
“ Brexit was the main question in this election , and it will be the main question for a while during the aftermath . Once it is resolved — and with this majority , it will be — it will disappear fairly quickly . When it does , the big question for the Conservatives will be : ‘ Now what ? ’ Hoping to avoid the fate of his predecessor , Boris Johnson ran a distinctly unconservative campaign , promising to spend lavishly on the National Health Service , to keep taxes at their present level and to increase funding across the board . Compared to Jeremy Corbyn , Boris Johnson looks like Margaret Thatcher . But compared to Margaret Thatcher , Johnson looks like a centrist without too many big ideas . How — and if — he will keep the Labour voters who defected over Brexit remains to be seen . ”
“ Naturally , there were instinctive reactions from the left to blame it on racism and xenophobia , but statistics prove otherwise . There was one particular interview on BBC , where three Labour voters from the heart of England who never voted Conservative in their entire lives talked about how surreal it was to not vote Labour… The nationalism in question here isn ’ t one based on race or ethnicity . Every BBC interview was showing British people of Nigerian , Indian , Hong-Kong Chinese , and even European heritage , saying why they voted Conservative… There will be swings in the future , and some of those seats will go back to Labour again , but a healthy , civic nationalism is a vote winner . ”
“ There are obvious lessons here for American politics . As working-class voters migrate to the Republican column , the GOP will probably have to do more to represent blue-collar concerns in its policy platform… A radical swing to the left — especially on cultural issues — could pose a danger to Democrats in 2020 . Many suburban voters are suspicious of Trump , but they are also repelled by plans to abolish private health insurance and impose radical ‘ wokeness ’ upon the nation as a whole… In this time of political realignment , center-right political parties can wrack up major wins by taking populist concerns seriously while also offering an inclusive message . One of the great challenges facing the center-right in the years ahead might , then , be how to balance market principles and worker priorities . ”
“ Left-leaning liberals such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders would be wise to pay attention . Corbyn has spent much of the past four years as the party leader pushing Labour further and further to the left , advocating for the ‘ un-privatization ’ of municipal energy companies and railways , among other things . Corbyn wanted nothing short of a complete economic transformation . He even referred to his own platform as ‘ radical. ’ And his party 's unexpected albeit modest gains in the 2017 British election suggested that he might just achieve it…
“ Like Corbyn , Warren , and Sanders have built their presidential campaigns on bold promises of radical change : heavy taxes on the rich , extensive government-subsidized programs , such as ‘ Medicare for all , ’ and a sweeping crackdown on private corporations… Labour ’ s big loss has given moderate Democrats , such as former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg , one more reason to argue that their colleagues ’ policies could backfire next year . ”
“ If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? … the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . ”
Others note , “ I ’ d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump ’ s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “ I think Joe Sixpack ’ s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama ’ s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack ’ s attention you are going to have to do better than this . ”","Others argue that “Biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person.

Reconciling those two models will be difficult, if not impossible , even for an ideologically flexible prime minister.” Mark Landler, New York Times

“It's important to remember that a lot of the challenges for the UK have yet to come … Johnson is hoping to secure a new trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2020, before the end of the so-called transition period -- during which the UK will be formally out of the bloc, but still subject to all its rules and regulations. That's a quick turnaround, especially if he seeks to diverge significantly from EU rules, as he has indicated… “And the second phase of Brexit negotiations is set to be more trying than the last. For months we have watched Westminster for make or break votes, but the ratification process will turn our collective attention to parliaments all across the European Union -- every member state will get a vote and veto on the framework of the UK's future relationship.” Eliza Mackintosh, CNN

“Every year since the referendum, the average company in Ireland — which trades heavily with Britain — has seen its growth in investment reduced by 4.2 percent, and hiring is 15 percent less than it otherwise would have been because of uncertainty, [a new paper] concludes. Yet even across the Atlantic, the average American company has seen investment growth limited by 0.5 percent a year and hiring slowed by 1.7 percent… If Brexit uncertainty has been damaging, what replaces it is the near certainty of weaker economic growth and diminished living standards .” Peter S. Goodman, New York Times

The right sees the vote as a rejection of Labour’s embrace of far-left policies and affirmation of Brexit, and argues that Democrats will face a similar fate in 2020 if they fail to nominate a moderate.

“For many, [this election] represented a second referendum on Brexit — a chance to say, ‘we really meant it the first time.’ For others, many of whom were not enthusiastic about Brexit in 2016, last night represented a chance to move on. One does not have to have been an ardent Leaver to have been appalled at the way in which the will of the people has been thwarted. Boris Johnson’s promise to ‘get Brexit done’ resonated… Then there was Corbyn himself. It should have come as no surprise that Corbyn was most unpopular with Britons who remember the dark days of the 1970s. Britain has tried Corbyn’s ideas before, and they resulted in disastrous inflation, economic stagnation, high unemployment, routine power-cuts, industrial strife, a reduction in national prestige, and a penchant for nationalization that led to scarcity, abysmal customer service, and a virtual end to innovation.”

“Brexit was the main question in this election, and it will be the main question for a while during the aftermath. Once it is resolved — and with this majority, it will be — it will disappear fairly quickly. When it does, the big question for the Conservatives will be: ‘Now what?’ Hoping to avoid the fate of his predecessor, Boris Johnson ran a distinctly unconservative campaign, promising to spend lavishly on the National Health Service, to keep taxes at their present level and to increase funding across the board. Compared to Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson looks like Margaret Thatcher. But compared to Margaret Thatcher, Johnson looks like a centrist without too many big ideas. How — and if — he will keep the Labour voters who defected over Brexit remains to be seen.”

Charles C.W. Cooke, New York Post

“Naturally, there were instinctive reactions from the left to blame it on racism and xenophobia, but statistics prove otherwise. There was one particular interview on BBC, where three Labour voters from the heart of England who never voted Conservative in their entire lives talked about how surreal it was to not vote Labour… The nationalism in question here isn’t one based on race or ethnicity. Every BBC interview was showing British people of Nigerian, Indian, Hong-Kong Chinese, and even European heritage, saying why they voted Conservative… There will be swings in the future, and some of those seats will go back to Labour again, but a healthy, civic nationalism is a vote winner.”

Sumantra Maitra, The Federalist

“There are obvious lessons here for American politics. As working-class voters migrate to the Republican column, the GOP will probably have to do more to represent blue-collar concerns in its policy platform… A radical swing to the left — especially on cultural issues — could pose a danger to Democrats in 2020. Many suburban voters are suspicious of Trump, but they are also repelled by plans to abolish private health insurance and impose radical ‘wokeness’ upon the nation as a whole… In this time of political realignment, center-right political parties can wrack up major wins by taking populist concerns seriously while also offering an inclusive message. One of the great challenges facing the center-right in the years ahead might, then, be how to balance market principles and worker priorities.”

Fred Bauer, National Review

“Left-leaning liberals such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders would be wise to pay attention. Corbyn has spent much of the past four years as the party leader pushing Labour further and further to the left, advocating for the ‘un-privatization’ of municipal energy companies and railways, among other things. Corbyn wanted nothing short of a complete economic transformation. He even referred to his own platform as ‘radical.’ And his party's unexpected albeit modest gains in the 2017 British election suggested that he might just achieve it…



“Like Corbyn, Warren, and Sanders have built their presidential campaigns on bold promises of radical change: heavy taxes on the rich, extensive government-subsidized programs, such as ‘Medicare for all,’ and a sweeping crackdown on private corporations… Labour’s big loss has given moderate Democrats, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, one more reason to argue that their colleagues’ policies could backfire next year.”

Kaylee McGhee, Washington Examiner

“If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy. In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors?… the nation does not want another war. How we avoid it, however, is becoming difficult to see. John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing, but his soul is marching on.”

Patrick Buchanan, The American Conservative

Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After all that has emerged about Trump so far, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”

Both Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke well in yesterday ’ s parliamentary debate on the Queen ’ s Speech — an occasion heavy with tradition and ceremony but dedicated in reality to the sober business of setting out the government ’ s legislative program for the next year . As every pundit has now pointed out , this Queen ’ s Speech is a stripped-down program from which most of the controversial items in May ’ s doomed election manifesto ( her “ dementia tax , ” for instance ) have been removed .
It is now devoted largely to bills that will implement the domestic reforms needed to put Brexit into effect once negotiations with the European Union have concluded . Quite cleverly , the legislative draughtsmen have put most of these items in positive terms so that it will be tricky for opposition spokesmen to object to bills that promote free-trade agreements with friendly countries or that give Britain ’ s fishermen control of their traditional fishing grounds .
Despite the near-hysterical political atmosphere of the days since the election — an atmosphere made more poisonous by the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire and the angry public outcry it has provoked — the debate itself was a surprisingly calm and friendly affair . It began with the two traditionally “ witty ” speeches from backbenchers from opposing sides . This time they were genuinely witty . That lightened the atmosphere . Then both May and Corbyn delivered strong and effective parliamentary performances that cheered up their troops .
That was far easier for Corbyn than for May . He had a “ good war ” in the campaign , and he delivered a better result for Labour than almost anyone except himself expected . He ’ s currently the beneficiary of the myth that Labour “ won ” and that the momentum of that victory will shortly carry the party into office . Not least , Corbyn ’ s speech yesterday , tough but not rancorous or bitter , was well calculated to appeal to both sides of the House . Like many other voters , even Tories may be starting to “ like ” Corbyn because of his courtesy .
May had the more difficult task of reviving and uniting a party that blames her for its loss of seats following a bad campaign built around her . Her bad public image has actually got worse since the election because of her awkward and “ frozen ” response to the Grenfell fire . That hostility has been exaggerated and unfair — even some Labour local politicians have testified to how helpful and reliable she has been in working with them on joint national-local projects and emergency programs . After a brief pause , she has put in place a series of measures to help the Grenfell tenants and to discover the causes of the fire . She met them privately in meetings that seemingly went well . In effect , for the last week she has been pilloried for being shy and emotionally reserved — even , dare one say , for being typically English .
She began her speech by apologizing for the immediate delay in responding effectively to the Grenfell fire . She dealt in detail with the inquiry into it , answering 16 questions from MPs , and with wider matters about the housing-safety regulations as well as the legislative program . She was dogged , thorough , practical , and in command of her brief . She even cracked a few jokes at appropriate moments . By the time she concluded , she no longer fitted George Osborne ’ s malicious description of “ a dead woman walking . ”
These two strong performances , Theresa May ’ s and Jeremy Corbyn ’ s debate on the Queen ’ s Speech , were illustrations of a larger return to political normalcy : Two-party politics is back .
These two strong performances were illustrations of a larger return to political normalcy : Two-party politics is back . MPs representing the Liberal Democrats , the Scottish National Party , and other small parties were greatly reduced in numbers by the election . In Scotland alone , the Tories and Labour both increased the number of their MPs at the cost of the shrunken Scot-Nats . In electoral mathematics , the share of the total vote taken by the two major parties rose to 83 percent — sharply higher than the mid-60s figure of Tony Blair ’ s day . UKIP , which had only one MP in the past , lost both him and five-sixths of its support in the country . However temporarily , it ’ s back to the Tory–Labour ding-dong of most of the 20th century .
The exception to this new status quo , of course , is Northern Ireland ’ s newly important Democratic Unionist party , which is haggling over the terms of its support for the May government as I write . Most observers think that such a deal is a live certainty because the solidly unionist DUP would do nothing whatever that might bring a longstanding friend of the IRA like Jeremy Corbyn anywhere near the inside of Ten Downing Street
But could a minority Tory government , with or without the support of the Democratic Unionist party , stay in power for more than a few months ? On the morrow of the election the sentiment on all sides was : No , it couldn ’ t do so . That fueled the demands for May ’ s immediate resignation or defenestration . Briefly , it seemed inevitable .
As a young parliamentary correspondent in the 1970s , however , I watched Jim Callaghan ’ s government survive for two years after it lost its majority in April 1977 . When Callaghan left office following his defeat at the hands of Mrs. Thatcher , he did so amid general respect after a failed but respectable administration . But if the DUP joins the Tories in a de facto coalition , Prime Minister May would enjoy an effective parliamentary majority of 22 . That ’ s more than enough to survive for the full parliamentary term of five years .
Tory ministers and MPs woke up to this ambiguous reality in a short time . That explains why by the Monday evening after defeat the cabinet had been reshuffled , talks with the DUP were taking place , and the 1922 Committee ( which is the forum for Tory backbenchers ) had given the prime minister a warm reception once she had humbled herself . ( “ I got us into this mess and I will get us out. ” ) It is not inconceivable that Mrs. May could serve as prime minister for a full Parliament and lead the Tories into the next election .
It ’ s not likely , though . Rightly or wrongly , she is currently regarded by the great majority of Tories as unelectable in any future U.K. election . And since a contest could occur at a moment not of the government ’ s choosing — following , for instance , a breach with the DUP — Mrs. May may not be a dead woman walking , but she is an accident waiting to happen . The disposition of most of her colleagues is to allow her a little time in Downing Street during which the party can arrange an orderly leadership election and a smooth transfer to a new prime minister . That ’ s how it could happen — and how it likely will happen .
As the French say , though : Nothing lasts like the provisional . May is in possession of the ball . Those who want to succeed her will support a leadership contest only when they are confident they can win it — which means that , at any one moment , most of them will oppose it . ( At present the friends of Boris Johnson , foreign secretary , are shaking their heads solemnly and opining that a contest can not be held for two years — a sure sign that Brexit secretary David Davis would win one now . ) Most influential Tories seem to agree that the party needs stability in order to recover its mojo in power and allow the anti-Tory hysteria in London to dissipate . There are signs that is happening ; yesterday ’ s “ Day of Rage ” march in London attracted not the thousands expected but only a ragged few hundred . In addition , the more we learn about the Grenfell fire , the less it seems to be a simple morality tale about Tory “ cuts ” and deregulation . Grenfell was highly regulated , if perversely , and both parties nationally and locally were involved in that regulation and in supervising its expensive refurbishment .
As the French say : Nothing lasts like the provisional . May is in possession of the ball .
Given that a week is a long time in politics , perhaps the most likely scenario is that May will continue until Brexit has been passed , then ( having secured an honorable place in history ) announce her resignation , preside over the selection of her successor , and retire to the Upper House . That has to be one of several scenarios . Whatever happens , though , Brexit will be central to this new two-party politics — as it has been in establishing the new two-party status quo .
Brexit was the reason that May enjoyed the prospect of a landslide at the start of the campaign . The referendum had shaken up the supporters of both parties , but the Tories were most favored to gain new votes from the shakeup , as those UKIP defectors from Labour were defecting a second time to the Tories . Nationalist-minded Labour voters would also join them . It held out the glittering mirage of a national Tory majority . Then something happened that no one expected and very few people noticed except the voters .
Corbyn and his close ally , John McDonnell , Labour ’ s shadow chancellor , almost alone on the opposition front bench , neutralized Brexit as an issue not only by supporting it but also by embracing its clearest expression : leaving the single market . Result : Brexit was no long the Tory party ’ s unique selling proposition . Both major parties pledged in their manifestos to leave the single market ( i.e. , to implement a “ hard Brexit ” ) . Voters pocketed this pledge and turned to other issues — notably , the economy , on which the Tories did not have the clear advantage over Labour . There ’ s a lot to be said about that — in a different article — but here the point is that UKIP voters came to both parties , instead of overwhelmingly to the Tories , and that Labour voters stayed where they were . And since Brexit had been neutralized , the voters danced to Corbyn ’ s tune . His support rose from 28 to 40 percent in the course of the campaign .
Corbyn did well to win more than 30 extra seats from the Tories . But at the finish line he was still 50 seats behind them . The Tories won the largest share of the popular vote ( 42 percent ) , the largest number of parliamentary seats ( 318 ) , and the right to form a government if they mustered a majority to sustain one in the House of Commons . These are all the traditional tests of victory in a parliamentary election . Several Tories have said in recent days that their victory “ feels like a defeat. ” Maybe so . But it wasn ’ t a defeat , and the rest of the Parliament is likely to confirm that .
That ’ s especially so since Brexit is likely to return to center stage as the dominating issue for the next few years . Both parties are divided on Brexit , but Labour is more deeply and dangerously divided than the Tories . Conservatives have never been a sincere pro-EU party . Most of their leaders have embraced the European idea superficially in the last four decades , but their rank and file even among MPs has been skeptical to hostile . The referendum vote has made the Tory party immovably anti . Now even Remainers in the Tory leadership realize they can not push the party into an anti-Brexit posture ; the most they can do is delay and soften Britain ’ s departure — and even that will have to happen in the dark .
Labour is in a much more complicated position . The party in its manifesto has just committed itself to leaving the single market . Yet Corbyn and McDonnell are in a small parliamentary minority supporting that view . Most Labour MPs are Remainers , some passionately so . Fifty Labour parliamentarians renounced that pledge on the day Parliament resumed . On the other hand , the Labour party in the country is divided into three factions : Yuppie and Bobo social-democratic strivers who agree with the 50 Remainers ; Momentum hard leftists who support Corbyn and Labour ’ s leftward drift above all ; and traditional Labour blue-collar voters , who are tempted to stray into UKIP or Tory territory over the Brexit issue . Herding cats would be child ’ s play compared to keeping this menagerie in the same cage .
In this battle the Tories have majority opinion on their side . If they play it sensibly , they can regain the landslide potential they threw away in the last month . To do that , however , they will have to disprove an old saying : The Tory party never panics — except in a crisis .","Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (left) and Prime Minister Theresa May (Reuters photos: Andrew Yates, Toby Melville)

In a historic nail-biter of a referendum , the nation voted to exit the 28-member EU bloc , a result widely seen to have been driven public fear of immigration that has surged in the nation during recent years but which quickly prompted a run on the British currency .
Prime Minister David Cameron , who had campaigned against leaving the EU , announced Friday morning that he will resign in October , saying that “ fresh leadership ” is now needed in the U.K .
While turnout was at a near record levels , and officials had predicted a tally that was “ too close to call , ” the major TV networks BBC and ITV called a victory for the “ Leave ” forces in the so-called “ Brexit ” vote late Thursday night .
With more than 100 percent of the vote counted , the “ Leave ” forces had an edge of 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent .
The “ remain ” forces had carried a slight lead in several areas of the country during early counting on Thursday night . Heading into the referendum , a poll by IPSOS MORI , a leading market research company in the UK and Ireland , had predicted a 4-point victory for Britain to stay in the bloc that it joined in 1973 .
Indeed Nigel Farage , head of the anti-EU U.K . Independence Party , had telling reporters Thursday night his side may have come up just short . But later , he was exulting in what he called “ Independence Day ” for Britain .
“ I now dare to dream that the dawn is coming up on an independent United Kingdom , ” he said .
The economic effects were swift in early Friday trading in the markets in East Asia . Both Wall Street futures and the British pound had risen strongly Thursday in the belief that the remain forces would win .
The British currency Friday had lost about 12 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar Friday , with the pound worth $ 1.34 , a 30-year low and a 11 percent loss just since Thursday . The Euro was also off against other world currencies , as investors began to doubt the viability of the whole European Union .
The major stock-markets in East Asia all lost significant value , and trading on Japan ’ s Nikkei Index was reined in automatically under its “ circuit breaker ” rule , when the market had lost 8 percent of its value .
But on Thursday , the atmosphere was lively across the country . Long lines were reported at many polling stations as many braved torrential downpours and threats of flooding in some areas . Early indications were that turnout topped 70 percent — the highest since the 1997 general election .

In a historic nail-biter of a referendum, the nation voted to exit the 28-member EU bloc, a result widely seen to have been driven public fear of immigration that has surged in the nation during recent years but which quickly prompted a run on the British currency.

Prime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned against leaving the EU, announced Friday morning that he will resign in October, saying that “fresh leadership” is now needed in the U.K.

While turnout was at a near record levels, and officials had predicted a tally that was “too close to call,” the major TV networks BBC and ITV called a victory for the “Leave” forces in the so-called “Brexit” vote late Thursday night.

With more than 100 percent of the vote counted, the “Leave” forces had an edge of 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent.

The “remain” forces had carried a slight lead in several areas of the country during early counting on Thursday night. Heading into the referendum, a poll by IPSOS MORI, a leading market research company in the UK and Ireland, had predicted a 4-point victory for Britain to stay in the bloc that it joined in 1973.

Indeed Nigel Farage, head of the anti-EU U.K. Independence Party, had telling reporters Thursday night his side may have come up just short. But later, he was exulting in what he called “Independence Day” for Britain.

“I now dare to dream that the dawn is coming up on an independent United Kingdom,” he said.

The economic effects were swift in early Friday trading in the markets in East Asia. Both Wall Street futures and the British pound had risen strongly Thursday in the belief that the remain forces would win.

The British currency Friday had lost about 12 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar Friday, with the pound worth $1.34, a 30-year low and a 11 percent loss just since Thursday. The Euro was also off against other world currencies, as investors began to doubt the viability of the whole European Union.

The major stock-markets in East Asia all lost significant value, and trading on Japan’s Nikkei Index was reined in automatically under its “circuit breaker” rule, when the market had lost 8 percent of its value.

But on Thursday, the atmosphere was lively across the country. Long lines were reported at many polling stations as many braved torrential downpours and threats of flooding in some areas. Early indications were that turnout topped 70 percent — the highest since the 1997 general election.

Campaign organizers and politicians carried their respective arguments down to the last minute. Prime Minister David Cameron crisscrossed the nation to plead for a vote to stay in the European Union and to “put jobs first, put the economy first.”

“It is a fact that our economy will be weaker if we leave and stronger if we stay,” he told one crowd in Birmingham.

Not all Britons agreed. “We have a strong export capability in Yorkshire from high-tech goods to services,” said Roger Tattersall, assistant director for Vote Leave in the Yorkshire and Humberside region.

“We want to be able to export anywhere in the world without the tariffs that are caused by our membership in the European Union,” Mr. Tattersall said.

Aside from the economic and financial effects of a British exit, U.S. analysts said, a vote to leave would have massive consequences for the European Union and could inspire other eurosceptic groups to follow suit.

“Brexit would inevitably set in motion centrifugal dynamics on the continent, empowering nationalists in countries that have no chance of being successful outside of the EU,” said Dalibor Rohac, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

Nine months after Britain voted to leave , Tim Barrow , Britain ’ s ambassador to the EU , hand-delivered a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk formally notifying the bloc that the U.K. will be the first member state ever to leave it .
“ This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back , ” Mrs. May said in Parliament , at times interrupted by hoots and heckling from opposition lawmakers . “ Britain is leaving the European Union . ”
In her letter , couched in a diplomatic tone , Mrs. May said she wanted an orderly and fair process that made sure Europe “ remains strong and prosperous. ” But she also offered what some read as a veiled warning , highlighting how the U.K. sees its military and security contributions as a vital card it can play in the coming talks to win better EU market access .
“ In security terms , a failure to reach an agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened , ” she wrote . “ In this kind of scenario , both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change , but it is not the outcome that either side should seek . ”
Britain , a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and strong component of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , is the continent ’ s foremost military power , alongside France . It is also a big player in intelligence gathering and counterterrorism .
That status gave Mrs. May ’ s reference to those issues particular resonance . Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny , speaking on the sidelines of a gathering of Europe ’ s center-right politicians in Malta , said everybody there was talking about the link she had apparently laid out between security and future trade ties .
“ The government will say it ’ s not a threat , but they ’ ve made a point , ” Mr. Kenny said .
Mrs. May said she would seek a broad trade and economic deal with the EU “ of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it , ” one that she said for the first time should include crucial sectors such as financial services and telecommunications .
The U.K. government is expected to publish details on Thursday of its plans to convert EU laws and regulations into U.K. law , a move officials say will pave the way for a smooth transition . Once the laws are transposed , politicians will decide how they want to adjust them .
“ Converting EU law into U.K. law , and ending the supremacy of lawmakers in Brussels , is an important step in giving businesses , workers and consumers the certainty they need , ” said David Davis , Brexit secretary .
The EU ’ s trade deal with the U.S. and its recently sealed accord with Canada address some financial service issues , but Mrs. May ’ s comments suggest the U.K. government is looking for a much more sweeping arrangement that could allow U.K.-based financial firms to continue to provide services to European customers .
European capitals are hoping to persuade U.K.-based financial service firms to shift jobs to the continent , even as officials acknowledge that EU businesses will continue to rely on financing from the City of London .
The triggering of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty , which governs EU law , opens a two-year window for Britain to negotiate the terms of its exit from the bloc , unraveling 44 years of ties .
Managing Britain ’ s exit will be a major measure of the Mrs. May ’ s leadership and diplomatic skills , as she has only a slim majority in Parliament . The negotiations will also test the unity of the remaining 27 nations of the EU , which have so far largely held together by sticking to their promise not to strike separate deals with London before talks begin .
Mr. Tusk , in Brussels , expressed regret about Britain ’ s decision to leave , saying of the coming talks that “ in essence , this is about damage control . ”
“ There is no reason to pretend that this is a happy day , neither in Brussels nor in London , ” he said . “ We already miss you . ”
The negotiations are expected to be tough . Early indications are that Britain and the EU are far apart . Mrs. May has said Britain would pursue a clean break from the EU , regaining control over immigration , leaving the jurisdiction of the bloc ’ s courts and exiting its common market .
British officials said they want to negotiate the best deal they can for trade with the EU . European leaders have said they don ’ t want to punish the U.K. for leaving , but won ’ t grant Britain a better deal outside the club than it had in it .
Mrs. May said she accepted warnings that Britain can ’ t choose what it would like to keep from the EU while dropping obligations it doesn ’ t want .
“ We understand that there will be consequences for the U.K. of leaving the EU , ” she said . “ We know that U.K. companies that trade with the EU will have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part , just as we do in other overseas markets . We accept that . ”
One of the first—and likely most contentious—issues in the negotiations is set to be how much the U.K. will have to pay to exit from the bloc .
Some U.K. officials have said the country shouldn ’ t have to pay anything after a referendum campaign in which the British contribution to the bloc was a significant pro-Brexit argument . EU officials say the bill , which would include payments for programs the U.K. committed to before it voted to leave , could be as high as €55 billion ( $ 54 billion ) to €60 billion .
In her letter Wednesday , Mrs. May hinted that the U.K. would be willing to make some payments . The two sides , she wrote , “ will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the U.K. ’ s rights and obligations as a departing member state , in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom ’ s continuing partnership with the EU . ”
Mrs. May told Mr. Tusk the U.K. wants talks on the future relationship to take place alongside negotiations over the terms of its exit . She said she hoped to complete them within two years , while acknowledging that was a challenging timetable .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said divorce negotiations have to be concluded before talks about future relations can begin . “ During the negotiations , we first have to clarify how to untie these links in an orderly way , ” she said on Wednesday . “ Only then—but hopefully soon—can we address questions about our future relations . ”
Mrs. May also said one of her priorities is to strike an early agreement on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and U.K. citizens living in other parts of Europe . The EU has said talks on that issue alone would likely take at least several months .
A country like Spain , which hosts a large community of elderly British expatriates , might look to limit the scope of future rights and benefits since it could end up resulting in a net cost for the government . By contrast , countries like Poland that have large numbers of citizens living in Britain would want a more expansive deal .
Opposition leaders accused Mrs. May of laying out plans that would damage the British economy , and what they said was inappropriately using security as a bargaining chip .
Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper said on Twitter that it was “ completely irresponsible to threaten , gamble or bargain on national security . This isn ’ t a threat to EU , it ’ s a dangerous act of self-harm . ”
Downing Street officials said Mrs. May ’ s statement about security wasn ’ t a threat to the EU .
Any Brexit deal will need the approval of a majority in the European Parliament . Top EU lawmakers laid out their red lines Wednesday , including a demand that Britain refrain from starting trade talks and that any transition deal after 2019 be limited to three years .","British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday began the U.K.’s path out of the European Union, highlighting her country’s security expertise as she started the clock on negotiations that will challenge ties between Britain and some of its closest allies.

The U.K.’s Overall Trade With the EU
