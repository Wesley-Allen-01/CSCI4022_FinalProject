The president didn ’ t lay out any broad new strategies for defeating the Islamic State , saying the U.S.-led coalition is intensifying its airstrikes against the militants in Syria and Iraq and stepping up military aid to local ground forces . He also called on Congress to approve new restrictions on guns that he said would make it harder for terrorists to get weapons in the U.S. , an action that Republican lawmakers have already rejected .
“ As commander in chief , I have no greater responsibility than the security of the American people , ” Mr. Obama said in a somber 13-minute address . “ The threat from terrorism is real , but we will overcome it . ”
Mr. Obama delivered the address four days after a radicalized Islamist husband-and-wife team wielding semiautomatic weapons killed 14 people in San Bernardino , California , and wounded 21 others . Investigators say the couple were inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group , and the attack has only fueled the debate over how best to fight radical Islamic terrorists and their supporters in the U.S .
Mr. Obama urged lawmakers to restrict ownership of semi-automatic firearms , saying , “ What we can do , and must do , is make it harder for them to kill . ”
But House Speaker Paul D. Ryan was one of a number of top Republicans who quickly panned Mr. Obama ’ s remarks , calling the president ’ s address “ so disappointing ” because it failed to offer anything new in the fight against the Islamic State .
“ No new plan , just a half-hearted attempt to defend and distract from a failing policy , ” Mr. Ryan said minutes after Mr. Obama finished speaking . “ The horrific events of recent weeks remind us that any hope to contain [ the Islamic State ] has been a failure . ”
The Wisconsin Republican added , “ Until we hear from the president what more can be done — with our military , our intelligence-gathering , and our international partners — we will remain one step behind our enemy . This is not just the next president ’ s problem . It is our problem , and we must confront it today . ”
Concerns about terrorism have been on the rise since the Islamic State ’ s coordinated attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 that killed 120 . The debate over national security has shifted the landscape in the 2016 presidential campaign , and Mr. Obama has struggled to convince Americans that he has an effective strategy for destroying the extremist group .
Polling shows voters have record low confidence in Mr. Obama ’ s ability to handle the problem , with about two-thirds saying he lacks an effective strategy for defeating the Islamic State in its home base in Iraq and Syria .
The president devoted a portion of his address to urging non-Muslims in the U.S. not to demonize all Muslims because of the acts of the Islamist terrorists . He said a divided America would help the Islamic State by fostering more “ home-grown ” terrorism and hurt efforts to defeat the militants ’ ideology .
“ We can not turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam , ” Mr. Obama said . “ ISIL does not speak for Islam . They are thugs and killers , part of a cult of death , and they account for a tiny fraction of more than a billion Muslims around the world — including millions of patriotic Muslim Americans who reject their hateful ideology . ”
He added , “ If we ’ re to succeed in defeating terrorism , we must enlist Muslim communities as some of our strongest allies , rather than push them away through suspicion and hate , ” Mr. Obama said .
The president did adopt a more direct tone by calling on Muslims both here and abroad to more forcefully to reject extremist ideology . He said refraining from discrimination against Muslims “ does not mean denying the fact that an extremist ideology has spread within some Muslim communities . ”
“ There ’ s a real problem that Muslims must confront without excuse , ” Mr. Obama said . “ Muslim leaders here and around the globe have to continue working with us to decisively and unequivocally reject the hateful ideology that groups like [ the Islamic State ] and al Qaeda promote . ”
Without mentioning them by name , the president criticized Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump for appearing to endorse a proposal to register Muslim Americans and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for backing a proposal to prevent Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. because of fears terrorists can infiltrate their ranks .
Mr. Trump responded to the president ’ s address on Twitter , saying , “ Is that all there is ? We need a new President - FAST ! ”
Mr. Trump also commented , “ Well , Obama refused to say ( he just can ’ t say it ) , that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS . ”
Underscoring the heightened importance of the event , it was only the third Oval Office address of Mr. Obama ’ s presidency , with the last coming five years ago at the end of the Iraq War . The other address concerned the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The president took several swipes at the Republican-controlled Congress and at GOP presidential candidates , saying that lawmakers should vote on a new authorization of military force against the Islamic State and gun control measures .
“ For over a year , I have ordered our military to take thousands of airstrikes against ISIL targets , ” Mr. Obama said . “ I think it ’ s time for Congress to vote to demonstrate that the American people are united and committed to this fight . ”
But the White House acknowledged the president erred in his address by saying he had ordered a review of “ the visa waiver program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country. ” The female terrorist , Tashfeen Malik , a native of Pakistan , came to the U.S. on a so-called “ fiancee ” or K-1 visa , not under the waiver program that applies mainly to European countries .
Mr. Obama said authorities must work more closely with high-tech companies to stop digital technology that allows militants to plot attacks undetected on social media .
A week after the Paris attacks , Mr. Obama began urging Americans not to “ succumb to fear ” and to “ settle down ” about his plan to accept 10,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq in 2016 . A veto-proof bipartisan majority in the House has voted to delay the program until security concerns are addressed , although the Senate hasn ’ t acted on the measure .
Senate Republicans blocked an amendment last week that would have banned people on the “ no-fly ” list from purchasing guns .
Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican and a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination , said Sunday that people on the no-fly list should still be able to purchase guns because the list is full of “ everyday Americans ” who are on it by accident .
“ The majority of the people on the no-fly list are often times people that just basically have the same name as somebody else , who doesn ’ t belong on the no-fly list , ” Mr. Rubio said on CNN ’ s State of the Union . “ Former Senator Ted Kennedy once said he was on a no-fly list . There are journalists on the no-fly list . ”
Another Republican presidential candidate , former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee , said the White House is using gun control as a “ false argument … to dodge the real issue ” of Islamic jihadism .
Mr. Obama reiterated his opposition to deploying U.S. ground troops in Syria or Iraq to fight the extremists .
“ We should not be drawn once more into a long and costly ground war in Iraq or Syria , ” he said . “ That ’ s what groups like ISIL want . They know they can ’ t defeat us on the battlefield . ISIL fighters were part of the insurgency that we faced in Iraq . But they also know that if we occupy foreign lands , they can maintain insurgencies for years , killing thousands of our troops , draining our resources , and using our presence to draw new recruits . ”","President Obama tried to reassure Americans on Sunday night that he has the right plan to defeat the Islamic State, using a rare prime-time Oval Office address to urge the public not to take revenge on Muslim Americans in the wake of the deadliest terrorist attack in the U.S. since 2001.

For months , administration officials have claimed no special operations forces were dispatched from outside Libya to Benghazi during the Sept. 11 , 2012 , al Qaeda terrorist attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission and CIA annex because none was within range .
The Pentagon , under intense public criticism for not coming to the aid of besieged Americans , published an official timeline in November that carefully danced around the issue .
It said time and distance prevented any commandos outside Libya from reaching a CIA compound under attack . The timeline disclosed that a reinforcement flight 400 miles away in Tripoli contained two “ DoD personnel ” but did not describe who they were . Later , the official State Department report on Benghazi said they were “ two U.S. military personnel ” — but provided no other details . It made no mention of special operations forces .
But sources directly familiar with the attack tell The ███ that a unit of eight special operators — mostly Delta Force and Green Beret members — were in Tripoli the night of the attack , on a counterterrorism mission that involved capturing weapons and wanted terrorists from the streets and helping train Libyan forces .
When word of the Benghazi attack surfaced , two members of that military unit volunteered to be dispatched along with five private security contractors on a hastily arranged flight from Tripoli to rescue Americans in danger , the sources said , speaking only on the condition of anonymity because the special operations forces ’ existence inside Libya was secret .
The two special operations forces arrived in time to engage in the final , ferocious firefight between the terrorists and Americans holed up in the CIA annex near the ill-fated diplomatic mission in Benghazi , the sources added .

Masked from public view, two of the U.S. military’s elite special operations commandos have been awarded medals for bravery for a mission that further undercuts the Obama administration’s original story about the Benghazi tragedy.

For months, administration officials have claimed no special operations forces were dispatched from outside Libya to Benghazi during the Sept. 11, 2012, al Qaeda terrorist attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission and CIA annex because none was within range.

But sources directly familiar with the attack tell The Washington Times that a unit of eight special operators — mostly Delta Force and Green Beret members — were in Tripoli the night of the attack, on a counterterrorism mission that involved capturing weapons and wanted terrorists from the streets and helping train Libyan forces.

The Washington Times confirmed the information last week and learned that they were part of the small reinforcement flight from Tripoli. They were awarded medals for valor. The CIA also has bestowed medals to its employees who defended the mission and annex.

The charter flight proved ill-fated. After terrorists stormed the U.S. mission in Benghazi at 9:45 p.m. local time, killing Stevens and communications aide Sean Smith, surviving diplomats and State Department security personnel made a mad dash. In armored vehicles, they arrived just after midnight at the annex commanded by a retired Army officer turned CIA operative. A rescue team from the annex also brought back survivors from the mission.

The Hicks-ordered flight arrived in Benghazi in time to help at 1:15 a.m. — but they could not get various Libyan militias to provide transportation to the annex.

The annex inhabitants had plenty of weapons to hold off a direct assault, like the one that breached and burned the U.S. mission. Huddled there was a mix of CIA officers and security personnel, such as former SEAL Tyrone Woods, and employees of Britain’s Blue Mountain personal security team.

The Tripoli team finally arrived at about 5 a.m. Sept. 12. Exactly what the two Delta soldiers did is not contained in any public account. But it is known that ex-SEAL Glen Doherty, who was on the flight, joined Woods on the roof to man machine guns. Within minutes, five mortar rounds hit on or near the annex. Three hit the roof, killing both former SEALs and badly wounding State Department security officer David Ubben.

The State Department’s official account said men went to the roof and carried the dead and wounded defenders below.

A source said annex defenders killed at least 20 terrorists during an on-and-off firefight that lasted nearly eight hours. The terrorists who planned the mission attack also knew of the annex and were able to place mortars within striking range.

The National Defense Panel called on the president to dump a major section of his 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review ( QDR ) and write a broader strategy that requires the military to fight on multiple fronts at once .
It also said the shrinking U.S. armed forces , which are being downsized to fit that strategy and budget cuts , is a “ serious strategic misstep on the part of the United States. ” The forces ’ numbers spelled out in Mr. Obama ’ s QDR are “ inadequate given the future strategic and operational environment . ”
The warning comes as Mr. Obama is under criticism from many Republicans and some Democrats for his standoff policy toward Syria and his limited response to a June offensive by an al Qaeda offshoot that has gobbled up swaths of territory in Iraq .
Congress authorized the panel of outside experts to review the QDR , a strategy for shaping the active and reserve force . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel appointed the co-chairmen : former Defense Secretary William Perry , who served under President Bill Clinton , and retired Army Gen. John Abizaid , who ran U.S. Central Command during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq .
The panel ’ s report said the past several years of budget cuts and mandated reduction in personnel and weapons have stirred deep unease among allies who would count on the U.S. in a crisis .
“ Not only have they caused significant investment shortfalls in U.S. military readiness and both present and future capabilities , they have prompted our current and potential allies and adversaries to question our commitment and resolve , ” the report said . “ Unless reversed , these shortfalls will lead to a high-risk force in the near future . That in turn will lead to an America that is not only less secure but also far less prosperous . In this sense , these cuts are ultimately self-defeating . ”
It calls the defense cuts “ dangerous ” as “ global threats and challenges are rising. ” The experts point to China ’ s and Russia ’ s new territorial claims , nuclear proliferation by Iran and North Korea and al Qaeda ’ s rapid rise in Iraq .
The panel knocks Mr. Obama ’ s QDR for reducing the military ’ s global mission from being able to defeat two enemies nearly simultaneously to defeating one and denying the objectives of a second . The report calls on Mr. Obama to expand this overriding mission statement .
“ The international security environment has deteriorated since then , ” the report said of the QDR , which was released earlier this year . “ In the current threat environment , America could plausibly be called upon to deter or fight in any number of regions in overlapping time frames . ”
Rep. Howard P. “ Buck ” McKeon , California Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , said the independent review shows the QDR was more concerned with justifying budget cuts than meeting global security needs .
“ It is the same conclusion many Americans have already reached , ” Mr. McKeon said . “ There is a cost when America does not lead , and there are consequences when America disengages . What the president fails to understand — which the report points out — is that a strong military underwrites all other tools our nation has for global influence . ”
On the two-war requirement , the panel said : “ We find the logic of the two-war construct to be as powerful as ever and note that the force sizing construct in the 2014 QDR strives to stay within the two-war tradition while using different language . But given the worsening threat environment , we believe a more expansive force sizing construct — one that is different from the two-war construct but no less strong — is appropriate . ”
It proposes a new overriding strategy requirement that talks of taking on and stopping adversaries in multiple theaters of war .
The experts said both the Navy and the Air Force are too small .
“ The Air Force now fields the smallest and oldest force of combat aircraft in its history yet needs a global surveillance and strike force able to rapidly deploy to theaters of operation to deter , defeat or punish multiple aggressors simultaneously , ” the review group said .
Cuts in the numbers of Army soldiers “ go too far , ” the panel said .

For the last several years, though, whenever I've been in Ohio I have noticed the highway signs with the unfamiliar names.

Bob Greene

Last week I got in touch with the Ohio Department of Transportation to ask about them.

The answer makes you want to pause humbly.

On August 31, 2009, Marine Lance Cpl. David R. Hall, of Elyria, Ohio, was killed in an explosion while serving in Garmsir, Afghanistan. He was 31; he worked at a Ford assembly plant back home before joining the Marines.

In most cases of fallen service members, there is a solemn funeral ceremony when their remains are returned home, and a respectful obituary in the local newspaper. It can feel all too fleeting.

But in Ohio, in recent years, there has been an effort to do more.

Which is why the Ohio General Assembly authorized that a stretch of State Route 2 in Lorain County -- David Hall's home county -- be named, now and forever, to honor him.

""After the General Assembly votes to name a portion of a highway, we manufacture the signs and put them up at the designated places,"" said Steve Faulkner, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation. He said that two signs are usually erected, each facing a different direction, so that people in cars on either side of the highway will see the honoree's name.

Always, the memorial signs are placed in the service member's hometown or home county, so that friends and family members are reminded every day that the state and its citizens want to remember and salute him or her.

Thus, Army Master Sgt. Shawn T. Hannon's portion of Interstate 71 runs through Grove City, Ohio. That is where he lived; he was 44 when, on April 4, 2012, he died of wounds caused by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. He was a long way from home, but back in Grove City now his old neighbors and buddies see his name and think of him each time they pull onto that part of the interstate.

In the United States, there has grown to be a mercenary ritual around so-called naming rights. If there's a Major League Baseball park, an NBA or NHL arena, or an NFL stadium, corporations line up to bid for the opportunity to plaster their names on it. Airlines, financial services companies, big merchandisers -- all they have to do to get their names on the signs is come up with tens of millions of dollars.

But the people with their names on the signs by the sides of Ohio's highways have paid a much, much higher price, for much less selfish reasons. And they are so deserving of the honor, which can't begin to repay the sacrifice they made.

The most poignant thing about the placement of the signs is that almost invariably they are next to spans of road upon which the service members, when they were younger, drove their own cars: on the way to movies, on the way to dances, on the way to grab late-night burgers with their best hometown friends. Back then, they never could have imagined that the roads would before long bear their names, or why.

But, while most of the rest of us during this last decade enjoyed life, or complained about it, inside America's borders, they crossed the oceans because their country said that it mattered. They didn't argue the politics of it. They answered the call.

Thus, on this Memorial Day weekend, there is a bit of highway near Canton, Ohio, set aside for U.S. Marine Pvt. Heath D.

Reporter Robert Vitale of the Columbus Dispatch calculated that, as of last year, more than 70 Ohioans killed in the line of duty during the past decade had received the honor.

Almost certainly there will be more; almost certainly the last highway sign has not been erected.

But summer will be here soon. In Ohio, that is the time when long, leisurely drives along wide roads and narrow strips of blacktop can feel the most enticing. The sun is high in the sky; the nights are warm and lit by impossibly white stars.

For those who left home never to return, those who once knew these highways by heart, the roads are now eternally theirs.",www.cnn.com,left,cX1evRhvz1AhUItO

But afterwards , America knows just about as much what he 's doing and what 's going on as it did before he scrambled Sunday 's prime time schedule with the ultimate presidential prop .
From the spot where George W. Bush spoke the night of Sept. 11 , Richard Nixon resigned and John F. Kennedy talked civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis ( all seated , behind where he stood ) , Obama looked firmly into the camera and gave America a not-so-peppy pep talk .
His strategy in Syria : working , air strikes and coalition expansion underway .
Law enforcement officials : on the case , sharing intelligence and tracking people down .
People had to look somewhere else for how he 's going to step up the mission against ISIL , his positions on several related pieces of legislation in Congress or how exactly he thinks that a 13-minute summoning of political theater is going to turn around two-and-a-half weeks of dismissing much of the response since the Paris attacks as overreaction and Republican fear-mongering .
“ Is that all there is ? We need a new President - FAST ! ” Republican frontrunner Donald Trump tweeted as Obama finished .
Though perhaps no response said more than Hillary Clinton ’ s , who didn ’ t issue any , by Twitter or press release , pro forma or detailed , leaving her comments to the anti-terrorism speech she delivered Sunday in Washington hours before Obama walked into the Oval Office .
Republican presidential candidates , led by Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , used their weekend events and TV interviews to go into bloodthirsty overdrive : “ carpet bomb them into oblivion , ” Cruz said in Iowa on Saturday . Go after their families , Trump said Sunday morning in an interview on “ Face the Nation ” on CBS .
`` What ’ s too far ? What ’ s too far ? '' Trump said . `` They are killing people . ''

But afterwards, America knows just about as much what he's doing and what's going on as it did before he scrambled Sunday's prime time schedule with the ultimate presidential prop.

Story Continued Below

From the spot where George W. Bush spoke the night of Sept. 11, Richard Nixon resigned and John F. Kennedy talked civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis (all seated, behind where he stood), Obama looked firmly into the camera and gave America a not-so-peppy pep talk.

His strategy in Syria: working, air strikes and coalition expansion underway.

Law enforcement officials: on the case, sharing intelligence and tracking people down.

Americans: full of resolve.

Scapegoating Muslims: bad.

People had to look somewhere else for how he's going to step up the mission against ISIL, his positions on several related pieces of legislation in Congress or how exactly he thinks that a 13-minute summoning of political theater is going to turn around two-and-a-half weeks of dismissing much of the response since the Paris attacks as overreaction and Republican fear-mongering.

“Is that all there is? We need a new President - FAST!” Republican frontrunner Donald Trump tweeted as Obama finished.

Though perhaps no response said more than Hillary Clinton’s, who didn’t issue any, by Twitter or press release, pro forma or detailed, leaving her comments to the anti-terrorism speech she delivered Sunday in Washington hours before Obama walked into the Oval Office.

Republican presidential candidates, led by Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, used their weekend events and TV interviews to go into bloodthirsty overdrive: “carpet bomb them into oblivion,” Cruz said in Iowa on Saturday. Go after their families, Trump said Sunday morning in an interview on “Face the Nation” on CBS.

""What’s too far? What’s too far?"" Trump said. ""They are killing people.""

“Destroy the caliphate,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday morning on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

By contrast, Obama tried to go bloodless, waiting as at other crucial moments of his presidency for comments like that to set the tone—a new CNN/ORC poll shows people disapproving of Obama’s handling of ISIL 64-33 percent and his handling of terrorism 60-34 percent—then built up a high-profile speech to respond, and said close to nothing.

Meanwhile, a sense of panic has set in that’s less like last year’s sci-fi horror movie cable news frenzy over Ebola, more like a frightening new reality where everyone everywhere feels like they could be mowed down or blown up by someone shouting Allahu Akbar. A measure of how far things have tilted: that same CNN/ORC poll shows that 53 percent of people say they now want to send new ground troops in to fight ISIL.

Obama's cool, calm ""I got this"" air helped get him elected in 2008. Seven years later, it’s clear that many Americans don’t want reassurance, but want him to convey the sense of urgency that they’re feeling. Aides were hoping that he’d be able to.

Giving the speech from the Oval Office “conveys the seriousness with which we are taking the issue,” a senior administration official said Sunday afternoon, ahead of Obama’s remarks. Americans would see Obama in “a familiar and appropriate venue,” the official said, “from the place where he makes his decisions.”

But he didn’t announce any of those decisions on Sunday. And the four minutes he spent during the Oval Office address explaining what he thinks Americans should do were shorter on details and passion than the four minutes he spent saying what he thinks Americans shouldn’t do.

“We cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam,” Obama said. “That, too, is what groups like ISIL want.”

The irony is that, rhetoric aside, while Americans say they seriously disapprove of Obama’s performance on terrorism, few Republicans or Democrats have proposed anything substantively different from what Obama's doing in Syria.

That’s not all: he’s been waiting since February for Congress to move on his updated Authorization of Military Force that he called for again Sunday. He acknowledged again on Sunday the uncomfortable truth that no solution or strategy can account for every angry or crazed person willing to die who connects with murderous ideology on the Internet or directly in their lives.

And the new CNN/ORC poll aside, no one really argues Obama's right both that Americans don’t really want another war in the Middle East—and that ISIL does.

“We should not be drawn once more into a long and costly ground war in Iraq or Syria,” Obama said. ISIL knows “that if we occupy foreign lands, they can maintain insurgencies for years, killing thousands of our troops and draining our resources, and using our presence to draw new recruits.”

All of what underlies Obama's speech Sunday night may be true. So is his failure to move the country without finding stronger language or more palpable results.

Obama pressed those points himself Sunday night, insisting that the kind of attack him through press release mentality (“tough talk, or abandoning our values or giving into fear”) certainly doesn’t help, and probably hurts.

“That's what groups like ISIL are hoping for,” he said.

Obama received some back-up for that.

“Those who instantly criticize any strategy have an obligation to tell you their strategy (and the costs, duration, risks),” tweeted Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.).

If Obama’s goal was to reassure people, he doesn’t seem to have managed that. If his goal was to raise the worries out of the political debate, he fell short there too. If he was looking to appeal to deeper thinking than comes out of most elected officials, that also didn’t happen.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The U.S. and Iran stepped back from the brink of possible war on Wednesday as President Donald Trump signaled he would not retaliate militarily for Iran ’ s missile strikes on Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops . No one was harmed in the strikes , but U.S. forces in the region remained on high alert .
Speaking from the White House , Trump seemed intent on deescalating the crisis , which spiraled after he authorized the targeted killing last week of Iran ’ s top general , Qassem Soleimani . Iran responded overnight with its most direct assault on America since the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran , firing more than a dozen missiles at two installations in Iraq . The Pentagon said Wednesday that it believed Iran fired with the intent to kill .
Even so , Trump ’ s takeaway was that “ Iran appears to be standing down , which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world . ”
Despite such conciliatory talk , the region remained on edge , and American troops including a quick-reaction force dispatched over the weekend , were on high alert . Last week Iranian-backed militia besieged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad , and Tehran ’ s proxies in the region remain able to carry out attacks such as the one on Dec. 27 that killed a U.S. contractor and set off the most recent round of hostilities .
Hours after Trump spoke , an ‘ incoming ’ siren went off in Baghdad ’ s Green Zone after what seemed to be small rockets “ impacted ” the diplomatic area , a Western official said . There were no reports of casualties .
Gen. Mark Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , warned that it was “ perhaps too early to tell ” if Iran will be satisfied that the missile strikes were sufficient to avenge the Soleimani killing .
“ We should have some expectation , ” Defense Secretary Mark Esper added in a Wednesday briefing , “ that Shiite militia groups , either directed or not directed by Iran , will continue in some way , shape or form to try and undermine our presence there , ” either politically or militarily .
There is no obvious path to diplomatic engagement , as Trump pledged to add to his “ maximum pressure ” campaign of economic sanctions . He said the new , unspecified sanctions would remain in place “ until Iran changes its behavior . ”
Iran ’ s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the overnight strike was not necessarily the totality of Iran ’ s response .
“ Last night they received a slap , ” Khamenei said . “ These military actions are not sufficient ( for revenge ) . What is important is that the corrupt presence of America in this region comes to an end . ”
Trump , facing perhaps the biggest test of his presidency , credited the minimized damage to an early warning system “ that worked very well ” and said Americans should be “ extremely grateful and happy ” with the outcome .
The strikes had pushed Tehran and Washington perilously close to all-out conflict and left the world waiting to see whether the American president would respond with more military force . Trump , in his nine-minute , televised address , spoke of a robust U.S. military with missiles that are “ big , powerful , accurate , lethal and fast. ” But then he added : “ We do not want to use it . ”
Iran for days had been promising to respond forcefully to Soleimani ’ s killing , but its limited strike on two bases — one in the northern Iraqi city in Irbil and the other at Ain al-Asad in western Iraq — appeared to signal that it , too , was uninterested in a wider clash with the U.S. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that the country had “ concluded proportionate measures in self-defense . ”
Trump , who is facing reelection in November , campaigned for president on a promise to extract the United States from “ endless wars . ”
On Wednesday , he said the United States was “ ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. ” That marked a sharp change in tone from his warning a day earlier that “ if Iran does anything that they shouldn ’ t be doing , they ’ re going to be suffering the consequences , and very strongly . ”
Members of Congress were briefed on the Iran situation Wednesday afternoon in closed-door sessions on Capitol Hill , where Democrats and some Republicans expressed dissatisfaction with the administration ’ s justifications for the drone strike on Soleimani .
Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said it was “ probably the worst briefing I ’ ve seen , at least on a military issue , in the nine years I ’ ve served in the United States Senate. ” He said it was “ distressing ” that officials suggested it would only embolden Iran if lawmakers debated the merits of further military action . He and Sen. Rand Paul announced their support of a largely symbolic war powers resolution to limit Trump ’ s military action regarding Iran .
Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced after the briefing that the House would vote Thursday on a war powers resolution of its own .
Trump opened his remarks at the White House by reiterating his promise that “ Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. ” Iran had announced in the wake of Soleimani ’ s killing that it would no longer comply with any of the limits on uranium enrichment in the 2015 nuclear deal crafted to keep it from building a nuclear device .
The president , who had earlier pulled the U.S. out of the deal , seized on the moment of calm to call for negotiations toward a new agreement that would do more to limit Iran ’ s ballistic missile programs and constrain regional proxy campaigns like those led by Soleimani .
Trump also announced he would ask NATO to become “ much more involved in the Middle East process. ” While he has frequently criticized NATO as obsolete and has encouraged participants to increase their military spending , Trump has tried to push the military alliance to refocus its efforts on modern threats .
Like the U.S. troops in the region , NATO forces have temporarily halted their training of Iraqi forces and their work to combat the Islamic State .

A senior U.S. official told Fox News that an MQ9 Reaper drone was fired on by the Iranians on Thursday shortly after it arrived at the scene where the MV Altair tanker sent out a distress signal amid the attacks the U.S. says were perpetrated by Iran.

The official said the first distress call from the MV Altair tanker, a Marshall Islands-flagged but Norwegian-owned crude oil tanker, went out at 6:12am local time. The unmanned MQ9 Reaper drone arrived 8 minutes later.

Then at 6:45am local time, a missile was fired at the drone, but missed. The U.S. military said that it was a modified SA-7 fired from Iran’s mainland. It was fired on after the drone arrived on station to assist the Norwegian tanker.

Officials also told Fox News that a U.S. MQ9 drone was shot down in Yemen by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in recent days.

The news comes amid tensions in the region following the attack on oil tankers that put the U.S. and Iran on the brink of a direct conflict.

EUROPEANS SKEPTICAL OF TRUMP'S CLAIM THAT IRAN TO BLAME IN TANKER ATTACK

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran for the ""blatant assault"" on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman earlier Thursday.

In a news conference, Pompeo said: “This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.”

He charged that Iran was working to disrupt the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz and this is a deliberate part of a campaign to escalate tension, adding that the U.S. would defend its forces and interests in the region, although he did not elaborate.

President Trump, meanwhile, told “Fox and Friends” Friday morning that the attack had “Iran written all over it.’

“Iran did do it and you know they did it because you saw the boat,” he said, before pointing to the video showing the Iranians removing the unexploded mine. “They're a nation of terror and they've changed a lot since I've been president, I can tell you,” he added.

U.S. officials released a video Friday supposedly showing Iran’s Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded limpet mine from one of the vessels.

The black-and-white footage, as well as still photos released by the U.S. military’s Central Command on Friday, appeared to show the limpet mine on the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, before a Revolutionary Guard patrol boat pulled alongside the ship and removed the mine, Central Command spokesman Capt. Bill Urban said.

Both sides are jockeying for leverage ahead of a possible constitutional showdown that could have a major impact on the legacy of a president nearing his final year in office.

The White House has suggested all options are on the table — leading the president’s GOP critics to believe Obama could be gearing up to use his authority as commander in chief to shutter the prison if lawmakers refuse to go along with a plan due out as soon as this week for clearing out the remaining 112 detainees.

It appears to be to the White House’s advantage to leave that possibility open. The prospect of Obama going around Congress could goad reluctant lawmakers into working with the president to come up with a legislative compromise for shuttering the military prison and transferring the inmates to the U.S. mainland.

But congressional Republicans are making clear they’re prepared to do whatever it takes to ensure the president defers to them on a divisive issue that raises big questions about the constitutional separation of powers.

“Rumors are that he will act again in an unconstitutional manner,” said McCain (R-Ariz.), a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who’s long stressed the need to close Guantanamo but wants the president to work with Congress to do so. “I think it’s unconstitutional. I think we’d have to go to court.”

The dispute comes as the Pentagon prepares to release a report outlining options for closing Guantanamo, which was established by President George W. Bush in early 2002 as U.S. forces began capturing suspected Al Qaeda operatives and leaders of the Taliban movement.

Many of the remaining detainees are slated to be sent to other countries, and some are facing military prosecutions. The big question, though, is what to do with the dozens of detainees the administration deems too dangerous to release — but lacks the evidence or will to prosecute.

The report is expected to lay out options for moving those detainees to federal or military prisons in the United States — an approach that would result in the closing of Guantanamo but wouldn’t end the indefinite detention that’s been decried by human-rights groups as extralegal and an affront to American values.

Think again.,2016-05-20,Suzanne Maloney,"Are the wheels coming off the Iran deal ? Less than a year after Iran , America , and five other world powers inked a comprehensive nuclear accord , a debate over its terms has erupted anew .
In Washington , the braggadocio of a prominent White House aide is fueling Republican accusations that President Obama deliberately deceived the Congress and the country about Iran and the deal . And in Tehran , frustration over the residual impact of American sanctions has prompted increasingly resentful accusations from Iranian leaders that the United States has failed to live up to its end of the bargain . As a result , some are fretting that the deal is “ at risk ” and are laying blame on the White House doorstep .
Both claims are spurious , and deserve a more forceful rebuttal from the Obama administration . In the end , however , the ruckus over recent comments by Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes is largely an inside-the-Beltway drama—one that provides endless entertainment for Washington insiders but has little real significance for deal or American diplomacy .
By contrast , Iran ’ s dissatisfaction presents a serious diplomatic dilemma for Washington . But it should not be interpreted as evidence that the deal is “ unraveling. ” Rather , the chorus of complaints from Tehran demonstrates the accord signed in July 2015 is working exactly as it was intended—forestalling Iranian nuclear ambitions while amplifying the incentives for further reintegration into the global economy .
Obama ’ s handling of this first real test of the nuclear agreement will be crucial for sustaining its credibility . For the sake of the deal , and for any prospect of a durable Thermidor for the revolutionary state , Washington should resist the temptation to assuage Iran ’ s post-deal growing pains . If Iranians wants wholesale economic rehabilitation , their leadership needs to embrace the kind of policies that would yield that—in other words , meaningful political , economic , and foreign policy reform .
Not surprisingly , Iranian officials are seeking a quicker fix , and they have mounted an intense campaign to wrest supplementary sanctions relief from Washington . Their principal argument is that the theocracy has been stiffed . On an April visit to Washington , Valiollah Seif , the head of Iran ’ s Central Bank , questioned the benefits of the nuclear agreement , insisting that Tehran has received “ almost nothing ” of the sanctions relief that was promised as part of the deal , formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ) . Mohammad Javad Zarif , the country ’ s smooth-spoken foreign minister , has contended that “ the United States needs to do way more , ” warning that “ if one side does not comply with the agreement then the agreement will start to falter . ”
And Iran ’ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , charged recently that “ the Americans are engaged in obstruction and deception , adding : “ on paper , the Americans say banks can trade with Iran but in practice they act in such an Iranophobic way that no trade can take place with Iran . ”
Adding fuel to the fire are changes to U.S. visa policies that are perceived at constraining Iran ’ s economic rebound , deliberately inflammatory rhetoric from the U.S. Congress , and a recent Supreme Court verdict that paves the way for a $ 2 billion payout to victims of terrorist attacks attributed to Tehran or its proxies . Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has described the decision as “ flagrant theft ” and evidence of enduring American hostility toward Tehran .
Tehran ’ s narrative plays equally well to its essential constituencies : the revolution ’ s power brokers , steeped in official narratives of American treachery ; an Iranian citizenry impatient for its long overdue peace dividend ; and a European business community anxious to reclaim its piece of the pie after an unwelcome five years of having to forgo a lucrative market .
And it wouldn ’ t be the first time Tehran got cold feet about its nuclear obligations out of an unfortunate sense of that the payoff was insufficient . In 2005 , two years after a deal with Britain , France , and Germany to suspend core aspects of its nuclear program , Iran ’ s leadership soured on that deal and reneged . Anxiety about a repeat performance is prompting new U.S. efforts to facilitate business in Iran and a mounting debate in the press and on Capitol Hill around additional American sanctions relief .
But Iran ’ s campaign is grounded in a fundamental falsehood : that Washington has failed to live up to its end of the bargain . In fact , Washington has delivered fully on the sanctions relief pledged under the JCPOA , and officials in the White House , State Department , and even the enforcement office of the Treasury Department have engaged in extraordinary outreach to clarify remaining restrictions and underscore American commitment to the terms of the deal .
[ T ] he rewards of Iran ’ s nuclear concessions are actually widely evident .
Moreover , the rewards of Iran ’ s nuclear concessions are actually widely evident—in the volume of new trade and investment that is already underway ; in the scope and velocity of diplomatic and commercial reengagement with Iran ; in the swifter-than-anticipated revival of oil exports . Heads of state from Italy and India , from South Korea to South Africa are beating a path to Tehran , accompanied by contingents of eager investors . Meanwhile , Iranian officials including Seif—chief of the same Central Bank that was formerly barred by sanctions—headline swanky conferences aimed at wooing European business players . The great Iranian gold rush is on .
The catch is that the money is moving more slowly than Iranian officials seem to have anticipated—and the trickle-down effect has been almost nonexistent for the average Iranian . The explanation for this lag is complex and multi-dimensional .
First and foremost , Iran is hard hit by the decline in oil prices , which have fallen by roughly 60 percent since the interim nuclear deal was signed in November 2013 . Even in the best of times , the Islamic Republic was never a particularly easy place to do business , and many of its structural economic problems have been exacerbated by a decade of sanctions and the particularly egregious mismanagement of the 2005 to 2013 tenure of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Iran ’ s designation since 2008 as a “ high-risk and non-cooperative ” jurisdiction by Financial Action Task Force , a multilateral body established to combat money laundering and terrorist finance , poses additional hurdles for banks . In addition , a host of other market distortions induce investor caution : corruption , a bloated and opaque banking system , an inflexible labor market , unattractive contract terms for energy investments , the traditional dominance of the public sector .
Tehran ’ s challenges in luring capital is further complicated by its reputation for provocative domestic and regional behavior . Torching embassies , arresting tourists and dual-national businessmen , testing ballistic missiles—none of this provides a conducive context for Iran ’ s reintegration into the global economy . As the old adage goes , capital is a coward , and the Islamic Republic is a haunted house .
[ C ] apital is a coward , and the Islamic Republic is a haunted house .
Iran has seen this all before . Similar factors undercut Tehran ’ s previous efforts to open up to the global economy . In the early 1990s , after the long war with Iraq , then-President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani sought foreign trade and investment as part of his massive reconstruction program . Initial outcomes were encouraging , but falling oil prices , excessive short-term debt , and the perpetuation of an ideological foreign policy drove away investors and undermined his economic reforms .
This time around , American sanctions have cast a long shadow . The nuclear deal left intact an array of restrictions : the primary U.S. embargo on Iran as well as financial measures that preclude access to the U.S. dollar and penalize third countries for doing business with Iranian individuals and entities that are involved with terrorism or other malfeasance . The vestiges of the sanctions regime create truly epic compliance issues for any international investor . And the hangover effect of a decade of stringent ( and costly ) enforcement has generated a culture of overcompliance in the international financial sector , since institutional due diligence is an integral dimension of the industry ’ s viability .
The vestiges of the sanctions regime create truly epic compliance issues for any international investor .
None of this should come as a surprise to Tehran ; American officials were crystal clear throughout the negotiations and in advocating on behalf of the deal that the deal only removed the nuclear-related sanctions and that U.S. measures imposed as a result of Iran ’ s support for terrorism , its human rights abuses , or other issues would remain intact . And every sensible analyst looked past the inflated rhetoric of the deal ’ s opponents , who brayed against the deal as a massive “ cash bonanza , ” to recognize that the residual sanctions regime would remain a significant factor in Iran ’ s post-deal economic picture . As I wrote at the time :
“ What remains [ of the sanctions regime ] is not insubstantial . The U.S. Treasury Department remains the long pole in the international sanctions architecture , and even residual American measures will pose a powerful deterrent against business in Iran . Iran ’ s worst actors will remain sanctioned by the United States—tainting , by extension , any foreign company that does business with them after the deal . For American firms and individuals , the embargo on U.S. trade and investment in Iran criminalizes even the most tangential involvement in the Iranian economy outside the specific sectors exempted under the deal . ”
“ Congressional opposition to sanctions termination means that the Obama administration will have to rely on waivers and other inherently temporary mechanisms for reversing existing measures ; that alone entails sufficient uncertainty to give major investors around the world significant qualms about committing to the kind of multi-year , multi-billion dollar projects that Iran ’ s energy sector requires . ”
So if this was entirely predictable , why is Tehran crying foul now ? Unlike in the United States—where the agreement ’ s shortcomings were oversold ( if anything ) rather than downplayed—in Iran there was a triumphalism with which the deal was sold domestically . This was mostly because of the peculiarities of Iran ’ s political system . To avoid the appearance of contravening the “ red lines ” articulated by Khamenei , the country ’ s ultimate authority , Iranian negotiators depicted the JCPOA as delivering wholesale sanctions relief . Rouhani described the outcome as a “ legal , technical , and political victory ” for the country , emphasizing that Tehran achieved “ more than what was imagined . ”
Iran ’ s politically motivated embellishments were exacerbated by the hype surrounding the deal , cultivated by entrepreneurs and aspiring middlemen who presented Iran in hyperbolic terms as “ the best emerging market for years to come ” and “ one of the hottest opportunities of the decade. ” But while it may offend the Iranian ego , the relative scale of the opportunity in Iran is more modest than other much-heralded economic openings , such as China . It is hardly inconceivable that many banks and other firms have simply chosen to sit this first round out .
Neither Iran ’ s economic challenges nor the grievances of its leadership are “ fraying ” the nuclear accord ; in fact , they only highlight its underlying logic . While the deal ’ s scope was finite—it was not a wholesale rapprochement or rehabilitation—many of its supporters argued that its logic would prove self-reinforcing . Iran ’ s gradual reintegration into the global economy would bolster the case among its leadership for a broader moderation of its domestic and foreign policies precisely in order to boost their benefits .
Tehran ’ s dissatisfaction with the payout to date suggests this formula is working . A little bit of sanctions relief has whetted the entrepreneurial appetites of the clerical state . Despite official invocations proclaiming a “ resistance economy , ” the trickle of new trade and investment from Europe and Asia into Iran since the deal was signed has only intensified pressure for more—and for more tangible dissemination of its benefits among the Iranian population . In other words , it is the success of the nuclear deal—rather than its shortcomings—that is driving the complaints that have emanated from Iran .
[ I ] t is the success of the nuclear deal—rather than its shortcomings—that is driving the complaints that have emanated from Iran .
The United States is not responsible for the hesitancy of international capital and other economic hiccups that Tehran has experienced in the aftermath of the nuclear agreement . The culpability resides , as it always has , with Iran and the risks that its government ’ s policies pose for international business . If Iranians want to see their nascent opening to the international community expanded—if they want the peace dividend they have been promised , they need to look to their own leadership and its policies . If Iran ’ s Central Bank governor wants “ normal conditions ” and “ access to the U.S. financial system , ” as he demanded during his Washington visit , let him return to Tehran and help instill the kind of reforms that would make those goals possible .
There are sensible steps that Washington can take to ensure that the provisions of the nuclear deal are fully feasible , including limited mechanisms for enabling transactions , such as the repatriation of previously frozen assets , that are specifically permitted under the deal . Such exceptional measures are reasonable—not because they help Tehran , but because they help sustain consensus between Washington and its European partners and help preserve the West ’ s negotiating leverage with any future targets of American or multilateral financial sanctions .
However , it would be profoundly detrimental for Washington to provide significant unilateral relief to Tehran without reciprocal additional Iranian concessions . And the PR blitz by senior U.S. officials to reassure Iran ’ s prospective foreign investors has taken on an unseemly tone , especially since existing sanctions prohibit U.S. persons from facilitating transactions with Iran by foreign entities .
These measures may be aimed at building confidence , but they ultimately have the opposite effect—eroding Iran ’ s incentives to abide by the deal , undermining any rationale for broader changes . Iran remains a risky place to do business , and it is in Washington ’ s interests—as well as those of Iranians and the broader international community—that Tehran focuses on mitigating those risks rather than seeking to subvert their penalties .
The nuclear deal is working ; Iran ’ s nascent reintegration into the global economy is intensifying internal debates and popular expectations . This is all to the good . But to get more , Tehran will have to give more .","Are the wheels coming off the Iran deal? Less than a year after Iran, America, and five other world powers inked a comprehensive nuclear accord, a debate over its terms has erupted anew.

In Washington, the braggadocio of a prominent White House aide is fueling Republican accusations that President Obama deliberately deceived the Congress and the country about Iran and the deal. And in Tehran, frustration over the residual impact of American sanctions has prompted increasingly resentful accusations from Iranian leaders that the United States has failed to live up to its end of the bargain. As a result, some are fretting that the deal is “at risk” and are laying blame on the White House doorstep.

Both claims are spurious, and deserve a more forceful rebuttal from the Obama administration. In the end, however, the ruckus over recent comments by Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes is largely an inside-the-Beltway drama—one that provides endless entertainment for Washington insiders but has little real significance for deal or American diplomacy.

By contrast, Iran’s dissatisfaction presents a serious diplomatic dilemma for Washington. But it should not be interpreted as evidence that the deal is “unraveling.” Rather, the chorus of complaints from Tehran demonstrates the accord signed in July 2015 is working exactly as it was intended—forestalling Iranian nuclear ambitions while amplifying the incentives for further reintegration into the global economy.

Obama’s handling of this first real test of the nuclear agreement will be crucial for sustaining its credibility. For the sake of the deal, and for any prospect of a durable Thermidor for the revolutionary state, Washington should resist the temptation to assuage Iran’s post-deal growing pains. If Iranians wants wholesale economic rehabilitation, their leadership needs to embrace the kind of policies that would yield that—in other words, meaningful political, economic, and foreign policy reform.

“Iranophobes” and “thieves”

Not surprisingly, Iranian officials are seeking a quicker fix, and they have mounted an intense campaign to wrest supplementary sanctions relief from Washington. Their principal argument is that the theocracy has been stiffed. On an April visit to Washington, Valiollah Seif, the head of Iran’s Central Bank, questioned the benefits of the nuclear agreement, insisting that Tehran has received “almost nothing” of the sanctions relief that was promised as part of the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country’s smooth-spoken foreign minister, has contended that “the United States needs to do way more,” warning that “if one side does not comply with the agreement then the agreement will start to falter.”

And Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, charged recently that “the Americans are engaged in obstruction and deception, adding: “on paper, the Americans say banks can trade with Iran but in practice they act in such an Iranophobic way that no trade can take place with Iran.”

Adding fuel to the fire are changes to U.S. visa policies that are perceived at constraining Iran’s economic rebound, deliberately inflammatory rhetoric from the U.S. Congress, and a recent Supreme Court verdict that paves the way for a $2 billion payout to victims of terrorist attacks attributed to Tehran or its proxies. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has described the decision as “flagrant theft” and evidence of enduring American hostility toward Tehran.

Upholding our side of the bargain

Tehran’s narrative plays equally well to its essential constituencies: the revolution’s power brokers, steeped in official narratives of American treachery; an Iranian citizenry impatient for its long overdue peace dividend; and a European business community anxious to reclaim its piece of the pie after an unwelcome five years of having to forgo a lucrative market.

Bowe Bergdahl and his capture by the Taliban , which held him for five years , a new report indicates Army officials have determined Bergdahl — for whom the administration traded five top Gitmo-held terrorists — will be charged as a deserter .
Retired Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer , a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research , made the startling claim during an appearance on `` The O'Reilly Factor '' on Fox News :
Bergdahl ’ s attorney has received the charges , according to Shaffer , who claims the Obama administration is withholding the report .
But the Army Times claims the Army says there 's no truth to claims a decision has been made on the Bergdahl case . Paul Boyce , spokesman for Forces Command , told the Army Times there is no charge sheet and the Fox News story `` seems to be speculative in nature . ''
`` What they are reporting is untrue – there has been no update to what we provided in Dec. Investigation is still with [ General Mark ] Milley who will determine appropriate action – which ranges from no further action to convening a court martial . We can not discuss or disclose the findings of the investigation while disciplinary decisions are pending before commanders , '' the Army said in a statement provided to CNN Tuesday .
Likewise , Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby posted the following statement on Twitter : `` Contrary to media reporting , no decision made by Army leadership with respect to Sgt . Bergdahl 's case . The process will be respected . ''
O ’ Reilly said the White House has had this information for a while but has been delaying it under the auspices of Ben Rhodes , assistant national security adviser .
`` This is shaping up to be a Titanic struggle behind the scenes , '' Shaffer said . `` Believe me , the Army here wants to do the right thing . Factually , there ’ s no way they can not do the right thing regarding Bergdahl . And the White House , because of the political narrative , President Obama cozying up to the parents and because he , President Obama , releasing the five Taliban . … The narrative is what the White House does not want to have come out . ''
NBC News is separately reporting that a decision on the desertion charge is imminent and may come within a week , according to an anonymous senior defense officials .
Bergdahl was recovered in Afghanistan by U.S. troops in a controversial swap for five Taliban officials on May 31 . He had disappeared from his small patrol base on June 30 , 2009 , under a cloud of suspicion and fear as it became clear he been captured by militants .
The Army in June launched a new investigation into Bergdahl ’ s disappearance and capture , amid a raft of accusations from his fellow soldiers that he walked away from his unit on the battlefield and questions about whether the Obama administration handled the prisoner swap legally .
On Jan. 11 , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. Martin Dempsey , said he anticipated a decision `` fairly soon '' on whether the Army would court martial Bergdahl for deserting his post .
`` In White House terms , not charging Bergdahl means that he was indeed worth the trade for the Taliban Five . But charging him on any level means that releasing the five Taliban was an error of monstrous proportions , one the administration will never be able to explain away satisfactorily , '' said retired Lt. Col. Bill Cowen in a commentary written for the Fox News site .
Former Sgt . Matt Vierkant told CNN last year , `` Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war , and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him . ''
`` I do n't understand , '' Vierkant added , `` why we 're trading prisoners at Gitmo for somebody who deserted during a time of war , which is an act of treason . ''
A full 54 percent of Americans agreed in a June 2014 poll , saying Obama ’ s swap for Bergdahl amounted to providing aid to terrorists – which violates federal law . And they said impeachment is deserved .
In June , WND reported an explosive charge emerged – that Bergdahl 's fellow soldiers had orders to shoot him on sight as a deserter .
A number of damning charges against Bergdahl came from soldiers who served with him . Some were posted on Facebook .
The soldiers wrote anonymously , saying the Pentagon had them sign nondisclosure statements after Bergdahl disappeared from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 . Some said they were still on active duty .
WND also reported a four-year-old claim by a Taliban commander that Bergdahl was n't just a deserter but also a traitor who converted to Islam and taught jihadi fighters how to make bombs and ambush convoys .
Afghan intelligence officials believed Bergdahl was `` cooperating with the Taliban '' and advising fighters at a base in Pakistan .
A comment posted by a soldier who says he served with Bergdahl confirmed the charge .
`` What you have is pretty well spot on , '' the post says . `` All I know is that our orders were kill on contact and then we came back and it was covered up . I ’ ve personally been threatened a few times that discussing it in half the detail you already have was considered an act of treason . ''
Another post made clear the Army considered Berdahl not just a deserter but a defector .
`` My battalion took over the AO from 25th . The story of Bergdahl being a defector is exactly what was briefed to us and I also read the debrief report about the situation . The story is 100 % correct . I ’ ve personally been on a few missions following up on Bergdahls location but we never found anything . I currently live an hour away from his family ’ s location . Hailey , Idaho , is a resort town frequented by movie stars etc . They typically side with the anti-war side of politics in that area and is a perfect spot for him to live in solitude . ''
Another post that said Bergdahl deserted came from someone who said he was directly involved in the attempted recovery of Bergdahl .
`` Here is what I know , not from hearsay , but because I was there . Bergdahl became a sympathizer , walked off his post to seek out the Taliban in order to join their ranks , to help and live with them . In exchange for his release , the United States released the following 5 known Taliban ; Khairullah Khairkhwa , Mullah Norullah Noori , Mullah Norullah Noori , Abdul Haq Wasiq , Mohammed Nabi who were immediately welcomed back into the Taliban network . The Taliban are currently seeking the release of additional prisoners , but will not state specifics . Now that they have the blue print on how to accomplish this by simply capturing an American soldier and with the troop number drawing down to 9,800+ , I can only hope our service men and women keep their heads on a swivel .

On Jan. 11, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, said he anticipated a decision ""fairly soon"" on whether the Army would court martial Bergdahl for deserting his post.

""In White House terms, not charging Bergdahl means that he was indeed worth the trade for the Taliban Five. But charging him on any level means that releasing the five Taliban was an error of monstrous proportions, one the administration will never be able to explain away satisfactorily,"" said retired Lt. Col. Bill Cowen in a commentary written for the Fox News site.

Former Sgt. Matt Vierkant told CNN last year, ""Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war, and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him.""

""I don't understand,"" Vierkant added, ""why we're trading prisoners at Gitmo for somebody who deserted during a time of war, which is an act of treason.""

A full 54 percent of Americans agreed in a June 2014 poll, saying Obama’s swap for Bergdahl amounted to providing aid to terrorists – which violates federal law. And they said impeachment is deserved.

In June, WND reported an explosive charge emerged – that Bergdahl's fellow soldiers had orders to shoot him on sight as a deserter.

A number of damning charges against Bergdahl came from soldiers who served with him. Some were posted on Facebook.

The soldiers wrote anonymously, saying the Pentagon had them sign nondisclosure statements after Bergdahl disappeared from his post in Afghanistan in 2009. Some said they were still on active duty.

WND also reported a four-year-old claim by a Taliban commander that Bergdahl wasn't just a deserter but also a traitor who converted to Islam and taught jihadi fighters how to make bombs and ambush convoys.

Afghan intelligence officials believed Bergdahl was ""cooperating with the Taliban"" and advising fighters at a base in Pakistan.

A comment posted by a soldier who says he served with Bergdahl confirmed the charge.

""What you have is pretty well spot on,"" the post says. ""All I know is that our orders were kill on contact and then we came back and it was covered up. I’ve personally been threatened a few times that discussing it in half the detail you already have was considered an act of treason.""

Another post made clear the Army considered Berdahl not just a deserter but a defector.

""My battalion took over the AO from 25th. The story of Bergdahl being a defector is exactly what was briefed to us and I also read the debrief report about the situation. The story is 100% correct. I’ve personally been on a few missions following up on Bergdahls location but we never found anything. I currently live an hour away from his family’s location. Hailey, Idaho, is a resort town frequented by movie stars etc. They typically side with the anti-war side of politics in that area and is a perfect spot for him to live in solitude.""

Another post that said Bergdahl deserted came from someone who said he was directly involved in the attempted recovery of Bergdahl.

""Here is what I know, not from hearsay, but because I was there. Bergdahl became a sympathizer, walked off his post to seek out the Taliban in order to join their ranks, to help and live with them. In exchange for his release, the United States released the following 5 known Taliban; Khairullah Khairkhwa, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mullah Norullah Noori, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mohammed Nabi who were immediately welcomed back into the Taliban network. The Taliban are currently seeking the release of additional prisoners, but will not state specifics. Now that they have the blue print on how to accomplish this by simply capturing an American soldier and with the troop number drawing down to 9,800+, I can only hope our service men and women keep their heads on a swivel.""",www.wnd.com,right,yjIkjIWA82O3pHXZ

Before President Donald Trump even said `` good morning '' in a televised address responding to Iran 's strikes on U.S. targets , he announced , `` As long as I am president of the United States , Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon . ''
It 's an often-repeated line from him , but there was one change in U.S. policy Wednesday : Trump called for other world powers to abandon the nuclear accord , which is barely surviving after he withdrew the U.S. in 2018 and Iran has unraveled its cooperation since 2019 .
Instead , Trump urged those countries that remain in the deal to pursue negotiations over a new Iran nuclear deal . But in doing so , he attacked the existing one with misinformation -- and analysts say any new negotiations are unlikely because of Trump 's maximalist approach to Tehran .
`` Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism , '' the president said at the White House . `` The time has come for the United Kingdom , Germany , France , Russia and China to recognize this reality . They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal -- or JCPOA -- and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place . ''
JCPOA stands for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , the nuclear deal 's formal name . Under its terms , the U.S. , other countries and the United Nations agreed to lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran accepting restrictions on its nuclear program , including caps on enriched uranium and centrifuges and inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency , a nuclear watchdog .
Since Trump reimposed sanctions and maximized their enforcement last spring , Iran has taken a series of steps to break those caps -- stockpiling more enriched uranium than the 300 kg limit , enriching uranium higher than than 3.75 % limit and installing more centrifuges than allowed and operating them in facilities not allowed .
But America 's European allies in the deal -- the United Kingdom , France and Germany -- have maintained that it is essential because those IAEA inspections continue and Iran has agreed to never pursue a nuclear weapon , especially as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , or NPT .
The Trump administration , however , argues that Tehran can not be trusted to abide by those agreements , with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arguing recently that Iran should not be allowed to enrich uranium at all . It 's unclear if that is Trump 's position for any potential future negotiations , too .
Instead of laying out a road map for talks , Trump took the time on Wednesday to bash the previous deal , saying , `` Iran 's hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013 and they were given $ 150 billion , not to mention $ 1.8 billion in cash . ''
Trump has made these claims before , but they 're no less false . As part of the deal , which was signed in 2015 , not 2013 , Iran was not given $ 150 billion , but had billions of its assets unfrozen . That figure could have been as high as $ 150 billion , but the U.S. Treasury put it closer to $ 56 billion , while the Central Bank of Iran said it ended up at around $ 35 billion after Iran paid off its debts .
The Obama administration did agree to pay $ 1.7 billion to the Iranian government for military equipment that the U.S. government agreed to sell the pro-Western Iranian government in the 1970 's and then never delivered after the 1979 Islamic Revolution . It was part of a larger arbitration in international court that also saw Iran pay more than $ 2.5 billion to American citizens and businesses . As part of that payment , $ 400 million -- the original amount in question -- was paid in cash by the U.S. , with a negotiated interest payment of $ 1.3 billion paid later .
Trump went further , however , saying those `` funds made available by the last administration '' were used to pay for `` the missiles fired last night at us and our allies . ''
It 's a stinging criticism of his predecessor , essentially accusing President Barack Obama of funding an attack against Americans . Trump 's broader point is that those payments gave Iran more funds for its military and proxy forces like the Shiite militias in Iraq , but it 's also a claim that ca n't be proven . A senior State Department official told ███ on Wednesday that the missiles Iran deployed were `` retro '' and `` not new or unique , '' so perhaps they were made or purchased many years prior to the deal .
Trump also claimed the `` very defective JCPOA expires shortly , '' but parts of the deal never expire , including the IAEA inspections , Iran 's signature on the NPT and a commitment not to pursue a nuclear weapon . Certain caps on Iran 's enriched uranium stockpile or number of centrifuges do lift and European allies tried to negotiate with Iran and the Trump administration to extend them , but Trump abandoned those efforts and withdrew the U.S .
Critics instead argue that Trump 's withdrawal and Iran 's response to break its commitments have sped up those expiration dates . While Iran would not have crossed that 300 kg limit on enriched uranium until 2030 , for example , it has already done that this past July .
While Trump expressed optimism for a new negotiation with Iran and a new deal , the chances of that are also low .

Mr. McHugh took the action against Maj. Mathew Golsteyn , who braved repeated enemy fire in Afghanistan , even though he has not been charged with any offenses . The Army now is seeking to release him with a less-than-honorable discharge . The officer plans to fight the move , his attorney says .
The secretary acted after the CIA informed the Army that Maj. Golsteyn , during a polygraph exam for a job application , told of killing a terrorist who was making improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) , the weapon that has killed more Americans in Afghanistan than any other . The Army also removed Maj. Golsteyn from the elite ranks of the Green Berets .
Rep. Duncan Hunter , the California Republican who is spearheading the restrictive legislation , says he wants to prevent service secretaries from retaliating against personnel by stripping their awards in cases where there is insufficient evidence to charge them for nonjudicial , or court-martial , punishment .
“ Secretary McHugh made a political decision , ” Mr. Hunter said . “ He used his power as a weapon to retaliate against a soldier when the Army was unable to prove an allegation . ”
The CIA disclosure prompted the Army to launch a criminal investigation . Agents fanned out to interview his combat cohorts in Marjah , Afghanistan . The report remains confidential , but sources say it could never confirm that Maj. Golsteyn did anything criminally wrong outside of his statements to the CIA .
The CIA , in turn , protects its polygraph procedures and questions as strictly as it guards other secrets . It will not let the Army use the transcript in a criminal proceeding and will give very limited access in an administrative one .
Maj. Golsteyn ’ s case is taking the administrative route . His lawyer , Phillip Stackhouse , a former Marine Corps judge advocate , said he has requested a board of inquiry , at which he will make the case the officer should be retained .
“ They can ’ t prove that anything improper took place because nothing improper did take place , ” Mr. Stackhouse said . “ We ’ ll certainly stand on Matt ’ s combat and military service . ”
A supporter on Capitol Hill said the officer believes the killing was justified under Afghanistan ’ s complex rules of engagement and because of the need to protect troops .
Mr. Hunter , a former Marine Corps officer who has taken up Maj. Golsteyn ’ s cause , had a testy exchange with Mr. McHugh via letters , copies of which were obtained by The ███ .
On Feb. 9 , Mr. Hunter wrote to Mr. McHugh questioning the secretary ’ s “ objectivity . ”
“ The Army ’ s case against Maj. Matt Golsteyn continues to lack clarity and consistency , ” the congressman said . “ Matt has yet to be charged with a crime or convicted of any wrongdoing . Yet the Army is going to great lengths to administratively punish him . ”
Mr. McHugh fired back on Feb. 26 : “ Every step in the process of investigating Maj. Golsteyn ’ s actions , and reviewing and subsequently revoking his valor awards , has been thorough , objective and justified . ”
“ The Army investigation demonstrated that Maj. Gosteyn ’ s service during or after the time of the distinguished act , achievement or meritorious service was not honorable , ” the Army secretary added .
He offered to have investigators brief Mr. Hunter as long as the congressman kept all information confidential . Mr. Hunter curtly declined .
“ Unfortunately , I have to disagree with your characterization of the investigation , ” Mr. Hunter wrote . “ Can you please explain to me what evidence the Army — and agents , in particular — actually discovered , beyond the allegations relayed by CIA ? ”

The Silver Star ranks third in precedence of combat valor awards to the Medal of Honor and the Army Distinguished Service Cross . The officer was approved for an Army Cross , but the CIA disclosure prompted the Army not to award it and to rescind the Silver Star .
Maj. Golsteyn performed his heroics on Feb. 20 , 2010 , when a crow ’ s nest at Forward Operating Base McQueary took sniper rounds . Then a captain and leader of Special Forces A-Team , Maj. Golsteyn organized a combined 80-man Green Beret/Marine Corps/Afghan force to find and destroy the snipers .
The force quickly came under fire in a muddy poppy field . The officer ran more than the length of a football field under heavy fire to coordinate the evacuation by ground of a bullet-pierced Afghan soldier .
“ Captain Golsteyn was alone running in the open through enemy gun fire that had over 80 men pinned down , and from the crow ’ s nest on top of FOB McQueary it looked like Captain Golsteyn was alone fighting 30 enemy fighters out in the poppy fields , ” the narrative says .
Dodging fire , he ran to a spot from which he could unleash rifle fire to provide cover for the medical evacuation . Enemy reinforcements of about 80 Taliban arrived , increasing a barrage of small arms fire . The Green Beret again exposed himself to fire to gain positive identification of the target , which in turn allowed a Navy F-18 Hornet to hit the compound with two 500-pound satellite-guided bombs .
Next , he moved on foot to identify the next target .
“ With blatant disregard for his own personal safety , Captain Golsteyn exposed himself again to heavy enemy fire and moved 200 meters from the center of the patrol to the eastern flank in order to establish a position of advantage from which to engage the enemy , ” the narrative said .
He then relayed positions so a mortar team could put rounds on the second target . Next , he provided the site for a Predator drone to fire a Hellfire missile . After four hours of intense fighting , the enemy was subdued .
“ His razor sharp focus and emotionless decision-making under extreme duress kept the combined patrol a step ahead of a skilled and prepared enemy , ” the narrative stated .
Subsequent to the battle , Maj. Golsteyn encountered and killed the IED maker .
Back home at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , Maj. Golsteyn saw his name added to the Pentagon online roster of Silver Star recipients .
But then he did the CIA interview , and the next thing he knew , the Army had taken away the medal .
Mr. Stackhouse said no Army official in person informed the officer of the revocation . He received an email that alerted him to an unspecified change in his personnel file , a change he had to research himself .
He filed a rebuttal and asked to meet with Mr. McHugh but received no reply .
“ From a leadership perspective , it is repugnant , ” Mr. Stackhouse said .
Lt. Col. Benjamin Garrett , an Army spokesman at the Pentagon , said Mr. McHugh acted on sound legal ground and was supported by Army Gen. David Rodriguez , who was then the No . 2 commander of all coalition forces in Afghanistan and had approved the award .

These hours , minutes , and seconds of history will be front and center this Friday , when Barack Obama becomes the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima . Yet aside from anniversaries , Americans don ’ t think much about nuclear weapons today . Perhaps it is the cultural hangover from the Cold War , which often seemed to test the limits of how much fear societies could endure . Perhaps with the bombing of Hiroshima passing from living memory , we ’ ve simply lost the vocabulary for talking about the mechanics of midnight , as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists famously christened the end of the world .
When President Truman approved the use of the world ’ s first atomic bomb , the weapon first had to be transported to the island of Tinian . Stowed in the hold of the USS Indianapolis in July 1945 , the journey from San Francisco took 10 days . Flying time from the airfield to the city of Hiroshima clocked in at about six hours , and the bomb itself fell for 43 seconds before exploding .
The apparatus of calamity constructed over the past seven decades is more lethal now than it was in the summer of 1945 , and it is far easier to use . Its future is worth considering , especially by those seeking the White House . Today , the United States has more than 7,000 nuclear weapons . Of those , 2,000 are deployed , which means they can be launched on a 15-minute alert on the authority of one human being .
Nine months after Obama ’ s finger was first placed on the button , he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , in part for his stated goals of nuclear nonproliferation . The administration ’ s deal with Iran and its efforts to get more than a dozen nations to surrender bomb-grade material are important steps toward checking the spread of cataclysmic weapons .
At the same time , however , the Obama administration oversaw the development of the B61 model 12 , a new nuclear weapon that is small , accurate , and adaptable . In truth , this is what might be called a contradiction bomb : It is the most expensive nuclear weapon project in history , yet it is intentionally designed to get the least bang for the buck . It is a nuclear weapon that looks and feels and can be used like a conventional smart bomb . This ease — even plausibility — of use is what makes this weapon so dangerous .
The Pentagon is also in the process of taking advantage of the already extreme accuracy of missile warheads by changing their fusing mechanisms so as to increase their ability to successfully destroy the hardest targets by a factor of three .

These hours, minutes, and seconds of history will be front and center this Friday, when Barack Obama becomes the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima. Yet aside from anniversaries, Americans don’t think much about nuclear weapons today. Perhaps it is the cultural hangover from the Cold War, which often seemed to test the limits of how much fear societies could endure. Perhaps with the bombing of Hiroshima passing from living memory, we’ve simply lost the vocabulary for talking about the mechanics of midnight, as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists famously christened the end of the world.

When President Truman approved the use of the world’s first atomic bomb, the weapon first had to be transported to the island of Tinian. Stowed in the hold of the USS Indianapolis in July 1945, the journey from San Francisco took 10 days. Flying time from the airfield to the city of Hiroshima clocked in at about six hours, and the bomb itself fell for 43 seconds before exploding.

The apparatus of calamity constructed over the past seven decades is more lethal now than it was in the summer of 1945, and it is far easier to use. Its future is worth considering, especially by those seeking the White House. Today, the United States has more than 7,000 nuclear weapons. Of those, 2,000 are deployed, which means they can be launched on a 15-minute alert on the authority of one human being.

Nine months after Obama’s finger was first placed on the button, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in part for his stated goals of nuclear nonproliferation. The administration’s deal with Iran and its efforts to get more than a dozen nations to surrender bomb-grade material are important steps toward checking the spread of cataclysmic weapons.

At the same time, however, the Obama administration oversaw the development of the B61 model 12, a new nuclear weapon that is small, accurate, and adaptable. In truth, this is what might be called a contradiction bomb: It is the most expensive nuclear weapon project in history, yet it is intentionally designed to get the least bang for the buck. It is a nuclear weapon that looks and feels and can be used like a conventional smart bomb. This ease — even plausibility — of use is what makes this weapon so dangerous.

The Pentagon is also in the process of taking advantage of the already extreme accuracy of missile warheads by changing their fusing mechanisms so as to increase their ability to successfully destroy the hardest targets by a factor of three. This program will vastly increase the killing power of the entire missile arsenal and, in so doing, create the appearance that the United States is preparing to fight and win a nuclear war against Russia.

Americans today have lots of pressing concerns — paying their bills, paying their debts, deciding whom to vote for. The Atomic Scientists even changed their clock in 2007 to reflect the threat posed by climate change rather than just nuclear annihilation.

The country meanwhile spent its Cold War peace dividend on decades of forgetting the stakes, on trivializing the power of the presidency. After all, what really is an affair with an intern, a torture program, a terrorist attack on a remote embassy, when there’s an immediate and existential threat one push away?

Which brings us to Peak Triviality — Donald Trump’s pursuit of the White House.

The process is time-consuming and daunting . The Pentagon has made it clear that it does not want to retain irrelevant standards that women can not meet — and it wants women introduced into combat units in sizable numbers to develop mentoring and female camaraderie .
“ Yes , there is too much focus on social issues in the armed forces driven by external proponents with special interests , focused agendas and , in many cases , lack of knowledge about the armed forces , ” said retired Gen. Carl Mundy , Marine Corps commandant from 1991 to 1995 . “ The military services are without question the most open element in our society , and the very nature of that openness , together with the fishbowl in which they exist , make them ripe and easy targets for activists with an agenda . ”
The Marines in particular face a challenge in finding enough women , who make up 7 percent of the Corps . Women account for 14 percent of Army soldiers .
Before retiring as Marine commandant in 2010 , Gen. James Conway testified before a congressionally created commission on military diversity . He said he doesn ’ t believe Marine women want to be in land combat .
“ I don ’ t think you will see a change because I don ’ t think our women want it to change , ” Gen. Conway testified . “ There are certain demands of officers in a combat arms environment that our women see , recognize , appreciate , and say , ‘ I couldn ’ t do that .

The transgendered soldier

The combat debate was preceded by and now coincides with a running debate on openly serving gays. The Pentagon spent a year preparing every unit for open homosexuals in the ranks. Now it is churning out regulations on gay marriage, authorized leave for same-sex weddings and domestic benefits.

But the gay-rights movement, a big supporter of Mr. Obama, has demanded that the military ranks be open to transgenders as well as gays.

The social focus has emerged amid a military drawdown and retrenchment. The last combat troops left Iraq in December 2011, and most are due to leave Afghanistan next year. Mandatory budget cuts known as sequestration are squeezing a force already slated to shrink.

Military priorities

Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, Army chief of staff, announced in June that he was eliminating 10 brigade combat teams, with an aim of trimming 80,000 soldiers over four years.

The Navy said it lacked the money to send a second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, even though the commander in charge requested it.

The Air Force jet fighter inventory has shrunk by more than 500 over the past 10 years to about 2,000 planes as it consolidates units. Retired fighter jocks have taken to calling it a “geriatric Air Force.”

Said Gen. Mundy: “My greatest concern is the impact on the morale and steadfastness to service among some of the finest and most selfless leaders this nation produces, together with the equally fine young men and women they lead who are barraged with being branded as or tolerating sexual predators or anti-equal opportunity. I cannot help but believe that there is long-term impact on the effectiveness of our armed forces from this in terms of morale, recruiting, retention and public confidence and support.”

Last fall , Mr. Obama sent 50 special operators to Syria as trainers as “ a proof of concept of sorts , ” says Melissa Dalton , a former intelligence analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency . The goal was to see if the United States could use the training to gain traction with Kurdish fighters and Arab Sunnis on the ground , she says .
On Monday , Obama offered his verdict , saying that the expertise of the Special Operations Forces already in Syria “ has been critical as local forces have driven [ the Islamic State ] out of key areas . ”
Monday ’ s decision , then , appears to be an attempt to hit the fast forward button .
It “ seems to reflect that this proof of concept works , ” adds Ms. Dalton . “ There ’ s been some positive momentum built up , with the idea now being , ‘ OK , if we expand that out a bit further – multiply the amount of trainers in the country – then perhaps we can multiply the effects . ' ”
There are questions . At a time when a diplomatic cease-fire is faltering , the US seems to be doubling down on a military strategy , even as it has failed to define what a realistic end state might be , Dalton says .
“ Where are we building to ? Is this the first of many plus-ups happening incrementally – and to what end ? ”
But building out the program bit by bit makes sense , say others . It gives the US the potential to empower anti-Islamic State forces in a proven way without becoming embroiled in a Mideast war .
In this case , “ incrementalism is the right approach , ” says Nicholas Heras , a Middle East analyst at the Center for a New American Security .
Monday ’ s decision mirrored another made last week , with more US troops on their way to Iraq in newly-expanded roles that will bring them “ closer to the action , ” as Defense Secretary Ash Carter put it .
With Obama making no secret of his desire to keep US out of another war in the Middle East , this increase in Syria from 50 to 300 Special Operations Forces is seen as a relatively low-risk gambit .
In the past , the US has made much more grandiose efforts at fighting the Islamic State , also known as ISIS . Before the US sent over its 50 special operators last fall , it attempted a $ 500 million effort to train Syrian anti-ISIS forces . The result : “ four or five ” fighters on the battlefield , Gen. Lloyd Austin told Congress last September .
But still , the Syrian rebels in the program were “ getting terrific training , ” Christine Wormuth , the Pentagon ’ s policy chief , assured lawmakers .
The answer was to pivot to the 50 special operators , who have worked on refining their message to potential recruits .
“ They are explaining the benefits : They get training , they get US airstrike support , US logistical support , and the tacit idea that while ISIS is the primary objective , the US isn ’ t going to complain if these groups fight back against ” Syrian president Bashar al-Assad , Mr. Heras says .
The trainers have also had some success in expanding the number of Syrian Arabs within the Syrian Democratic Forces , Heras adds .
That ’ s important in building some degree of trust among anti-ISIS forces . Kurds have proven to be US forces ’ most-reliable partners , but Syrian Arabs distrust them – to the point that Sunni Arab families were fleeing deeper into ISIS-held territory for fear of Kurdish forces , Amnesty International reports . The Kurdish forces were accused of ethnic cleansing and forcibly removing Sunni Arabs from their homes .
Kurdish forces ultimately want an autonomous region of their own within Syria , a goal that many Sunni Arabs do not support , notes Jenny Cafarella , a fellow at the Institute for the Study of War .
But a greater ethnic mix of forces battling ISIS could help in the long run . If these troops can ultimately take back control of their hometowns , then they must find a way to live together and govern – an even trickier proposition than winning on the battlefield .

In the first train-and-equip mission , the emphasis was on fighters that had been recommended by Syrians on the ground , often with the Turks acting as intermediaries .
Now , the latest pool includes “ guys who were expelled from ISIS-controlled territory , so they have a sense of vengeance – they ’ re on a mission , ” Heras says . “ For them , it ’ s ISIS that ’ s the major impediment to them being able to go back home , to build up their own government , ” he adds . “ For them , it ’ s ISIS that ’ s the main enemy . ”","President Obama’s announcement Monday that 250 Special Operations Forces will be headed to Syria suggests that a “start small” approach to combatting the Islamic State might be showing signs of promise.

`` I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea , '' Trump tweeted .
The encounter happened last week . Six U.S. Navy warships were conducting drills with US Army Apache attack helicopters in international waters off Iran last Wednesday when they were repeatedly harassed by 11 Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Navy vessels , the U.S. Navy ’ s 5th Fleet reported .
The Iranian ships repeatedly crossed in front and behind the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds , including multiple crossings of one ship , the Puller , with a 50-yard closest point of approach and within 10 yards of another ship , the Maui 's , bow , a 5th Fleet statement said .

The Navy said that the Iranian ’ s dangerous and provocative actions “ increased the risk of miscalculation and collision ” and were in violation of international maritime “ rules of the road. ” The Navy also said they were not in accordance with international law to act safely with other vessels in the area .
The incident last week came one day after Iranian gunmen stormed a Hong Kong-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz before quickly leaving when they learned the vessel was from China .
The U.S. Navy , Coast Guard , Marines and Army have been conducting joint interoperability operations in the Gulf since March .

At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance… Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. ” Edward B. Foley , Politico
“ In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid , the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation . There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter. ” Noah Feldman , Bloomberg
“ Trump ’ s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it ’ s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there ’ s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But… ‘ even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. ’ …
“ Here is what a presidential president might have said : If there is one thing the past three years have shown , the only good answer to a foreign country offering dirt on your political opponent is to decline and immediately report the offer to the FBI . Our country is still enduring the fallout from Russian interference in 2016 . It has cast a pall on my presidency and led to the indictment of former senior government and campaign officials . The last thing any president should do is encourage foreign meddling in our next presidential election… “ It is important for me to be clear on this , because it is not only a question of me or my campaign potentially breaking the law . It is also a matter of principle . Our political differences matter less than our commitment to one another as citizens loyal to the same constitutional order and committed to defending it in a world in which other states , friendly or unfriendly , pursue their own national interests . As president , I will defend this principle from the same erosion of other norms we have seen as our politics have gotten sharper. ” Editorial Board , Washington Post
“ Foreign dirt wouldn ’ t come from Norway or other stable democratic allies like Ireland , France , and England . It would come from corrupt authoritarian regimes that want to manipulate American democracy for their own ends . In 2016 , the Russian government favored Trump because he appeared open to relieving U.S. sanctions on the country . What if Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies try to repay Trump ’ s support as president by meddling in 2020 ? ... What if Chinese leaders try to push the election in his opponents ’ favor , in hopes of ending the trade war ? … Thanks to Trump ’ s actions , Americans risk inheriting a democracy where elections are playgrounds for foreign powers rather than an expression of citizens ’ wishes. ” Matt Ford , New Republic
Regarding Christopher Steele , a foreign national hired by the Clinton campaign in 2016 , “ ‘ You can pay a foreign national to provide you with services , so a campaign , for instance , could have a campaign attorney who is a Canadian citizen ’ … If this kind of seems like a loophole , experts pointed out that it would be really hard to run a campaign otherwise . It would mean having to worry if the campaign signs you printed came from a foreign company , or if the catering firm you hired had foreign workers . If a campaign is paying someone for work or services , they ’ re being compensated . But where that doesn ’ t happen , and a campaign is accepting a contribution — or ‘ thing of value ’ — from a foreign government , the question then is what ’ s in it for them ? ” Jen Kirby , Vox
“ When [ White House senior advisor Jared ] Kushner was asked whether he would call the FBI if he received an email offering the Trump campaign help from the Russian government , he refused to answer , saying it was a hypothetical question . Besides , he added , he never received the information he was promised the last time that offer was made . This is like asking someone who stole silverware from your house whether he would steal from you again and him responding it was a hypothetical question and , besides , the silverware he stole the first time turned out to be worthless . It 's unlikely you would invite him over again . However , Donald Trump is running for re-election in 2020. ” Larry Noble , CNN
“ Mueller opted not to charge Trump Jr. for accepting a meeting in which he expected to receive opposition research on Clinton and the Democrats from a Russian lawyer in 2016 . But it was not because there was nothing potentially wrong with this ; it was because Mueller decided it was unlikely that it could be proven Trump Jr. knew that it was illegal and/or that the information was something ‘ of value ’ ... [ but ] even if Trump Jr. was ignorant of the law , that defense doesn ’ t really fly with his father today — not after a two-year investigation probing exactly that issue. ” Aaron Blake , Washington Post

“ The good thing you can say for President Trump in this interaction is… that President Trump is the most honest president that we 've ever had . He is . Call him honest Donald . You have Honest Abe and now you can have honest Donald . Why is he the most honest president ? Because President Trump brags about doing all the bad things and thinking all the bad things that all the other presidents have also done but they 've hidden . He 's open about it . He 's honest about it…
“ However , what this also means is then we need to articulate that it 's bad . You do n't want to incentivize foreign governments to spy on American citizens… You do n't want it to seem like the President of the United States is encouraging you to do that or offering you something in return . That 's not a good idea . It 's refreshing to hear a guy speak honestly but then it 's incumbent on all the rest of us to say right that 's true and that is honest , but we should n't do that . ”
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) tweeted , “ I believe that it should be practice for all public officials who are contacted by a foreign government with an offer of assistance to their campaign – either directly or indirectly – to inform the FBI and reject the offer… the outrage some of my Democratic colleagues are raising about President Trump ’ s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on President Trump ’ s campaign and that information , unverified , was apparently used by the FBI to obtain a warrant against an American citizen . ”
“ You see , it ’ s perfectly fine to pay a foreign spy to use Russian government sources ( including FSB agents ) to put together opposition research on Trump . It ’ s also completely acceptable for the DNC to seek out help from Ukraine to come up with dirt on Paul Manafort in order to hurt Trump . But Trump answers a hypothetical honestly instead of choosing to lie like every other politician and it ’ s time to clutch the pearls…
“ There ’ s no moral , nor legal imperative that if a German ( for example ) offers documented wrongdoing by your opponent , you must immediately turn it over to the FBI and not use it . We live in a global society . Negative information about political candidates comes from all corners and travels far and wide via the internet . This is especially true given how internationally connected and active many Presidential candidates are . If someone does something untoward in a foreign country , it ’ s logical that a foreign source would be the one to find out . ”
“ If Russia is calling to give the president information about a political opponent , odds are it is making mischief . But what if the call relaying such information comes from , say , Canada ? While it is possible that this could be nefarious , it is more likely that , like a good neighbor , Canada would be trying to warn the president about some peril to American interests…
“ In the 2016 election , Estonia did call President Obama ’ s administration to provide opposition research — specifically , to convey unverified intelligence that Russia might be channeling money into the Trump campaign . The Brits provided information too . So did the Aussies . So , according to former CIA director John Brennan , did a number of European governments . To be sure , these countries are our allies . But that hardly means they were concerned only for our well-being . Like Brennan , they had their own anti-Trump agendas . The foreign-affairs component of Trump ’ s populist platform seemed to be : better relations with Putin , NATO bashing , skepticism about American interventions and military commitments , and halting the U.S. taxpayer-funded gravy train for European security . Europeans did not like this , not one little bit . ”
It ’ s worth noting that “ conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions… ‍ “ In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer ’ s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey — notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) ”
“ If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? … the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . ”
Others note , “ I ’ d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump ’ s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “ I think Joe Sixpack ’ s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama ’ s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack ’ s attention you are going to have to do better than this . ”","Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference.

As president, I will defend this principle from the same erosion of other norms we have seen as our politics have gotten sharper.” Editorial Board, Washington Post

“Foreign dirt wouldn’t come from Norway or other stable democratic allies like Ireland, France, and England. It would come from corrupt authoritarian regimes that want to manipulate American democracy for their own ends. In 2016, the Russian government favored Trump because he appeared open to relieving U.S. sanctions on the country. What if Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies try to repay Trump’s support as president by meddling in 2020?... What if Chinese leaders try to push the election in his opponents’ favor, in hopes of ending the trade war?… Thanks to Trump’s actions, Americans risk inheriting a democracy where elections are playgrounds for foreign powers rather than an expression of citizens’ wishes.” Matt Ford, New Republic

Regarding Christopher Steele, a foreign national hired by the Clinton campaign in 2016, “‘You can pay a foreign national to provide you with services, so a campaign, for instance, could have a campaign attorney who is a Canadian citizen’… If this kind of seems like a loophole, experts pointed out that it would be really hard to run a campaign otherwise. It would mean having to worry if the campaign signs you printed came from a foreign company, or if the catering firm you hired had foreign workers. If a campaign is paying someone for work or services, they’re being compensated. But where that doesn’t happen, and a campaign is accepting a contribution — or ‘thing of value’ — from a foreign government, the question then is what’s in it for them? ” Jen Kirby, Vox

“When [White House senior advisor Jared] Kushner was asked whether he would call the FBI if he received an email offering the Trump campaign help from the Russian government, he refused to answer, saying it was a hypothetical question. Besides, he added, he never received the information he was promised the last time that offer was made. This is like asking someone who stole silverware from your house whether he would steal from you again and him responding it was a hypothetical question and, besides, the silverware he stole the first time turned out to be worthless. It's unlikely you would invite him over again . However, Donald Trump is running for re-election in 2020.” Larry Noble, CNN

“Mueller opted not to charge Trump Jr. for accepting a meeting in which he expected to receive opposition research on Clinton and the Democrats from a Russian lawyer in 2016. But it was not because there was nothing potentially wrong with this; it was because Mueller decided it was unlikely that it could be proven Trump Jr. knew that it was illegal and/or that the information was something ‘of value’... [but] even if Trump Jr. was ignorant of the law, that defense doesn’t really fly with his father today — not after a two-year investigation probing exactly that issue.” Aaron Blake, Washington Post

“The good thing you can say for President Trump in this interaction is… that President Trump is the most honest president that we've ever had. He is. Call him honest Donald. You have Honest Abe and now you can have honest Donald. Why is he the most honest president? Because President Trump brags about doing all the bad things and thinking all the bad things that all the other presidents have also done but they've hidden. He's open about it. He's honest about it…



“However, what this also means is then we need to articulate that it's bad. You don't want to incentivize foreign governments to spy on American citizens… You don't want it to seem like the President of the United States is encouraging you to do that or offering you something in return. That's not a good idea. It's refreshing to hear a guy speak honestly but then it's incumbent on all the rest of us to say right that's true and that is honest, but we shouldn't do that.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted, “I believe that it should be practice for all public officials who are contacted by a foreign government with an offer of assistance to their campaign – either directly or indirectly – to inform the FBI and reject the offer… the outrage some of my Democratic colleagues are raising about President Trump’s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on President Trump’s campaign and that information, unverified, was apparently used by the FBI to obtain a warrant against an American citizen.”

Lindsey Graham, Twitter

“You see, it’s perfectly fine to pay a foreign spy to use Russian government sources (including FSB agents) to put together opposition research on Trump. It’s also completely acceptable for the DNC to seek out help from Ukraine to come up with dirt on Paul Manafort in order to hurt Trump. But Trump answers a hypothetical honestly instead of choosing to lie like every other politician and it’s time to clutch the pearls…



“There’s no moral, nor legal imperative that if a German (for example) offers documented wrongdoing by your opponent, you must immediately turn it over to the FBI and not use it. We live in a global society. Negative information about political candidates comes from all corners and travels far and wide via the internet. This is especially true given how internationally connected and active many Presidential candidates are. If someone does something untoward in a foreign country, it’s logical that a foreign source would be the one to find out.”

Bonchie, RedState

“If Russia is calling to give the president information about a political opponent, odds are it is making mischief. But what if the call relaying such information comes from, say, Canada? While it is possible that this could be nefarious, it is more likely that, like a good neighbor, Canada would be trying to warn the president about some peril to American interests…



“In the 2016 election, Estonia did call President Obama’s administration to provide opposition research — specifically, to convey unverified intelligence that Russia might be channeling money into the Trump campaign. The Brits provided information too. So did the Aussies. So, according to former CIA director John Brennan, did a number of European governments. To be sure, these countries are our allies. But that hardly means they were concerned only for our well-being. Like Brennan, they had their own anti-Trump agendas. The foreign-affairs component of Trump’s populist platform seemed to be: better relations with Putin, NATO bashing, skepticism about American interventions and military commitments, and halting the U.S. taxpayer-funded gravy train for European security. Europeans did not like this, not one little bit.”

Andrew C. McCarthy, National Review

It’s worth noting that “conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party. In Washington State, voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions… ‍ “In Seattle, the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger. In Colorado, voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap, money that the state Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers. In Sussex County, N.J., voters approved, by a 2-to-1 margin, a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (Washington, Colorado, New Jersey — notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately.)”

Jim Geraghty, National Review

“If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy. In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors?… the nation does not want another war. How we avoid it, however, is becoming difficult to see. John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing, but his soul is marching on.”

Patrick Buchanan, The American Conservative

Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After all that has emerged about Trump so far, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”

Gulf’s turn to diplomacy

The Gulf’s dramatic turnabout and push for diplomacy with Iran was fueled in part by what it perceived as the “unreliability” of the Trump administration and Washington’s unwillingness to protect Arab states from repeated Iranian attacks.

In the wake of last summer’s sabotage of Gulf tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, a UAE delegation went to Tehran and signed a pact to monitor the shipping lanes to prevent conflict, while Saudi Arabia quietly reached out to Iranian proxies in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria.

September’s attacks on Aramco facilities in Saudi Arabia, which badly damaged the kingdom’s oil infrastructure and went without an overt U.S. response, reinforced the notion that the Gulf stands alone.

The belief settled in Arab capitals that for this transactional president, the political cost was too high and personal benefits too few to justify any retaliation. Feeling abandoned, Gulf countries concluded that diplomacy was their only way forward with Iran.

Until all that was upended on Friday.

“In an instant, we saw a sudden shift in the U.S. from being passive and non-interventionist vis-à-vis Iran to being extremely confrontational and taking out its top commander,” says Riad Kahwaji, director of the Dubai-based Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis (INEGMA).

Exasperation with U.S.

These words of “caution” and “restraint” were repeated Wednesday, hours after Iranian missiles struck the U.S.-led coalition’s Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq.

But an even deeper fear is gripping Gulf leaders.

“What the Gulf countries are really afraid of now is that the U.S. will start a war with Iran and walk away,” says Kenneth Pollack, a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute and former CIA analyst. “They are absolutely terrified that Trump has stirred up the hornets’ nest, the Iranians will retaliate, and he will leave them holding the bag.”

Eroding trust

The crisis represents a breakdown in relations and trust with Washington and the administration that has deteriorated for months after initially looking like a happy marriage.

It comes after a series of broken promises, including the troop pullout from Syria and refusal to back the Saudi- and UAE-led blockade of Gulf rival Qatar.

Trust has reportedly been broken between Arab states and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, once seen as an “independent thinker” who could steer President Trump’s policies and prevent rash decision-making.

Malcolm Nance , a former US Navy intelligence specialist , told the magazine it would be a very unusual decision to picture them so clearly while on duty because , if any of them were captured , `` there would be no denying who you are and what you do '' .
Mr Trump also took a selfie with US Navy Lt Cmdr Kyu Lee , who told him he was with Seal Team Five - a fact later reported by the pool of reporters travelling with the president .
The White House has not commented on why they decided against taking such precautions , as some of his predecessors did .
The president also announced that he had secured a sizable pay increase for troops .
Some of his advisers had suggested 2 , 3 or 4 % , he said , adding that he had made clear that this was not enough : `` I said : 'No . Make it 10 % . Make it more than 10 % . ' Because it 's been a long time , it 's been more than 10 years . ''
But as a number of US commentators noted , armed forces personnel have in fact received a pay rise in each of the past 10 years .
The increase for 2019 , approved by Congress and signed by the president in August , will be 2.6 % .
It is the largest rise for troops since 2010 , but not significantly more than last year 's 2.4 % .
Any trip by a US president has to be planned down to the last detail , to make sure there are no holes in the security arrangements .
A trip to an active war zone has to be planned with special care - and secretly .
Mr Trump was apparently very happy , regaling reporters with tales of how they had travelled with the windows closed and lights off so as not to attract any attention .
But unfortunately , when you are in arguably the world 's most recognisable aircraft , the chance of being spotted is always high .
And on this occasion , Alan Meloy captured a perfect image of the plane soaring over Sheffield , UK , on Boxing Day .

Mr Trump is , of course , not the only president to travel on Air Force One on a secret visit to a warzone . His predecessors have done so .
However , the fact it was quite so easy to follow what the president was doing had more than a few people concerned .
`` Sources telling me Trump 's on his way to visit troops - possibly in Iraq . Better late than never , '' tweeted Paul Rieckhoff , founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
`` But also a bit troubling that so many folks seem to already know about this if it has n't happened already . # OpSec anyone ? ''
President Trump was due to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi during the trip but the talks were cancelled over what Mr Mahdi 's office called `` disagreements '' over organisation .
Iraqi MPs told Reuters news agency that Mr Trump had asked for the meeting to take place at the al-Asad military base , an offer declined by the prime minister .
When asked if he had had concerns about the visit , Mr Trump told reporters : `` Absolutely . I had concerns for the institution of the presidency - not for myself , personally . I had concerns for the first lady , I will tell you . ''
Mr Mahdi 's office said US officials had given Iraq advance notice of the presidential visit , but powerful local figures clearly took umbrage .
Sabah al-Saadi , who leads the Shia Muslim parliamentary bloc Islah , called it a `` blatant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty '' .
Qais al-Khazali , commander of Asaib Ahl al-Haqq , Iraq 's most powerful Shia Muslim militia , also objected to the trip .

Malcolm Nance, a former US Navy intelligence specialist, told the magazine it would be a very unusual decision to picture them so clearly while on duty because, if any of them were captured, ""there would be no denying who you are and what you do"".

Mr Trump also took a selfie with US Navy Lt Cmdr Kyu Lee, who told him he was with Seal Team Five - a fact later reported by the pool of reporters travelling with the president.

The White House has not commented on why they decided against taking such precautions, as some of his predecessors did.

Fiction: What was the pay rise figure?

The president also announced that he had secured a sizable pay increase for troops.

Some of his advisers had suggested 2, 3 or 4%, he said, adding that he had made clear that this was not enough: ""I said: 'No. Make it 10%. Make it more than 10%.' Because it's been a long time, it's been more than 10 years.""

But as a number of US commentators noted, armed forces personnel have in fact received a pay rise in each of the past 10 years.

The increase for 2019, approved by Congress and signed by the president in August, will be 2.6%.

It is the largest rise for troops since 2010, but not significantly more than last year's 2.4%.

Secret's out: Trump's plane tracked

Any trip by a US president has to be planned down to the last detail, to make sure there are no holes in the security arrangements.

A trip to an active war zone has to be planned with special care - and secretly.

Mr Trump was apparently very happy, regaling reporters with tales of how they had travelled with the windows closed and lights off so as not to attract any attention.

But unfortunately, when you are in arguably the world's most recognisable aircraft, the chance of being spotted is always high.

And on this occasion, Alan Meloy captured a perfect image of the plane soaring over Sheffield, UK, on Boxing Day.

From there, Twitter sleuths and plane enthusiasts began to track the aircraft as it made its way across Europe and to Iraq, with a number of people guessing where it was headed.

Mr Trump is, of course, not the only president to travel on Air Force One on a secret visit to a warzone. His predecessors have done so.

However, the fact it was quite so easy to follow what the president was doing had more than a few people concerned.

""Sources telling me Trump's on his way to visit troops - possibly in Iraq. Better late than never,"" tweeted Paul Rieckhoff, founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

""But also a bit troubling that so many folks seem to already know about this if it hasn't happened already. #OpSec anyone?""

Friction: Iraqi host not too pleased

President Trump was due to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi during the trip but the talks were cancelled over what Mr Mahdi's office called ""disagreements"" over organisation.

Iraqi MPs told Reuters news agency that Mr Trump had asked for the meeting to take place at the al-Asad military base, an offer declined by the prime minister.

When asked if he had had concerns about the visit, Mr Trump told reporters: ""Absolutely. I had concerns for the institution of the presidency - not for myself, personally. I had concerns for the first lady, I will tell you.""

Mr Mahdi's office said US officials had given Iraq advance notice of the presidential visit, but powerful local figures clearly took umbrage.

Sabah al-Saadi, who leads the Shia Muslim parliamentary bloc Islah, called it a ""blatant violation of Iraq's sovereignty"".

Qais al-Khazali, commander of Asaib Ahl al-Haqq, Iraq's most powerful Shia Muslim militia, also objected to the trip. He warned in a tweet that parliament would respond to the visit by ""forcing the US troops to leave Iraq"".",www.bbc.com,center,GTK7bdAVk3ZseTML

It wasn't exactly a surprise to hear that President Obama named U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice as his next national security adviser.

Almost as soon as it became clear that her role in the administration's Benghazi talking-points snafu meant Senate Republicans would never let her be confirmed as secretary of state if Obama nominated her, the possibility of her taking over from Tom Donilon as Obama's top national security aide was frequently mentioned.

Still, speculation is one thing; an actual appointment, another. So what to make of Rice's appointment?

Here are five ways to look at it:

1. Obama values loyalty.

The appointment could be seen as a reward for Rice's early loyalty to the president. Rice, who held important posts in the Clinton administration, took a chance on then-candidate Obama during his 2008 White House run, when it was still unclear whether he or Hillary Clinton would become the Democratic nominee. Rice eventually became his foreign policy adviser, a critical role for a presidential candidate who at the time, was light on international experience.

2. Obama to GOP: In your face.

So much for the charm offensive. As trash-talking scorers sometimes say to their defenders in basketball — a sport both Rice, a former point guard, and Obama played in prep school — her selection is a glaring ""in your face"" to Republican opponents of both Rice and Obama. The national security adviser post requires no Senate approval, so conservatives opposed to her (not all of them are) will just have to deal with it.

Not only is Rice not going away, she'll have a high-profile position. Republicans will be reminded of their inability to deny her a Cabinet-level position every time they see her in photos with the president, or when she visits Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers.

3. It's all Benghazi, all the time.

Rice's new role pretty much guarantees that anytime she's in the news, some conservatives will bring up her role in the Benghazi affair. So the appointment is likely to give the Benghazi line of attack on Obama a new lease on life.

4. The White House has its privileges.

Even as Obama's foes try to confound his second-term agenda, he has ways to confound them. There are appointments, for example, that don't require Senate confirmation and presidential powers, like executive orders, to achieve certain ends.

5. Then there's the diversity issue.

One of the ironies of the first African-American president's time in office — a president whose immediate household is all female — is that he's drawn criticism for not having enough minorities or women in senior positions in his administration.

Several of his second-term selections for top jobs have quieted that particular criticism. The choice of Rice can be seen as one more significant step in that direction.",www.npr.org,center,eSccSs5y2zNDauM2

Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi recently said Iraqi troops could deploy into Syria to protect Iraq from threats across its borders. Iraq keeps reinforcements along its frontier to guard against infiltration by IS militants, who hold a pocket of territory along the Euphrates River.

Trump campaigned for office on a platform of ending U.S. involvement in foreign trouble spots, such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. The Syria decision will ultimately affect all of the approximately 2,000 troops deployed in the war-torn country. The Pentagon is also said to be developing plans to withdraw up to half of the 14,000 American troops still serving in Afghanistan.

During the presidential campaign, Trump blamed Democrat Hillary Clinton for the rise of IS, due to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 during her tenure as secretary of state.

President George W. Bush is the one who set the 2011 withdrawal date as part of an agreement with the Iraqi government to gradually shrink the U.S. footprint and slowly hand off security responsibilities to the government and Iraqi security forces.

His successor, President Barack Obama, wanted to leave a residual force in Iraq to help the government manage ongoing security challenges. But he ultimately went ahead with the scheduled pullout in 2011 after Iraqi's political leaders rejected terms the U.S. sought for legal protections for the U.S. troops that would have remained.

Two of Trump's recent predecessors visited Iraq early in their terms.

Bush visited Iraq in November 2003, about eight months after that conflict began. Due to security concerns, Bush waited until 2006 to make his first visit to Afghanistan.

Obama visited Iraq in April 2009, the first year of his eight years in office, as part of an overseas tour. He visited Afghanistan in 2010.

Vice President Mike Pence visited Afghanistan in December 2017, not long after Trump outlined a strategy to break the stalemate in America's longest war. Pence met with Afghan leaders and visited with U.S. troops stationed in the country. Trump has not visited Afghanistan.",www.newsmax.com,right,4wK8XrCR7H0UNieH

The strike that killed Soleimani also claimed the life of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a top Iraqi military figure who commanded the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah group.

What did Trump threaten Iraq with?

Speaking from the presidential plane, Mr Trump said that if Iraq asked US forces to depart on an unfriendly basis, ""we will charge them sanctions like they've never seen before, ever. It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.""

Some 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group.

On Sunday, the coalition paused its operations against IS in Iraq, and Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave.

The resolution was pushed through by the parliament's Shia Muslim bloc - which is close to Iran.

Iran's top cultural sites

Iran is home to two dozen Unesco World Heritage sites. These are landmarks the UN's cultural organisation believes need preserving for their cultural, historic or scientific significance. They include:

Persepolis, the capital of the ancient Persian Achaemenid empire and whose earliest remains date back to Sixth Century BC

Naqsh-e Jahan Square in the city of Isfahan, which was built in the early 17th Century and is is one of the largest city squares in the world

Golestan Palace in Tehran, the residence and seat of power for the Qajar dynasty which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925

There are also a number of sites which - while not listed by Unesco - still retain huge cultural importance. For example, the Azadi (Freedom) Tower in Tehran has been the gathering point for celebrations, military parades and mass demonstrations for almost 50 years.

Elsewhere in the city, the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini is dedicated to the Islamic Republic's founder and also houses the tombs of some of the country's leading political figures.

How soon could Iran develop a nuclear bomb?

The country has always insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful - but suspicions that it was being used to develop a bomb covertly prompted the UN Security Council, US and EU to impose crippling sanctions in 2010.

The 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief.

It restricted Iran's enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, to 3.67%. Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built, whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb, and allow international inspections.

Before July 2015, Iran had a large stockpile of enriched uranium and almost 20,000 centrifuges, enough to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the White House at the time.

US experts estimated back then that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called ""breakout time"".

Iran's current ""breakout time"", should it attempt to build a nuclear bomb, is estimated to be around a year, but this could be reduced to half a year or even a matter of months if enrichment levels are increased to 20%, for example.",www.bbc.com,center,v2JaMIJwsc3ROTRN

Goldsmith did not consider himself an adversary of Cheney and Addington . He probably shared many of their political views . What shocked him was their confidence in a set of secret laws and violent policies that could destroy innocent lives and warp the Constitution . The neoconservatives -- the opinion-makers and legislative pedagogues who since 2001 have justified the Cheney-Bush policies -- fit the same description . They are relentless , they push until they are stopped , and thus far they have never been stopped for long .
The campaign for the Iraq war of 2003 , the purest example of their handiwork , began with a strategy memorandum in 1996 , so it is fair to say that they have been pitching to break up the Middle East for a full two decades . But fortune played them a nasty trick with the signing of the nuclear agreement between the P5+1 powers and Iran . War and the prospect of war have been the source of their undeniable importance . If the Iran nuclear deal attains legitimacy , much of their power will slip through their fingers . The imperialist idealism that drives their ventures from day to day will be cheated of the enemy it can not live without .
Iran might then become just one more unlucky country -- authoritarian and cruelly oppressive but an object of persuasion and not the focus of a never-ending threat of force . The neoconservatives are enraged and their response has been feverish : if they were an individual , you would say that he was a danger to himself and others . They still get plenty of attention and airtime , but the main difference between 2003 and 2015 is the absence of a president who obeys them -- something that has only served to sharpen their anger .
President Obama defended the nuclear deal vigorously in a recent speech at American University . This was the first such extended explanation of a foreign policy decision in his presidency , and it lacked even an ounce of inspirational fluff . It was , in fact , the first of his utterances not likely to be remembered for its “ eloquence , ” because it merits the higher praise of good sense . It has been predictably denounced in some quarters as stiff , unkind , ungenerous , and “ over the top . ”
Obama began by speaking of the ideology that incited and justified the Iraq War of 2003 . He called it a “ mindset , ” and the word was appropriate -- suggesting a pair of earphones around a head that prevents us from hearing any penetrating noise from the external world . Starting in the summer of 2002 , Americans heard a voice that said : Bomb , invade , occupy Iraq ! And do the same to other countries ! For the sake of our sanity , Obama explained , we had to take off those earphones :
“ We had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place . It was a mindset characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy ; a mindset that put a premium on unilateral U.S. action over the painstaking work of building international consensus ; a mindset that exaggerated threats beyond what the intelligence supported . Leaders did not level with the American people about the costs of war , insisting that we could easily impose our will on a part of the world with a profoundly different culture and history . And , of course , those calling for war labeled themselves strong and decisive , while dismissing those who disagreed as weak -- even appeasers of a malevolent adversary . ”
In this precise catalogue of mental traits , Obama was careful to name no names , but he made it easy to construct a key :
A mindset characterized by a preference for military action : President George W. Bush ordering the U.N. nuclear inspectors out of Iraq ( though they had asked to stay and complete their work ) because there was a pressing need to bomb in March 2003 ;
A mindset that put a premium on unilateral U.S. action : Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld dismissing the skeptical challenge and eventual non-participation of France and Germany as proof of the irrelevance of “ old Europe ” ;
A mindset that exaggerated threats : the barely vetted New York Times stories by Judith Miller and Michael Gordon , which an administration bent on war first molded and then cited on TV news shows as evidence to justify preventive war ;
Leaders did not level with the American people about the costs of war : Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz pooh-poohing the estimate by Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki that it would take 400,000 troops to maintain order in Iraq after the war ;
Insisting that we could easily impose our will on a part of the world with a profoundly different culture and history : the bromides of Bush and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice on the indwelling Arab spirit that yearns for American-style democracy across the Middle East .
Obama went on to assert that there was a continuity of persons as well as ideas between the propagandists who told us to bomb , invade , and occupy Iraq in 2003 and those now spending tens of millions of dollars to ensure that Congress will abort the nuclear deal . “ The same mindset , ” the president remarked , “ in many cases offered by the same people who seem to have no compunction with being repeatedly wrong , led to a war that did more to strengthen Iran , more to isolate the United States , than anything we have done in the decades before or since . ”
Those people have never recognized that they were wrong . Some put the blame on President Bush or his viceroy in Baghdad , the administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority , L. Paul Bremer , for mismanaging the occupation that followed the invasion ; others continue to nurse the fantastic theory that Saddam Hussein really was in possession of nuclear weapons but somehow smuggled them across the border to Syria and fooled both U.S. reconnaissance teams and the U.N. inspectors ; still others maintain that Shiite militias and weaponry dispatched to Iraq from Iran were the chief culprits in the disaster of the postwar insurgency .
Bear in mind that these opinion-makers , in 2003 , hardly understood the difference between Shiite and Sunni in the country they wanted to invade . To put the blame now on Iran betrays a genius for circular reasoning . Since all Shia militias are allied by religion with Iran , it can be argued that Iraq was not destroyed by a catastrophic war of choice whose effects set the region on fire . No : the United States under Bush and Cheney was an unpresuming superpower doing its proper work , bringing peace and democracy to one of the dark places of the earth by means of a clean , fast , “ surgical ” war . In 2004 and 2005 , just as in 2015 , it was Iran that caused the trouble .
Because the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has scorned the nuclear deal without any attention to detail , the president felt compelled in his speech to recognize candidly the difference of national interest that exists between Israel and the United States . Though we are allies , he said , we are two different countries , and he left his listeners to draw the necessary inference : it is not possible for two countries ( any more than two persons ) to be at once different and the same . Obama went on to connect the nations in question to this premise of international politics :
“ I believe [ the terms of the agreement ] are in America ’ s interest and Israel ’ s interest . And as president of the United States , it would be an abrogation of my constitutional duty to act against my best judgment simply because it causes temporary friction with a dear friend and ally . ”
The last affirmation is critical . A president takes an oath to “ preserve , protect , and defend the constitution of the United States ” -- that is , to attend to the interest of his own country and not another .
The danger of playing favorites in the world of nations , with a partiality that knows no limits , was a main topic of George Washington ’ s great Farewell Address . “ Permanent , inveterate antipathies against particular nations , and passionate attachments for others , should be excluded , ” said Washington , because
“ a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils . Sympathy for the favorite nation , facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists , and infusing into one the enmities of the other , betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification . ”
There are Americans today who submit to a ruling passion that favors uniquely the interests of Israel , and the president had them in mind when he invoked his duties under the Constitution toward the only country whose framework of laws and institutions he had sworn to uphold . Genuine respect for another democracy formed part of his thinking here . Not only was Obama not elected to support Netanyahu ’ s idea of America ’ s interest , he was also not elected by Israelis to support his own idea of Israel ’ s interest .
In a recent commentary in Foreign Affairs , the prominent Israeli journalist and former government adviser Daniel Levy pointed out a fact that is not much remembered today regarding Netanyahu ’ s continuous effort to sabotage negotiations with Iran . It was the Israeli prime minister who initially demanded that nuclear negotiations be pursued on a separate track from any agreement about the trade or sale of conventional weapons . He chose that path because he was certain it would cause negotiations to collapse . The gambit having failed , he now makes the lifting of sanctions on conventional weaponry a significant objection to the “ bad deal ” in Vienna .
Obama concluded his argument by saying that “ alternatives to military action will have been exhausted if we reject a hard-won diplomatic solution that the world almost unanimously supports . So let ’ s not mince words . The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy or some form of war -- maybe not tomorrow , maybe not three months from now , but soon. ” A measured statement and demonstrably true .
But you would never come within hailing distance of this truth if you listened to the numbers of Congressional Republicans who repeat the neoconservative watchwords and their accompanying digests of the recent history of the Middle East . They run through recitations of the dramatis personae of the war on terror with the alacrity of trained seals . Israel lives in a “ dangerous neighborhood. ” Islamists are “ knocking on our door ” and “ looking for gaps in the border with Mexico. ” Iran is “ the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in the world. ” Barack Obama is “ an appeaser ” and “ it ’ s five minutes to midnightin Munich. ” Elected officials who walk on two legs in the twenty-first century are not embarrassed to say these things without the slightest idea of their provenance .
If there was a fault in the president ’ s explanation of his policy , it lay in some things he omitted to say . When you are educating a people who have been proselytized , as Americans have been , by a political cult for the better part of two decades , nothing should be taken for granted . Most Americans do not know that the fanatical Islamists , al-Qaeda , al-Nusra , the Islamic State ( IS ) -- the active and destructive revolutionary force in the greater Middle East at the moment -- are called Sunni Muslims . Nor do they know that the Shia Muslims who govern Iran and who support the government of Syria have never attacked the United States .
To say it as simply as it should be said : the Shiites and Sunnis are different sects , and the Shiites of Iran are fighting against the same enemies the U.S. is fighting in Syria and elsewhere . Again , most Americans who get their information from miscellaneous online scraps have no idea that exclusively Sunni fanatics made up the force of hijackers who struck the World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 . They would be surprised to learn that none of these people came from Iraq or Iran . They do not know that 15 of the 19 came from Saudi Arabia -- a supposed ally of the United States . And they do not know that the Islamist warriors who brought chaos and destruction to Syria and Iraq are bankrolled in part by members of the Saudi and Qatari elite who have nothing to do with Iran . It has never been emphasized -- it is scarcely written in a way that might be noticeable even in our newspaper of record -- that Iran itself has carried the heaviest burden of the fight against IS .
Throughout his presidency , when speaking of Iran , Obama has mixed every expression of hope for improved relations with a measure of opprobrium . He has treated Iran as an exceptional offender against the laws of nations , a country that requires attention only in the cause of disarmament . He does this to assure the policy elite that he respects and can hum the familiar tunes . But this subservience to cliché is timid , unrealistic , and pragmatically ill advised . Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill did not denounce the Soviet Union when they took that country ’ s dictator , Joseph Stalin , as a partner in war in 1941 , though Stalin ’ s crimes exceeded anything attributable to the Iranian mullahs . Ritual denunciation of a necessary ally is a transparent absurdity . And in a democracy , it prevents ordinary people from arriving at an understanding of what is happening .
What are the odds that the neoconservatives and the Republicans whose policy they manage will succeed in aborting the P5+1 nuclear deal ? One can take some encouragement from the last comparably ambitious effort at rapprochement with an enemy : the conversations between President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet head of state Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik , Washington , and Moscow in 1986 , 1987 , and 1988 . At the same time , one ought to be forewarned by the way that unexpected change of course was greeted . The neoconservative cult was just forming then . Some of its early leaders like Richard Perle had positions in the Reagan administration , and they were unanimously hostile to the talks that would yield the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty ( INF ) of 1988 . The agreement set out the terms for the destruction of 2,611 missiles , capable of delivering 4,000 warheads -- the biggest step in lowering the risk of nuclear war since the Test Ban Treaty championed by President Kennedy and passed in late 1963 .
But as James Mann recounted in The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan -- a narrative of the anticommunist president ’ s surprising late turn in foreign policy -- all of Reagan ’ s diplomatic efforts were deeply disapproved at the time , not only by the neoconservative hotheads but by those masters of the “ diplomatic breakthrough , ” former President Richard Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger ; by the most widely quoted columnists of the right , George Will and William Safire ; and by Timemagazine , which ran a story titled “ Has Reagan Gone Soft ? ” The Reagan-Gorbachev talks were looked upon with suspicion , too , by “ realists ” and “ moderates ” of the political and security establishment , including Robert Gates and then-Vice President George H.W . Bush . Why Gates ? Because he was deputy director of the CIA and the Agency was thoroughly convinced that Soviet Russia and its leadership could never change . Why Bush ? Because he was already running for president .
The political and media establishment of that moment was startled by the change that President Reagan first signaled in 1986 , as startled as today ’ s establishment has been by the signing of the P5+1 agreement . This was the same Ronald Reagan who in 1983 had called the Soviet Union “ an evil empire. ” At the end of his visit to Moscow in June 1988 , Reagan was asked by the ABC News reporter Sam Donaldson , “ Do you still think you ’ re in an evil empire , Mr. President ? ”
“ No , ” Reagan replied . “ I was talking about another time and another era. ” And he stuck to that answer at a press conference the next day , adding : “ I think that a great deal of [ the change ] is due to the General Secretary , who I have found different than previous Soviet leaders ... A large part of it is Mr. Gorbachev as a leader . ”
By 1987 , Reagan ’ s popularity had hit a low of 47 % -- largely because of the Iran-Contra scandal -- but he still retained his reputation as the most irreproachable defender of the West against world communism . Obama for his part has done everything he could -- short of emulating the invade-and-occupy strategy of Bush -- to maintain U.S. force projection in the Middle East in a manner to which Washington has become accustomed since 9/11 . He doubtless believes in this policy , and he has surrounded himself with adepts of “ humanitarian war ” ; but he clearly also calculated that a generous ration of conformity would protect him when he tried for his own breakthrough in negotiations with Iran .
In the end , Reagan got a 93-5 vote in the Senate for his nuclear treaty with the Soviet Union . Obama is hoping for much less -- a vote of less than two thirds of that body opposed to the Iran settlement . But he is confronted by the full-scale hostility of a Republican party with a new character and with financial backing of a new kind .
The U.S. military and security establishment has sided with the president . And though the fact is little known here , so have the vast majority of Israelis who can speak with any authority on issues of defense and security . Even the president of Israel , Reuven Rivlin , has signaled his belief that Netanyahu ’ s interventions in American politics are wrong . Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak has advised that , however reluctantly , Israel should accept the nuclear agreement and forge an understanding with the U.S. about what to do in case of its violation . To this remarkable consensus should be added the public letter -- signed by 29 American scientists , many of them deeply involved in nuclear issues , including six recipients of the Nobel Prize -- which vouches for the stringency of the agreement and praises the “ unprecedented ” rigor of the 24-day cap on Iranian delays for site inspection : an interval so short ( as no one knows better than these scientists ) that successful concealment of traces of nuclear activity becomes impossible .
Two other public letters supporting the nuclear deal have been notable . The first was signed by former U.S. diplomats endorsing the agreement unambiguously , among them Ryan Crocker , the American ambassador to Iraq after 2003 ; Nicholas Burns , who negotiated with Iran for the younger Bush ; and Daniel Kurtzer , a former ambassador to Israel and Egypt who served under both President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush . A further letter carried the personal and institutional authority of dozens of retired admirals and generals . So close an approach to unanimity on the benefits of an agreement among the U.S. military , diplomatic , and scientific communities has seldom been achieved . Even President Reagan could not claim this degree of support by qualified judges when he submitted the INF treaty to the Senate .
Such endorsements ought to represent a substantial cause for hope . But Obama ’ s supporters would be hard pressed to call the contest a draw on television and radio . The neoconservatives -- and the Republicans channeling them -- are once again working with boundless energy . Careers are being built on this fight , as in the case of Senator Tom Cotton , and more than onepresidential candidacy has been staked on it .
On the day of Obama ’ s speech , even a relatively informed talk show host like Charlie Rose allowed his coverage to slant sharply against the agreement . His four guests were the Haaretz reporter Chemi Shalev ; the Daily Beastcolumnist Jonathan Alter ; the former State Department official and president of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass ; and the neoconservative venture capitalist , Mark Dubowitz , who has come to be treated as an expert on the nuclear policies and government of Iran .
Haass , passionately opposed to the agreement , said that the president ’ s speech had been “ way over the top , ” and hoped Congress would correct its “ clear flaws. ” Shalev rated the speech honest and “ bracing ” but thought it would leave many in the Jewish community “ offended. ” Dubowitz spoke of Iran as a perfidious nation that ought to be subjected to relentless and ever-increasing penalties . His solution : “ empower the next president to go back and renegotiate. ” Jonathan Alter alone defended the agreement .
By now , the active participants in mainstream commentary on the War on Terror all have a history , and one can learn a good deal by looking back . Haass , for example , a pillar of the foreign policy establishment , worked in the State Department under Bush and Cheney and made no public objection to the Iraq War . Dubowitz has recently co-authored several articles with Reuel Marc Gerecht , a leading propagandist for the 2003 invasion of Iraq . In acharacteristic piece in the Wall Street Journal last November , Gerecht and Dubowitz argued that the P5+1 negotiations opened a path to a nuclear bomb for Iran . President Obama , they said , was too weak and trapped by his own errors to explore any alternatives , but there were three “ scenarios ” that a wiser and stronger president might consider . First , “ the White House could give up on diplomacy and preemptively strike Iran ’ s nuclear sites ” ; second , “ the administration could give up on the current talks and default back to sanctions ” ; third , “ new , even more biting sanctions could be enacted , causing Tehran considerable pain. ” The range of advisable policy , for Gerecht and Dubowitz , begins with “ crippling sanctions ” and ends with a war of aggression .
These scenarios typify the neoconservative “ options. ” Writing on his own inthe Atlantic in June 2013 , Dubowitz informed American readers that there was nothing to celebrate in the Iranian presidential election that brought to power the apparently rational and moderate Hassan Rouhani . “ A loyalist of Iran 's supreme leader and a master of nuclear deceit , ” Rouhani , as interpreted by Dubowitz , is a false friend whose new authority “ does n't get us any closer to stopping Iran 's nuclear drive . ”
Consider Gerecht in his solo flights and you can see what made the president say that these are the people who gave us the Iraq War . They were as sure then about the good that would follow the bombing and invasion of that country as they are now about the benefits of attacking Iran . Indeed , Gerecht has the distinction of having called for an attack on Iran even before the official launch of the Bush strategy on Iraq .
It is said that Dick Cheney ’ s August 26 , 2002 , speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars marked the first formal description of the War on Terror offered by a U.S. leader to American citizens . But Gerecht , a former CIA specialist on the Middle East , stole a march on the vice president . In theWeekly Standard of August 6 , 2002 , under the title “ Regime Change in Iran ? , ” he declared his belief that President Bush was the possessor of a “ revolutionary edge and appeal ... in the Middle East. ” The younger Bush had
“ sliced across national borders and civilizational divides with an unqualified assertion of a moral norm . The president declared , ‘ The people of Iran want the same freedoms , human rights , and opportunities as people around the world. ’ America will stand ‘ alongside people everywhere determined to build a world of freedom , dignity , and tolerance . ’ ”
The analyst Gerecht took up where the evangelist Bush left off : the relevant country to attack in August 2002 -- on behalf of its people of course -- was Iran . Gerecht had no doubt that
“ the Iranian people overwhelmingly view clerical rule as fundamentally illegitimate . The heavily Westernized clerics of Iran 's religious establishment -- and these mullahs are on both sides of the so-called 'moderate-conservative ' split -- know perfectly well that the Persian word azadi , ‘ freedom , ’ is perhaps the most evocative word in the language now ... Azadi has also become indissolubly associated with the United States . ”
This was the way the neoconservatives were already writing and thinking back in August 2002 . It is hard to know which is more astounding , the show of philological virtuosity or the self-assurance regarding the advisability of war against a nation of 70 million .
General prognostications , however , are never enough for the neoconservatives , and Gerecht in 2002 enumerated the specific benefits of disorder in Iraq and Iran :
“ An American invasion [ of Iraq ] could possibly provoke riots in Iran -- simultaneous uprisings in major cities that would simply be beyond the scope of regime-loyal specialized riot-control units . The army or the Revolutionary Guard Corps would have to be pulled into service in large numbers , and that 's when things could get interesting . ”
That was how he had it scored . Bush , the voice of freedom , would be adored as a benevolent emperor at a distance :
“ President Bush , of course , does n't need National Iranian Television broadcasts to beam his message into the Islamic Republic . Everything he says moves at light speed through the country . The president just needs to keep talking about freedom being the birthright of Muslim peoples . ”
Such was the neoconservative recipe for democracy in the Middle East : beam the words of George W. Bush to people everywhere , invade Iraq , and spark a democratic uprising in Iran ( assisted if necessary by U.S. bombs and soldiers ) .
For a final glimpse of the same “ mindset , ” look closely at Gerecht ’ s advice on Syria in June 2014 . Writing again in the Weekly Standard , he deprecated the very idea of getting help from Iran in the fight against the Islamic State . “ The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Enemy ” declares the title of the piece , and the article makes the same point with a minimal reliance on facts . Sunni terrorists are portrayed as impetuous youngsters who naturally go too far , but it is too early to gauge their trajectory : the changes they bring may not ultimately be uncongenial to American interest . The Shiite masterminds of Iran , on the other hand , have long ago attained full maturity and will never change . Gerecht ’ s hope , last summer , was that substantial Iranian casualties in a war against IS would lead to the spontaneous uprising that failed to materialize in 2003 .
“ It is possible that the present Sunni-Shiite conflict could , if the Iranian body count rises and too much national treasure is spent , produce shock waves that fundamentally weaken the clerical regime ... Things could get violent inside the Islamic Republic . ”
The vision underlying this policy amounts to selective or strategic tolerance of al-Qaeda and IS for the sake of destroying Iran .
How can such opinions be contested in American politics ? The answer will have to come from what remains of the potential opposition party in the war on terror . Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been a remarkable exception , but for the most part the Democrats are preoccupied with domestic policy . If almost two-thirds of Congress today is poised to vote against the Iran settlement , this embarrassment is the result of years of systematic neglect . Sherrod Brown , Elizabeth Warren , Dick Durbin , Ron Wyden , Tammy Baldwin , and a few others have the talent to lead an opposition to a pursuit of the war on terror on the neoconservative plan , but to have any effect they would have to speak up regularly on foreign policy .
Meanwhile , the Republican Party and its billionaire bankrollers are playing the long game on Iran . They would like to gain the two-thirds majority to override Obama ’ s veto of a Congressional vote against the nuclear agreement , but they do not really expect that to happen . The survival of any agreement , however , depends not only on its approval but on its legitimation . Their hope is to depress public support for the P5+1 deal so much that the next president and members of the next Congress would require extraordinary courage to persist with American participation .
In the Foreign Affairs column mentioned earlier , Daniel Levy concluded that the long game is also Benjamin Netanyahu ’ s strategy :
” Netanyahu is going for a twofer -- if he loses on the veto-proof super majority in Congress , he can still succeed in keeping the Iran deal politically controversial and fragile and prevent any further détente with Iran . The hope , in this case , is that the next U.S. administration can resume the status quo ante in January 2017 . ”
What we are seeing , then , is not simply a concentrated effort that will end with the vote by the Senate in September on the P5+1 nuclear deal . It is the earliest phase of a lobbying campaign intended to usher in a Republican president of appropriate views in January 2017 .
One may recognize that the money is there for such a long-term drive and yet still wonder at the virulence of the campaign to destroy Iran . What exactly allows the war party to keep on as they do ? Within Israel , the cause is a political theology that obliges its believers to fight preemptive wars without any end in sight in order to guard against enemies who have opposed the existence of the Jewish state ever since its creation . This is a defensive fear that responds to an irrefutable historical reality . The neoconservatives and the better informed among their Republican followers are harder to grasp -- harder anyway until you realize that , for them , we are Rome and the Republican Party is the cradle of future American emperors , praetors , and proconsuls .
“ Ideology , ” as the political essayist and Czech dissident Vaclav Havel once wrote , is “ the bridge of excuses ” a government offers to the people it rules . Between 2001 and 2009 , the U.S. government was run by neoconservatives ; they had a fair shot and the public judgment went against them ; but in a climate of resurgent confusion about the Middle East , they have come a long way toward rebuilding their bridge . They are zealots but also prudent careerists , and the combination of money and revived propaganda may succeed in blurring many unhappy memories . Nor can they be accused of insincerity . When a theorist at a neoconservative think tank , the Foundation for Defense of Democracies or the American Enterprise Institute , affirms that democracy is what the Iranian people will have as soon as the U.S. cripples the resources of that country , he surely believes what he is saying . The projection seems as true to them now as it was in 2002 , 2007 , and 2010 , as true as it will be in 2017 when a new president , preferably another young man of “ spirit ” like George W. Bush , succeeds the weak and deplorable Barack Obama . For such people , the battle is never over , and there is always another war ahead . They will push until they are stopped .","“We’re going to push and push until some larger force makes us stop.”

David Addington, the legal adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, made that declaration to Jack Goldsmith of the Office of Legal Counsel in the months after September 11, 2001. Goldsmith would later recall that Cheney and Addington were the first people he had ever met of a certain kind: “Cheney is not subtle, and he has never hidden the ball. The amazing thing is that he does what he says. Relentlessness is a quality I saw in him and Addington that I never saw before in my life.”

Goldsmith did not consider himself an adversary of Cheney and Addington. He probably shared many of their political views. What shocked him was their confidence in a set of secret laws and violent policies that could destroy innocent lives and warp the Constitution. The neoconservatives -- the opinion-makers and legislative pedagogues who since 2001 have justified the Cheney-Bush policies -- fit the same description. They are relentless, they push until they are stopped, and thus far they have never been stopped for long.

The campaign for the Iraq war of 2003, the purest example of their handiwork, began with a strategy memorandum in 1996, so it is fair to say that they have been pitching to break up the Middle East for a full two decades. But fortune played them a nasty trick with the signing of the nuclear agreement between the P5+1 powers and Iran. War and the prospect of war have been the source of their undeniable importance. If the Iran nuclear deal attains legitimacy, much of their power will slip through their fingers. The imperialist idealism that drives their ventures from day to day will be cheated of the enemy it cannot live without.

Iran might then become just one more unlucky country -- authoritarian and cruelly oppressive but an object of persuasion and not the focus of a never-ending threat of force. The neoconservatives are enraged and their response has been feverish: if they were an individual, you would say that he was a danger to himself and others. They still get plenty of attention and airtime, but the main difference between 2003 and 2015 is the absence of a president who obeys them -- something that has only served to sharpen their anger.

This was the first such extended explanation of a foreign policy decision in his presidency, and it lacked even an ounce of inspirational fluff. It was, in fact, the first of his utterances not likely to be remembered for its “eloquence,” because it merits the higher praise of good sense. It has been predictably denounced in some quarters as stiff, unkind, ungenerous, and “over the top.”

Obama began by speaking of the ideology that incited and justified the Iraq War of 2003. He called it a “mindset,” and the word was appropriate -- suggesting a pair of earphones around a head that prevents us from hearing any penetrating noise from the external world. Starting in the summer of 2002, Americans heard a voice that said: Bomb, invade, occupy Iraq! And do the same to other countries! For the sake of our sanity, Obama explained, we had to take off those earphones:

“We had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place. It was a mindset characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy; a mindset that put a premium on unilateral U.S. action over the painstaking work of building international consensus; a mindset that exaggerated threats beyond what the intelligence supported. Leaders did not level with the American people about the costs of war, insisting that we could easily impose our will on a part of the world with a profoundly different culture and history.

Paul Bremer, for mismanaging the occupation that followed the invasion; others continue to nurse the fantastic theory that Saddam Hussein really was in possession of nuclear weapons but somehow smuggled them across the border to Syria and fooled both U.S. reconnaissance teams and the U.N. inspectors; still others maintain that Shiite militias and weaponry dispatched to Iraq from Iran were the chief culprits in the disaster of the postwar insurgency.

Bear in mind that these opinion-makers, in 2003, hardly understood the difference between Shiite and Sunni in the country they wanted to invade. To put the blame now on Iran betrays a genius for circular reasoning. Since all Shia militias are allied by religion with Iran, it can be argued that Iraq was not destroyed by a catastrophic war of choice whose effects set the region on fire. No: the United States under Bush and Cheney was an unpresuming superpower doing its proper work, bringing peace and democracy to one of the dark places of the earth by means of a clean, fast, “surgical” war. In 2004 and 2005, just as in 2015, it was Iran that caused the trouble.

Simple Facts That Are Not Known

Because the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has scorned the nuclear deal without any attention to detail, the president felt compelled in his speech to recognize candidly the difference of national interest that exists between Israel and the United States. Though we are allies, he said, we are two different countries, and he left his listeners to draw the necessary inference: it is not possible for two countries (any more than two persons) to be at once different and the same. Obama went on to connect the nations in question to this premise of international politics:

“I believe [the terms of the agreement] are in America’s interest and Israel’s interest. And as president of the United States, it would be an abrogation of my constitutional duty to act against my best judgment simply because it causes temporary friction with a dear friend and ally.”

The last affirmation is critical. A president takes an oath to “preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States” -- that is, to attend to the interest of his own country and not another.

The danger of playing favorites in the world of nations, with a partiality that knows no limits, was a main topic of George Washington’s great Farewell Address. “Permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others, should be excluded,” said Washington, because

“a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification.”

There are Americans today who submit to a ruling passion that favors uniquely the interests of Israel, and the president had them in mind when he invoked his duties under the Constitution toward the only country whose framework of laws and institutions he had sworn to uphold. Genuine respect for another democracy formed part of his thinking here. Not only was Obama not elected to support Netanyahu’s idea of America’s interest, he was also not elected by Israelis to support his own idea of Israel’s interest.

In a recent commentary in Foreign Affairs, the prominent Israeli journalist and former government adviser Daniel Levy pointed out a fact that is not much remembered today regarding Netanyahu’s continuous effort to sabotage negotiations with Iran. It was the Israeli prime minister who initially demanded that nuclear negotiations be pursued on a separate track from any agreement about the trade or sale of conventional weapons. He chose that path because he was certain it would cause negotiations to collapse. The gambit having failed, he now makes the lifting of sanctions on conventional weaponry a significant objection to the “bad deal” in Vienna.

Obama concluded his argument by saying that “alternatives to military action will have been exhausted if we reject a hard-won diplomatic solution that the world almost unanimously supports. So let’s not mince words. The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy or some form of war -- maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.” A measured statement and demonstrably true.

But you would never come within hailing distance of this truth if you listened to the numbers of Congressional Republicans who repeat the neoconservative watchwords and their accompanying digests of the recent history of the Middle East. They run through recitations of the dramatis personae of the war on terror with the alacrity of trained seals. Israel lives in a “dangerous neighborhood.” Islamists are “knocking on our door” and “looking for gaps in the border with Mexico.” Iran is “the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in the world.” Barack Obama is “an appeaser” and “it’s five minutes to midnightin Munich.” Elected officials who walk on two legs in the twenty-first century are not embarrassed to say these things without the slightest idea of their provenance.

If there was a fault in the president’s explanation of his policy, it lay in some things he omitted to say. When you are educating a people who have been proselytized, as Americans have been, by a political cult for the better part of two decades, nothing should be taken for granted. Most Americans do not know that the fanatical Islamists, al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, the Islamic State (IS) -- the active and destructive revolutionary force in the greater Middle East at the moment -- are called Sunni Muslims. Nor do they know that the Shia Muslims who govern Iran and who support the government of Syria have never attacked the United States.

To say it as simply as it should be said: the Shiites and Sunnis are different sects, and the Shiites of Iran are fighting against the same enemies the U.S. is fighting in Syria and elsewhere. Again, most Americans who get their information from miscellaneous online scraps have no idea that exclusively Sunni fanatics made up the force of hijackers who struck the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. They would be surprised to learn that none of these people came from Iraq or Iran. They do not know that 15 of the 19 came from Saudi Arabia -- a supposed ally of the United States. And they do not know that the Islamist warriors who brought chaos and destruction to Syria and Iraq are bankrolled in part by members of the Saudi and Qatari elite who have nothing to do with Iran. It has never been emphasized -- it is scarcely written in a way that might be noticeable even in our newspaper of record -- that Iran itself has carried the heaviest burden of the fight against IS.

Throughout his presidency, when speaking of Iran, Obama has mixed every expression of hope for improved relations with a measure of opprobrium. He has treated Iran as an exceptional offender against the laws of nations, a country that requires attention only in the cause of disarmament. He does this to assure the policy elite that he respects and can hum the familiar tunes. But this subservience to cliché is timid, unrealistic, and pragmatically ill advised. Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill did not denounce the Soviet Union when they took that country’s dictator, Joseph Stalin, as a partner in war in 1941, though Stalin’s crimes exceeded anything attributable to the Iranian mullahs. Ritual denunciation of a necessary ally is a transparent absurdity. And in a democracy, it prevents ordinary people from arriving at an understanding of what is happening.

Nuclear Deals and Their Critics, Then and Now

What are the odds that the neoconservatives and the Republicans whose policy they manage will succeed in aborting the P5+1 nuclear deal? One can take some encouragement from the last comparably ambitious effort at rapprochement with an enemy: the conversations between President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet head of state Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Washington, and Moscow in 1986, 1987, and 1988. At the same time, one ought to be forewarned by the way that unexpected change of course was greeted. The neoconservative cult was just forming then. Some of its early leaders like Richard Perle had positions in the Reagan administration, and they were unanimously hostile to the talks that would yield the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) of 1988. The agreement set out the terms for the destruction of 2,611 missiles, capable of delivering 4,000 warheads -- the biggest step in lowering the risk of nuclear war since the Test Ban Treaty championed by President Kennedy and passed in late 1963.

But as James Mann recounted in The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan -- a narrative of the anticommunist president’s surprising late turn in foreign policy -- all of Reagan’s diplomatic efforts were deeply disapproved at the time, not only by the neoconservative hotheads but by those masters of the “diplomatic breakthrough,” former President Richard Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; by the most widely quoted columnists of the right, George Will and William Safire; and by Timemagazine, which ran a story titled “Has Reagan Gone Soft?” The Reagan-Gorbachev talks were looked upon with suspicion, too, by “realists” and “moderates” of the political and security establishment, including Robert Gates and then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. Why Gates? Because he was deputy director of the CIA and the Agency was thoroughly convinced that Soviet Russia and its leadership could never change. Why Bush? Because he was already running for president.

The political and media establishment of that moment was startled by the change that President Reagan first signaled in 1986, as startled as today’s establishment has been by the signing of the P5+1 agreement. This was the same Ronald Reagan who in 1983 had called the Soviet Union “an evil empire.” At the end of his visit to Moscow in June 1988, Reagan was asked by the ABC News reporter Sam Donaldson, “Do you still think you’re in an evil empire, Mr. President?”

“No,” Reagan replied. “I was talking about another time and another era.” And he stuck to that answer at a press conference the next day, adding: “I think that a great deal of [the change] is due to the General Secretary, who I have found different than previous Soviet leaders... A large part of it is Mr. Gorbachev as a leader.”

By 1987, Reagan’s popularity had hit a low of 47% -- largely because of the Iran-Contra scandal -- but he still retained his reputation as the most irreproachable defender of the West against world communism. Obama for his part has done everything he could -- short of emulating the invade-and-occupy strategy of Bush -- to maintain U.S. force projection in the Middle East in a manner to which Washington has become accustomed since 9/11. He doubtless believes in this policy, and he has surrounded himself with adepts of “humanitarian war”; but he clearly also calculated that a generous ration of conformity would protect him when he tried for his own breakthrough in negotiations with Iran.

In the end, Reagan got a 93-5 vote in the Senate for his nuclear treaty with the Soviet Union. Obama is hoping for much less -- a vote of less than two thirds of that body opposed to the Iran settlement. But he is confronted by the full-scale hostility of a Republican party with a new character and with financial backing of a new kind.

The U.S. military and security establishment has sided with the president. And though the fact is little known here, so have the vast majority of Israelis who can speak with any authority on issues of defense and security. Even the president of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, has signaled his belief that Netanyahu’s interventions in American politics are wrong. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak has advised that, however reluctantly, Israel should accept the nuclear agreement and forge an understanding with the U.S. about what to do in case of its violation. To this remarkable consensus should be added the public letter -- signed by 29 American scientists, many of them deeply involved in nuclear issues, including six recipients of the Nobel Prize -- which vouches for the stringency of the agreement and praises the “unprecedented” rigor of the 24-day cap on Iranian delays for site inspection: an interval so short (as no one knows better than these scientists) that successful concealment of traces of nuclear activity becomes impossible.

Two other public letters supporting the nuclear deal have been notable. The first was signed by former U.S. diplomats endorsing the agreement unambiguously, among them Ryan Crocker, the American ambassador to Iraq after 2003; Nicholas Burns, who negotiated with Iran for the younger Bush; and Daniel Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Israel and Egypt who served under both President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. A further letter carried the personal and institutional authority of dozens of retired admirals and generals. So close an approach to unanimity on the benefits of an agreement among the U.S. military, diplomatic, and scientific communities has seldom been achieved. Even President Reagan could not claim this degree of support by qualified judges when he submitted the INF treaty to the Senate.

Such endorsements ought to represent a substantial cause for hope. But Obama’s supporters would be hard pressed to call the contest a draw on television and radio. The neoconservatives -- and the Republicans channeling them -- are once again working with boundless energy. Careers are being built on this fight, as in the case of Senator Tom Cotton, and more than onepresidential candidacy has been staked on it.

On the day of Obama’s speech, even a relatively informed talk show host like Charlie Rose allowed his coverage to slant sharply against the agreement. His four guests were the Haaretz reporter Chemi Shalev; the Daily Beastcolumnist Jonathan Alter; the former State Department official and president of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass; and the neoconservative venture capitalist, Mark Dubowitz, who has come to be treated as an expert on the nuclear policies and government of Iran.

Haass, passionately opposed to the agreement, said that the president’s speech had been “way over the top,” and hoped Congress would correct its “clear flaws.” Shalev rated the speech honest and “bracing” but thought it would leave many in the Jewish community “offended.” Dubowitz spoke of Iran as a perfidious nation that ought to be subjected to relentless and ever-increasing penalties. His solution: “empower the next president to go back and renegotiate.” Jonathan Alter alone defended the agreement.

Planning to Attack Iran, 2002-2015

By now, the active participants in mainstream commentary on the War on Terror all have a history, and one can learn a good deal by looking back. Haass, for example, a pillar of the foreign policy establishment, worked in the State Department under Bush and Cheney and made no public objection to the Iraq War. Dubowitz has recently co-authored several articles with Reuel Marc Gerecht, a leading propagandist for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In acharacteristic piece in the Wall Street Journal last November, Gerecht and Dubowitz argued that the P5+1 negotiations opened a path to a nuclear bomb for Iran. President Obama, they said, was too weak and trapped by his own errors to explore any alternatives, but there were three “scenarios” that a wiser and stronger president might consider. First, “the White House could give up on diplomacy and preemptively strike Iran’s nuclear sites”; second, “the administration could give up on the current talks and default back to sanctions”; third, “new, even more biting sanctions could be enacted, causing Tehran considerable pain.” The range of advisable policy, for Gerecht and Dubowitz, begins with “crippling sanctions” and ends with a war of aggression.

These scenarios typify the neoconservative “options.” Writing on his own inthe Atlantic in June 2013, Dubowitz informed American readers that there was nothing to celebrate in the Iranian presidential election that brought to power the apparently rational and moderate Hassan Rouhani. “A loyalist of Iran's supreme leader and a master of nuclear deceit,” Rouhani, as interpreted by Dubowitz, is a false friend whose new authority “doesn't get us any closer to stopping Iran's nuclear drive.”

Consider Gerecht in his solo flights and you can see what made the president say that these are the people who gave us the Iraq War. They were as sure then about the good that would follow the bombing and invasion of that country as they are now about the benefits of attacking Iran. Indeed, Gerecht has the distinction of having called for an attack on Iran even before the official launch of the Bush strategy on Iraq.

It is said that Dick Cheney’s August 26, 2002, speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars marked the first formal description of the War on Terror offered by a U.S. leader to American citizens. But Gerecht, a former CIA specialist on the Middle East, stole a march on the vice president. In theWeekly Standard of August 6, 2002, under the title “Regime Change in Iran?,” he declared his belief that President Bush was the possessor of a “revolutionary edge and appeal... in the Middle East.” The younger Bush had

“sliced across national borders and civilizational divides with an unqualified assertion of a moral norm. The president declared, ‘The people of Iran want the same freedoms, human rights, and opportunities as people around the world.’ America will stand ‘alongside people everywhere determined to build a world of freedom, dignity, and tolerance.’”

The analyst Gerecht took up where the evangelist Bush left off: the relevant country to attack in August 2002 -- on behalf of its people of course -- was Iran. Gerecht had no doubt that

“the Iranian people overwhelmingly view clerical rule as fundamentally illegitimate. The heavily Westernized clerics of Iran's religious establishment -- and these mullahs are on both sides of the so-called 'moderate-conservative' split -- know perfectly well that the Persian word azadi, ‘freedom,’ is perhaps the most evocative word in the language now... Azadi has also become indissolubly associated with the United States.”

This was the way the neoconservatives were already writing and thinking back in August 2002. It is hard to know which is more astounding, the show of philological virtuosity or the self-assurance regarding the advisability of war against a nation of 70 million.

General prognostications, however, are never enough for the neoconservatives, and Gerecht in 2002 enumerated the specific benefits of disorder in Iraq and Iran:

“An American invasion [of Iraq] could possibly provoke riots in Iran -- simultaneous uprisings in major cities that would simply be beyond the scope of regime-loyal specialized riot-control units. The army or the Revolutionary Guard Corps would have to be pulled into service in large numbers, and that's when things could get interesting.”

That was how he had it scored. Bush, the voice of freedom, would be adored as a benevolent emperor at a distance:

“President Bush, of course, doesn't need National Iranian Television broadcasts to beam his message into the Islamic Republic. Everything he says moves at light speed through the country. The president just needs to keep talking about freedom being the birthright of Muslim peoples.”

Such was the neoconservative recipe for democracy in the Middle East: beam the words of George W. Bush to people everywhere, invade Iraq, and spark a democratic uprising in Iran (assisted if necessary by U.S. bombs and soldiers).

For a final glimpse of the same “mindset,” look closely at Gerecht’s advice on Syria in June 2014. Writing again in the Weekly Standard, he deprecated the very idea of getting help from Iran in the fight against the Islamic State. “The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Enemy” declares the title of the piece, and the article makes the same point with a minimal reliance on facts. Sunni terrorists are portrayed as impetuous youngsters who naturally go too far, but it is too early to gauge their trajectory: the changes they bring may not ultimately be uncongenial to American interest. The Shiite masterminds of Iran, on the other hand, have long ago attained full maturity and will never change. Gerecht’s hope, last summer, was that substantial Iranian casualties in a war against IS would lead to the spontaneous uprising that failed to materialize in 2003.

“It is possible that the present Sunni-Shiite conflict could, if the Iranian body count rises and too much national treasure is spent, produce shock waves that fundamentally weaken the clerical regime... Things could get violent inside the Islamic Republic.”

The vision underlying this policy amounts to selective or strategic tolerance of al-Qaeda and IS for the sake of destroying Iran.

Will the War on Terror Be Debated?

How can such opinions be contested in American politics? The answer will have to come from what remains of the potential opposition party in the war on terror. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been a remarkable exception, but for the most part the Democrats are preoccupied with domestic policy. If almost two-thirds of Congress today is poised to vote against the Iran settlement, this embarrassment is the result of years of systematic neglect. Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Dick Durbin, Ron Wyden, Tammy Baldwin, and a few others have the talent to lead an opposition to a pursuit of the war on terror on the neoconservative plan, but to have any effect they would have to speak up regularly on foreign policy.

Meanwhile, the Republican Party and its billionaire bankrollers are playing the long game on Iran. They would like to gain the two-thirds majority to override Obama’s veto of a Congressional vote against the nuclear agreement, but they do not really expect that to happen. The survival of any agreement, however, depends not only on its approval but on its legitimation. Their hope is to depress public support for the P5+1 deal so much that the next president and members of the next Congress would require extraordinary courage to persist with American participation.

In the Foreign Affairs column mentioned earlier, Daniel Levy concluded that the long game is also Benjamin Netanyahu’s strategy:

”Netanyahu is going for a twofer -- if he loses on the veto-proof super majority in Congress, he can still succeed in keeping the Iran deal politically controversial and fragile and prevent any further détente with Iran. The hope, in this case, is that the next U.S. administration can resume the status quo ante in January 2017.”

What we are seeing, then, is not simply a concentrated effort that will end with the vote by the Senate in September on the P5+1 nuclear deal. It is the earliest phase of a lobbying campaign intended to usher in a Republican president of appropriate views in January 2017.

One may recognize that the money is there for such a long-term drive and yet still wonder at the virulence of the campaign to destroy Iran. What exactly allows the war party to keep on as they do? Within Israel, the cause is a political theology that obliges its believers to fight preemptive wars without any end in sight in order to guard against enemies who have opposed the existence of the Jewish state ever since its creation. This is a defensive fear that responds to an irrefutable historical reality. The neoconservatives and the better informed among their Republican followers are harder to grasp -- harder anyway until you realize that, for them, we are Rome and the Republican Party is the cradle of future American emperors, praetors, and proconsuls.

“Ideology,” as the political essayist and Czech dissident Vaclav Havel once wrote, is “the bridge of excuses” a government offers to the people it rules. Between 2001 and 2009, the U.S. government was run by neoconservatives; they had a fair shot and the public judgment went against them; but in a climate of resurgent confusion about the Middle East, they have come a long way toward rebuilding their bridge. They are zealots but also prudent careerists, and the combination of money and revived propaganda may succeed in blurring many unhappy memories. Nor can they be accused of insincerity. When a theorist at a neoconservative think tank, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies or the American Enterprise Institute, affirms that democracy is what the Iranian people will have as soon as the U.S. cripples the resources of that country, he surely believes what he is saying. The projection seems as true to them now as it was in 2002, 2007, and 2010, as true as it will be in 2017 when a new president, preferably another young man of “spirit” like George W. Bush, succeeds the weak and deplorable Barack Obama. For such people, the battle is never over, and there is always another war ahead. They will push until they are stopped.",www.salon.com,left,S4fXHi5ae4jv1ga1

Max Hoffman , a national security expert at the liberal Center for American Progress , tweeted that “ Trump ’ s Syria decision is a huge mistake. ” Jonathan Schanzer , a leader at the conservative Foundation for Defense of Democracies , tweeted , “ Obama ’ s red line debacle was a dark day for American leadership in the Middle East . This is far worse . ”
The criticism , from both right- and left-leaning analysts and politicians , centers on two main themes .
First , ISIS isn ’ t actually defeated , as Trump claimed in his tweet Wednesday justifying the decision . Yes , they ’ ve lost nearly all the territory they once held , and their so-called “ caliphate ” has been dismantled — but the Pentagon estimates ISIS has as many as 17,100 fighters in Syria , and many have warned that if the US pulls out too soon , that could provide the extra space the group needs to make a comeback .
Second , withdrawing US troops from Syria essentially means that the US is handing over the country to Iran , which has thousands of proxy fighters there fighting in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime , to take back the largely liberated northeast while opening up a strategic channel to the Mediterranean .
Those are both serious concerns , and there is a legitimate worry about what withdrawal really says about America ’ s commitment to its Kurdish allies in Syria , who have been fighting ISIS alongside the US , and to the broader fight against both ISIS and Iran .
But these two arguments also overlook some very important realities . One is that while the 2,000 US troops in the country were certainly involved in the fight against ISIS , the bulk of the US military effort in Syria took the form of airstrikes , not ground troops . It ’ s unclear if those airstrikes will continue after US ground troops leave .
Another is that those 2,000 US ground troops were explicitly focused on the fight against ISIS , and were not doing much of anything to actually push back against Iran ’ s influence in the country .
So it ’ s not like the troop withdrawal will change the course of the Syrian civil war , severely impact the ISIS fight in the short term , or deter Russia and Iran from involving themselves in the country .
But the fact that people on pretty much all sides reacted so negatively to the troop withdrawal decision speaks to a much deeper issue : how hard it is for the US to extricate itself from military engagement abroad once it ’ s been started .
Judging from my TL , there is no one outside of the White House who agrees with the president 's decision to rapidly withdraw from Syria .
No one . — Bradley P. Moss ( @ BradMossEsq ) December 19 , 2018
Former Joint Chiefs chairman and Secretary of State Colin Powell is known for his famous phrase about America ’ s involvement in war : “ You break it , you own it. ” The meaning is simple : If the US becomes militarily involved somewhere , and especially if it overthrows a government , the situation becomes America ’ s problem .
He learned that lesson well during and after George W. Bush ’ s invasion of Iraq , which Powell at first championed .
And it ’ s proven true for the last two US presidents . Barack Obama desperately wanted the US to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . But he kept adding US troops to the Afghan fight and found himself severely criticized for withdrawing troops from Iraq , giving ISIS the space to grow and govern territory in the region . That barrage affected his decision not to strike Syria after the Assad regime dropped chemical weapons on hundreds of people in 2013 .
Trump , who has been very vocal at times about his skepticism of American military intervention abroad , still found himself increasing America ’ s troop presence in Afghanistan and in September authorizing the indefinite deployment of US armed forces in Syria — a decision he just reversed .
But now even staunch Trump allies can ’ t stomach the withdrawal .
“ It will be an Obama-like mistake made by the Trump Administration , “ Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) said in a Wednesday statement . “ An American withdrawal at this time would be a big win for ISIS , Iran , Bashar al Assad of Syria , and Russia . I fear it will lead to devastating consequences for our nation , the region , and throughout the world . ”
Trump ’ s opponents , of course , have also sharpened their knives . But it seems some are doing so less for partisan reasons than in support of America ’ s military commitment in Syria .
“ The President ’ s decision to withdraw troops from Syria is dangerous , premature and wholly inconsistent with the facts on the ground in Syria and our military ’ s advice , ” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D-NH ) , a member of the Senate ’ s Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees , said in a Wednesday statement .
In other words , Trump — as Obama before him — will never please the Washington commentariat or major political parties by withdrawing US troops from wars . In fact , it appears he could suffer politically for doing so .
That only incentivizes him and those after him to keep the US in the middle of foreign fights , even if it means keeping American men and women in harm ’ s way for no clear strategic reason .
The big lesson from today , then , is that American leaders need to think extremely hard about sending troops into war — because once they ’ re in , it becomes nearly impossible to pull them out without blowback .","To hear the outcry over President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw all US troops from Syria, one would think he’d just made the greatest strategic blunder in American history.

One is that while the 2,000 US troops in the country were certainly involved in the fight against ISIS, the bulk of the US military effort in Syria took the form of airstrikes, not ground troops. It’s unclear if those airstrikes will continue after US ground troops leave.

Another is that those 2,000 US ground troops were explicitly focused on the fight against ISIS, and were not doing much of anything to actually push back against Iran’s influence in the country.

So it’s not like the troop withdrawal will change the course of the Syrian civil war, severely impact the ISIS fight in the short term, or deter Russia and Iran from involving themselves in the country.

But the fact that people on pretty much all sides reacted so negatively to the troop withdrawal decision speaks to a much deeper issue: how hard it is for the US to extricate itself from military engagement abroad once it’s been started.

Judging from my TL, there is no one outside of the White House who agrees with the president's decision to rapidly withdraw from Syria.



No one. — Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) December 19, 2018

“You break it, you own it”

Former Joint Chiefs chairman and Secretary of State Colin Powell is known for his famous phrase about America’s involvement in war: “You break it, you own it.” The meaning is simple: If the US becomes militarily involved somewhere, and especially if it overthrows a government, the situation becomes America’s problem.

He learned that lesson well during and after George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq, which Powell at first championed.

And it’s proven true for the last two US presidents. Barack Obama desperately wanted the US to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But he kept adding US troops to the Afghan fight and found himself severely criticized for withdrawing troops from Iraq, giving ISIS the space to grow and govern territory in the region. That barrage affected his decision not to strike Syria after the Assad regime dropped chemical weapons on hundreds of people in 2013.

Trump, who has been very vocal at times about his skepticism of American military intervention abroad, still found himself increasing America’s troop presence in Afghanistan and in September authorizing the indefinite deployment of US armed forces in Syria — a decision he just reversed.

But now even staunch Trump allies can’t stomach the withdrawal.

“It will be an Obama-like mistake made by the Trump Administration,“ Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said in a Wednesday statement. “An American withdrawal at this time would be a big win for ISIS, Iran, Bashar al Assad of Syria, and Russia. I fear it will lead to devastating consequences for our nation, the region, and throughout the world.”

Trump’s opponents, of course, have also sharpened their knives. But it seems some are doing so less for partisan reasons than in support of America’s military commitment in Syria.

“The President’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria is dangerous, premature and wholly inconsistent with the facts on the ground in Syria and our military’s advice,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a member of the Senate’s Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, said in a Wednesday statement.

In other words, Trump — as Obama before him — will never please the Washington commentariat or major political parties by withdrawing US troops from wars. In fact, it appears he could suffer politically for doing so.

That only incentivizes him and those after him to keep the US in the middle of foreign fights, even if it means keeping American men and women in harm’s way for no clear strategic reason.

The big lesson from today, then, is that American leaders need to think extremely hard about sending troops into war — because once they’re in, it becomes nearly impossible to pull them out without blowback.

national_defense,Scientific American,1,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/back-in-business-nasa-is-set-to-return-to-human-spaceflight-with-historic-spacex-launch/,Back in Business: NASA Is Set to Return to Human Spaceflight with Historic SpaceX Launch,,Irene Klotz,"Editor ’ s Note ( 5/27/20 ) : Because of unfavorable weather conditions , the historic launch of two NASA astronauts on a SpaceX crew module and rocket has been postponed until Saturday , May 30 , at 3:22 P.M. Eastern time .
Barring poor weather or last-minute technical glitches , shortly after 4:30 P.M. Eastern time today , a spaceship carrying two crew members will blast off on a rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . The flight will be bound for the International Space Station ( ISS ) , but its true destination is the annals of space history : it will be the first time that U.S. astronauts have been launched from American soil since the final flight of the space shuttle program in 2011—and that anyone has flown to space using a commercially built crew capsule and rocket .
Much changed after humans last flew to space from the nation . Most obviously , the U.S. ’ s relations with Russia have frayed , although both countries have isolated their space program from politics . And they have continued a strong partnership to fly NASA astronauts to the ISS onboard Russian Soyuz rockets . Life-protecting pressurized suits have changed , too : The new flight ’ s two astronauts , NASA veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley , will not wear the fluorescent orange ensembles of the space shuttle era . Instead they will be clad in sleek , monochrome one-piece outfits that are lighter-weight , more maneuverable and much better looking . The suits , like the mission ’ s Crew Dragon capsule and reusable Falcon 9 rocket , were designed and manufactured by aerospace company SpaceX . Gone , too , are the old-fashioned “ Astrovans ” —souped-up motor homes that transferred NASA astronauts from crew quarters to the launchpad for most of the past half-century . To reach the rocket for this Demonstration Mission 2 ( Demo-2 ) test flight , Behnken and Hurley will ride in style within an all-electric Model X sport utility vehicle provided by SpaceX ’ s sister company Tesla .
Such is the new era of American spaceflight , in which the federal government seeks cheaper , safer and more reliable access to orbit not by directly building and operating fleets of spaceships and rockets but rather by spending tax dollars on launch services provided by private companies . All previous human spaceflight programs have been based on systems developed , owned and run by government space agencies . Now , via its Commercial Crew program—which is itself a follow-on to the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program initiated in the mid-2000s—NASA is instead buying seats and stowage on SpaceX assets . That strategy should free up funds for the agency to spend on other projects—deep-space exploration and transformative science missions—which presently remain out of reach for private enterprise .
The hope is that federal investment in low-cost , reliable and safe space transportation will spur rapid innovation and create entirely new opportunities for economic growth . The approach has an antecedent in the development of the commercial satellite industry , which , as of 2019 , is worth more than $ 277 billion , in large part because of initial phases of robust governmental financial support . “ The Commercial Crew program has been a great experiment by NASA to see if commercial companies can do this particular job , ” says Wayne Hale , a former shuttle program manager who now serves as a consultant at engineering firm Special Aerospace Services .
NASA has pumped more than $ 8.2 billion into the Commercial Crew program since its inception in 2010 . Most of those funds have gone to Boeing and SpaceX , which were each awarded development and flight-service contracts in 2014 . This commercial partnership approach , says NASA ’ s commercial spaceflight director Phil McAlister , has saved the agency some $ 20 billion to $ 30 billion that it would have had to otherwise spend developing new human-rated rockets and spacecraft under traditional contracting methods .
NASA chief Jim Bridenstine considers Demo-2 the final step in proving the success of a public-private partnership business model to drive down costs . “ It is going to enable us to not just go to the moon but to go sustainably , with reusable landers , to the surface of the moon , ” he said during a recent press conference . “ All of this , ultimately , is to get to Mars . ”
It took a while for SpaceX , founded and run by technology entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk , to learn how to work with NASA—and vice versa . But that relationship warmed considerably after a Falcon 9 rocket exploded during launch on June 28 , 2015 , destroying a cargo ship bound for the ISS . In the aftermath of that accident , SpaceX sought—and found—a strong technical shoulder to lean on at NASA .
“ At the beginning , there was a lot of learning on both sides—more so with SpaceX , because they were new to working with NASA , but even with Boeing , ” says Patricia Sanders , chair of NASA ’ s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel . “ This was a different way of defining requirements . They would propose standards but not necessarily in a way that NASA could digest . They ’ d send something over , NASA would send it back , and then they ’ d send it over again . They were really learning about each other . ”
For NASA , immersion in the tech start-up culture at SpaceX took some getting used to as well . “ You have the ability to learn quickly by being ‘ hardware-rich ’ —having lots of flightlike test articles , doing test after test and not having a big concern if you push on something [ when ] you don ’ t know if it ’ s going to work [ to ] see if it passes or fails , ” says NASA engineer John Posey , who oversees the Crew Dragon ’ s design and performance . “ Since it ’ s a partnership instead of a traditional contractor customer , where we own the design and we dictate what they do , we always try to stay away from saying , ‘ Oh , we ’ ve never done it that way before ’ or ‘ This way works better for us. ’ We try to take what we learned on [ the ] shuttle and other programs and apply that by saying , ‘ Here ’ s a pitfall you might want to check if you ’ re going to go that way ’ or something like that . ”
“ This also is the hardest we ’ ve ever worked in our NASA jobs , just to run at the pace of SpaceX , ” Posey adds . “ I feel like I ’ m young—I ’ m 39—but those guys , a lot of them are half my age , so they can really crank out a lot more work than I ’ m capable of keeping up with . ”
NASA ’ s Commercial Crew program has come a long way from its humble beginnings a decade ago , when the agency awarded $ 50 million of development contracts to five companies ( which did not include SpaceX ) . By September 2014 NASA ’ s confidence in the public-private partnership approach was sufficient for the agency to award SpaceX and Boeing space-taxi contracts worth a combined $ 6.8 billion . The hope was one or both companies would be ready to take over ferry flights from Russia for the ISS crew by the end of 2017 .
SpaceX and Boeing encountered technical stumbling blocks , pushing crewed flight tests to 2020 and 2021 , respectively . The former company had two accidents with the Falcon 9 rocket , including a launchpad explosion that prompted a redesign of part of the rocket ’ s pressurization system . Then , in April 2019—just a month after a milestone test flight of an uncrewed Dragon to the ISS—SpaceX suffered another setback : an explosion of a Dragon on a test stand in Florida during the setup for a static engine firing .
Meanwhile Boeing ’ s CST-100 Starliner has been grounded for software verification and quality-control upgrades following a botched orbital debut in December 2019 . A timing error prevented the capsule from reaching the space station , and the mission ended four days early . The company now plans to repeat the uncrewed flight test later this year . A crewed test with Boeing ’ s Christopher Ferguson and NASA ’ s Michael Fincke and Nicole Aunapu Mann will most likely follow in 2021 .
These delays are creating a staffing shortfall on the ISS , as NASA ’ s paid rides on Soyuz rockets come to an end . In May the agency reached an agreement with Russia to remove a cosmonaut from the upcoming October 2020 Soyuz launch to the ISS , freeing the seat for a NASA astronaut in case SpaceX and Boeing are further delayed . That arrangement would ensure that the ISS is still staffed by at least one U.S. crew member . November will mark 20 years of continuous human presence on the space station .
Despite the technical problems that have significantly slowed the pace of NASA ’ s Commercial Crew program , agency officials say such delays could pay off , ultimately serving to streamline the process of certifying the reusable vehicles for further operational missions once test flights are complete . The delays have also given individuals and organizations outside of NASA and its astronaut corps more time to devise ambitious spaceflight feats of their own that leverage the agency ’ s Commercial Crew investments . For instance , a plan exists for actor Tom Cruise to reach the ISS in a Dragon launched by a Falcon 9 as soon as next year , says Gwynne Shotwell , SpaceX ’ s president and chief operating officer .
SpaceX also has contracts with Axiom Space , which is developing a commercial module to be attached to the ISS , and with Space Adventures , which previously brokered eight tourist flights to the ISS onboard Russian Soyuz capsules . And Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa has put down a deposit for a charter flight around the moon on SpaceX ’ s next-generation Starship spacecraft , which is currently in development near Brownsville , Tex .
In April NASA decided to invest $ 135 million in Starship to see if the system can be used to transport two astronauts to the lunar surface in 2024 , an expedited schedule requested by the Trump administration . Like NASA , the moon as a destination is on SpaceX ’ s radar screens . But Musk founded the company to develop technologies needed to build and sustain a city on Mars . Demo-2 will be SpaceX ’ s 85th Falcon 9 launch and its first with people .
“ We wouldn ’ t be here without the prior work of NASA— ‘ standing on the shoulders of giants , ’ as the saying goes , ” Musk says . “ And we couldn ’ t have gotten to Starship without really going through the Dragon path . ”","Editor’s Note (5/27/20): Because of unfavorable weather conditions, the historic launch of two NASA astronauts on a SpaceX crew module and rocket has been postponed until Saturday, May 30, at 3:22 P.M.

Pelosi and other Democrats have been critical of Trump ’ s decision to conduct an airstrike in Iraq that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani , head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ' elite Quds Force , claiming he did not properly notify Congress in advance and warning about the risk of escalation in the region . Trump has also threatened additional action if Iran retaliates for Soleimani ’ s death .
TRUMP NOTIFIES CONGRESS OF WARNING AFTER LAWMAKERS SAID THEY WERE N'T INFORMED ABOUT SOLEIMANI IN ADVANCE
“ This week , the House will introduce and vote on a War Powers Resolution to limit the President ’ s military actions regarding Iran , ” Pelosi wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats , referring to a similar Senate resolution to be introduced by Sen.

Pelosi and other Democrats have been critical of Trump’s decision to conduct an airstrike in Iraq that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force, claiming he did not properly notify Congress in advance and warning about the risk of escalation in the region. Trump has also threatened additional action if Iran retaliates for Soleimani’s death.

“This week, the House will introduce and vote on a War Powers Resolution to limit the President’s military actions regarding Iran,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats, referring to a similar Senate resolution to be introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. “It reasserts Congress’s long-established oversight responsibilities by mandating that if no further Congressional action is taken, the Administration’s military hostilities with regard to Iran cease within 30 days.”

national_defense,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/05/09/defiant-iran-test-fires-ballistic-missile/84130912/,Iran disputes report of missile test,2016-05-09,,"Iran 's defense minister on Monday denied at least parts of a report in the Iranian media that the military recently test-fired a ballistic missile with pinpoint accuracy at a range of 1,250 miles — a range that would include Israel and several other Middle East nations .
Brigadier General Ali Abdollahi , the Iranian military 's deputy chief of staff , told Iran 's Tasnim news agency that Iran fired the test missile two weeks ago and that it was accurate to within 25 feet , which he described as zero error .
`` We can guide this ballistic missile , '' he told Tasnim . Iran has previously asserted it has such missile capability .
Abdollahi declined to provide further details on the missile or the test . Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan later denied that a missile test of that distance took place . He also told Iran 's Islamic Republic News Agency that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are conducting a propaganda campaign to make the world believe Iran 's missiles are not for defensive purposes .
Firas Abi-Ali , an analyst for the consulting firm IHS Country Risk , said Iran 's government must pursue its missile program to appease hardliners after striking a deal on its nuclear program with the West .
`` Given there technical restrictions , the missile program makes a lot of sense for them , '' Abi-Ali told ███ . `` At the end of the day , they are beholden to the hardliners and the IRGC ( revolutionary guard ) . The elected government is not the most powerful actor in Iran . ''
Last month , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei stressed the need for boosting Iran ’ s defense capabilities , saying negotiations without a robust defense could weaken Iran 's position and force it to yield to countries posing threats .
Two months ago , Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles , one of them with the phrase `` Israel should be wiped off the Earth '' written on it in Hebrew . Iranian officials say the phrase was added by workers on the ground and was not a decision made by higher-level officials . Iran also conducted a missile test in November .
Iran has rejected claims that missile tests violate the nuclear agreement it reached with the U.S. and other nations or a United Nations resolution on missile testing , describing its missiles as conventional armaments for `` legitimate defense '' and not designed for carrying nuclear warheads .
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the department was aware of the reports . She said that , if a launch was confirmed , the U.S. would take up the issue with the U.N .
The nuclear deal , which took effect in January , does not directly address missile restrictions . The U.N.

Iran's defense minister on Monday denied at least parts of a report in the Iranian media that the military recently test-fired a ballistic missile with pinpoint accuracy at a range of 1,250 miles — a range that would include Israel and several other Middle East nations.

Brigadier General Ali Abdollahi, the Iranian military's deputy chief of staff, told Iran's Tasnim news agency that Iran fired the test missile two weeks ago and that it was accurate to within 25 feet, which he described as zero error.

""We can guide this ballistic missile,"" he told Tasnim. Iran has previously asserted it has such missile capability.

Abdollahi declined to provide further details on the missile or the test. Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan later denied that a missile test of that distance took place. He also told Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are conducting a propaganda campaign to make the world believe Iran's missiles are not for defensive purposes.

Iran: Missile tests don't violate nuclear agreement, U.N. resolution

Firas Abi-Ali, an analyst for the consulting firm IHS Country Risk, said Iran's government must pursue its missile program to appease hardliners after striking a deal on its nuclear program with the West.

""Given there technical restrictions, the missile program makes a lot of sense for them,"" Abi-Ali told USA TODAY. ""At the end of the day, they are beholden to the hardliners and the IRGC (revolutionary guard). The elected government is not the most powerful actor in Iran.""

Last month, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei stressed the need for boosting Iran’s defense capabilities, saying negotiations without a robust defense could weaken Iran's position and force it to yield to countries posing threats.

Two months ago, Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles, one of them with the phrase ""Israel should be wiped off the Earth"" written on it in Hebrew. Iranian officials say the phrase was added by workers on the ground and was not a decision made by higher-level officials. Iran also conducted a missile test in November.

Iran has rejected claims that missile tests violate the nuclear agreement it reached with the U.S. and other nations or a United Nations resolution on missile testing, describing its missiles as conventional armaments for ""legitimate defense"" and not designed for carrying nuclear warheads.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the department was aware of the reports. She said that, if a launch was confirmed, the U.S. would take up the issue with the U.N.

The nuclear deal, which took effect in January, does not directly address missile restrictions. The U.N. Security Council lifted its ban on such testing when the deal was struck, but passed a resolution that ""calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles ... including launches using such ballistic missile technology.""

The U.S., Britain, France and Germany were among nations decrying the March tests. The Security Council's Panel of Experts on Iran later said in a confidential report, first reported by Reuters, that the March launches did violate the U.N. resolution.

The tests in March involved two types of ballistic missiles during “Might of Velayat” military drills, Tasnim said. (Velayat is Persian for ""governance of the jurist."")

Why the U.S. wants them in its arsenal again.,2020-02-25,Anna Mulrine Grobe,"For now , the 1997 land mine treaty that prohibits use and development is “ surviving and thriving , ” says Mary Wareham of Human Rights Watch . “ 164 countries are signatories , and there have been more every year since the treaty was created . They ’ re not going to tolerate any land mine use , and we ’ re not going to stop the monitoring that we do . ”
Human rights groups and some former military officers are among those who are not as convinced that land mines are necessary to bolster American defense . As recently as 2016 , an average of 23 people were killed or injured every day by land mines , with 78 % of victims being civilians .
In late January , the Trump administration rescinded a U.S. prohibition against anti-personnel mines , citing their power as a deterrent . In addition , the Pentagon can now “ turn to our industries to start developing land mines that are even more reliable , ” said acting Assistant Secretary of Defense Victorino Mercado .
With an estimated failure rate of 6 in 1 million , “ smart ” land mines are supposed to deactivate after a period of time . It ’ s a safety feature that the U.S. Defense Department highlights as one reason land mines should be back on the table .
After being banned from planting land mines since 2014 , the United States military can now use them once again , and Victorino Mercado admits it ’ s “ a very emotional subject ” – including within the halls of the Pentagon .
That said , “ we ’ re not talking about what you see on TV , ” added Mr. Mercado , the acting assistant secretary of defense for strategy , plans , and capabilities , during a Pentagon briefing last month . The prohibitions against the old tripwire and pressure-plate land mines that have “ really wreaked havoc ” remain in place , and any newly deployed land mines must have safeguards to protect civilians . “ If we were n't comfortable ... that we can mitigate the risk to our forces and ensure that we minimize civilian casualties , then we would n't probably put this policy in place . ”
It ’ s that “ probably ” that has prompted unease among some former U.S. military generals and an outcry from human rights groups . Their concerns hinge in part on just how effective the “ safety valves ” for modern land mines are . Even granting technological advances , opponents argue that they don ’ t justify bringing back weapons of war that nonetheless remain indiscriminate .
As recently as 2016 , an average of 23 people were killed or injured every day by land mines , according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines , which notes that the vast majority of victims – 78 % – are civilians .
The Obama administration decided that while it wouldn ’ t sign the 1997 international treaty banning anti-personnel land mines – known as the Ottawa Convention – it would abide by its requirements , except on the Korean Peninsula . Commanders there lobbied to retain the capability to counter the threat of hundreds of thousands of North Korean troops and armored trucks ready to pour over the border .
The White House statement rescinding the ban authorizes four-star military commanders “ in exceptional circumstances ” – and with the express approval of the secretary of defense , according to Mr. Mercado – “ to employ advanced , non-persistent landmines specifically designed to reduce unintended harm to civilians . ”
Modern land mine designs include a deactivation mechanism , which is supposed to kick in after a period of time , between , say , 12 hours and 60 days . The minefields are also “ smart , ” in that they can “ talk to each other and be command-activated , and link into other sensors so that they know when enemy formations are coming , ” says retired Col. Mark Cancian , senior adviser in the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , who previously worked on land mine issues at the Pentagon .
But reducing the threat does not mean eliminating it , notes a U.S. Campaign to Ban Landmines statement released last week by 63 nongovernmental organizations that came together to condemn the policy . “ If the self-destruct or self-deactivation mechanisms were to fail , they would remain lethal , and the potential exists for the components to be repurposed into improvised explosive devices , ” it says . “ While there are still too many casualties annually , we have seen a dramatic decline since the Treaty came into being . To roll back the progress the global community has made would not only be a tragedy but an affront to the dignity of landmine survivors . ”
Mr. Cancian argues that cameras and infrared heat signature sensors can help to bring real-time surveillance of minefields . And more generally , he places a high degree of trust in the technology . “ I have a great deal of confidence that they ’ ll do what they say they will , ” he says . Pentagon officials say the odds that the mines will fail to self-deactivate as they ’ ve been programmed to do is 6 in 1 million .
“ That ’ s pretty good . Can we make it better ? We can make it better. ” said Mr. Mercado , who added that besides the land mines that it already has stockpiled – most of which will expire in 2030 – the Pentagon can now “ turn to our industries to start developing land mines that are even more reliable . ”
This acknowledgment of room for improvement , however , points to the underlying threat that even the most recent land mine technology poses to civilians , says Mary Wareham , advocacy director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch . “ I ’ ve heard land mines called everything from ‘ safe ’ to ‘ pure ’ to ‘ area denial systems. ’ There ’ s definitely been efforts by the defense sector to make more precise and accurate weapons . We ’ ve seen that with the more sophisticated cluster weapons that do not leave many unexploded remnants – but they still leave some . ”
Even when the U.S. military “ is out there laying down so-called ‘ nonpersistent smart mines ’ that will time out after 30 days , there ’ s still a field of mines out there , ” adds Stephen Pomper , senior director for policy at the International Crisis Group . “ Are U.S. troops going to be comfortable walking through there ? Are people going to send their children to play in them ? ”
The Trump administration argues that the greater risk is to U.S. national security . “ [ R ] estrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama Administration ’ s policy could place [ U.S. forces ] at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries , ” according to the White House statement . “ The President is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops . ”
Analysts point out , however , that U.S. military leaders outside the Korean Peninsula haven ’ t been clamoring for land mines . Rather than in their underuse , the danger lies in their overuse , retired Gen. Carter Ham , former head of U.S. Africa Command , tells the Monitor . “ I think what we need to do is be very , very careful in the application of land mines . It ’ s kind of like nuclear weapons – we should never take anything off the table , but we should make sure we have very tight controls . ”
The current argument for land mines lies chiefly in their deterrent value – sowing uncertainty is a useful war tactic . They “ cause the adversary to have to pause and say , ‘ Do I need to clear this field or not ? ’ ” Mr. Mercado said . This is particularly true , some analysts argue , against the backdrop of the Trump administration ’ s National Defense Strategy , which cites U.S. jockeying with “ great powers ” like China and Russia – neither of whom are Ottawa Convention signatories – as a bigger threat than terrorism .
In the event that Moscow decides to invade a neighbor , for example , “ a [ land mine ] capability like this would be very helpful to slow Russians until we bring in NATO , ” Mr. Cancian says . Yet in an era of drones , cyberwarfare , and hypersonic weapons , “ I guess I ’ m a little bit skeptical that if , God forbid , the U.S. were to end up in a ground war with Russia , ” Mr. Pomper adds , “ that the outcome would be determined by the availability of anti-personnel land mines . ”

The idea that “ they are a vital tool of warfare – it ’ s a joke , ” argues Ms. Wareham .

Officials are warning that employee shortages mean completions of ongoing retrofits are being delayed , endangering deployment plans and compromising international agreements that require tight time lines .
The Navy has already warned that current projections show repairs to four ships over the next year won ’ t be completed on time , as officials urgently work to rebuild a shipyard workforce that dropped to an all-time low of 30,000 Defense Department civilian personnel from a target of about 33,500 workers because of budget cuts associated with sequestration .

“ Maybe an embassy has to be evacuated , ” Lt. Cmdr . Cook said . “ Maybe a hot spot heats up and we have to put Marines on the beach . Maybe the president decides that we need to be bombing country X . ”
Navy ships are often sent on several deployments and then brought back to shipyards for a bow-to-stern overhaul . The work can stretch beyond a year for ships as large as an aircraft carrier , which have a crew of more than 6,200 and a height equivalent to a 24-story building . The overhaul includes repairing deteriorated valves , patching up rudders and replacing pipes .
Officials thus far have tried to devise backup plans to account for the delays , on occasion even extending deployments .
Bryan Clark , an analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Analysis , said the average carrier strike group — a group of Navy ships with an aircraft carrier at its center — is currently spending an extra month at sea , with deployments stretching between eight and nine months because of repair delays to other ships .
Retired Vice Adm. Peter Daly , CEO of the U.S . Naval Institute , said lengthening deployments is one of the easiest ways to erode morale among sailors . In fact , he said , low morale has already prompted some of the Navy ’ s highly trained personnel to leave the military .
“ What we ’ re starting to see is the beginning of people voting with their feet , ” he said .
The maintenance delays began in 2012 , and so far the majority of the ships that have missed their delivery dates have been fast-attack submarines , said Rear Adm. Mark Whitney , deputy commander of logistics , maintenance and industrial operations .
Now Navy officials are mulling over how much maintenance work they will need to push off into future years .
For Rear Adm. Whitney , the detainment of a single ship is simply unacceptable .
“ I want to deliver them all , ” he said . “ That ’ s the goal : deliver everything on time , including the fast-attack submarines , just by virtue of the fact that what we have is a priority list [ and ] they ’ re always kind of at the bottom . That ’ s not satisfying . We need to deliver them all . ”
As Navy officials try to repair the shipyard workforce deficiency at its four naval shipyards — Norfolk in Portsmouth , Virginia ; Portsmouth in Kittery , Maine ; Puget Sound in Bremerton , Washington ; and Pearl Harbor in Hawaii — they remain wary of the fact that they will not be able to reach their maximum hiring rate until 2016 .
“ The target that we ’ re aiming for is 33,500 workers , and we are at about — I think we ’ re just approaching 31,000 , ” Rear Adm. Whitney said .
To speed up that process , the Navy is implementing a new training procedure called “ onboarding , ” which shepherds new employees with no experience through the hiring and training phases . Prior to 2012 , Navy shipyards employed about five experienced employees for every new person . Back then , it was easier to absorb lesser-experienced workers and place them alongside seasoned employees so they could learn their craft , Mr. Johnson said .
“ The employee demographic has shifted significantly recently , to the point that over the next two years , 5,000 employees will have less than one year of shipyard experience , ” he said .
Mr. Daly said the turmoil resulting from workforce shortages is prompting the Navy ’ s highly trained personnel to say , “ I don ’ t want to do this anymore . ”

Speaking on “ Fox News Sunday , ” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was “ unmistakable ” that Iran conducted the attacks “ with the clear intent to deny transit through the strait , ” through which about a fifth of the world ’ s oil is transported daily .
The Pentagon late Thursday released photographs and a grainy black-and-white video purportedly showing Islamic Revolutionary Guard troops removing an unexploded mine from the side of an oil tanker targeted in the Gulf of Oman earlier that day .
U.S. Central Command said American forces in the region witnessed and recorded an Iranian boat approach the oil tanker Kokuka Courageous and remove an unexploded limpet mine from the side of the vessel . The video footage released by the Defense Department appears to show a small device being removed from the ship .
Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. intelligence community has significant evidence to blame Tehran for the attacks . Iran has persistently denied such claims .
“ The American people should rest assured we have high confidence with respect to who conducted these attacks , as well as who conducted other attacks within the last 40 days , ” the secretary of state said .
U.S. officials said that limpet mines also were used in a May attack on four oil tankers , which the Trump administration also has blamed on Iran .
Not everyone , however , is convinced by the U.S. take on how the situation unfolded .
Germany ’ s foreign minister has requested additional evidence before pointing blame on Tehran and said the video released by the Pentagon is not enough to draw conclusions .
There also have been disputing claims about the attack . The Japanese owner of one of the tankers has told of his crew ’ s account of the incident and said the ship was hit by a flying object , not a mine .
Saudi Arabia , the world ’ s largest exporter of crude oil , and Britain have joined the U.S. in pointing fingers at Iran .
In an interview with Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat , Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called on other countries to take a “ decisive stand ” against the attack .
“ The kingdom does not want a war in the region , but it will not hesitate to deal with any threats to its people , its sovereignty or its vital interests , ” the crown prince said .
Britain plans to send elite military forces to the region in response to the attacks after the country ’ s foreign secretary declared that Iran is “ almost certainly ” responsible for the attacks , according to The Sunday Times .
Royal Marines are scheduled to be deployed to the region in coming weeks and are expected to patrol the strait , joining ships stationed at Britain ’ s naval base in Bahrain .
But the British Defense Ministry downplayed the significance of the move and told the newspaper that it is a “ pre-planned training deployment and is in no way related to the ongoing situation in the Gulf of Oman . ”
As tensions escalate between Washington and Tehran , Mr. Pompeo maintained that the U.S. does not seek war with Iran but will defend itself if necessary . The Trump administration has repeated that message for weeks since the Pentagon deployed additional forces to the region last month citing a threat to American interests .
In an interview with CBS News , Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. is considering a “ full range of options ” to respond to the attacks but is “ confident [ the U.S. ] can take a set of actions that would restore deterrence . ”
Asked whether such action would include a military response , the secretary of state responded , “ Of course . ”
Lawmakers in recent weeks have warned that the administration lacks congressional approval to use military force .
Mr. Pompeo on Sunday insisted that the administration “ always [ has ] the authorization to defend American interests . ”
“ Every option that we look at will be fully lawful , ” Mr. Pompeo said .
Congressional leaders , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , have said the White House can not cite the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force to strike in the Middle East and have reiterated that only Congress can declare war .
Rep. Adam B. Schiff , California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said in an appearance on CBS that while he believes Iran is behind the attacks , “ congressional approval is necessary to initiate hostilities against Iran . ”
“ We should be trying to corral a response , though , from the international community to protect shipping , to impose sanctions , but because we have so alienated ourselves from our allies , that ’ s not happening , ” Mr. Schiff said .
Meanwhile , Sen. Tom Cotton , an Arkansas Republican who sits on the Senate intelligence and Armed Services committees , said retaliatory military strikes against Iran would be warranted .
“ Unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike against the Islamic Republic of Iran , ” Mr. Cotton said on CBS after Mr. Pompeo ’ s appearance .
Mr. Cotton said he believes the administration does have the authority to use military action against Iran without expressed congressional approval .

The dishonesty of words illustrates the dishonesty of America ’ s wars .
Since 9/11 , can there be any doubt that the public has become numb to the euphemisms that regularly accompany U.S. troops , drones , and CIA operatives into Washington ’ s imperial conflicts across the Greater Middle East and Africa ? Such euphemisms are meant to take the sting out of America ’ s wars back home . Many of these words and phrases are already so well known and well worn that no one thinks twice about them anymore .
Here are just a few : collateral damage for killed and wounded civilians ( a term used regularly since the First Gulf War of 1990-1991 ) . Enhanced interrogation techniques for torture , a term adopted with vigor by George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , and the rest of their administration ( “ techniques ” that were actually demonstrated in the White House ) . Extraordinary rendition for CIA kidnappings of terror suspects off global streets or from remote badlands , often followed by the employment of enhanced interrogation techniques at U.S. black sites or other foreign hellholes . Detainees for prisoners and detention camp for prison ( or , in some cases , more honestly , concentration camp ) , used to describe Guantánamo ( Gitmo ) , among other places established offshore of American justice . Targeted killings for presidentially ordered drone assassinations . Boots on the ground for yet another deployment of “ our ” troops ( and not just their boots ) in harm ’ s way . Even the Bush administration ’ s Global War on Terror , its label for an attempt to transform the Greater Middle East into a Pax Americana , would be redubbed in the Obama years overseas contingency operations ( before any attempt at labeling was dropped for a no-name war pursued across major swathes of the planet ) .
As euphemisms were deployed to cloak that war ’ s bitter and brutal realities , over-the-top honorifics were assigned to America ’ s embattled role in the world . Exceptional , indispensable , and greatest have been the three words most commonly used by presidents , politicians , and the gung ho to describe this country . Once upon a time , if Americans thought this way , they felt no need to have their presidents and presidential candidates actually say so -- such was the confidence of the golden age of American power . So consider the constant redeployment of these terms a small measure of America ’ s growing defensiveness about itself , its sense of doubt and decline rather than strength and confidence .
To what end this concerted assault on the words we use ? In George Orwell ’ s classic 1946 essay “ Politics and the English Language , ” he noted that his era ’ s equivalents for “ collateral damage ” were “ needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them. ” Obviously , not much has changed in the intervening seven decades . And this is , as Orwell intuited , a dangerous way to go . Cloaking violent , even murderous actions in anodyne language might help a few doubting functionaries sleep easier at night , but it should make the rest of us profoundly uneasy .
The more American leaders and officials -- and the media that quotes them endlessly -- employ such euphemisms to cloak harsh realities , the more they ensure that such harshness will endure ; indeed , that it is likely to grow harsher and more pernicious as we continue to settle into a world of euphemistic thinking .
In the future , some linguist or lexicographer will doubtless compile a dictionary of perpetual war and perhaps ( since they may be linked ) imperial decline , focusing on the grim processes and versions of failure language can cloak . It would undoubtedly explore how certain words and rhetorical devices were used in twenty-first-century America to obscure the heavy burdens that war placed on the country , even as they facilitated its continuingfailed conflicts . It would obviously include classic examples like surge , used in both Iraq and Afghanistan to obscure the way our government rushed extra troops into a battle zone in a moment of failure only ensuring the extension of that failure , and the now-classic phrase shock and awe that obscured the reality of a massive air strike on Baghdad that resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians ( “ collateral damage ” ) , but not the “ decapitation ” of a hated regime .
Don ’ t think , however , that the language of twenty-first-century American war was only meant to lull the public . Less familiar words and terms continue to be used within the military not to clarify tasks at hand but to obscure certain obvious realities even from those sanctioned to deal with them . Takeasymmetrical warfare , the gray zone , and VUCA . Unless you spend time in Department of Defense and military circles , you probably haven ’ t heard of these .
Asymmetrical warfare suggests that the enemy fights unfairly and in a thoroughly cowardly fashion , regularly lurking behind and mixing with civilians ( “ hostages ” ) , because that enemy doesn ’ t have the moxie to don uniforms and stand toe-to-toe in a “ kinetic ” smack-down with U.S. troops . As a result , of course , the U.S. must be prepared for underhanded tactics and devious weaponry , including ambushes and IEDs ( improvised explosive devices , or roadside bombs ) , as well as a range of other “ unconventional ” tactics now all too familiar in a world plagued by violent attacks against “ soft ” targets ( aka civilians ) . It must also be prepared to engage an enemy mixed in with a civilian population and so brace itself for the inevitable collateral damage that is now so much the essence of American war .
That groups like the Islamic State ( ISIS ) would choose to fight “ asymmetrically ” should hardly come as a surprise to anyone who ’ s ever been confronted by a much bigger and better armed kid in a schoolyard . Misdirection , a sucker punch , a slingshot , even running away to fight another day are “ asymmetrical ” approaches that are sensible indeed for any outgunned and overmatched opponent . The term is a truism , nothing more , when it comes to the realities of our world . It is , however , a useful way of framing matters for those in the Pentagon and the military who don ’ t want to think seriously about the grim course of action , focused significantly on civilian populations , they are pursuing , which often instills anger and the urge for revenge in such populations and so , in the end , runs at cross purposes to stated U.S. aims .
The “ gray zone ” is a fuzzy term used in military circles to describe the perplexing nature of lower-level conflicts , often involving non-state actors , that don ’ t qualify as full-fledged wars . These are often fought using non-traditional weapons and tactics ranging from cyber attacks to the propagandizing of potential terror recruits via social media . This “ zone ” is unnerving to Pentagon types in part because the vast majority of the Pentagon ’ s funding goes to conventional weaponry that ’ s as subtle as a sledgehammer : big-ticket items like aircraft carriers , nuclear submarines , main battle tanks , strategic bombers , and wildly expensive multi-role aircraft such as the F-35 ( now estimated to cost roughly $ 1.4 trillion through its lifecycle ) . Much of this weaponry is “ too big to fail ” in the funding wars in Washington , but regularly fails in the field precisely because it ’ s too big to be used effectively against the latest crop of evasive enemies . Hence , that irresolvable gray zone which plagues America ’ s defense planners and operatives .
The question the gray zone both raises and obscures is : Why has the U.S. done so poorly when , by its own definition , it remains the biggest , baddest superpower around , the one that outspends its non-state enemies by a factor so large it can ’ t even be calculated ? Keep in mind , for instance , that the 9/11 attacks on American soil were estimated to have cost Osama bin Laden at most a half-million dollars . Multiply that by 400 and you can buy one “ made in America ” F-35 jet fighter .
If the gray zone offers little help clarifying America ’ s military dilemmas , what about VUCA ? It ’ s an acronym for volatile , uncertain , complex , and ambiguous , which is meant to describe our post-9/11 world . Of course , there ’ s nothing like an acronym to take the sting out of any world . But as an historian who has read a lot of history books , let me confess that , to the best of my knowledge , the world has always been , is now , and will always be VUCA .
For any future historian of the Pentagon ’ s language , let me sum things up this way : instead of honest talk about war in all its ugliness and uncertainty , military professionals of our era have tended to substitute buzz words , catchphrases , and acronyms . It ’ s a way of muddying the water . It allows the world of war to tumble on without serious challenge , which is why it ’ s been so useful in these years to speak of , say , COIN ( Counterinsurgency ) or 4GW ( Fourth-Generation Warfare ) .
Much like its most recent enthusiast , General David Petraeus , COIN has once again lost favor in the military , but Fourth-Generation Warfare is still riding high and sounds so refreshingly forward-looking , not like the stale Vietnam-era wine in a post-9/11 bottle that it is . In reality , it ’ s another iteration of insurgency and COIN mixed and matched with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong ’ s people 's war . To prevail in places like Afghanistan , so 4GW thinkers suggest , one needs to win hearts and minds -- yes , that classic phrase of defeat in Vietnam -- while securing and protecting ( a definite COINage ) the people against insurgents and terrorists . In other words , we ’ re talking about an acronym that immediately begins to congeal if you use older words to describe it like “ pacification ” and “ nation-building. ” The latest 4GW jargon may not help win wars , but it does sometimes win healthy research grants from the government .
The fact is that trendy acronyms and snappy buzz words have a way of limiting genuine thinking on war . If America is to win ( or , far better , avoid ) future wars , its war professionals need to look more honestly at that phenomenon in all of its dimensions . So , too , do the American people , for it ’ s in their name that such wars are allegedly waged .
These days , Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter often resorts to cancer imagery when describing the Islamic state . `` Parent tumor '' is an image he especially favors -- that is , terrorism as a cancer that America ’ s militarized surgeons need to attack and destroy before it metastasizes and has “ children. ” ( Think of the ISIS franchises in Libya , where the organization has recently doubled in size , Afghanistan , and Yemen . ) Hence the proliferation of “ surgical strikes ” by drones and similarly “ surgical ” Special Ops raids , both of which you could think of as America ’ s equivalent of white blood cells in its war on the cancer of terrorism .
But is terrorism really a civilizational cancer that can be “ cured ” via the most aggressive “ kinetic ” treatments ? Can the U.S. render the world cancer-free ? For that ’ s what Carter ’ s language implies . And how does one measure “ progress ” in a “ war ” on the cancer of ISIS ? Indeed , from an outsider ’ s perspective , the proliferation of U.S. military bases around the world ( there are now roughly 800 ) , as well as of drone strikes , Special Ops raids , and massive weapons exports might have a cancerous look to them . In other words , what constitutes a “ cancer ” depends on one ’ s perspective -- and perhaps one ’ s definition of world “ health , ” too .
The very notion of progress in America ’ s recent wars is one that a colleague , Michael Murry , recently critiqued . A U.S. Navy Vietnam War Veteran , he wrote me that , for his favorite military euphemism , “ I have to go with ‘ progress ’ as incessantly chanted by the American military brass in Iraq and Afghanistan…
“ We go on hearing about 14 years of ‘ progress ’ which , to hear our generals tell it , would vanish in an instant should the United States withdraw its forces and let the locals and their neighbors sort things out . Since when do ‘ fragile gains ’ equate to ‘ progress ’ ? Who in their right mind would invest rivers of blood and trillions of dollars in ‘ fragility ’ ? Now that I think of it , we also have the euphemistic expression of ‘ drawdown ’ substituting for ‘ withdrawal ’ which in turn substitutes for ‘ retreat. ’ The U.S. military and the civilian government it has browbeaten into hapless acquiescence simply can not face the truth of their monumental failures and so must continually bastardize our language in a losing -- almost comical -- attempt to stay one linguistic step ahead of the truth . ”
Progress , as Murry notes , basically means nothing when such “ gains , ” in the words of David Petraeus during the surge months in Iraq in 2007 , are both “ fragile ” and “ reversible. ” Indeed , Petraeus repeated the same two words in 2011 to describe similar U.S. “ progress ” in Afghanistan , and today it couldn ’ t be clearer just how much “ progress ” was truly made there . Isn ’ t it time for government officials to stop banging the drums of war talk in favor of “ progress ” when none exists ?
Think , for instance , of the American-trained ( and now re-trained ) Iraqi security forces . Each year U.S. officials swear that the Iraqi military is getting ever closer to combat readiness , but much like one of Zeno ’ s paradoxes , the half-steps that military takes under American tutelage never seem to get it into fighting shape . Progress , eternally touted , seems always to lead to regress , eternally explained away , as that army regularly underperforms or its units simply collapse , often abandoning their American-supplied weaponry to the enemy .

The dishonesty of words illustrates the dishonesty of America’s wars.

Since 9/11, can there be any doubt that the public has become numb to the euphemisms that regularly accompany U.S. troops, drones, and CIA operatives into Washington’s imperial conflicts across the Greater Middle East and Africa? Such euphemisms are meant to take the sting out of America’s wars back home. Many of these words and phrases are already so well known and well worn that no one thinks twice about them anymore.

Here are just a few: collateral damage for killed and wounded civilians (a term used regularly since the First Gulf War of 1990-1991). Enhanced interrogation techniques for torture, a term adopted with vigor by George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and the rest of their administration (“techniques” that were actually demonstrated in the White House). Extraordinary rendition for CIA kidnappings of terror suspects off global streets or from remote badlands, often followed by the employment of enhanced interrogation techniques at U.S. black sites or other foreign hellholes. Detainees for prisoners and detention camp for prison (or, in some cases, more honestly, concentration camp), used to describe Guantánamo (Gitmo), among other places established offshore of American justice. Targeted killings for presidentially ordered drone assassinations. Boots on the ground for yet another deployment of “our” troops (and not just their boots) in harm’s way. Even the Bush administration’s Global War on Terror, its label for an attempt to transform the Greater Middle East into a Pax Americana, would be redubbed in the Obama years overseas contingency operations (before any attempt at labeling was dropped for a no-name war pursued across major swathes of the planet).

As euphemisms were deployed to cloak that war’s bitter and brutal realities, over-the-top honorifics were assigned to America’s embattled role in the world. Exceptional, indispensable, and greatest have been the three words most commonly used by presidents, politicians, and the gung ho to describe this country. Once upon a time, if Americans thought this way, they felt no need to have their presidents and presidential candidates actually say so -- such was the confidence of the golden age of American power. So consider the constant redeployment of these terms a small measure of America’s growing defensiveness about itself, its sense of doubt and decline rather than strength and confidence.

To what end this concerted assault on the words we use? In George Orwell’s classic 1946 essay “Politics and the English Language,” he noted that his era’s equivalents for “collateral damage” were “needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.” Obviously, not much has changed in the intervening seven decades. And this is, as Orwell intuited, a dangerous way to go. Cloaking violent, even murderous actions in anodyne language might help a few doubting functionaries sleep easier at night, but it should make the rest of us profoundly uneasy.

The more American leaders and officials -- and the media that quotes them endlessly -- employ such euphemisms to cloak harsh realities, the more they ensure that such harshness will endure; indeed, that it is likely to grow harsher and more pernicious as we continue to settle into a world of euphemistic thinking.

The Emptiness of Acronyms

In the future, some linguist or lexicographer will doubtless compile a dictionary of perpetual war and perhaps (since they may be linked) imperial decline, focusing on the grim processes and versions of failure language can cloak. It would undoubtedly explore how certain words and rhetorical devices were used in twenty-first-century America to obscure the heavy burdens that war placed on the country, even as they facilitated its continuingfailed conflicts. It would obviously include classic examples like surge, used in both Iraq and Afghanistan to obscure the way our government rushed extra troops into a battle zone in a moment of failure only ensuring the extension of that failure, and the now-classic phrase shock and awe that obscured the reality of a massive air strike on Baghdad that resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians (“collateral damage”), but not the “decapitation” of a hated regime.

Don’t think, however, that the language of twenty-first-century American war was only meant to lull the public. Less familiar words and terms continue to be used within the military not to clarify tasks at hand but to obscure certain obvious realities even from those sanctioned to deal with them. Takeasymmetrical warfare, the gray zone, and VUCA. Unless you spend time in Department of Defense and military circles, you probably haven’t heard of these.

Asymmetrical warfare suggests that the enemy fights unfairly and in a thoroughly cowardly fashion, regularly lurking behind and mixing with civilians (“hostages”), because that enemy doesn’t have the moxie to don uniforms and stand toe-to-toe in a “kinetic” smack-down with U.S. troops. As a result, of course, the U.S. must be prepared for underhanded tactics and devious weaponry, including ambushes and IEDs (improvised explosive devices, or roadside bombs), as well as a range of other “unconventional” tactics now all too familiar in a world plagued by violent attacks against “soft” targets (aka civilians). It must also be prepared to engage an enemy mixed in with a civilian population and so brace itself for the inevitable collateral damage that is now so much the essence of American war.

That groups like the Islamic State (ISIS) would choose to fight “asymmetrically” should hardly come as a surprise to anyone who’s ever been confronted by a much bigger and better armed kid in a schoolyard. Misdirection, a sucker punch, a slingshot, even running away to fight another day are “asymmetrical” approaches that are sensible indeed for any outgunned and overmatched opponent. The term is a truism, nothing more, when it comes to the realities of our world. It is, however, a useful way of framing matters for those in the Pentagon and the military who don’t want to think seriously about the grim course of action, focused significantly on civilian populations, they are pursuing, which often instills anger and the urge for revenge in such populations and so, in the end, runs at cross purposes to stated U.S. aims.

The “gray zone” is a fuzzy term used in military circles to describe the perplexing nature of lower-level conflicts, often involving non-state actors, that don’t qualify as full-fledged wars. These are often fought using non-traditional weapons and tactics ranging from cyber attacks to the propagandizing of potential terror recruits via social media. This “zone” is unnerving to Pentagon types in part because the vast majority of the Pentagon’s funding goes to conventional weaponry that’s as subtle as a sledgehammer: big-ticket items like aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, main battle tanks, strategic bombers, and wildly expensive multi-role aircraft such as the F-35 (now estimated to cost roughly $1.4 trillion through its lifecycle). Much of this weaponry is “too big to fail” in the funding wars in Washington, but regularly fails in the field precisely because it’s too big to be used effectively against the latest crop of evasive enemies. Hence, that irresolvable gray zone which plagues America’s defense planners and operatives.

The question the gray zone both raises and obscures is: Why has the U.S. done so poorly when, by its own definition, it remains the biggest, baddest superpower around, the one that outspends its non-state enemies by a factor so large it can’t even be calculated? Keep in mind, for instance, that the 9/11 attacks on American soil were estimated to have cost Osama bin Laden at most a half-million dollars. Multiply that by 400 and you can buy one “made in America” F-35 jet fighter.

If the gray zone offers little help clarifying America’s military dilemmas, what about VUCA? It’s an acronym for volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous, which is meant to describe our post-9/11 world. Of course, there’s nothing like an acronym to take the sting out of any world. But as an historian who has read a lot of history books, let me confess that, to the best of my knowledge, the world has always been, is now, and will always be VUCA.

For any future historian of the Pentagon’s language, let me sum things up this way: instead of honest talk about war in all its ugliness and uncertainty, military professionals of our era have tended to substitute buzz words, catchphrases, and acronyms. It’s a way of muddying the water. It allows the world of war to tumble on without serious challenge, which is why it’s been so useful in these years to speak of, say, COIN (Counterinsurgency) or 4GW(Fourth-Generation Warfare).

Much like its most recent enthusiast, General David Petraeus, COIN has once again lost favor in the military, but Fourth-Generation Warfare is still riding high and sounds so refreshingly forward-looking, not like the stale Vietnam-era wine in a post-9/11 bottle that it is. In reality, it’s another iteration of insurgency and COIN mixed and matched with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong’s people's war. To prevail in places like Afghanistan, so 4GW thinkers suggest, one needs to win hearts and minds -- yes, that classic phrase of defeat in Vietnam -- while securing and protecting (a definite COINage) the people against insurgents and terrorists. In other words, we’re talking about an acronym that immediately begins to congeal if you use older words to describe it like “pacification” and “nation-building.” The latest 4GW jargon may not help win wars, but it does sometimes win healthy research grants from the government.

The fact is that trendy acronyms and snappy buzz words have a way of limiting genuine thinking on war. If America is to win (or, far better, avoid) future wars, its war professionals need to look more honestly at that phenomenon in all of its dimensions. So, too, do the American people, for it’s in their name that such wars are allegedly waged.

The Truth About “Progress” in America’s Wars

These days, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter often resorts to cancer imagery when describing the Islamic state. ""Parent tumor"" is an image he especially favors -- that is, terrorism as a cancer that America’s militarized surgeons need to attack and destroy before it metastasizes and has “children.” (Think of the ISIS franchises in Libya, where the organization has recently doubled in size, Afghanistan, and Yemen.) Hence the proliferation of “surgical strikes” by drones and similarly “surgical” Special Ops raids, both of which you could think of as America’s equivalent of white blood cells in its war on the cancer of terrorism.

But is terrorism really a civilizational cancer that can be “cured” via the most aggressive “kinetic” treatments? Can the U.S. render the world cancer-free? For that’s what Carter’s language implies. And how does one measure “progress” in a “war” on the cancer of ISIS? Indeed, from an outsider’s perspective, the proliferation of U.S. military bases around the world (there are now roughly 800), as well as of drone strikes, Special Ops raids, and massive weapons exports might have a cancerous look to them. In other words, what constitutes a “cancer” depends on one’s perspective -- and perhaps one’s definition of world “health,” too.

The very notion of progress in America’s recent wars is one that a colleague, Michael Murry, recently critiqued. A U.S. Navy Vietnam War Veteran, he wrote me that, for his favorite military euphemism, “I have to go with ‘progress’ as incessantly chanted by the American military brass in Iraq and Afghanistan…

“We go on hearing about 14 years of ‘progress’ which, to hear our generals tell it, would vanish in an instant should the United States withdraw its forces and let the locals and their neighbors sort things out. Since when do ‘fragile gains’ equate to ‘progress’? Who in their right mind would invest rivers of blood and trillions of dollars in ‘fragility’? Now that I think of it, we also have the euphemistic expression of ‘drawdown’ substituting for ‘withdrawal’ which in turn substitutes for ‘retreat.’ The U.S. military and the civilian government it has browbeaten into hapless acquiescence simply cannot face the truth of their monumental failures and so must continually bastardize our language in a losing -- almost comical -- attempt to stay one linguistic step ahead of the truth.”

Progress, as Murry notes, basically means nothing when such “gains,” in the words of David Petraeus during the surge months in Iraq in 2007, are both “fragile” and “reversible.” Indeed, Petraeus repeated the same two words in 2011 to describe similar U.S. “progress” in Afghanistan, and today it couldn’t be clearer just how much “progress” was truly made there. Isn’t it time for government officials to stop banging the drums of war talk in favor of “progress” when none exists?

Think, for instance, of the American-trained (and now re-trained) Iraqi security forces. Each year U.S. officials swear that the Iraqi military is getting ever closer to combat readiness, but much like one of Zeno’s paradoxes, the half-steps that military takes under American tutelage never seem to get it into fighting shape. Progress, eternally touted, seems always to lead to regress, eternally explained away, as that army regularly underperforms or its units simply collapse, often abandoning their American-supplied weaponry to the enemy. Here we are, 12 years after the U.S. began training the Iraqi military and once again it seems to be cratering, this time while supposedly on the road to retaking Iraq’s second largest city, Mosul, from its Islamic State occupiers. Progress, anyone?

In short, the dishonesty of the words the U.S. military regularly wields illustrates the dishonesty of its never-ending wars. After so many years of failure and frustration, of wars that aren’t won and terrorist movements that only seem to spread as its leaders are knocked off, isn’t it past time for Americans to ditch phrases like “collateral damage,” “enemy noncombatant,” “no-fly zone” (or even worse, “safe zone”), and “surgical strike” and adopt a language, however grim, that accurately describes the military realities of this era?

What was the Iran deal supposed to do?

In negotiating the agreement, the administration of President Barack Obama said its aim was to increase Iran’s “breakout time” to one year. That means that if the Iranians decided to race and produce enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon, it would take them a year, up from just a few weeks.

To accomplish that, the deal imposed limits on enriched uranium stockpiles and enrichment activities at Iran’s Fordow and Natanz sites.

In return for these actions, the U.S., European Union, and United Nations pledged in the agreement to lift all economic sanctions imposed on Iran as punishment for its previous nuclear activities.

Why is the deal in trouble?

Candidate Donald Trump proclaimed the Iran agreement a “terrible deal” during his run for the presidency. He objected that it placed no curbs on Iran’s wider military activities, and that it was time-limited, as its major restrictions expired after 15 years. President Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018, and reimposed economic sanctions meant to isolate Iran from financial markets and end its oil exports.

Iran said the withdrawal amounted to the U.S. reneging on its agreements. Some countries continued to import Iranian oil under waivers granted by the Trump administration, but the U.S. ended the waiver program in 2019.

In this context, Iran’s Jan. 5 announcement simply affirmed what was already clear. Iran said that, as far as it was concerned, it no longer faced any “operational restrictions” and that future actions would depend solely on Iran’s “technical needs.”

What happens now?

Iran has not yet completely withdrawn from the JCPOA. Notably, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran would continue to cooperate with inspectors from the IAEA, the U.N. arm charged with on-site verification of the nuclear deal.

That means the world will continue to periodically receive IAEA reports of Iran’s overt nuclear enrichment activities, including measures of enrichment levels and stockpile growth.

Whether the U.S., Iran, and other partners will resume nuclear negotiations, aiming for a broader deal that settles the Trump administration’s stated concerns about missile development and regional meddling, is much less certain.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government’s 17-year effort to stabilize parts of war-torn Afghanistan has mostly failed, according to a report released Thursday by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

The damning report finds that much of the $4.7 billion spent on programs to stabilize areas cleared of insurgents has been largely wasted — some of it siphoned off by corrupt officials, some of it paying for projects that did more harm than good. All told, the U.S. government has appropriated about $126 billion to rebuild the country, most of it to train and equip security forces.

“The large sums of stabilization dollars the United States devoted to Afghanistan in search of quick gains often exacerbated conflicts, enabled corruption, and bolstered support for insurgents,” the report states.

After toppling the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, U.S., allied and Afghan forces there have sought to establish a stable country that could prevent insurgents from harboring al-Qaeda terrorists. The report released Thursday follows another issued this week by the Pentagon’s inspector general that found little progress in providing security for the Afghan people.

Thursday’s report finds that bad strategy and policies in Afghanistan have led to billions wasted, more than 2,200 U.S. troops killed and a dysfunctional country left behind. The problems stemmed in part from U.S. officials focusing efforts on the most dangerous parts of the country and seeking to get out too fast.

President Barack Obama sent 50,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in 2009 and ’10 to the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan. At the same time Obama ordered more forces to Afghanistan, he set a deadline for their withdrawal. This “surge,” patterned in part after a similar escalation in Iraq, was intended to tamp down the Taliban insurgency and allow the government to grow. But the strategy did not provide enough security, nor did it last long enough to allow Afghans to take over.

“These two decisions — to prioritize the most dangerous parts of the country and to draw down forces on timelines unrelated to conditions on the ground — had a profound and harmful impact on countless downstream decisions regarding stabilization planning, staffing, and programming,” the report says.

The huge flows of money into the impoverished country had the opposite effect of what was intended, the report says. Instead of bolstering the local government, the gusher of cash flooded the country with money that could not be spent fast enough.

“By fueling corruption and the population’s disillusionment with its government, the coalition undermined the very government it sought to legitimize and drove support for the insurgency,” the report says.

Of the $4.7 billion spent, $2.4 billion went to programs administered by USAID and $2.3 billion was spent on the Pentagon's Commander's Emergency Response Program.

The military measured success in how much money was spent rather its impact on providing security, according to the report. The commander's funds, money that officers in the field could dole out for projects, rose from $40 million in 2004 to $550 million in 2009.

“Our analysis of the implementation of CERP suggests senior policymakers devoted money to a program with no overarching strategy, and without effective systems for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data,” the report says. “The result was a program that spent $2.3 billion in a profoundly underdeveloped economy with unknown effects.”

Of the $4.7 billion spent, $2.4 billion went to programs administered by USAID and $2.3 billion was spent on the Pentagon's Commander's Emergency Response Program. Projects included wells, schools, clinics and roads.

Deadlines for drawing down troops and leaving Afghanistan entirely in 2014, a goal that was never achieved, eroded belief in the staying power of the U.S.-led coalition and the Afghan government.

“Stabilization requires time to measure and adapt, and we lost all that,” John Allen, the former top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told investigators. “It was pulled out from under us.”

About 15,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan.

WASHINGTON – Pentagon spending on sexual assault prevention and response programs has quadrupled since 2008, according to figures released by the Defense Department.

Whether that investment has paid dividends depends on where you stand:

Pentagon officials point to a long-term trend of lower estimates of sexual assaults in the ranks over the last decade.

Critics of the military's approach to prevention, however, note that the Pentagon's report on sexual assault released recently showed a nearly 38% increase in the estimated number of sexual assaults between 2016 and 2018 – the latest period available. There were an estimated 20,500 assaults in 2018.

“I am deeply disturbed by the results of this year’s survey on sexual assault in the military,"" said Rep. Jackie Speier, the California Democrat who chairs the Armed Services Committee's panel on personnel. ""Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars the Defense Department has spent on preventing and responding to sexual assaults over the last decade, more sexual assaults occurred in fiscal year 2018 than fiscal year 2010. The number of assaults jumped 37% from two years ago.""

Speier called for Congress to force the Pentagon to take more aggressive steps to curb sexual assault among troops.

Pentagon officials credit the total $192 million investment over time for an increase in troops reporting such crimes and seeking help.

Spending increased from $4.9 million in 2008 to $23.2 million in 2018 for the Pentagon's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. In addition, each of the armed services also funds programs to prevent, respond to and prosecute sexual assault cases.

Since 2006, there has been a reduction in the estimated number of sexual assaults when 34,000 troops reported some type of assault, ranging from groping to rape.

""We see that as great progress,"" said Nathan Galbreath, deputy director of the Pentagon's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.

The spending figures were released to USA TODAY and follow months of bad news on the issue of sexual assault.

Earlier this year, a report found that sexual assault at the military service academies rose nearly 50% last year.

And the Pentagon established a task force to combat assaults after Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., a retired Air Force pilot, announced during an Armed Forces committee meeting that she'd been raped while serving.

""Every case of sexual assault erodes readiness, lethality and the trust Americans have in our ability to carry out our mission,"" Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote in an April 15 memo to all of the armed forces. ""Zero tolerance is the only acceptable metric.""

Spending for the Pentagon's sexual assault office spiked at $25 million in 2016 and the number of full-time employees more than doubled from seven in 2008 to 15 currently.

The Pentagon has an annual budget of $700 billion.

Galbreath credited the focus of senior military and civilian officials, beginning with former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, for the progress in reducing the number of sexual assaults over time. But he cautioned that progress shown in recent years isn't guaranteed to continue.

""We’re going to have good years and bad years,"" Galbreath said.

Washington signaled it would pull out of the arms control treaty six months ago unless Moscow stuck to the accord . Russia called the move a ploy to exit a pact that the United States wanted to leave anyway in order to develop new missiles .
President Donald Trump told reporters he would like to seal a new arms deal with Russia reducing all nuclear forces , and possibly with China as well .
“ If we could get a pact where they reduce and we reduce nuclear , that would be a good thing for the world . I do believe that will happen , ” Trump said .
The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty ( INF ) was negotiated by then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev . It banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles ( 500-5,500 km ) , reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike on short notice .
The dispute is aggravating the worst U.S.-Russia friction since the Cold War ended in 1991 . Some experts believe the treaty ’ s collapse could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms .
“ The United States will not remain party to a treaty that is deliberately violated by Russia , ” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement .
“ Russia ’ s non-compliance under the treaty jeopardizes U.S. supreme interests as Russia ’ s development and fielding of a treaty-violating missile system represents a direct threat to the United States and our allies and partners , ” Pompeo said .
Senior Trump administration officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Russia had deployed “ multiple battalions ” of a cruise missile throughout Russia in violation of the pact , including in western Russia , “ with the ability to strike critical European targets . ”
Russia denies the allegation , saying the missile ’ s range puts it outside the treaty . It rejected a U.S. demand to destroy the new missile , the Novator 9M729 , known as the SSC-8 by the NATO Western military alliance .
Moscow has told Washington the U.S. decision to quit the pact undermines global security and removes a key pillar of international arms control .
China ’ s new ambassador to the United Nations , Zhang Jun , said China regrets that the United States is withdrawing from the treaty and expressed doubt about joining the United States and Russia in a nuclear deal .

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States formally withdrew from a landmark 1987 nuclear missile pact with Russia on Friday after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty, an accusation the Kremlin has denied.

Washington signaled it would pull out of the arms control treaty six months ago unless Moscow stuck to the accord. Russia called the move a ploy to exit a pact that the United States wanted to leave anyway in order to develop new missiles.

President Donald Trump told reporters he would like to seal a new arms deal with Russia reducing all nuclear forces, and possibly with China as well.

“If we could get a pact where they reduce and we reduce nuclear, that would be a good thing for the world. I do believe that will happen,” Trump said.

The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) was negotiated by then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. It banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500-5,500 km), reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike on short notice.

The dispute is aggravating the worst U.S.-Russia friction since the Cold War ended in 1991. Some experts believe the treaty’s collapse could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms.

“The United States will not remain party to a treaty that is deliberately violated by Russia,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.

“Russia’s non-compliance under the treaty jeopardizes U.S. supreme interests as Russia’s development and fielding of a treaty-violating missile system represents a direct threat to the United States and our allies and partners,” Pompeo said.

Senior Trump administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Russia had deployed “multiple battalions” of a cruise missile throughout Russia in violation of the pact, including in western Russia, “with the ability to strike critical European targets.”

Russia denies the allegation, saying the missile’s range puts it outside the treaty. It rejected a U.S. demand to destroy the new missile, the Novator 9M729, known as the SSC-8 by the NATO Western military alliance.

Moscow has told Washington the U.S. decision to quit the pact undermines global security and removes a key pillar of international arms control.

China’s new ambassador to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, said China regrets that the United States is withdrawing from the treaty and expressed doubt about joining the United States and Russia in a nuclear deal.

“The United States is saying China should be a party in this disarmament agreement, but I think everybody knows that China is not at the same level with the United States and the Russian Federation,” he said.

‘SERIOUS MISTAKE’

Russia said on Friday it had asked the United States for a moratorium on the deployment of land-based short and intermediate-range nuclear missiles.

“A serious mistake has been made in Washington,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

“We have already introduced a unilateral moratorium and won’t deploy land-based short or medium-range missiles, if we get them, in regions where such U.S. missiles are not deployed,” it said.

President Vladimir Putin has said Russia does not want an arms race and he has promised he would not deploy Russian missiles unless the United States does so first.

However, should Washington take such a step, he has said he would be forced to deploy Russian hypersonic nuclear missiles on ships or submarines near U.S. territorial waters.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg dismissed Russia’s moratorium request on Friday, saying it was “not a credible offer” as he said Moscow had already deployed illegal missiles.

“There are no new U.S. missiles, no new NATO missiles in Europe, but there are more and more new Russian missiles,” he said.

‘WE DON’T WANT A NEW ARMS RACE’

NATO said it had agreed a defensive package of measures to deter Russia. That response would be measured and would only involve conventional weapons, it said.

NATO’s Stoltenberg said there would be “no rash moves” by the alliance which he said “would not mirror what Russia does.”

“We don’t want a new arms race,” Stoltenberg said.

NATO members Britain and Poland blamed Moscow for the treaty’s demise.

“Their contempt for the rules-based international system threatens European security,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter.

European officials had voiced concern that if the treaty collapses, Europe could again become an arena for a nuclear-armed, intermediate-range missile buildup by the United States and Russia.

U.S. officials said the United States was months away from the first flight tests of an American intermediate-range missile that would serve as a counter to the Russians. Any deployment would be years away, they said.

My wife and I love the writing , the plots and picking out famous actors in their one-off roles for the classic television series .
Maybe I ’ ll write an episode of my own , complete with a Rod Serling-worthy opening monologue : “ The year is 2017 . Donald Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States , and mass amnesia has washed over America . Half the country can no longer remember anything that happened before Jan. 20 . The former president , Barack Obama , is literally sitting right there . Yet , his own party can not remember one thing about his eight years … ”
It is one of the strangest phenomena of the Trump era — the memory-holing of Obama ’ s executive powers . Democrats continuously act as though they ’ ve just fallen off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump does anything .
Trump ’ s illegal immigration policies are draconian ! He ’ s deporting too many , they screamed , forgetting that … Obama deported more . A lot more . And , you know those cages on the southern border ? Obama built them , not Trump .
Trump ’ s defying congressional subpoenas ! No president has ever stonewalled Congress , they screamed , forgetting that Obama ’ s attorney general , Eric Holder , was held in contempt of Congress for … defying subpoenas related to the `` Fast and Furious '' gun operation scandal . There were at least eight other times when Obama ’ s administration defied congressional oversight , even preventing people from testifying ( sound familiar ? ) .
More from Scott Jennings : Which 2020 Democrat can beat Donald Trump ? Do n't bet on Biden , Warren or Sanders .
When Trump announced his “ America First ” policy during his inaugural , Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can .
Now , they howl over Trump ’ s latest outrage : The airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani , the general who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the U.S. Embassy and , evidently , plotting future hits on American targets .
Washington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent . This , after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval .
“ When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009 , he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency . By his third year in office , Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned ( at ) Guantanamo Bay , ” Newsweek reported .
Obama practically invented modern push-button warfare , for goodness ’ sake ! Eventually , the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump ’ s perfectly precedented decisions .
On Iran , Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren ’ t going to take the regime ’ s provocations and hostility anymore . Obama sent them pallets of cash . Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper .
Anyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying . They don ’ t . But the commander in chief took out the world ’ s most notorious terrorist , one with plenty of American blood on his hands . Trump is the good guy here , not the terrorist .
Yet , Democrats couldn ’ t wait to pounce . How many statements included perfunctory “ yeah , Soleimani was a bad guy , but … ” construction before hammering Trump ?
Here ’ s a pro tip : If your statement has a “ but ” in the middle ( I ’ m looking at you , Elizabeth Warren ) , just eliminate the throat-clearing , political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean . We get it : Iranian Guy Bad , Orange Man Worse .
This attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election . Not just on foreign policy , but across the board ( they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression ) . They just can ’ t give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is , thanks at least in part to the president ’ s decisions .
It hasn ’ t always been this way . After the death of Osama bin Laden , Republicans praised Obama ’ s decision to get him .
“ Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared , ‘ The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation. ’ New York ’ s former mayor , Rudolph W. Giuliani , said , ‘ I admire the courage of the president. ’ And Donald J. Trump declared , ‘ I want to personally congratulate President Obama , ’ ” according to The New York Times .
But no such allowance is given to President Trump when he kills a terrorist . As commentator Guy Benson tweeted , “ The U.S. auto industry is alive , and ( Abu Bakr ) Baghdadi/Soleimani are dead , ” referencing the Islamic State leader Trump had killed a few months ago and recalling Obama ’ s reelection slogan .
Or , as Rod Serling might say , “ Democrats will soon wake up from their amnesia to an old lesson : Past is prologue . And it ’ s a Shakespearean seminar most acutely taken … in The Twilight Zone . ”

I have spent the past 20 or so New Years’ Eves glued to the SyFy channel’s “Twilight Zone” marathon. My wife and I love the writing, the plots and picking out famous actors in their one-off roles for the classic television series.

Maybe I’ll write an episode of my own, complete with a Rod Serling-worthy opening monologue: “The year is 2017. Donald Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States, and mass amnesia has washed over America. Half the country can no longer remember anything that happened before Jan. 20. The former president, Barack Obama, is literally sitting right there. Yet, his own party cannot remember one thing about his eight years …”

Obama memory hole

It is one of the strangest phenomena of the Trump era — the memory-holing of Obama’s executive powers. Democrats continuously act as though they’ve just fallen off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump does anything.

Trump’s illegal immigration policies are draconian! He’s deporting too many, they screamed, forgetting that … Obama deported more. A lot more. And, you know those cages on the southern border? Obama built them, not Trump.

Trump’s defying congressional subpoenas! No president has ever stonewalled Congress, they screamed, forgetting that Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, was held in contempt of Congress for … defying subpoenas related to the ""Fast and Furious"" gun operation scandal. There were at least eight other times when Obama’s administration defied congressional oversight, even preventing people from testifying (sound familiar?).

More from Scott Jennings:Which 2020 Democrat can beat Donald Trump? Don't bet on Biden, Warren or Sanders.

When Trump announced his “America First” policy during his inaugural, Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can.

Now, they howl over Trump’s latest outrage: The airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani, the general who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the U.S. Embassy and, evidently, plotting future hits on American targets.

Washington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent. This, after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.

Obama's drone strikes

“When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009, he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency. By his third year in office, Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned (at) Guantanamo Bay,” Newsweek reported.

Obama practically invented modern push-button warfare, for goodness’ sake! Eventually, the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump’s perfectly precedented decisions.

On Iran, Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren’t going to take the regime’s provocations and hostility anymore. Obama sent them pallets of cash. Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper.

Anyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying. They don’t. But the commander in chief took out the world’s most notorious terrorist, one with plenty of American blood on his hands. Trump is the good guy here, not the terrorist.

Yet, Democrats couldn’t wait to pounce. How many statements included perfunctory “yeah, Soleimani was a bad guy, but … ” construction before hammering Trump?

Here’s a pro tip: If your statement has a “but” in the middle (I’m looking at you, Elizabeth Warren), just eliminate the throat-clearing, political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean. We get it: Iranian Guy Bad, Orange Man Worse.

This attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election. Not just on foreign policy, but across the board (they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression). They just can’t give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is, thanks at least in part to the president’s decisions.

It hasn’t always been this way. After the death of Osama bin Laden, Republicans praised Obama’s decision to get him.

“Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, ‘The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.’ New York’s former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, ‘I admire the courage of the president.’ And Donald J. Trump declared, ‘I want to personally congratulate President Obama,’ ” according to The New York Times.

But no such allowance is given to President Trump when he kills a terrorist. As commentator Guy Benson tweeted, “The U.S. auto industry is alive, and (Abu Bakr) Baghdadi/Soleimani are dead,” referencing the Islamic State leader Trump had killed a few months ago and recalling Obama’s reelection slogan.

Or, as Rod Serling might say, “Democrats will soon wake up from their amnesia to an old lesson: Past is prologue. And it’s a Shakespearean seminar most acutely taken … in The Twilight Zone.”

The US military will send an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East as tensions build with Iran.

It recently stepped up production in response to the US tightening sanctions. The 2015 deal, from which the US has withdrawn, curbed Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said his country did not seek to wage war with any nation and had remained ""loyal"" to its international obligations.

Overnight three rockets hit a military base housing US troops north of Baghdad, the Iraqi military said. The US said it was ""indirect fire"" and did not cause injuries.

No group said it had carried out the attack, though it followed US warnings of an increased threat to US interests in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias.

What do we know about the extra troops?

Announcing the deployment, Mr Shanahan said the US did ""not seek conflict with Iran"" but the action had been taken to ""ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region to protect our national interests"".

He said the military would continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments to troop levels accordingly.

The 1,000 additional troops being despatched to the Middle East is presented as a prudent defensive measure by the Pentagon; the recent attacks on the two oil tankers being taken as a clear sign of Iran's hostile intent.

They join some 1,500 additional troops sent last month. Taken together, these deployments inevitably raise tensions but they are clearly not in any sense an assault force.

The other tanker damaged in the attacks was the Norwegian-owned Front Altair.

The US has implicated Iran in the latest attacks and four others outside the Strait of Hormuz in May, allegations denied by Iran.

How do other powers see the situation?

China urged the US to lower the pressure and for Iran to stick to the nuclear deal, warning of a ""Pandora's box"" in the region.

Saudi Arabia also blames Iran for the attacks on the two oil tankers, while the UK said it was ""almost certain"" Iran was behind the blasts.

But EU foreign ministers meeting on Monday warned against jumping to conclusions and backed UN calls for an independent investigation.

Why are there new tensions?

In 2015, Iran agreed to a landmark deal with world powers to curb its nuclear development.

It agreed to limit the enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, and other measures in return for relief from sanctions.

Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear accord last year and started to re-impose sanctions.

“We have a rocky relationship with our allies, and we need them to join with us to reconstitute the effort to bring Iran back to the negotiating table and get a good deal on their nuclear program,” he said.



Trump administration officials have repeatedly denied disagreements of substance with their European allies over Iran, with special representative Brian Hook repeating after Pompeo’s Brussels trip that “we agree on much more than we disagree.”

“The Europeans are usually behind us a bit on these things, so they get more nervous than they should from time to time,” Risch said. “I feel quite certain they will catch up to us in short order.”



By the end of the week, England at least said it shares the U.S. intelligence assessment. The statement did not mention the Pentagon briefing, but appeared designed to do damage control.

“@SecPompeo and I discussed #Iran last week in London and again in Brussels on Monday,” U.K. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted Thursday. “We share the same assessment of the heightened threat posed by Iran. As always we work closely with the US.”

Reports quoted Xi as saying : “ At present , the relevant parties must maintain restraint and avoid words and deeds that would exacerbate the tension on the Korean peninsula . ”
Trump has pushed China to pressure North Korea to halt a nuclear weapons programme that is nearing the capability of targeting the United States . China is the North ’ s biggest economic partner and source of aid .
Trump on Friday went further to turn the crisis into a personal battle of wills between him and Kim Jong-un , warning the North Korean leader he would “ truly regret ” hostile acts against US territory or US allies .
Donald Trump loyalists eager to back up his rhetoric on North Korea Read more
The warning came a few hours after an early morning tweet from the president that claimed US military options were “ locked and loaded ” for use if Pyongyang “ acted unwisely ” .
The tweet triggered worldwide alarm and a rebuke from the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , who said : “ I consider an escalation of rhetoric the wrong answer . ”
But Trump stood by his words when asked about them at his golf resort in New Jersey . “ I hope they are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said , and what I said is what I mean , ” he said . “ Those words are very , very easy to understand . ”
Trump then issued an ultimatum to Kim Jong-un himself . “ This man will not get away with what he ’ s doing , ” he said . “ If he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat … or if he does anything in respect to Guam or anyplace else that ’ s an American territory or an American ally , he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast . ”
Boris Johnson , the UK foreign secretary , said on Twitter that Britain was working with the US and other countries in the region to end the diplomatic crisis .
He said the international community stood “ shoulder to shoulder in ensuring North Korea stops its aggressive acts ” , adding :
Boris Johnson ( @ BorisJohnson ) The North Korean regime is the cause of this problem and they must fix it
The North Korean leadership has warned it will launch four missiles at the waters around US Pacific territory of Guam as a warning to the US if it persists with its practice sorties by long-range bombers based on the island .
Despite gung-ho language from the US president , there was no change in US deployments in the region or a change in the alert status of US forces . And it was reported on Friday that the Trump administration had reopened a channel of communication between US and North Korean diplomats at the UN .
According to the Associated Press , the “ New York channel ” had been broken off by North Korea in protest against sanctions in 2016 , but it was revived this year between Joseph Yun , the US envoy for North Korea policy , and Pak Song-il , a senior North Korean diplomat at the country ’ s UN mission .
The US state department said it had no comment on the report . It had previously been reported that there had been diplomatic contacts about US detainees in North Korea , but the new AP account said the talks addressed wider issues , although such contacts had so far failed to moderate the exchange of threats between the leaders of the two countries .
Asked about the report on Friday , Trump said : “ Well , we don ’ t want to talk about progress , we don ’ t want to talk about back channels .
“ We want to talk about a country that has misbehaved for many many years – decades , actually – through numerous administrations , and they didn ’ t want to take on the issue and I had no choice but to take it on , and I ’ m taking it on . And we ’ ll either be very , very successful quickly or we ’ re going to be very , very successful in a different way , quickly . ”
As for Merkel ’ s criticism earlier in the day , Trump said : “ Maybe she ’ s speaking for Germany ; let her speak for Germany . She ’ s a friend of mine , she ’ s a very good person , a very good woman , she ’ s a friend of Ivanka . Perhaps she is referring to Germany . She ’ s certainly not referring to the United States , that I can tell you . ”
In his comments , Trump made it clear that domestic political considerations played a role in shaping his rhetoric .
“ If somebody else uttered the exact same words that I uttered , they ’ d say : ‘ What a great statement , what a wonderful statement , ’ ” Trump said . “ But I will tell you , we have tens of millions of people in this country that are so happy with what I am saying , because they say , ‘ Finally , we have a president that ’ s sticking up for our nation and frankly , sticking up for our friends and our allies . ’ ”
Speaking to reporters in California , the US defence secretary , James Mattis , said a conflict on the Korean peninsula would be “ catastrophic ” and stressed that US diplomats should take the lead in resolving the crisis .
Mattis pointed to a UN security council vote at the weekend for more sanctions against North Korea as a sign that diplomacy was making progress .
Quick guide Are US defences strong enough to ward off North Korean missiles ? Show Hide What kind of anti-missile defences does the US possess ? The US has various anti-missile options , some designed to take down missiles at short-range and others for medium-to-long-range . The US relies heavily on the US Patriot missile and the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence ( THAAD ) . The US deployed THAAD to South Korea this year to defend against medium-range missiles . There is a three-phased defence system : ground-based missiles on the Korean peninsula ; US naval ships stationed in the Pacific ; and two bases in Alaska and California that can launch an estimated 36 interceptors .
Is the US system robust enough to stop a North Korean missile attack ? No air defence system offers anything like a complete guarantee of success . The Pentagon offer repeated assurances that air defence systems would be more than a match for any North Korean attack . But when missile defence systems have been put to the test over the last few decades , the performance has been far from reassuring .
The US provided anti-missile defence systems to Israel and Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War as protection against Iraq 's Scud missiles . It was initially claimed that they had shot down 41 of 42 missiles fired by Iraq . But eventually it was acknowledged that only a few missiles had been hit .
Recent tests of interceptors have provided little comfort – with success rates of around 50 % on average . The Pentagon celebrated in May when it destroyed a mock warhead over the Pacific but overall the performance has been spotty . Since the newest intercept system was introduced in 2004 only four of nine intercept attempts have been successful . Of the five tests since 2010 , only two have been successful .
However , Friday ’ s tweet , sent out by Trump at about 7.30am from his golf resort in Bedminster , New Jersey , put the emphasis back on the use of force :
Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) Military solutions are now fully in place , locked and loaded , should North Korea act unwisely . Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path !
A White House official later played down the significance of the tweet , saying there were continuously updated military contingency plans for any global crisis . “ This isn ’ t anything new , ” the official said , according to CNN .
The contingency plan for war on the Korean peninsula , Oplan 5027 , envisages a build-up of the US military , including half the US navy and more than 1,000 aircraft in the region , over 90 days . More than 200,000 US civilians would also have to be evacuated .
Later on Friday morning , the president retweeted US Pacific command , which had posted pictures of B-1B Lancer heavy bombers on exercises over the Pacific with the Japanese and South Korean air forces on 7 August , accompanied by text saying the planes were ready to fulfil the “ ready to fight tonight ” mission of US forces in South Korea , “ if called upon to do so ” .
Trump ’ s messages continued a war of words between the president and North Korea that ignited on Tuesday when Trump , following reports of a breakthrough in Pyongyang ’ s weapons programme , threatened to unleash “ fire and fury like the world has never seen ” on North Korea if the regime continued to threaten the US .
Kim Jong-un ’ s government responded the next day by deriding Trump ’ s remarks as a “ lot of nonsense ” and publishing detailed plans to launch missiles to land in the waters around the US Pacific territory of Guam .
Pyongyang has warned that continued practice sorties by B-1B bombers over South Korea would trigger the launch of the four Hwasong-12 intermediate-range missiles that would be aimed at the waters around their base on Guam .
“ This grave situation requires the KPA [ Korean People ’ s Army ] to closely watch Guam , the outpost and beachhead for invading the DPRK , and necessarily take practical actions of significance to neutralise it , ” a KPA spokesman said on the state news service .
It added that the missile launch , if ordered , would aim “ to contain the US major military bases on Guam , including the Andersen air force base , in which the US strategic bombers , which get on the nerves of the DPRK and threaten and blackmail it through their frequent visits to the sky above South Korea , are stationed , and to send a serious warning signal to the US ” .
The B-1 bombers have been modified so as to be non-nuclear capable , but the North Korean statement identifies them as “ nuclear strategic bombers ” , one of many examples of misperceptions and overheated rhetoric that fog the Korean standoff .
“ The United States should think carefully about authorizing further B-1 flights . Leadership may decide to defy the North Korean threat , but should make that decision consciously and take measures to limit the risk of that action , ” said Adam Mount , an expert on North Korea at the Center for American Progress .
The Guam authorities issued new emergency guidelines on Friday that included advice of what to do in the event of a nuclear attack .
“ Do not look at the flash or fireball – it can blind you , ” the fact sheet said . “ Take cover behind anything that might offer protection . ”
Asked about the potential for military confrontation , Mattis told reporters it was his responsibility to prepare “ military options should they be needed ” .
But he warned : “ The tragedy of war is well enough known ; it doesn ’ t need another characterisation , beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic . ”
Alongside its missiles and nuclear warheads , North Korea has thousands of pieces of heavy artillery , capable of inflicting devastating damage on Seoul .
The US has about 35,000 troops stationed in South Korea and 40,000 in Japan . They have not been put on a higher alert or redeployed in recent days despite the heated rhetoric .
Malcolm Nance , a former naval intelligence officer , said that there had been none of the normal indicators of heightened alert at US bases in the region .
“ We are not ready for even a small action size of Libya much less Korean War 2.0 , ” Nance said in a tweet . “ This talk of Locked & Loaded is irresponsible madness . ”

Trump was due to interrupt his working holiday for a lightning visit to Washington on Monday , according to one report . But it was not clear whether the trip was connected to the North Korean stand-off , and there are secure facilities at his Bedminster golf club where he can discuss national security matters .
The North Korean military has said its planned missile test aimed at the sea around Guam will be ready for launch on orders of the country ’ s leader from mid-August .
In his remarks , however , Mattis repeatedly underlined the role of diplomacy and non-military pressure on Pyongyang , and the key roles played by the secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , and the US envoy to the United Nations , Nikki Haley .

The Missile Defense Agency launched a ground-based interceptor from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to intercept a US-launched mock ICBM target over the Pacific Ocean , according to a US defense official .
The test ICBM , which flew thousands of miles per hour , was destroyed `` thousands of miles off the coast '' of the US mainland , with the intercept taking place northeast of Hawaii , the director of the Missile Defense Agency , Vice Adm. Jim Syring , told reporters at the Pentagon via a Wednesday phone call .
The interceptor `` destroyed the target in a direct collision , '' according to a statement from the Missile Defense Agency .
`` The intercept of a complex , threat-representative ICBM target is an incredible accomplishment ... and a critical milestone for this program , '' Syring said in a statement shortly after the test .
`` This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland , and this test demonstrates that we have a capable , credible deterrent against a very real threat , '' he said .
`` Everything we did was operationally realistic , '' Syring told reporters , adding that `` decoys '' were deployed by the target ICBM to make the test more realistic .
He said that the test ICBM `` flew at a higher altitude and a longer range and a higher velocity than any other target we 've flown to date . ''
He said the designers of the test ICBM worked with the intelligence community in order to replicate a realistic Iranian or North Korean threat that the US might face between now and 2020 .
`` I was confident before the test that we have the capability to defeat any threat that they would throw at us and I am more confident -- even more confident today , '' Syring added .
`` We are launching an interceptor that is flying thousands of miles past Hawaii and that requires us to shut down large parts of the ocean in terms of mariner ship traffic and air traffic , '' he said .
The next test will take place in August/September 2018 and will involve multiple interceptors attempting to take out a single test ICBM .
`` We shoot more than one in a real world operational scenario , '' Syring said .
While the Pentagon is calling this test a success , some experts cautioned that the $ 40 billion missile defense system still has a long way to go before it can be considered fully developed .
`` It marks two successes in a row , which is significant , but only two hits out of the last five attempts ; that is , only a 40 % success rate since early 2010 , '' said Philip E. Coyle , a senior fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .
`` In school , 40 % is n't a passing grade , '' added Coyle , who formerly headed the Pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation . `` Based on its testing record , we can not rely upon this missile defense program to protect the United States from a North Korean long-range missile . ''
Washington Rep. Adam Smith , the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee , congratulated the Missile Defense Agency for a successful test but sounded a note of caution that `` much work remains to be done to ensure we have a reliable and effective system . ''
`` After an investment of more than $ 40 billion since 2002 , it 's good that the Missile Defense Agency is finally doing a missile defense test against an ICBM target , some 13 years after the first Ground-Based Interceptor system 's deployment , '' Smith told CNN .
`` Flight intercept testing , particularly against realistic targets , remains a key element of the program to assess the effectiveness of our deployed missile defense system , as well as to demonstrate the capability and continue the development of such a system , '' he added .
The test comes just two days after Pyongyang fired a short-range ballistic missile that traveled an estimated 248 miles , splashing down within Japan 's exclusive economic zone .
In a Monday tweet , President Donald Trump joined the leaders of South Korea and Japan in condemning the test , saying that North Korea had `` shown great disrespect '' for China by `` shooting off yet another ballistic missile . ''

The Pentagon insists the long-planned test of its ground-based interceptor system is not solely about North Korea , and the test is aimed at being able to challenge any threatening ICBM , including possibly from Iran in the future .
That test involved firing a new version of the military 's single long-range ground-based interceptor missile , which is currently based in Alaska and California . That program has also been in existence for more than a decade but only about half of the tests have been successful , according to the Defense Department . US officials often call it a high-speed effort to hit a bullet with another bullet .
In the most recent Pentagon report examining weapons testing across the Department of Defense , this long-range system was criticized , saying it `` demonstrates a limited capability to defend the US homeland from small numbers of simple intermediate-range or intercontinental ballistic missile threats launched from North Korea or Iran . ''
The report went on to say the Defense Department continues to discover new failure modes during testing .
In Tuesday 's test , an interceptor missile was launched from Vandenberg and intercepted a simulated threat missile over the Pacific Ocean launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands .
The interceptor tested had an upgraded `` kill '' vehicle -- to hit the incoming missile , as well as an upgraded booster and improved guidance .
With this pre-programmed test , the Pentagon was looking to see specifically how all these components performed and what additional improvements needed to be made . It is widely acknowledged that in a real world attack , several interceptors would be launched to maximize the chance of quickly destroying the incoming threat .
Last week , Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told Congress , `` North Korea is an increasingly grave national security threat to the United States because of its growing missile and nuclear capabilities combined with the aggressive approach of its leader Kim Jong Un . Kim is attempting to prove that he has the capability to strike the US mainland with a nuclear weapon . ''
Sen. John McCain , the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said in an interview Sunday that it would not be acceptable for North Korea to acquire an intercontinental ballistic missile , saying the US should not be reliant solely upon missile defense to ward off the threat .
`` I do n't think it 's acceptable for the United States of America to have an intercontinental ballistic missile -- or a missile aimed at Australia -- with a nuclear weapon on it , and depend on our ability to counter it with an anti-missile capability , '' McCain told Australia 's ABC .
He added that the situation on the Korean Peninsula had the potential to mirror the Cuban Missile Crisis unless Pyongyang is curbed , calling on China to do more .

WASHINGTON — Most Americans believe that President Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Syrian border has damaged America’s reputation around the world as a reliable ally, a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds.

Even Republicans, typically in Trump’s corner, by 44%-36% say the nation’s reputation has been hurt.

Many of those surveyed express uncertainty about what to think; only half say they are very or somewhat familiar with rapidly changing developments in the region. The abrupt U.S. withdrawal opened the door to a Turkish military assault on the Kurds, who had been aligned with U.S. forces against ISIS. The White House announced Thursday that Turkey had agreed to a five-day ceasefire to allow Kurds to withdraw from the area.

Overall, a 37% plurality of Americans calls the president’s decision to withdraw the small contingent of U.S. troops wrong because it upset stability in a dangerous region; 27% say it was right because the United States has too many military commitments around the world. More than one in four Republicans see the decision as wrong.

Brian Hook , the special representative for Iran , was in Los Angeles to talk about US policy toward Iran . But by the time he stepped to the podium , he was already more than an hour late , having spent much of the day on a secure line speaking to US officials in Washington including his boss , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo .
`` The peoples of Iraq and Lebanon and Iran , they want their country back , '' Hook said . `` And they are tired of Iran being unable to stay within its own borders . Thank you . ''
With that , Hook walked briskly off stage . America 's defense apparatus was spinning into action .
Minutes earlier , US intelligence satellites had picked up signs of a heat signature from Iran , suggesting the country had just launched short range ballistic missiles . The US knew an impending attack was likely , thanks to a tip from the Iraqi government , which had been told by the Iranians an attack was coming and which bases to avoid .
Still , using information from the satellites and US aircraft in the region -- which had intercepted Iranian communications -- US intelligence analysts quickly determined that two bases in Iraq were the targets , al-Asad and Erbil . Within minutes , US troops stationed there were warned . They 'd already been on high alert and sought safety in bunkers , according to a source familiar .
Troops took short-term cover the day before out of a concern of a possible attack . Now , the threat was imminent , and the troops were told of incoming missiles .
At 7:30 p.m . ET , the official announcement went out : Iran had launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against US military and coalition forces in Iraq .
Just five days after killing Iran 's top military leader , Qasem Soleimani , in a drone strike in Baghdad , this was the moment that the Trump administration had been preparing for -- a direct retaliatory attack from Iran .
News of the missile strike came as the administration had spent days stuck in a chaotic series of self-inflicted wounds . First , Trump had threatened to target Iranian cultural sites . Then there was the shocking letter announcing the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq that the Pentagon had to walk back as `` a mistake . ''
It all raised questions about the administration 's handling of the situation , and even had some Republican allies of the President privately expressing concern about whether the administration was truly prepared to deal with the events it had unleashed with the Soleimani strike .
The moment was n't lost on Trump 's top aides , who convened in the basement Situation Room knowing that the ensuing hours could redeem a chaotic several days -- or cement the impression of a rudderless ship .
On Tuesday evening , aides watched as the situation went from the potential for dramatic conflict to one that seemed to offer Trump a new opportunity to deescalate . Bolstered by incoming messages from Iran sent through back-channels , Trump 's aides realized the damage would be limited .
`` Iran appears to be standing down , which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world , '' Trump said on Wednesday morning .
The following account of the events that unfolded over the past are based on interviews with dozens of Trump administration officials , foreign diplomats , as well as staffers and top lawmakers on the Hill .
Within an hour of the strikes , leaders on Capitol Hill were being briefed . In the House , Speaker Nancy Pelosi was discussing the situation in Iran with a group of top Democrats when she was handed a note with news of a rocket attack on a US military base in Iraq . Among those present was Rep. Dan Kildee , who told CNN that Pelosi paused the discussion to alert members of the situation . `` Pray , '' Pelosi told members , according to Rep. Debbie Dingel .
Not long after , Pelosi got on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence , who briefed her on the Iranian attacks . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also received a call from Pence around the same time and was briefed on the attack .
Meanwhile , GOP leaders were getting briefed directly by the President .
At the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense Mark Esper met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and senior defense officials as soon as he got word of the attack . Less than an hour after news broke of the Iranian strike , Esper 's office reached out to Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul al-Mahdi , who just days earlier had criticized the US drone strike on Soleimani as a `` flagrant violation of the conditions for the presence of the American forces in Iraq . ''
At first Esper 's team could n't get through . It was around 3 a.m. in Baghdad and the number the Pentagon had for Mahdi 's office was n't working , said a source familiar with the outreach . They contacted the ambassador in Washington at home , who managed to connect the two parties .
After making a few calls to senior congressional officials , Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , headed to the White House .
Just before 7:30 p.m . ET , Esper , Milley and Pompeo all pulled up to the White House within a few minutes of each other . Pompeo arrived first . As he waited for the others , Pompeo turned the light on in the back seat of his Cadillac sedan and was reading from two cellphones . Once the other two cars arrived , Pompeo , Esper and Milley all entered the West Wing together .
Soon , a group of senior administration officials were gathered in the Situation Room . Along with Pence , Pompeo , Esper and Milley , the group included national security adviser Robert O'Brien , acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney . White House counsel Pat Cippolone and press secretary Stephanie Grisham were there , while CIA Director Gina Haspel joined by teleconference .
The first objective was to determine whether any Americans had died in the strike . A senator who spoke with Trump told CNN the President appeared ready to attack Iranian facilities had there been even one American casualty . Though it took well into the night to confirm , the early evidence suggested there had not been any American deaths .
That lack of casualties fed a sense of restraint in the room , according to sources . While some consideration was given to striking back at Iran that night , according to one White House official , the decision was made to hold off until more information came in regarding Iran 's intentions and the conditions on the ground .
One of the initial reactions in the room was one of surprise that the Iranians fired so few missiles out of their arsenal of thousands , this source said . That , along with the expectation that Iran was always going to strike back , created a sense of calm . Though there was an obvious level of tension given the high stakes , part of the reason the group was more relaxed was the initial view among many administration officials that Iranians were more bent on sending a message than in killing Americans .
One source pointed to how accurate Iranians have been in the past with its ballistic missiles , such as the attack a Saudi oil refinery , suggesting the attack could have been lethal .
Within hours of the strike , the President had made clear he wanted to make a public address and began dictating an outline of what it should look like , according to a person familiar . As Trump and his advisers continued to meet in the Situation Room , aides began making urgent plans for an address to the nation , including prepping the Oval Office . The framework of a speech started coming together with aide Stephen Miller at the helm and senior advisers weighing in .
Over the past few days , top White House officials expressed regret that Trump had n't addressed the nation sooner after the strike that killed Soleimani , and worried he 'd missed a chance to shape the narrative in his favor . Right after the strike , White House aide and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner was among those pushing Trump to give a speech , but the decision was made to hold off .
On the Hill , Republican leaders were getting constant updates from the White House , including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. James Inhofe . The overall message to the White House from Republicans , according to a number of sources , was one of restraint , and that this was a moment for de-escalation .
In the end , White House officials said Trump would not emerge on Tuesday night to make an address . The news was met with a collective sigh of relief on the Hill , according to several GOP aides who spoke to CNN .
Around 9 p.m . ET , Trump began making calls to several GOP lawmakers , including Inhofe , who told reporters Wednesday the President was in a `` very , very positive '' mood and said he was willing to negotiate with Iran . Inhofe agreed , telling the President this was an opportunity to not just de-escalate but start negotiations .
At 9:45 p.m . ET , Trump tweeted , `` All is well ! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq . Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now . So far , so good ! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world , by far ! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning . ''
Starting late Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning , Iran initiated contact with the administration through at least three back channels , including Switzerland and other countries , according to a senior administration official . The message from Iran was clear : This would be their only response . They would now wait to see what the US would do .
As part of its response back , the US conveyed that it was fully aware that Iran controls its proxies in the region , including Hezbollah . The source told CNN that Iran tried to `` squeak out of it , '' saying they are not responsible for those proxies , but the US made clear it did n't buy that argument .
By around 1 a.m . ET , the battleground assessment came in , confirming no US casualties . Working through the night without sleep in secure rooms at the White House , national security teams put response options together , including plans to sanction Iran .
By early Wednesday morning , teams met again with the President , who was given an update on the latest assessment . That 's when Trump made the final decision that the US response would be sanctions , signaling to advisers that the threat of escalation was off the table .
`` They 've stepped back -- now we 've taken a bit of a step back , '' said a senior administration official .
Trump then began making his own edits on the draft of the speech , as did a handful of other national security advisers including Esper , Pompeo and Milley . As the White House prepared for an 11 a.m . ET address to the nation , advisers kept weighing in on the draft of the President 's remarks , delaying Trump 's address by nearly half an hour .
As junior staffers and reporters crowded into the red-carpet lined White House foyer , the President 's top national security officials -- many wearing their military uniforms -- lined up on either side of the podium .
The wooden doors opened behind them and Trump -- silhouetted by late-morning sun -- emerged .","Washington (CNN) America's top diplomat on Iran was only a few minutes into a speech on Tuesday afternoon when he was handed an urgent note.

On Tuesday evening, aides watched as the situation went from the potential for dramatic conflict to one that seemed to offer Trump a new opportunity to deescalate. Bolstered by incoming messages from Iran sent through back-channels, Trump's aides realized the damage would be limited.

""Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,"" Trump said on Wednesday morning.

The following account of the events that unfolded over the past are based on interviews with dozens of Trump administration officials, foreign diplomats, as well as staffers and top lawmakers on the Hill.

Scramble to inform

Within an hour of the strikes, leaders on Capitol Hill were being briefed. In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was discussing the situation in Iran with a group of top Democrats when she was handed a note with news of a rocket attack on a US military base in Iraq. Among those present was Rep. Dan Kildee, who told CNN that Pelosi paused the discussion to alert members of the situation. ""Pray,"" Pelosi told members, according to Rep. Debbie Dingel.

Not long after, Pelosi got on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who briefed her on the Iranian attacks. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also received a call from Pence around the same time and was briefed on the attack.

Meanwhile, GOP leaders were getting briefed directly by the President.

At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and senior defense officials as soon as he got word of the attack. Less than an hour after news broke of the Iranian strike, Esper's office reached out to Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul al-Mahdi, who just days earlier had criticized the US drone strike on Soleimani as a ""flagrant violation of the conditions for the presence of the American forces in Iraq.""

At first Esper's team couldn't get through. It was around 3 a.m. in Baghdad and the number the Pentagon had for Mahdi's office wasn't working, said a source familiar with the outreach. They contacted the ambassador in Washington at home, who managed to connect the two parties.

After making a few calls to senior congressional officials, Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed to the White House.

In the Situation Room

Just before 7:30 p.m. ET, Esper, Milley and Pompeo all pulled up to the White House within a few minutes of each other. Pompeo arrived first. As he waited for the others, Pompeo turned the light on in the back seat of his Cadillac sedan and was reading from two cellphones. Once the other two cars arrived, Pompeo, Esper and Milley all entered the West Wing together.

Soon, a group of senior administration officials were gathered in the Situation Room. Along with Pence, Pompeo, Esper and Milley, the group included national security adviser Robert O'Brien, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. White House counsel Pat Cippolone and press secretary Stephanie Grisham were there, while CIA Director Gina Haspel joined by teleconference.

The first objective was to determine whether any Americans had died in the strike. A senator who spoke with Trump told CNN the President appeared ready to attack Iranian facilities had there been even one American casualty. Though it took well into the night to confirm, the early evidence suggested there had not been any American deaths.

That lack of casualties fed a sense of restraint in the room, according to sources. While some consideration was given to striking back at Iran that night, according to one White House official, the decision was made to hold off until more information came in regarding Iran's intentions and the conditions on the ground.

One of the initial reactions in the room was one of surprise that the Iranians fired so few missiles out of their arsenal of thousands, this source said. That, along with the expectation that Iran was always going to strike back, created a sense of calm. Though there was an obvious level of tension given the high stakes, part of the reason the group was more relaxed was the initial view among many administration officials that Iranians were more bent on sending a message than in killing Americans.

One source pointed to how accurate Iranians have been in the past with its ballistic missiles, such as the attack a Saudi oil refinery, suggesting the attack could have been lethal.

Within hours of the strike, the President had made clear he wanted to make a public address and began dictating an outline of what it should look like, according to a person familiar. As Trump and his advisers continued to meet in the Situation Room, aides began making urgent plans for an address to the nation, including prepping the Oval Office. The framework of a speech started coming together with aide Stephen Miller at the helm and senior advisers weighing in.

Over the past few days, top White House officials expressed regret that Trump hadn't addressed the nation sooner after the strike that killed Soleimani, and worried he'd missed a chance to shape the narrative in his favor. Right after the strike, White House aide and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner was among those pushing Trump to give a speech, but the decision was made to hold off.

On the Hill, Republican leaders were getting constant updates from the White House, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. James Inhofe. The overall message to the White House from Republicans, according to a number of sources, was one of restraint, and that this was a moment for de-escalation.

In the end, White House officials said Trump would not emerge on Tuesday night to make an address. The news was met with a collective sigh of relief on the Hill, according to several GOP aides who spoke to CNN.

Around 9 p.m. ET, Trump began making calls to several GOP lawmakers, including Inhofe, who told reporters Wednesday the President was in a ""very, very positive"" mood and said he was willing to negotiate with Iran. Inhofe agreed, telling the President this was an opportunity to not just de-escalate but start negotiations.

At 9:45 p.m. ET, Trump tweeted, ""All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.""

But the night was far from over.

Iran Back Channels

Starting late Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, Iran initiated contact with the administration through at least three back channels, including Switzerland and other countries, according to a senior administration official. The message from Iran was clear: This would be their only response. They would now wait to see what the US would do.

As part of its response back, the US conveyed that it was fully aware that Iran controls its proxies in the region, including Hezbollah. The source told CNN that Iran tried to ""squeak out of it,"" saying they are not responsible for those proxies, but the US made clear it didn't buy that argument.

By around 1 a.m. ET, the battleground assessment came in, confirming no US casualties . Working through the night without sleep in secure rooms at the White House, national security teams put response options together, including plans to sanction Iran.

By early Wednesday morning, teams met again with the President, who was given an update on the latest assessment. That's when Trump made the final decision that the US response would be sanctions, signaling to advisers that the threat of escalation was off the table.

""They've stepped back -- now we've taken a bit of a step back,"" said a senior administration official.

Trump then began making his own edits on the draft of the speech, as did a handful of other national security advisers including Esper, Pompeo and Milley. As the White House prepared for an 11 a.m. ET address to the nation, advisers kept weighing in on the draft of the President's remarks, delaying Trump's address by nearly half an hour.

As junior staffers and reporters crowded into the red-carpet lined White House foyer, the President's top national security officials -- many wearing their military uniforms -- lined up on either side of the podium.

The wooden doors opened behind them and Trump -- silhouetted by late-morning sun -- emerged.",www.cnn.com,left,bwp1Bpe53IKbcevf

Bringing fiber optic internet to every home in America



For years the United States has thrown untold billions at telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast in exchange for a rotating crop of jobs and broadband promises that, time and time again, mysteriously never arrive. The result: some of the highest prices and slowest speeds in the developed world.



A 2012 report by Goldman Sachs suggested it would cost America roughly $140 billion to bring a fiber optic line to every home in America, permanently freeing the entire country from Comcast’s grasp. Those estimates have dropped in recent years, with one recent report suggesting it would cost as little as $14 billion if fiber was included alongside highway builds.

Patching the broken U.S. healthcare system

The U.S.’s terrible telecom market pales in comparison to U.S. healthcare, which routinely ranks among the worst in the developed world. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S. healthcare costs ballooned to $3.5 trillion in 2017 alone—$10,739 per person.

Estimates to repair our often tragic healthcare system vary dramatically, but there’s countless areas where the F-35’s $435 billion budget could have paid huge dividends.

It could also fund research into raging, poorly understood pandemics like Lyme Disease, which receives a tiny fraction ($31 million) of the annual research money earmarked for countless, often ridiculous military projects.

Repairing America's crumbling infrastructure



Nearly 235,000—or roughly 38 percent of all U.S. bridges—are in dire need of replacement or repair according to a recent study by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association. The group estimates that it would cost somewhere around $171 billion to repair all of them.

Fixing poverty

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) doled out an estimated $2.3 trillion in tax breaks for giant corporations in exchange for little to nothing. A small fraction of that money could have all but eliminated poverty across the United States, with a healthy chunk of change left over to contribute to America’s affordable housing crisis.

Another 2012 estimate suggested that poverty could be eliminated for somewhere around $175 billion, more than covered by the F-35’s bloated budget.

Abolishing student loan debt

A 2018 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicated that 44.7 million Americans held roughly $1.47 trillion in student loan debt. Another Federal Reserve study indicated that the average student loan payment is somewhere between $200 and $300 per month, increasingly spent on degrees from predatory universities that often aren’t worth the paper they’re printed on.

national_defense,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/opinions/hillary-clinton-commander-in-chief-opinion-bergen/index.html,OPINION: What kind of commander in chief would Hillary Clinton be?,2016-06-02,Peter Bergen,"Peter Bergen is CNN 's national security analyst , a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University . He is the author of the new book `` United States of Jihad : Investigating America 's Homegrown Terrorists . ''
( CNN ) In what may have been the most forceful speech of her career , Hillary Clinton said in San Diego on Thursday that electing Donald Trump as commander in chief would be `` an historic mistake '' because of his `` dangerously incoherent '' foreign policy ideas and his `` temperament . ''
This raises the question : If Clinton were to become president , what kind of commander in chief would she be , and how might her approach differ from Trump 's ?
Clinton , unlike Trump , has an extensive foreign policy record to examine based on her four-year tenure as secretary of state , which can help us understand how she might operate as commander in chief .
As secretary of state , for example , she presided over the effort in 2010 to significantly tighten sanctions on Iran , which helped to bring the Iranians , eventually , to the negotiating table on their nuclear program . This diplomatic effort resulted in a 12 to 2 vote in the U.N. Security Council to enhance sanctions against Iran , `` one of her major achievements as secretary of state '' according to New York Times ' reporter Mark Landler in his excellent new book `` Alter Egos . ''
This move highlights what could perhaps be most distinctive about Hillary Clinton as president : her refusal to be typecast as either hawk or dove . Instead , she has long been resolutely both , advocating for military interventions in Iraq , Libya , Afghanistan and Syria while also being unafraid to express her support -- as in one noteworthy 2011 episode in which she and then-CIA director Leon Panetta got into a shouting match over CIA drone strikes in Pakistani territory -- for critiques of the use of force .
It is this record as both hawk and dove that suggests some of the contours of what a Clinton foreign policy would look like .
What is also very clear from her record is that Hillary Clinton is now and presumably would continue to be as president a hawk who is also willing to negotiate . When it comes to foreign policy , these are the qualities we should most associate with effective commanders in chief .
As president , either Clinton or Trump will have to navigate the two big ideas in American foreign policy : isolationism and interventionism . As was memorably defined by U.S. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams in 1821 , isolationism means : `` America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy . She is the well wisher to freedom and independence of all . She is the champion and vindicator only of her own . '' In other words , the United States will not become embroiled in foreign conflicts over ideals like `` freedom '' and `` democracy '' and will instead concentrate on strengthening itself at home .
By contrast , interventionism stipulates that the United States needs to uphold -- and even enforce -- global order and liberty not only because it 's the right thing to do , but also because it 's very much in America 's own interests , a view best expressed by John F. Kennedy in his 1961 inaugural address at the height of the Cold War when he said , `` We shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty . ''
Over the past century the United States has swung back and forth between periods of isolationism and interventionism . Isolationism kept America out of World War I until the end of the conflict and it was relatively late to send troops to join the alliance fighting the Axis powers during World War II . After that war , America emerged as the dominant world force of interventionism , spearheading the global architecture of NATO , the United Nations , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that has helped to sustain America 's position as the world 's only superpower .
Then the George W. Bush administration came into office promising a period of relative isolationism and opposition to `` nation building . '' Condoleezza Rice , Bush 's national security advisor , had famously opined , `` We really do n't need the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten . ''
9/11 , of course , changed all that . The Bush administration engaged in long and protracted multi-trillion-dollar nation-building efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq .
So how do Clinton and Trump fit into this long history of American isolationism and interventionism ?
To the extent that Trump has laid out his vision of foreign policy , he is a neo-isolationist . He has famously called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration , proposed building a wall along the Mexican border , and suggested a rethinking of the NATO alliance , which he described as `` obsolete '' to The New York Times in April . He also explained to the Times , `` We can not be the policeman of the world . ''
Trump is also an `` America first '' populist who has said he would torture terrorism suspects , kill their families and `` bomb the s .. t out of ISIS , '' in so doing indiscriminately bombing the cities in Iraq and Syria into which ISIS fighters have burrowed themselves . These kinds of actions are deemed to be war crimes by , among many others , the U.S. military .
Clinton , on the other hand , is very much part of the American foreign policy establishment , which for the past several decades has viewed the United States as an `` exceptional country , '' a phrase that Clinton used in her San Diego speech on Thursday . This view of the United States ' proper role in the world also comes freighted with responsibilities to act around the globe to promote both American values and interests .
In Clinton 's 2014 book `` Hard Choices , '' about her time as secretary of state , she recounted the attacks two years earlier on the U.S. diplomatic outpost and CIA facility in Benghazi , Libya , in which four Americans were killed . Clinton concluded that despite the tragic losses of life , `` Retreat is not the answer ; it wo n't make the world a safer place , and it 's just not in our country 's DNA . ''
Clinton 's record at the State Department demonstrates that she is an interventionist who is quite comfortable with the use of American military power , but at the same time she is willing to pursue negotiations with traditional American rivals such as Iran and the Taliban whenever the right kind of openings seem to present themselves .
Clinton 's vote for the Iraq War in 2003 when she was a senator is , of course , Exhibit A in any discussion of her record on national security . In `` Hard Choices '' she stated clearly , `` I was n't alone in getting it wrong . But I still got it wrong . Plain and simple . ''
Her vote on the Iraq War , however , did not make Clinton skeptical of the efficacy of American military power when the occasion seemed to merit it .
The first big national security decision the Obama administration faced in early 2009 was what to do about the worsening situation in Afghanistan , where the Taliban were gaining ground . The U.S. military advocated a substantial surge of troops to blunt the Taliban 's momentum .
Clinton sided with the generals arguing for a well-resourced counterinsurgency campaign ( over the objections of Vice President Joe Biden ) and endorsed a surge of 40,000 troops .
In the end , Obama authorized 30,000 troops , but also ordered their withdrawal after 18 months , disclosing a timetable that Clinton says she was uncomfortable with . As she put it in `` Hard Choices , '' `` I thought there was a benefit in playing our cards closer to our chests . ''
Clinton 's embrace of the generals ' plans for Afghanistan underlines her warm -- and , to some , surprising -- relations with some of the more hawkish officers in the U.S military , chief among them retired Gen. Jack Keane , a Fox News analyst , who played an important role in helping lay the groundwork for George W. Bush 's surge of troops into Iraq in 2007 and who , according to Times reporter Landler , is `` perhaps the greatest single influence on the way Hillary Clinton thinks about military issues . ''
Clinton also took a hawkish position when Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi threatened to exterminate swaths of his population in 2011 , playing the lead role in cobbling together an unusual coalition of NATO and Arab states that ended up removing Gadhafi from power .
This would turn out to be the Obama administration 's largest unforced error overseas , because -- just as was the case in Iraq in 2003 during the overthrow of Saddam Hussein -- there was not enough consideration given to what `` the day after '' would look like . Libya today is mired in a nasty civil war in which ISIS has gained a significant foothold .
Clinton was unafraid to promote hawkish positions even to a reluctant President Obama . Early on in their fight against the Syrian dictator , Bashar al-Assad , in 2012 Clinton urged the arming of `` moderate '' Syrian rebels . At the time , Obama nixed this idea but later he would come to embrace it . Another substantive difference with Obama is Clinton 's advocacy of a `` no-fly '' zone in northern Syria to protect Syrian citizens from Assad 's air force , which enjoys total air superiority and has killed untold thousands in indiscriminate airstrikes on civilian areas .
Most memorably , Clinton was the most senior official in Obama 's Cabinet urging that U.S. Navy SEALS be deployed to capture or kill Osama bin Laden . On April 28 , 2011 , Obama 's war Cabinet gathered in the Situation Room for the final meeting to consider the potential bin Laden raid . Obama asked his senior advisers for their views . Secretary of Defense Robert Gates urged caution and advised against the SEAL raid . So , too , did Vice President Biden . Clinton said the raid was the best option on the table .
Yet Clinton is far from merely a hawk . Clinton 's director of policy planning at the State Department , Jake Sullivan , played a key role in secret back-channel negotiations with the Iranians beginning in 2011 that were facilitated by the Sultan of Oman . These negotiations eventually bore fruit four years later with Iran 's agreement to suspend its nuclear weapons program .
Less successful were similar back-channel peace negotiations with the Taliban overseen by veteran U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke , whose office at the State Department opened up secret talks with representatives of Taliban 's leader Mullah Omar that largely fizzled .
And it was Clinton who oversaw the rapprochement with the pro-Chinese military junta ruling what they termed Myanmar and the rest of the world knows better as Burma . That rapprochement , beginning in 2011 , set the condition for elections four years later that brought to power in a landslide the Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi , who had spent a decade and a half under house arrest and with whom Clinton enjoys a particularly warm relationship .
With these experiences to draw upon , what would a President Clinton 's foreign policy look like ?
To a degree , she would probably be somewhat more interventionist than the Obama administration has been . On Afghanistan , where the Taliban is again taking territory , she would likely not follow what has ( until recently ) been the Obama administration 's policy , which is a withdrawal of U.S. forces .
On ISIS and Syria , she would not send in a large American Army . `` I do not believe that we should again have a hundred-thousand American troops in combat in the Middle East , '' she said in November . She would , as she explained in her San Diego speech , `` step up the air campaign '' against ISIS , while also continuing the Obama administration 's policy of strangling the sources of ISIS finances , its propaganda arm in cyberspace , and its flow of foreign recruits .
On China , Clinton has very nuanced views . In `` Hard Choices '' she wrote , `` This is n't a relationship that fits neatly into categories like friend or rival , and it may never . '' She therefore would likely continue to shore up American alliances with China 's neighbors such as Burma , but she would also not needlessly antagonize the Chinese . They are , after all , effectively America 's bankers since the United States owes Chinese banks more than a trillion dollars .","Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book "" United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists .""

(CNN) In what may have been the most forceful speech of her career, Hillary Clinton said in San Diego on Thursday that electing Donald Trump as commander in chief would be ""an historic mistake"" because of his ""dangerously incoherent"" foreign policy ideas and his ""temperament.""

This raises the question: If Clinton were to become president, what kind of commander in chief would she be, and how might her approach differ from Trump's?

Clinton, unlike Trump, has an extensive foreign policy record to examine based on her four-year tenure as secretary of state, which can help us understand how she might operate as commander in chief.

As secretary of state, for example, she presided over the effort in 2010 to significantly tighten sanctions on Iran, which helped to bring the Iranians, eventually, to the negotiating table on their nuclear program. This diplomatic effort resulted in a 12 to 2 vote in the U.N. Security Council to enhance sanctions against Iran, ""one of her major achievements as secretary of state"" according to New York Times' reporter Mark Landler in his excellent new book "" Alter Egos .""

This move highlights what could perhaps be most distinctive about Hillary Clinton as president: her refusal to be typecast as either hawk or dove. Instead, she has long been resolutely both, advocating for military interventions in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and Syria while also being unafraid to express her support -- as in one noteworthy 2011 episode in which she and then-CIA director Leon Panetta got into a shouting match over CIA drone strikes in Pakistani territory -- for critiques of the use of force.

It is this record as both hawk and dove that suggests some of the contours of what a Clinton foreign policy would look like.

What is also very clear from her record is that Hillary Clinton is now and presumably would continue to be as president a hawk who is also willing to negotiate. When it comes to foreign policy, these are the qualities we should most associate with effective commanders in chief.

America's two big foreign policy ideas

As president, either Clinton or Trump will have to navigate the two big ideas in American foreign policy: isolationism and interventionism. As was memorably defined by U.S. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams in 1821, isolationism means: ""America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well wisher to freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own."" In other words, the United States will not become embroiled in foreign conflicts over ideals like ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" and will instead concentrate on strengthening itself at home.

By contrast, interventionism stipulates that the United States needs to uphold -- and even enforce -- global order and liberty not only because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's very much in America's own interests, a view best expressed by John F. Kennedy in his 1961 inaugural address at the height of the Cold War when he said, ""We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.""

Over the past century the United States has swung back and forth between periods of isolationism and interventionism.

9/11, of course, changed all that. The Bush administration engaged in long and protracted multi-trillion-dollar nation-building efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Long-running US anger

The Trump administration has been livid over the International Criminal Court’s investigation into atrocities in Afghanistan, America’s longest-running war.

The administration last year revoked the US visa of the court’s chief prosecutor, Gambian-born Fatou Bensouda, to demand that she end the Afghanistan probe.

When he stepped out of his SUV , three Iraqi guards turned him around at gunpoint .
Mark Giaconia , who served for 20 years in the U.S. Army , of which 15 years in the U.S. Special Forces and was embedded with the Kurds in Iraq , poses for a photograph at his house in Herndon , Virginia , U.S. , October 19 , 2019 . Picture taken October 19 , 2019 . ███/Carlos Jasso
As he walked back to the vehicle , he heard an AK-47 being racked and a hail of cursing in Arabic and Kurdish . He turned to see Azaz facing off with the Iraqis .
“ Let us through or I ’ ll kill you all , ” Walker recalled his Kurdish bodyguard telling the Iraqi soldiers , who he described as “ terrified . ”
He thought to himself : “ This is the kind of ally and friend I want . ”
Now retired and living in Portland , Oregon , the 66-year-old former Army Special Forces soldier is among legions of U.S. servicemembers with a deep gratitude and respect for Kurdish fighters they served alongside through the Iraq war and , more recently , conflicts with the Islamic State . So he was “ furious ” when President Donald Trump this month abruptly decided to pull 1,000 U.S. troops from northeast Syria , clearing the way for Turkey to move in on Kurdish-controlled territory .
Walker ’ s rage was echoed in ███ interviews with a half dozen other current and former U.S. soldiers who have served with Kurdish forces . Mark Giaconia , a 46-year-old former U.S. Army special forces soldier , recalled similar camaraderie with the Kurds he fought with in Iraq more than a decade ago .
“ I trusted them with my life , ” said Giaconia , who now lives in Herndon , Virginia , after retiring from the Army with 20 years of service . “ I fought with these guys and watched them die for us . ”
The Trump administration ’ s decision to “ leave them hanging ” stirred deep emotions , Giaconia said .
Trump ’ s abrupt decision to pull back U.S. troops from along the Syria-Turkey border allowed Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to launch an offensive into the region aimed at creating a 20 mile ( 32 km ) “ safe zone ” clear of the Kurdish YPG militia . The Kurdish fighters had been Washington ’ s main ally in the region but the Turkish government regards them as a terrorist group .
In the face of criticism from both Democrats and his own Republicans , Trump defended the move , saying that it fulfilled a campaign promise to reduce foreign troop presence and asserting that the Kurds were “ not angels . ”
The Kurds pivoted quickly , allying themselves with Syria to try to hold off the Turkish onslaught .
Trump then sent Vice President Michael Pence to Ankara to negotiate a pause in the fighting that the United States said would allow the Kurds to pull back from the area Turkey aimed to take , and which Turkey said achieved the main goal of the assault it launched Oct. 9 .
Congressional Republicans - including Senator Lindsey Graham , normally a staunch Trump ally - fretted that the move would risk allowing the Islamic State militant group to resurge .
“ Congress is going to speak with a very firm , singular voice , ” Graham said at a Thursday news conference to unveil legislation to impose new sanctions on the Turkish government .

“ The path the president is on , ” he said , “ is a very destructive path . ”","(Reuters) - In the summer of 2004, U.S. soldier Greg Walker drove to a checkpoint just outside of Baghdad’s Green Zone with his Kurdish bodyguard, Azaz. When he stepped out of his SUV, three Iraqi guards turned him around at gunpoint.

As he walked back to the vehicle, he heard an AK-47 being racked and a hail of cursing in Arabic and Kurdish. He turned to see Azaz facing off with the Iraqis.

“Let us through or I’ll kill you all,” Walker recalled his Kurdish bodyguard telling the Iraqi soldiers, who he described as “terrified.”

He thought to himself: “This is the kind of ally and friend I want.”

Now retired and living in Portland, Oregon, the 66-year-old former Army Special Forces soldier is among legions of U.S. servicemembers with a deep gratitude and respect for Kurdish fighters they served alongside through the Iraq war and, more recently, conflicts with the Islamic State. So he was “furious” when President Donald Trump this month abruptly decided to pull 1,000 U.S. troops from northeast Syria, clearing the way for Turkey to move in on Kurdish-controlled territory.

Walker’s rage was echoed in Reuters interviews with a half dozen other current and former U.S. soldiers who have served with Kurdish forces. Mark Giaconia, a 46-year-old former U.S. Army special forces soldier, recalled similar camaraderie with the Kurds he fought with in Iraq more than a decade ago.

“I trusted them with my life,” said Giaconia, who now lives in Herndon, Virginia, after retiring from the Army with 20 years of service. “I fought with these guys and watched them die for us.”

The Trump administration’s decision to “leave them hanging” stirred deep emotions, Giaconia said.

“It’s like a violation of trust,” he said.

The White House declined to comment.

BIPARTISAN CRITICISM

Trump’s abrupt decision to pull back U.S. troops from along the Syria-Turkey border allowed Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to launch an offensive into the region aimed at creating a 20 mile (32 km) “safe zone” clear of the Kurdish YPG militia. The Kurdish fighters had been Washington’s main ally in the region but the Turkish government regards them as a terrorist group.

In the face of criticism from both Democrats and his own Republicans, Trump defended the move, saying that it fulfilled a campaign promise to reduce foreign troop presence and asserting that the Kurds were “not angels.”

The Kurds pivoted quickly, allying themselves with Syria to try to hold off the Turkish onslaught.

Trump then sent Vice President Michael Pence to Ankara to negotiate a pause in the fighting that the United States said would allow the Kurds to pull back from the area Turkey aimed to take, and which Turkey said achieved the main goal of the assault it launched Oct. 9.

Congressional Republicans - including Senator Lindsey Graham, normally a staunch Trump ally - fretted that the move would risk allowing the Islamic State militant group to resurge.

“Congress is going to speak with a very firm, singular voice,” Graham said at a Thursday news conference to unveil legislation to impose new sanctions on the Turkish government. He said the “Turkish outrage” would lead to the re-emergence of Islamic State, the destruction of an ally - the Kurds - and eventually benefit Iran at the expense of Israel.

The House of Representatives voted 354 to 60 last week to condemn Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria - a rare case of Republicans voting en masse against Trump. A Senate vote on the resolution was blocked, however, by Republican Senator Rand Paul.

Paul, a senator from Kentucky, has voiced his support Trump’s withdrawal of troops, saying during a Senate hearing on Thursday that “the Constitution is quite clear, no authorization has ever been given for the use of forces in Syria.”

HISTORY OF ‘BETRAYAL’

Some of the U.S. soldiers interviewed by Reuters pointed out that the United States has history of forging alliances with Kurdish forces only to later abandon them. In the 1970s, the administration of President Richard Nixon secretly agreed to funnel money to Iraqi Kurds fighting for autonomy from Iraq, only to drop that aid after Iraq and Iran reached a peace treaty to end border disputes in 1975.

Likewise after the 1991 Gulf War, a Kurdish uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein eventually led to a brutal crackdown after U.S. forces left the region.

Those incidents came up often among Kurds who fought alongside a U.S. Army soldier who did several tours in the Middle East.

“Even then, they were bringing up the 1991 betrayal of the Kurds. This idea of betraying the Kurds was something that was very, very front of mind,” said the soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity since he is still in the military. “There was definitely some skepticism of our support of them long term.”

Kurds have come to know betrayal, said Kardos Dargala, a 38-year-old Iraqi Kurd whose relationship with the U.S. military dates back to 2004 and the second U.S. invasion of Iraq.

“Feeling betrayed, throughout history it is a very familiar pattern,” said Dargala, who worked as a security contractor for the U.S. military until 2008 - when he immigrated to the United States, joined the U.S. Army, and was deployed to Afghanistan.

Mr. Trump gave his approval to acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan to deploy the additional troops to the Persian Gulf region to deter Iranian threats , after meeting with his military chiefs Thursday evening . The move was smaller than leaked reports this week that up to 10,000 new U.S. troops could be deployed .
“ We want to have protection , ” Mr. Trump confirmed Friday to reporters at the White House . “ We ’ ll be sending a relatively small number of troops . It ’ ll be about 1,500 people . ”
The extra forces had been requested by U.S. Central Command chief Marine Corps Gen. Kenneth McKenzie earlier this week . The influx of U.S. forces into the region will “ improve our force protection and safeguard U.S. forces , ” in the wake of Iranian threats , Mr. Shanahan said in a statement issued Friday .
The move represents “ a prudent defensive measure and intended to reduce the possibility of future hostilities , ” with Tehran and its regional allies , he added .
Pentagon officials appeared eager to play down impressions that Washington was pushing for war with Iran , despite a string of incidents in recent weeks that have put the two countries on a collision course . But U.S. officials Friday also used the strongest language to date explicitly blaming Iran for some of the recent events , including sabotage of international oil tankers in the Sea of Oman .
“ This is an operation driven by intelligence ” on the dangers posed to U.S. forces by Tehran , Joint Staff Director Vice Adm. Mike Gilday told reporters at the Pentagon Friday , noting the additional military units being sent into the region matched exactly what Central Command officials had asked for .
But administration critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere urged Mr. Trump to reconsider the move , over doubts about the quality of U.S. intelligence and fears of a re-run of the case made in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion .
“ This escalation doesn ’ t get us out of our decades long , seemingly endless wars , Mr. President , ” Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican and frequent critics of overseas military operations , posted on Twitter . “ Trust your instincts and follow what you ran on , not the neocons around who want to repeat past mistakes . ”
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith , Washington state Democrat , called the new deployment “ unwise ” and accused the Trump White House of engaging in “ a blatant and heavy-handed move to further escalate tensions with Iran . ”
“ Leaders from both sides of the aisle have called for de-escalation . At first blush , this move does not fit the bill , ” Mr. Smith said in a statement .
Adm. Gilday declined to provide details on the U.S. intelligence tying the Iranian regime to recent attacks Saudi oil pipelines and shipping vessels off the coast of Oman , as well as a Sunday rocket attack against the American Embassy in Baghdad ’ s Green Zone . But he did cite those actions as proof of an Iranian-led and -coordinated operation to pressure the U.S. and its Middle East allies .
Iran has denied a role in the recent aggressive moves , and Tehran-allied Shia militias in Iraq have claimed they did not launch the missile that landed in the Green Zone .
But Adm. Gilday told reporters Friday that “ we believe with a high degree of confidence this all stems back to Iran at the highest levels . ”
The Pentagon has already sent in the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group and an Air Force bomber task force into the Arabian Sea in recent weeks , in response to what U.S. officials say are credible threats from Iranian proxies to U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq and elsewhere across the region .
The new tranche of American forces heading into the Middle East , which include a military engineering unit , as well as Air Force fighter squadron , drone units and additional aerial intelligence aircraft , will likely ratchet up tensions in the region even further .
Some analysts said the new troop deployment is the kind of concrete action U.S. allies in the Middle East are looking for from the Trump administration .
Until Friday ’ s decision , there has been little consistency in Washington ’ s action to curb Iranian actions in the region , said Elie Abouaoun , director of Middle East programs at the Washington-based U.S. Institute for Peace . “ The U.S. has lost a lot of leverage because [ allies ] can not predict what the U.S. is going to do , ” he said .
Such an approach “ is good for enemies , but not good for allies , ” he added .
As a result , many of Washington ’ s friends in the region have largely stayed on the sidelines , Mr. Abouaoun said .
“ Containing is not effective , in a retail approach . It must be wholesale , ” involving political , diplomatic , economic and military means , he added .
But many countries in the region fear getting caught in the crossfire of a U.S.-Iranian war , and some see the Trump administration ’ s pressure campaign since abandoning the 2015 Iran nuclear deal as the catalyst for the most recent tensions .
The decision to send more U.S. troops into the Middle East is “ related to what is required for the protection of our forces , ” Kathryn Wheelbarger , assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs , said during Friday ’ s Pentagon briefing .
“ We do not see this as provocative , ” she added , noting that the Trump administration ’ s overall ‘ maximum pressure ’ policy toward Iran has not changed . “ The [ U.S. ] policy objective remains to get Iran back to the negotiating table ” she added .","President Trump has ordered the deployment of another 1,500 U.S. troops to the Middle East amid rising tensions with Iran, bolstering the American presence in the region but stoking fears the move will only escalate the situation and move the country closer to a shooting war.

Recently , the flag was flown from the back of a car alongside protests in South Dakota , and burned outside the Utah State Capitol . When deputies hoisted the flag outside government buildings in Cincinnati , Ohio , and Orange , California , the sheriffs in both communities were sharply criticized . Officers have worn versions of the flag on face masks while clashing with protesters in Baltimore and in Washington , D.C .
Those who fly the flag have said it stands for solidarity and professional pride within a dangerous , difficult profession and a solemn tribute to fallen police officers . But it has also been flown by white supremacists , appearing next to Confederate flags at the 2017 ‘ Unite the Right ’ rally in Charlottesville , Virginia . County officials in Oregon recently paid $ 100,000 to a black employee of a law enforcement agency there , after she said she was harassed by coworkers for complaining about her colleagues displaying the flag at work .
Now , as police again become the focal point of a fight for racial equality in the U.S. , the flag has returned to both mirror and amplify divisions .
But how did this flag come to be so pervasive ? And what does it really stand for ?
In 2014 , a white college student named Andrew Jacob was watching protests of police killings of Eric Garner , Michael Brown and Tamir Rice . He had seen the image of the flag on patches and stickers , he told ███ , but not an actual flag . While in high school in West Bloomfield , Michigan , he had attended a memorial service for a police officer who had been killed on the job .
Now , Jacob is the president of Thin Blue Line USA , one of the largest online retailers devoted exclusively to sales of pro-police flags , T-shirts , neckwear and jewelry . “ The flag has no association with racism , hatred , bigotry , ” he said . “ It ’ s a flag to show support for law enforcement—no politics involved. ” The company officially disavowed its use in Charlottesville .
Jacob said the flag was not a direct reaction to the first Black Lives Matter protests—an idea suggested by a previous origin story in Harper ’ s—but he allows he may have first seen the thin blue line image after those protests spurred the circulation of pro-police imagery online . “ That ’ s maybe why it came to my eyes , ” he said .
As Jacob built the company , a “ Blue Lives Matter ” movement was growing in the wake of news stories of multiple officers shot to death in Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; Brooklyn , New York ; and Dallas . Meanwhile , Donald Trump , as a presidential candidate , called police “ the force between civilization and total chaos. ” Some states began passing laws to categorize physical attacks on law enforcement officers as hate crimes .
Police were not actually in greater danger than they had been before the Black Lives Matter movement . Ambush killings of police have actually declined more than 90 percent since 1970 , even with the recent spikes , according to a study by Michael White , a professor of criminology at Arizona State University . White understands how the thin blue line flag has become a part of police culture , and that officers may view it as a sign of solidarity , but also worries about the message it sends to the public .
“ It fosters this ‘ us versus them ’ mentality , ” he said . “ The police and community should work together , in order to produce safety . Each should respect the role of the other . If you 're looking at the community as a potential enemy , or a threat , that 's certainly going to hinder any positive relationship . ”
Before the flag came the phrase . The idea of a “ thin blue line ” can be traced all the way back to a 1854 British battle formation , a “ thin red line ” used during the Crimean War and then popularized in art , poetry and song . According to lawyers James Clapp and Elizabeth Thornburg , who have dug up the history behind popular phrases , the idea migrated to other professions , with other colors , from a “ thin white line of bishops ” to a “ thin blue line of public schoolboys in blazers . ”
It was occasionally used for police , they write . But that usage caught on in 1922 , after New York police commissioner Richard Enright , facing criticism of his leadership , mentioned it in a public relations effort . The phrase started showing up in speeches by politicians and related press coverage from Chicago to Los Angeles .
In the 1950s , “ The Thin Blue Line ” was the title of a briefly running television show about the Los Angeles Police Department , masterminded by the chief , William H. Parker , who took advantage of Hollywood ’ s proximity to make public relations a key part of his tenure . He also opened up the department ’ s files to the writers of “ Dragnet . ”
Parker was known for unambiguous racism . He said some immigrants were “ not far removed from the wild tribes of Mexico ” and compared black residents participating in the Watts Riots—which stemmed in part from anger over his own department ’ s mistreatment—to “ monkeys in a zoo . ”
Parker used the phrase ‘ thin blue line ’ constantly in his speeches . The phrase was further popularized by the novels of Joseph Wambaugh , and it typified Parker ’ s philosophy : having served in the military , he wanted to end corruption and professionalize the police force .
In his view , the police “ protected Western civilization from communists , progressive politicians , minorities , anybody who agitated for something that didn ’ t fit his very narrow scheme , ” said Alisa Kramer , who wrote a 2007 dissertation on Parker 's tenure . `` There are a lot of parallels between Parker and Trump ; Parker had no understanding of the complexities of poverty and racism . ''
After Parker ’ s sudden death in 1966 , the city named the police headquarters after him . The Parker Center went on to be a primary site of protests in 1992 after police were filmed beating Rodney King .
Parker ’ s tenure augured a bigger shift towards militarism in police departments , which came to buy military gear directly from the Department of Defense . Criminologists Don L. Kurtz and Alayna Colburn have analyzed the language police officers use in formal interviews , and argue that the “ thin blue line ” idea is an example of popular culture informing internal police culture , highlighting “ the assumed differences between officers and citizens and further progresses an ‘ us versus them ’ mentality among officers . ”
The phrase gained another boost with Errol Morris ’ s 1988 film “ The Thin Blue Line , ” in which a Dallas judge quotes a prosecutor describing what separates “ the public from anarchy. ” The title was ironic , if not sly , since the film depicted how law enforcement sent an innocent man to death row .
Over the years , officers around the country occasionally placed stickers of a blue line surrounded by black on their cars . After the ambush of Dallas officers in 2016 , the flag became a common sight in yards and on bumper stickers around the city , along with “ Back the Blue ” and “ Thank a Cop ” signs . Mourners wore blue neckties and hair ribbons at the funeral service , but the fallen officers ’ caskets were draped with American flags .
Dallas Police Sgt . Stephen Bishopp has a doctorate and has studied police stress , use of force and officer misconduct . The “ thin blue line ” symbol existed before several of his colleagues were gunned down by a sniper in July 2016 , he said . To him , it symbolizes respect and understanding for the families of officers killed in the line of duty—including suicides .
“ When I see that flag as a sticker on a car or flying in someone ’ s yard , I know that there is someone there that knows what I ’ m going through . They know because they are a part of the family , ” Bishopp said . “ I don ’ t really care if it bothers people or hurts their feelings to see that flag . I absolutely could care less . I am proud of what I do , the people I work with , and the ones who have died defending the rights of strangers . I will continue to fly that flag until my very last day . ”
Social media allows for endless remixing , and the offerings now appear infinite . You can buy a sticker that mixes the imagery with the Disney World logo . You can buy a dog tag necklace , with a Matthew 5:9 engraved on the back : “ Blessed are the peacemakers , for they will be called children of God. ” Law enforcement officers can buy a special edition Sig Sauer pistol covered with the flag and blue line .
But as the images have multiplied , so have the meanings . The American flag and blue line have often been blended with the image of a skull associated with The Punisher , an ex-Marine turned vigilante who first appeared in Marvel comics in 1974 , combatting crime through extrajudicial murder and torture . “ Police should not be embracing a criminal as their symbol , ” the character ’ s creator Gerry Conway told Syfy Wire last year . “ In a way , it 's as offensive as putting a Confederate flag on a government building . ”
Although the flag ’ s manufacturers have tried to keep politics away from the flag , the current protests over the death of George Floyd have thrust the image into larger debates . In Cold Spring , New York , local leaders debated last week whether placing a decal of the flag on a police car would make some people afraid to ask officers for help . In Montclair , New Jersey , a police leader begged residents on a Zoom call not to view the flag as a “ symbol of racism . ”
`` We 've seen trucks riding around with big old versions , '' said Melina Abdullah , a co-founder of the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter , about the protests in recent days . `` It feels akin to a Confederate flag . '' She has also noticed the flag 's image on police and other government-owned vehicles , and she sees this as evidence that even self-described liberal officials are not doing enough to combat white supremacy . `` The supposed 'liberal ' answer to Donald Trump has not been as critical of police violence as it should be , '' she said .
Police officers themselves are also not speaking uniformly about the flag . Last month , San Francisco ’ s chief of police Bill Scott banned his officers from wearing face masks emblazoned with the thin blue line flag , worrying they would be seen as “ divisive and disrespectful. ” The masks had been distributed by the local police union , which accused the department of failing to provide masks . “ We did it as a morale booster for each other , ” union president Tony Montoya said , “ not as a political statement . ”
Local skirmishes and letters to the editor in various states have questioned whether the thin blue line flag is a violation of the U.S . Flag Code , which specifically states : “ The flag should never have placed upon it , nor any part of it , nor attached to it any mark , insignia , letter , word , figure , design , picture , or drawing of any nature . ”
Despite that language , the American flag is depicted in many other ways for a number of purposes , many commercial . Still , the American Legion , which played a key role in drafting the Flag Code and is the go-to authority on proper U.S. flag etiquette , has not taken an official position yet on the black-and-white version with a blue line , a spokesman told ███ .","As protests over policing continue to convulse cities throughout the U.S., one symbol keeps showing up: a black-and-white American flag with one blue stripe.

Recently, the flag was flown from the back of a car alongside protests in South Dakota, and burned outside the Utah State Capitol.

According to lawyers James Clapp and Elizabeth Thornburg, who have dug up the history behind popular phrases, the idea migrated to other professions, with other colors, from a “thin white line of bishops” to a “thin blue line of public schoolboys in blazers.”

It was occasionally used for police, they write. But that usage caught on in 1922, after New York police commissioner Richard Enright, facing criticism of his leadership, mentioned it in a public relations effort. The phrase started showing up in speeches by politicians and related press coverage from Chicago to Los Angeles.

In the 1950s, “The Thin Blue Line” was the title of a briefly running television show about the Los Angeles Police Department, masterminded by the chief, William H. Parker, who took advantage of Hollywood’s proximity to make public relations a key part of his tenure. He also opened up the department’s files to the writers of “Dragnet.”

Parker was known for unambiguous racism. He said some immigrants were “not far removed from the wild tribes of Mexico” and compared black residents participating in the Watts Riots—which stemmed in part from anger over his own department’s mistreatment—to “monkeys in a zoo.”

Parker used the phrase ‘thin blue line’ constantly in his speeches. The phrase was further popularized by the novels of Joseph Wambaugh, and it typified Parker’s philosophy: having served in the military, he wanted to end corruption and professionalize the police force.

In his view, the police “protected Western civilization from communists, progressive politicians, minorities, anybody who agitated for something that didn’t fit his very narrow scheme,” said Alisa Kramer, who wrote a 2007 dissertation on Parker's tenure. ""There are a lot of parallels between Parker and Trump; Parker had no understanding of the complexities of poverty and racism.""

After Parker’s sudden death in 1966, the city named the police headquarters after him. The Parker Center went on to be a primary site of protests in 1992 after police were filmed beating Rodney King.

Parker’s tenure augured a bigger shift towards militarism in police departments, which came to buy military gear directly from the Department of Defense. Criminologists Don L. Kurtz and Alayna Colburn have analyzed the language police officers use in formal interviews, and argue that the “thin blue line” idea is an example of popular culture informing internal police culture, highlighting “the assumed differences between officers and citizens and further progresses an ‘us versus them’ mentality among officers.”

The phrase gained another boost with Errol Morris’s 1988 film “The Thin Blue Line,” in which a Dallas judge quotes a prosecutor describing what separates “the public from anarchy.” The title was ironic, if not sly, since the film depicted how law enforcement sent an innocent man to death row.

Over the years, officers around the country occasionally placed stickers of a blue line surrounded by black on their cars. After the ambush of Dallas officers in 2016, the flag became a common sight in yards and on bumper stickers around the city, along with “Back the Blue” and “Thank a Cop” signs. Mourners wore blue neckties and hair ribbons at the funeral service, but the fallen officers’ caskets were draped with American flags.

Dallas Police Sgt. Stephen Bishopp has a doctorate and has studied police stress, use of force and officer misconduct. The “thin blue line” symbol existed before several of his colleagues were gunned down by a sniper in July 2016, he said. To him, it symbolizes respect and understanding for the families of officers killed in the line of duty—including suicides.

“When I see that flag as a sticker on a car or flying in someone’s yard, I know that there is someone there that knows what I’m going through. They know because they are a part of the family,” Bishopp said. “I don’t really care if it bothers people or hurts their feelings to see that flag. I absolutely could care less. I am proud of what I do, the people I work with, and the ones who have died defending the rights of strangers. I will continue to fly that flag until my very last day.”

Social media allows for endless remixing, and the offerings now appear infinite. You can buy a sticker that mixes the imagery with the Disney World logo. You can buy a dog tag necklace, with a Matthew 5:9 engraved on the back: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.” Law enforcement officers can buy a special edition Sig Sauer pistol covered with the flag and blue line.

But as the images have multiplied, so have the meanings. The American flag and blue line have often been blended with the image of a skull associated with The Punisher, an ex-Marine turned vigilante who first appeared in Marvel comics in 1974, combatting crime through extrajudicial murder and torture. “Police should not be embracing a criminal as their symbol,” the character’s creator Gerry Conway told Syfy Wire last year. “In a way, it's as offensive as putting a Confederate flag on a government building.”

Although the flag’s manufacturers have tried to keep politics away from the flag, the current protests over the death of George Floyd have thrust the image into larger debates. In Cold Spring, New York, local leaders debated last week whether placing a decal of the flag on a police car would make some people afraid to ask officers for help. In Montclair, New Jersey, a police leader begged residents on a Zoom call not to view the flag as a “symbol of racism.”

""We've seen trucks riding around with big old versions,"" said Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter, about the protests in recent days. ""It feels akin to a Confederate flag."" She has also noticed the flag's image on police and other government-owned vehicles, and she sees this as evidence that even self-described liberal officials are not doing enough to combat white supremacy. ""The supposed 'liberal' answer to Donald Trump has not been as critical of police violence as it should be,"" she said.

Police officers themselves are also not speaking uniformly about the flag. Last month, San Francisco’s chief of police Bill Scott banned his officers from wearing face masks emblazoned with the thin blue line flag, worrying they would be seen as “divisive and disrespectful.” The masks had been distributed by the local police union, which accused the department of failing to provide masks. “We did it as a morale booster for each other,” union president Tony Montoya said, “not as a political statement.”

Local skirmishes and letters to the editor in various states have questioned whether the thin blue line flag is a violation of the U.S. Flag Code, which specifically states: “The flag should never have placed upon it, nor any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.”

Despite that language, the American flag is depicted in many other ways for a number of purposes, many commercial. Still, the American Legion, which played a key role in drafting the Flag Code and is the go-to authority on proper U.S. flag etiquette, has not taken an official position yet on the black-and-white version with a blue line, a spokesman told The Marshall Project.",www.themarshallproject.org,center,1mblfEG0RnBOetRW

Trump's dilemma

Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent

This fresh deployment of troops and hardware has been signalled for a number of days, but it is a much more modest move than many expected. Around 1,500 service personnel are likely to be despatched, significantly down on the 5,000-10,000 that some administration sources had floated.

Despite some tough rhetoric, the president has appeared reluctant to become overly entangled in the region, mindful no doubt of his promises to bring troops back from there and not the reverse.

What is behind the tensions?

Tensions between the US and Iran began rising this month when Washington ended exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying from Iran. The decision was intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue.

Mr Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning the landmark nuclear deal that Iran has signed with six nations - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany.

Iran has now announced it it will suspend several commitments under the deal.

Four oil tankers were damaged in what the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said were sabotage attacks while drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi rebels - who are supported by Iran - forced the temporary closure of a pipeline.

Iran denied it was behind the incidents but Rear Admiral Michael Gilday, director of the US Joint Staff, accused the IRGC of being directly responsible.

This essay explores two very important issues . First , can missile defenses be deployed simultaneously with nuclear arms reductions ? Secondly , can limited missile defenses credibly defeat nuclear missile threats ? My answer is a “ yes ” to both questions , with an important caveat . While Russia and China both have adopted the threat of limited coercive missile strikes as policy , and U.S. missile defenses , if improved can continue to credibly deter such threats , other critically important threats remain that require continued robust strategic nuclear modernization and advanced integrated air and missile defenses utilizing a wide range of technologies and capabilities not currently part of the U.S. arsenal .
Since 1972 , when the ABM Treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate , missile defenses of the United States were prohibited .
The ABM ( Anti-Ballistic Missile ) Treaty allowed the United States and the Soviet Union to deploy 100 interceptors to protect an offensive missile base or the nation ’ s respective capitols . The Soviets chose to protect Moscow where 100 interceptors are current deployed . The United States opted to protect a Minuteman nuclear base in North Dakota but took down the system in 1974 as the Soviets could easily overwhelm the limited defense of 100 interceptors .
It then became an article of faith that defending the United States from Soviet or Chinese ballistic missiles was a bad thing .
Why such logic ? Each of the nuclear superpowers had to be guaranteed the ability to destroy the other country , if it was attacked first with nuclear weapons . This came to be known as “ mutual assured destruction , ” often referred to by its appropriate acronym MAD . American missile defenses , it was argued , could significantly limit the deterrent ability of the Soviet Union and China to respond to an initial American attack for fear that whatever limited response could be mounted would be soaked up by the American defense .
This MAD assumption led the successive administrations to declare the treaty as “ the cornerstone of strategic stability , ” with early supporters predicting the absence of such defenses meant the nuclear superpowers would not have any reason to continue to build up their nuclear arsenals , and , thus hopefully bring the “ nuclear arms race ” to an end . Although in 1972 the first nuclear arms agreement—SALT or Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty—was also signed between the Soviet and American Presidents , it allowed the continued buildup of nuclear forces by additional tens of thousands of nuclear weapons .
In reality , as it was later revealed ( and warned about by the Committee on the Present Danger ) , the Soviets pushed for the ABM Treaty not to “ end ” any nuclear arms race , but in fact to accelerate their own nuclear modernization , even under the SALT I treaty labelled as an “ arms control deal. ” The Soviets also through “ disinformazione ” and propaganda ( such as the nuclear freeze campaign ) also sought to push unilateral cuts to American nuclear upgrades . And their strategy worked .
In 1972 when President Nixon signed the ABM Treaty with the then Soviet Union , the Soviets had far fewer strategic long-range and short-range nuclear weapons than the United States . It was largely a Soviet initiative to seek the treaty , due to the 1967 announcement by the Secretary of Defense in the Johnson administration to build a limited missile defense shield , to stop a newly emerging Chinese missile threat .
Soviet General Secretary Brezhnev however saw the potential U.S. missile shield as a threat to Russia . And as soon as President-elect Nixon took office , the Soviet leader proposed to Nixon that all missile defenses be banned “ to end the nuclear arms race. ” As we now know from the Soviet archives , Moscow was worried a robust U.S. missile defense could significantly blunt what U.S. defense secretary Melvin Laird later argued was a planned Soviet first strike against the United States . The Soviet leaders though U.S. missile defenses could undermine the Soviet policy of seeking to use missile threats for coercion or blackmail . And in the absence of U.S. missile defenses , of course , Soviet warheads speeding toward their targets on the U.S. mainland would be unimpeded . The Soviet leadership wanted to keep things that way , but they also had to buy time to change the strategic balance in their favor .
Although domestic U.S. supporters of the ABM Treaty were convinced the Soviet interest in the ABM Treaty was simply to preserve MAD , the Soviets as we have noted had other motives , primarily to curtail U.S. nuclear modernization while the Soviets simultaneously caught up and eventually surpassed U.S. warhead levels .
Ironically , the SALT I agreement and the ABM Treaty did little to contain the subsequent buildup of Soviet nuclear forces despite widespread rhetoric to the contrary . While the United States did increase its nuclear arsenal , primarily by adding multiple warheads on its land-based Minuteman and sea-based Polaris missiles , the entirety of the U.S. planned nuclear modernization in the 1970s was repeatedly delayed , curtailed , or stopped entirely , except for B-2 bomber research and development . The MX missile and B1 bombers were never acquired during the 1970s and funding for the Ohio class submarine and bomber cruise missile was cut repeatedly , delaying deployment until at least 1981 .
In fact , up until the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , virtually every nuclear weapons modernization program was cut by Congress in its annual consideration of the defense budget . So , by the end of the decade , while strategic warhead levels were roughly equal , all types of U.S. nuclear warhead levels had dropped to 23,000 from 26,000 , while the Soviets increased their warhead deployments from 11,600 to 30,000 , a nearly three-fold increase . By 1980 , the Soviets openly boasted that the “ correlation of forces ” favored the USSR over the Americans in large part due to an expansive buildup of Soviet nuclear and conventional forces .
By the time President Reagan took office in 1981 , a key Soviet strategic nuclear force had surpassed the United States , in that the Soviet deployed fast flying multi-warhead land-based ballistic missiles significantly exceeded those of the United States . The Soviet momentum eventually would bring their strategic long-range nuclear warhead deployments alone to near 12,000 , which were eventually roughly matched by the United States because President Reagan successfully pursued a nuclear modernization program that had been slowed and truncated by the previous administration .
During this period of U.S. nuclear modernization , the question of whether the United States should deploy missile defenses rose to the front of national policy debates . President Reagan in March 1983 proposed the United States begin to research and develop robust missile defenses to blunt any future Soviet missile attack , as well as lesser nuclear powers including rogue states such as China , North Korea and Iran .
As former Reagan national security adviser Robert McFarlane notes , some traditional opponents of missile defense in Congress nevertheless grudgingly supported the missile defense funding . Despite the split control of Congress between the two major political parties , Reagan successfully secured significant missile defense funding beginning in 1983 .
McFarlane explained that Reagan convinced key members of Congress to support missile defense—an area where U.S. technology excelled . The missile defense initiative was designed to compel the Soviets to agree to major reductions in nuclear weapons , which was a key objective of the Reagan administration . Robust U.S. missile defense deployments it was thought , far from spurring a nuclear arms buildup by the Soviets , could be leveraged to secure major build-downs since an effective defense would nullify the Soviet sought advantage in offensive nuclear weapons . As both sides modernized their arsenals , the deployed numbers could still be dramatically reduced , exactly what Reagan sought in the START I and II arms control process .
McFarlane recalls being asked by top defense senators , “ How long do we have to support the missile defense spending before an arms control deal materializes ? ” The hoped-for deals eventually concluded were the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces ( INF ) and the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Talks ( START I ) Reagan had first drawn-up in 1981 .
McFarlane guessed that if one were measuring from the Reagan 1983 strategic defense initiative or SDI speech , he reckoned it would take about 4 years before the first deal could be concluded . The first deal—the 1987 INF treaty eliminating all missiles in Europe and Asia ( and the nuclear warheads they carried ) in the 500-5,000-kilometer range—was exactly within the four-year time-table McFarlane predicted .
Not too long after that , the 1991 START I treaty materialized , reducing deployed U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads by nearly 50 percent , down to 6,000 , followed in 1993 by the Bush-Yeltsin START II treaty between the United States and Russia calling for again reducing strategic nuclear warheads down to 3,500 . At the United Nations in January 1992 , President Yeltsin of Russia even went so far as to propose the United States and Russia together to cut nuclear weapons dramatically and simultaneously deploy a global and layered missile defense system to guard against missile threats .
Unfortunately , while the 1991 START I ( with top-notch verification measures ) treaty was implemented , the Russian Federation after Yeltsin opposed the START II treaty in part because of its ban on multiple warhead land-based missiles—the very first strike weapons the Soviets had long seen as providing key leverage against the United States in a crisis or conflict . In fact , former Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev took to the pages of the New York Times in 1996 to declare opposition to START II , warning the treaty if agreed to was tantamount to “ disarming Russia . ”
The obvious question after Yeltsin was whether the new Putin administration was going back to the old Soviet Union strategy of using nuclear weapons for coercion and blackmail . The Russian Duma eventually made Moscow ’ s intention clear . In 2000 , some 8 years after the START II treaty was signed by President Bush and President Yeltsin , and after the U.S. Senate had agreed to the treaty , the Duma declared it would agree to the treaty but only if the United States kept all its missile defense work in the laboratory .
Specifically , the Russian Federal Law on ratification linked START II implementation to continued U.S. compliance with the 1972 ABM Treaty while prohibiting all U.S. missile defenses , even those designed to protect against rogue state threats . Unwilling to ban multiple warhead land-based missiles , ( the preponderant nuclear forces deployed by the Russians ) , the Duma adopted a clever ruse to make sure the treaty never entered into force by making an offer to the United States they knew we would never accept !
Now American missile defense critics supported the Duma , arguing the end of the Cold War lessened missile threats significantly and such homeland and regional missile defenses were simply not necessary , especially those called for by the 1999 Missile Defense Act . Furthermore , these same critics argued since missile defenses can not perfectly defend against multiple thousands of nuclear armed missiles and thus can not effectively defend our homeland cities , such defenses should be banned . In short , even though American and Russian deployed strategic nuclear warhead levels had significantly diminished through arms control , MAD remained , in the eyes of disarmers , central to strategic stability , to be guaranteed in part by a continued ban on national missile defenses .
But such views ignored serious new threats outside the U.S.-Russian nuclear strategic balance . Two new missile threats emerged after the end of the Cold War and gave strong impetus to the United States seriously reviewing the need to deploy missile defenses , despite the relative success of arms control and the end of the Cold War . First , as the 1998 Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States noted , pro-missile defense legislation in the U.S. Congress was spurred by the use of missiles by Iraq in 1991 against the United States in Desert Storm .
Second , just as the Rumsfeld Commission had predicted , the long-range missile threat from North Korea emerged , most notably the 1998 Tae Po Dong missile test that occurred within days of the Rumsfeld Commission report being released and warning of exactly such a development . Specialists concluded that while the North Korean missile was in the 2,500 kilometer range , a very surprising development , it was possibly capable of considerably longer flight , up to 5,500 kilometers , if deployed with a small payload , putting at risk key U.S. interests .
Not only were new Iraqi and North Korean missile threats a factor , but additional and troublesome missile threats emerged elsewhere , as terror group proxies such as Hamas and Hizballah deployed very large missile inventories and over the next two decades began launching large-scale missile attacks on Israel .
These non-state actors reflected the emerging diversity in the new missile threats as these terror groups eventually acquired thousands of rockets and ballistic missiles—largely from Iran—which up to this day have been repeatedly launched at U.S. allies in the Middle East including at the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ( KSA ) , Israel and the United Arab Emirates .
As for the argument that U.S. missile defense initiatives spurred adversary missile developments , the Rumsfeld Commission highlighted the Iraqi and North Korean missile launch developments preceded the deployment by the United States of an initial national missile defense by thirteen and six years respectively , as well as the deployment of our theater or regional missile defenses . And it was only in 1999 that Congress passed , and President Clinton signed into law , the Missile Defense Act of 1999 , requiring that the United States eventually deploy national missile defenses , even though the United States still remained a signatory to the ABM Treaty that prevented such defenses . So , without question , missile threats to the United States and its allies came first long before responsive U.S. missile defense deployments .
To make matters worse , on top of the twin Iraqi and North Korean missile threats , plus the Duma ’ s rejection of the START II treaty reductions , Russian President Putin in remarks made in April 2000 emphasized the use of very limited nuclear strikes against both the U.S. regional and homeland military capabilities , during even the initial stage of a crisis or regional conventional conflict .
The Russian objective was to keep the United States out of the fight , forcing Washington to stand down in the face of such nuclear missile threats . Failure to come to the defense of our NATO allies , such as the Baltic nations , for example , could collapse NATO , a long-time Russian objective . Similarly , as former House Speaker Gingrich outlines in his new book , China also has increasingly moved toward a similar nuclear strategy with respect to its continued threats to forcefully incorporate Taiwan or the Republic of China into its political control .
Vladimir Putin , coming to power in Russia at the end of the 1990 ’ s , highlighted not only that further strategic arms control with the United States was uncertain but that U.S. missile defenses should again be considered for deployment , especially with the rise of rogue state nations also potentially armed with nuclear armed missiles .
In short , the United States was in a strategic quandary . Should we build missile defenses to deal with rogue states as well as non-state terror groups or put aside any future missile defenses largely because it was assumed missile defenses were not compatible with continued arms control with Russia ?
George W. Bush took office in 2001 and resolved that dilemma by proposing to Russia both ( 1 ) further reductions in nuclear weapons—what became the Moscow Treaty of 2002—down to 2,200 , a more than 60 percent cut in deployed warheads ; ( 2 ) while simultaneously also announcing in December 2001 the United States would get out of the ABM Treaty and proceed to build missile defenses . This allowed the United States to fulfill the requirement of the 1999 Missile Defense Act , to protect the U.S. mainland and territory from ballistic missiles , especially those armed with nuclear warheads .
Surprisingly , contrary to missile defense critics assumptions , the end of the 1972 ABM Treaty did not eliminate further arms control . In fact , the 2003-4 deployment of what would eventually be 44 land-based missile interceptors in Alaska and California apparently facilitated further reductions . Not only did the 2003-4 initial deployments coincide with the 2002 Moscow Treaty reductions from 6,000 down to 2,200 deployed strategic warheads , but subsequently the New START treaty of 2010 further reduced countable Russian deployed strategic nuclear weapons to the notional 1,550 level , strong evidence that missile defenses were perfectly compatible with major reductions in nuclear weapons .
Now the relatively limited missile defense deployments in 2003–2004 , and the significant arms reductions in the 2002 Moscow and 2010 New START agreements , did not usher in an era of complete strategic stability . Russia still has roughly 2,200–3,200 strategic nuclear warheads capable—if generated—of striking the United States via long-range missiles and bombers . Putin also insists the new deployed warheads on 6 additional nuclear strategic systems , now being developed and partially deployed , do not count under New START , probably giving Russia ’ s arsenal an eventual additional 300-400 warheads by the middle of the next decade .
And equally problematical , the Russians also have close to 5,000 theater nuclear weapons which have never been included in any arms control limits . Conversely , the United States has only 500 theater weapons , with only 200 based in Europe ; certainly , a serious imbalance . Although these numbers are a significant reduction from the height of the Cold War , they are nonetheless a still highly threatening arsenal according to analysis done by former top DOD nuclear expert Dr. Mark Schneider of the National Institute of Public Policy .
Additionally , China ’ s purported arsenal of 280 nuclear warheads is projected to grow to near 800 over the next decade , and then double again in the following decade .
Obviously , our current and planned missile defense deployments in Alaska and California can not effectively deal with the entirety of the Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and do not in any way threaten their deterrent capability .
Given this strategic imbalance , and faced with these myriad and remaining serious missile threats , does it make sense for Congress and the administration to examine whether to deploy more robust and capable missile defenses ? This would deal with not the entirety of the ballistic missile threats arrayed against the United States and its allies , but in particular both rogue state threats from Iran and North Korea , and the “ escalate to win ” Russian ( and emerging Chinese ) strategy of threatening limited nuclear strikes to successfully undertake aggression without having to fight .
The assumption of missile defense opponents who think that Congress should curtail missile defense spending remains stuck in a Cold War mindset , where any U.S. missile defense deployment is thought to be “ destabilizing. ” For example , how can it be assumed that 44 interceptors ( and eventually a planned 66 ) based in Alaska and California , will successfully stop all of the hundreds of available retaliatory Russian or Chinese warheads ? The math obviously makes no sense—66 interceptors can not stop hundreds or thousands of missile warheads .
Not only do many missile defense critics oppose the United States protecting our country from missiles , they also claim it has been the deployment of our limited missile shield that has pushed both Russia and China to increase their nuclear arsenals . Critics argue the United States has an unnecessarily aggressive move to deploy “ first the shield and then the sword , ” the shield being missile defense interceptors and the sword being offensive nuclear armed missiles . The idea being the United States will strike first against an adversary and then soak up all retaliatory warheads with its newly installed missile defense .

Missile Defense Is the Emerging Cornerstone of US National Security

Commentary

This essay explores two very important issues. First, can missile defenses be deployed simultaneously with nuclear arms reductions? Secondly, can limited missile defenses credibly defeat nuclear missile threats? My answer is a “yes” to both questions, with an important caveat. While Russia and China both have adopted the threat of limited coercive missile strikes as policy, and U.S. missile defenses, if improved can continue to credibly deter such threats, other critically important threats remain that require continued robust strategic nuclear modernization and advanced integrated air and missile defenses utilizing a wide range of technologies and capabilities not currently part of the U.S. arsenal.

Background

Since 1972, when the ABM Treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate, missile defenses of the United States were prohibited.

The ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty allowed the United States and the Soviet Union to deploy 100 interceptors to protect an offensive missile base or the nation’s respective capitols. The Soviets chose to protect Moscow where 100 interceptors are current deployed. The United States opted to protect a Minuteman nuclear base in North Dakota but took down the system in 1974 as the Soviets could easily overwhelm the limited defense of 100 interceptors.

It then became an article of faith that defending the United States from Soviet or Chinese ballistic missiles was a bad thing.

Why such logic? Each of the nuclear superpowers had to be guaranteed the ability to destroy the other country, if it was attacked first with nuclear weapons. This came to be known as “mutual assured destruction,” often referred to by its appropriate acronym MAD. American missile defenses, it was argued, could significantly limit the deterrent ability of the Soviet Union and China to respond to an initial American attack for fear that whatever limited response could be mounted would be soaked up by the American defense.

This MAD assumption led the successive administrations to declare the treaty as “the cornerstone of strategic stability,” with early supporters predicting the absence of such defenses meant the nuclear superpowers would not have any reason to continue to build up their nuclear arsenals, and, thus hopefully bring the “nuclear arms race” to an end. Although in 1972 the first nuclear arms agreement—SALT or Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty—was also signed between the Soviet and American Presidents, it allowed the continued buildup of nuclear forces by additional tens of thousands of nuclear weapons.

In reality, as it was later revealed (and warned about by the Committee on the Present Danger), the Soviets pushed for the ABM Treaty not to “end” any nuclear arms race, but in fact to accelerate their own nuclear modernization, even under the SALT I treaty labelled as an “arms control deal.” The Soviets also through “disinformazione” and propaganda (such as the nuclear freeze campaign) also sought to push unilateral cuts to American nuclear upgrades. And their strategy worked.

In 1972 when President Nixon signed the ABM Treaty with the then Soviet Union, the Soviets had far fewer strategic long-range and short-range nuclear weapons than the United States. It was largely a Soviet initiative to seek the treaty, due to the 1967 announcement by the Secretary of Defense in the Johnson administration to build a limited missile defense shield, to stop a newly emerging Chinese missile threat.

Soviet General Secretary Brezhnev however saw the potential U.S. missile shield as a threat to Russia. And as soon as President-elect Nixon took office, the Soviet leader proposed to Nixon that all missile defenses be banned “to end the nuclear arms race.” As we now know from the Soviet archives, Moscow was worried a robust U.S. missile defense could significantly blunt what U.S. defense secretary Melvin Laird later argued was a planned Soviet first strike against the United States. The Soviet leaders though U.S. missile defenses could undermine the Soviet policy of seeking to use missile threats for coercion or blackmail. And in the absence of U.S. missile defenses, of course, Soviet warheads speeding toward their targets on the U.S. mainland would be unimpeded. The Soviet leadership wanted to keep things that way, but they also had to buy time to change the strategic balance in their favor.

Although domestic U.S. supporters of the ABM Treaty were convinced the Soviet interest in the ABM Treaty was simply to preserve MAD, the Soviets as we have noted had other motives, primarily to curtail U.S. nuclear modernization while the Soviets simultaneously caught up and eventually surpassed U.S. warhead levels.

The Soviet Nuclear Buildup

Ironically, the SALT I agreement and the ABM Treaty did little to contain the subsequent buildup of Soviet nuclear forces despite widespread rhetoric to the contrary. While the United States did increase its nuclear arsenal, primarily by adding multiple warheads on its land-based Minuteman and sea-based Polaris missiles, the entirety of the U.S. planned nuclear modernization in the 1970s was repeatedly delayed, curtailed, or stopped entirely, except for B-2 bomber research and development. The MX missile and B1 bombers were never acquired during the 1970s and funding for the Ohio class submarine and bomber cruise missile was cut repeatedly, delaying deployment until at least 1981.

In fact, up until the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, virtually every nuclear weapons modernization program was cut by Congress in its annual consideration of the defense budget. So, by the end of the decade, while strategic warhead levels were roughly equal, all types of U.S. nuclear warhead levels had dropped to 23,000 from 26,000, while the Soviets increased their warhead deployments from 11,600 to 30,000, a nearly three-fold increase. By 1980, the Soviets openly boasted that the “correlation of forces” favored the USSR over the Americans in large part due to an expansive buildup of Soviet nuclear and conventional forces.

By the time President Reagan took office in 1981, a key Soviet strategic nuclear force had surpassed the United States, in that the Soviet deployed fast flying multi-warhead land-based ballistic missiles significantly exceeded those of the United States. The Soviet momentum eventually would bring their strategic long-range nuclear warhead deployments alone to near 12,000, which were eventually roughly matched by the United States because President Reagan successfully pursued a nuclear modernization program that had been slowed and truncated by the previous administration.

Missile Defense Proposed

During this period of U.S. nuclear modernization, the question of whether the United States should deploy missile defenses rose to the front of national policy debates. President Reagan in March 1983 proposed the United States begin to research and develop robust missile defenses to blunt any future Soviet missile attack, as well as lesser nuclear powers including rogue states such as China, North Korea and Iran.

As former Reagan national security adviser Robert McFarlane notes, some traditional opponents of missile defense in Congress nevertheless grudgingly supported the missile defense funding. Despite the split control of Congress between the two major political parties, Reagan successfully secured significant missile defense funding beginning in 1983.

McFarlane explained that Reagan convinced key members of Congress to support missile defense—an area where U.S. technology excelled. The missile defense initiative was designed to compel the Soviets to agree to major reductions in nuclear weapons, which was a key objective of the Reagan administration. Robust U.S. missile defense deployments it was thought, far from spurring a nuclear arms buildup by the Soviets, could be leveraged to secure major build-downs since an effective defense would nullify the Soviet sought advantage in offensive nuclear weapons. As both sides modernized their arsenals, the deployed numbers could still be dramatically reduced, exactly what Reagan sought in the START I and II arms control process.

Nuclear Deals Bear Fruit

McFarlane recalls being asked by top defense senators, “How long do we have to support the missile defense spending before an arms control deal materializes?” The hoped-for deals eventually concluded were the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) and the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START I) Reagan had first drawn-up in 1981.

McFarlane guessed that if one were measuring from the Reagan 1983 strategic defense initiative or SDI speech, he reckoned it would take about 4 years before the first deal could be concluded. The first deal—the 1987 INF treaty eliminating all missiles in Europe and Asia (and the nuclear warheads they carried) in the 500-5,000-kilometer range—was exactly within the four-year time-table McFarlane predicted.

Not too long after that, the 1991 START I treaty materialized, reducing deployed U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads by nearly 50 percent, down to 6,000, followed in 1993 by the Bush-Yeltsin START II treaty between the United States and Russia calling for again reducing strategic nuclear warheads down to 3,500. At the United Nations in January 1992, President Yeltsin of Russia even went so far as to propose the United States and Russia together to cut nuclear weapons dramatically and simultaneously deploy a global and layered missile defense system to guard against missile threats.

Unfortunately, while the 1991 START I (with top-notch verification measures) treaty was implemented, the Russian Federation after Yeltsin opposed the START II treaty in part because of its ban on multiple warhead land-based missiles—the very first strike weapons the Soviets had long seen as providing key leverage against the United States in a crisis or conflict. In fact, former Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev took to the pages of the New York Times in 1996 to declare opposition to START II, warning the treaty if agreed to was tantamount to “disarming Russia.”

Arms Control or Missile Defense?

The obvious question after Yeltsin was whether the new Putin administration was going back to the old Soviet Union strategy of using nuclear weapons for coercion and blackmail. The Russian Duma eventually made Moscow’s intention clear. In 2000, some 8 years after the START II treaty was signed by President Bush and President Yeltsin, and after the U.S. Senate had agreed to the treaty, the Duma declared it would agree to the treaty but only if the United States kept all its missile defense work in the laboratory.

Specifically, the Russian Federal Law on ratification linked START II implementation to continued U.S. compliance with the 1972 ABM Treaty while prohibiting all U.S. missile defenses, even those designed to protect against rogue state threats. Unwilling to ban multiple warhead land-based missiles, (the preponderant nuclear forces deployed by the Russians), the Duma adopted a clever ruse to make sure the treaty never entered into force by making an offer to the United States they knew we would never accept!

Now American missile defense critics supported the Duma, arguing the end of the Cold War lessened missile threats significantly and such homeland and regional missile defenses were simply not necessary, especially those called for by the 1999 Missile Defense Act. Furthermore, these same critics argued since missile defenses cannot perfectly defend against multiple thousands of nuclear armed missiles and thus cannot effectively defend our homeland cities, such defenses should be banned. In short, even though American and Russian deployed strategic nuclear warhead levels had significantly diminished through arms control, MAD remained, in the eyes of disarmers, central to strategic stability, to be guaranteed in part by a continued ban on national missile defenses.

New Missile Threats Emerge

But such views ignored serious new threats outside the U.S.-Russian nuclear strategic balance. Two new missile threats emerged after the end of the Cold War and gave strong impetus to the United States seriously reviewing the need to deploy missile defenses, despite the relative success of arms control and the end of the Cold War. First, as the 1998 Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States noted, pro-missile defense legislation in the U.S. Congress was spurred by the use of missiles by Iraq in 1991 against the United States in Desert Storm.

Second, just as the Rumsfeld Commission had predicted, the long-range missile threat from North Korea emerged, most notably the 1998 Tae Po Dong missile test that occurred within days of the Rumsfeld Commission report being released and warning of exactly such a development. Specialists concluded that while the North Korean missile was in the 2,500 kilometer range, a very surprising development, it was possibly capable of considerably longer flight, up to 5,500 kilometers, if deployed with a small payload, putting at risk key U.S. interests.

Not only were new Iraqi and North Korean missile threats a factor, but additional and troublesome missile threats emerged elsewhere, as terror group proxies such as Hamas and Hizballah deployed very large missile inventories and over the next two decades began launching large-scale missile attacks on Israel.

These non-state actors reflected the emerging diversity in the new missile threats as these terror groups eventually acquired thousands of rockets and ballistic missiles—largely from Iran—which up to this day have been repeatedly launched at U.S. allies in the Middle East including at the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Israel and the United Arab Emirates.

As for the argument that U.S. missile defense initiatives spurred adversary missile developments, the Rumsfeld Commission highlighted the Iraqi and North Korean missile launch developments preceded the deployment by the United States of an initial national missile defense by thirteen and six years respectively, as well as the deployment of our theater or regional missile defenses. And it was only in 1999 that Congress passed, and President Clinton signed into law, the Missile Defense Act of 1999, requiring that the United States eventually deploy national missile defenses, even though the United States still remained a signatory to the ABM Treaty that prevented such defenses. So, without question, missile threats to the United States and its allies came first long before responsive U.S. missile defense deployments.

Putin: Escalate to Win

To make matters worse, on top of the twin Iraqi and North Korean missile threats, plus the Duma’s rejection of the START II treaty reductions, Russian President Putin in remarks made in April 2000 emphasized the use of very limited nuclear strikes against both the U.S. regional and homeland military capabilities, during even the initial stage of a crisis or regional conventional conflict.

The Russian objective was to keep the United States out of the fight, forcing Washington to stand down in the face of such nuclear missile threats. Failure to come to the defense of our NATO allies, such as the Baltic nations, for example, could collapse NATO, a long-time Russian objective. Similarly, as former House Speaker Gingrich outlines in his new book, China also has increasingly moved toward a similar nuclear strategy with respect to its continued threats to forcefully incorporate Taiwan or the Republic of China into its political control.

Vladimir Putin, coming to power in Russia at the end of the 1990’s, highlighted not only that further strategic arms control with the United States was uncertain but that U.S. missile defenses should again be considered for deployment, especially with the rise of rogue state nations also potentially armed with nuclear armed missiles.

In short, the United States was in a strategic quandary. Should we build missile defenses to deal with rogue states as well as non-state terror groups or put aside any future missile defenses largely because it was assumed missile defenses were not compatible with continued arms control with Russia?

Bush: Part One, Both Arms Control and Defenses

George W. Bush took office in 2001 and resolved that dilemma by proposing to Russia both (1) further reductions in nuclear weapons—what became the Moscow Treaty of 2002—down to 2,200, a more than 60 percent cut in deployed warheads; (2) while simultaneously also announcing in December 2001 the United States would get out of the ABM Treaty and proceed to build missile defenses. This allowed the United States to fulfill the requirement of the 1999 Missile Defense Act, to protect the U.S. mainland and territory from ballistic missiles, especially those armed with nuclear warheads.

Surprisingly, contrary to missile defense critics assumptions, the end of the 1972 ABM Treaty did not eliminate further arms control. In fact, the 2003-4 deployment of what would eventually be 44 land-based missile interceptors in Alaska and California apparently facilitated further reductions. Not only did the 2003-4 initial deployments coincide with the 2002 Moscow Treaty reductions from 6,000 down to 2,200 deployed strategic warheads, but subsequently the New START treaty of 2010 further reduced countable Russian deployed strategic nuclear weapons to the notional 1,550 level, strong evidence that missile defenses were perfectly compatible with major reductions in nuclear weapons.

Nuclear Threats Get Worse

Now the relatively limited missile defense deployments in 2003–2004, and the significant arms reductions in the 2002 Moscow and 2010 New START agreements, did not usher in an era of complete strategic stability. Russia still has roughly 2,200–3,200 strategic nuclear warheads capable—if generated—of striking the United States via long-range missiles and bombers. Putin also insists the new deployed warheads on 6 additional nuclear strategic systems, now being developed and partially deployed, do not count under New START, probably giving Russia’s arsenal an eventual additional 300-400 warheads by the middle of the next decade.

And equally problematical, the Russians also have close to 5,000 theater nuclear weapons which have never been included in any arms control limits. Conversely, the United States has only 500 theater weapons, with only 200 based in Europe; certainly, a serious imbalance. Although these numbers are a significant reduction from the height of the Cold War, they are nonetheless a still highly threatening arsenal according to analysis done by former top DOD nuclear expert Dr. Mark Schneider of the National Institute of Public Policy.

Additionally, China’s purported arsenal of 280 nuclear warheads is projected to grow to near 800 over the next decade, and then double again in the following decade.

Obviously, our current and planned missile defense deployments in Alaska and California cannot effectively deal with the entirety of the Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and do not in any way threaten their deterrent capability.

Missile Defenses: A Good Option?

Given this strategic imbalance, and faced with these myriad and remaining serious missile threats, does it make sense for Congress and the administration to examine whether to deploy more robust and capable missile defenses? This would deal with not the entirety of the ballistic missile threats arrayed against the United States and its allies, but in particular both rogue state threats from Iran and North Korea, and the “escalate to win” Russian (and emerging Chinese) strategy of threatening limited nuclear strikes to successfully undertake aggression without having to fight.

The assumption of missile defense opponents who think that Congress should curtail missile defense spending remains stuck in a Cold War mindset, where any U.S. missile defense deployment is thought to be “destabilizing.” For example, how can it be assumed that 44 interceptors (and eventually a planned 66) based in Alaska and California, will successfully stop all of the hundreds of available retaliatory Russian or Chinese warheads? The math obviously makes no sense—66 interceptors cannot stop hundreds or thousands of missile warheads.

Not only do many missile defense critics oppose the United States protecting our country from missiles, they also claim it has been the deployment of our limited missile shield that has pushed both Russia and China to increase their nuclear arsenals. Critics argue the United States has an unnecessarily aggressive move to deploy “first the shield and then the sword,” the shield being missile defense interceptors and the sword being offensive nuclear armed missiles. The idea being the United States will strike first against an adversary and then soak up all retaliatory warheads with its newly installed missile defense.

The critics actually have it backward. In reality, the Russians and Chinese adoption of limited missile strike doctrines preceded U.S. missile defense deployments, and far from being a threat to Russia and China deterrent posture, the U.S. missile defenses prevent the reckless threat of “limited” nuclear use as missile defenses are now much more likely to stop dozens of adversary missile warheads than hundreds or thousands.

Whether the Russian or Chinese nuclear arsenals will be used in the future coercively or through blackmail is open to question, but to the extent that Russia and China’s leaders believe the only option they have—limited nuclear strikes or the escalate to win strategy—has now been taken off the table because the United States and our allied security has been strengthened.

As I have previously conveyed, the new Russian and emerging Chinese doctrine of threatening to use only a limited number of nuclear weapons in a crisis or conventional conflict makes even a so-called limited U.S. national or regional missile defenses highly credible as a deterrent.

Our ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California were never designed to protect against a massive nuclear attack. The missile defenses we now have can however readily deter limited strikes, having been successful in 75 percent of four recent tests. As we move to the future, these systems can be modified to be made more robust as to credibly deter and defend against the early initiation of nuclear weapons and limited strikes, effectively blocking the aggressive designs of Russia and China.

As for Iran, North Korea, terror groups such as the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza, and Hizballah in Syria and Lebanon, our regional and allied missile defenses are relatively more robust than our national missile defenses. Israel has demonstrated they are capable of intercepting upwards of 90 percent of Hamas incoming rockets even when such shorter range rockets have been launched by the multiple hundreds.

However, since our enemies are certainly not standing still, neither should the United States.

More capable missile defenses could certainly enhance our security and strategic stability and we should rapidly pursue variable missile defenses both global and layered, to include a system of space-based sensors to meet future more advanced threats.

Missile Defense: The New Cornerstone

In summary, what the United States has now done is flip upside down the traditional narrative of the ABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty (thankfully) no longer must be thought of as the “cornerstone” of U.S. security. In fact, the very opposite is the case—the presence of missile defenses acts as a critical cornerstone of U.S. and allied security because they remove the threat of limited use of nuclear weapons—for coercion and blackmail, off the strategic table.

As for massive strategic strikes involving nuclear weapons, the strong retaliatory capability maintained by the U.S. nuclear deterrent makes any such massive enemy strike totally irrational. And while removing the limited use of nuclear weapons does not necessarily eliminate all nuclear threats, U.S. and ally missile defense capabilities do begin to address emerging threats from Russia and China and rogue states, thus enhancing U.S. security quite dramatically.

To be sure, the United States needs to accelerate and expand its air and missile defense budgets and acquisition plans to meet current and projected growing and diverse missile threats to our homeland and overseas bases. This will require deploying spaced based and improved missile interceptors, upgraded Aegis cruisers, directed energy systems, and regional missile defenses, including those that deal with hypersonic threats.

We must continue to upgrade current missile defense capabilities, especially the 44-66 interceptors deployed in Alaska and California, and the more than 1,200 regional interceptors deployed globally to protect the United States and its allies in the Pacific, Middle East and Europe.

It has been half a century since the ABM Treaty forced the United States into forgoing defenses under the mistaken belief that it would end nuclear threats and the arms race. Although the Cold War ended, we now have multiple peer competitors, rogue state actors and terror affiliates, all of which brandish ballistic missiles or rockets for coercion, blackmail and terror. As a result, missile defenses are now becoming a key cornerstone of American security. That will require us to implement the goals of the 2019 Missile Defense Review (MDR). That report says CSIS “represents an attempt to adapt U.S. missile defense policy, posture, and programs to the strategic environment of great power competition [especially as] the United States and its allies face a more complex and challenging threat environment than ever before.”

In the wake of the Paris attacks , a majority of young Americans support sending U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS , according to a wide-ranging new poll from the Harvard Institute of Politics .
The institute has asked millennials about the idea of American boots on the ground at three different times this year , and the survey results have fluctuated somewhat , but there seems to be a `` hardening of support . ''
In this most recent survey , 60 percent of the 18- to 29-year-olds polled say they support committing U.S. combat troops to fight ISIS . But an almost equal number ( 62 percent ) say they would n't want to personally join the fight , even if the U.S. needed additional troops .
The disconnect in joining the fight comes down to how millennials feel about the government writ large , according to Harvard IOP Polling Director John Della Volpe .
`` I 'm reminded of the significant degree of distrust that this generation has about all things related to government , '' said Della Volpe . `` And I believe if young people had a better relationship with government ... they 'd be more open to serving . ''
Della Volpe does caution , though , that this poll does n't dig into the size or the scope of the military campaign that young folks would be willing to theoretically support .
`` I ca n't tell you that young people support 5,000 troops or 50,000 troops , '' he said .
Here are four other takeaways from the poll that help us explain the political attitudes of young people this election cycle .
Forty-three percent of the young Americans polled welcome the idea of building a wall along the U.S. Southern border with Mexico . But support differs sharply along partisan lines . Seventy percent of Republicans surveyed supported the wall , compared with 31 percent of Democrats .
`` This is a very divisive issue , '' said Della Volpe . `` And you can really kind of predict who 's gon na support it based on what their race is and also what their political party is . ''
A majority of white 18- to 29-year-olds polled support the wall , but only about a quarter of young Hispanics do .
`` It 's clearly kind of a wedge issue — something that illustrates significant differences in the way that young Republicans and young Democrats view America , '' said Della Volpe .
The Harvard IOP poll is conducted twice a year — in the fall and in the spring .
In the spring , Bernie Sanders seemed like a blip on the radar — just 1 percent of young Democratic primary voters supported him . Now , he 's edging out Hillary Clinton ( 41 percent to 35 percent ) .
`` The idea of any candidate moving 40 points or so over the course of six months , frankly , is extraordinary , '' said Della Volpe .
But , he says , it 's not surprising to see huge support for Sanders when you line up his campaign with some of the attributes that young people want to see in a candidate .
`` For example , young people telling us they 're interested in somebody who is authentic , who has integrity — these are some of the hallmarks , I think , of the ways in which young people would describe Bernie Sanders ' campaign , '' said Della Volpe .
Among young Republicans , Donald Trump has a slim lead ( 22 percent ) over Ben Carson ( 20 percent ) .
Sanders is a self-described `` democratic socialist , '' a label that commentators and some of Sanders ' opponents have suggested could be a problem . They question Sanders ' ability to govern a capitalist economy . Sanders even delivered a speech about his vision of democratic socialism , but , as NPR 's Sam Sanders has reported , many young people do n't mind the label .
The Harvard IOP poll finds the term makes `` no difference '' to 66 percent of likely Democratic voters .
`` Young people are fiercely independent , '' said Della Volpe . `` They 're not looking at a label , they 're looking at a person and his platform . ''
What 's perhaps more interesting is that for some millennials , the label does carry a connotation — and not the one pundits may have thought . For some young folks , democratic socialism is a plus — 24 percent say the `` democratic socialist '' ID makes them `` more likely '' to vote for Sanders .
Young voters lean left , so it 's no surprise that a majority ( 56 percent ) in this poll want a Democrat to maintain control of the White House . Only 36 percent say they prefer a Republican candidate .
The Democrats have widened the gap over the past six months , when Harvard IOP last polled .
`` Republicans had been making progress , but it looks like they might have taken a step back in terms of connecting their views with America 's millennial generation , `` said Della Volpe .
In particular , Democrats seem to be doing better among younger 18- to 24-year-olds . ( As we previously reported , there had been some indication that these younger millennials might be more conservative than their older siblings . )
`` We see fewer people today interested in supporting the Republican Party than we had six months ago , '' said Della Volpe . `` And the only thing that has changed between now and six months ago is that we 've had ... several Republican debates , and a lot of opportunities for Republicans — Donald Trump , Ben Carson and others — to share their views . ''
But regardless of political affiliation , most millennials still say they do n't follow politics . And a majority say they 're not following the presidential race . More than three-quarters of those polled say they 're not politically engaged .
Harvard Institute of Politics GFK-Knowledge Panel was a survey of 2,011 18- to 29- year-old U.S. citizens interviewed from Oct. 30 to Nov. 9 , 2015 . An exception was the section on sending ground troops and serving in the military , which had a sample size of 435 , and was re-asked following the November attacks in Paris . The margin of error for questions asked of the entire panel is +/- 2.8 percentage points .","Millennials Want To Send Troops To Fight ISIS, But Don't Want To Serve

""I'm reminded of the significant degree of distrust that this generation has about all things related to government,"" said Della Volpe. ""And I believe if young people had a better relationship with government ... they'd be more open to serving.""

Della Volpe does caution, though, that this poll doesn't dig into the size or the scope of the military campaign that young folks would be willing to theoretically support.

""I can't tell you that young people support 5,000 troops or 50,000 troops,"" he said.

Here are four other takeaways from the poll that help us explain the political attitudes of young people this election cycle.

1. Building a wall at the border

Forty-three percent of the young Americans polled welcome the idea of building a wall along the U.S. Southern border with Mexico. But support differs sharply along partisan lines. Seventy percent of Republicans surveyed supported the wall, compared with 31 percent of Democrats.

""This is a very divisive issue,"" said Della Volpe. ""And you can really kind of predict who's gonna support it based on what their race is and also what their political party is.""

A majority of white 18- to 29-year-olds polled support the wall, but only about a quarter of young Hispanics do.

""It's clearly kind of a wedge issue — something that illustrates significant differences in the way that young Republicans and young Democrats view America,"" said Della Volpe.

2. Skyrocketing support for Bernie Sanders

The Harvard IOP poll is conducted twice a year — in the fall and in the spring.

In the spring, Bernie Sanders seemed like a blip on the radar — just 1 percent of young Democratic primary voters supported him. Now, he's edging out Hillary Clinton (41 percent to 35 percent).

""The idea of any candidate moving 40 points or so over the course of six months, frankly, is extraordinary,"" said Della Volpe.

But, he says, it's not surprising to see huge support for Sanders when you line up his campaign with some of the attributes that young people want to see in a candidate.

""For example, young people telling us they're interested in somebody who is authentic, who has integrity — these are some of the hallmarks, I think, of the ways in which young people would describe Bernie Sanders' campaign,"" said Della Volpe.

Among young Republicans, Donald Trump has a slim lead (22 percent) over Ben Carson (20 percent).

3. No labels

Sanders is a self-described ""democratic socialist,"" a label that commentators and some of Sanders' opponents have suggested could be a problem. They question Sanders' ability to govern a capitalist economy. Sanders even delivered a speech about his vision of democratic socialism, but, as NPR's Sam Sanders has reported, many young people don't mind the label.

The Harvard IOP poll finds the term makes ""no difference"" to 66 percent of likely Democratic voters.

""Young people are fiercely independent,"" said Della Volpe. ""They're not looking at a label, they're looking at a person and his platform.""

What's perhaps more interesting is that for some millennials, the label does carry a connotation — and not the one pundits may have thought. For some young folks, democratic socialism is a plus — 24 percent say the ""democratic socialist"" ID makes them ""more likely"" to vote for Sanders.

4. Disinterested Democrats?

Young voters lean left, so it's no surprise that a majority (56 percent) in this poll want a Democrat to maintain control of the White House. Only 36 percent say they prefer a Republican candidate.

The Democrats have widened the gap over the past six months, when Harvard IOP last polled.

""Republicans had been making progress, but it looks like they might have taken a step back in terms of connecting their views with America's millennial generation, "" said Della Volpe.

In particular, Democrats seem to be doing better among younger 18- to 24-year-olds. (As we previously reported, there had been some indication that these younger millennials might be more conservative than their older siblings.)

""We see fewer people today interested in supporting the Republican Party than we had six months ago,"" said Della Volpe. ""And the only thing that has changed between now and six months ago is that we've had ... several Republican debates, and a lot of opportunities for Republicans — Donald Trump, Ben Carson and others — to share their views.""

But regardless of political affiliation, most millennials still say they don't follow politics. And a majority say they're not following the presidential race. More than three-quarters of those polled say they're not politically engaged.

Harvard Institute of Politics GFK-Knowledge Panel was a survey of 2,011 18- to 29- year-old U.S. citizens interviewed from Oct. 30 to Nov. 9, 2015. An exception was the section on sending ground troops and serving in the military, which had a sample size of 435, and was re-asked following the November attacks in Paris. The margin of error for questions asked of the entire panel is +/- 2.8 percentage points.",www.npr.org,center,Jg5oBHx25GAXopn2

Just before committing the act, the killer had shouted in Arabic: “God is great! [NOTE: “Allahu Akbar”] Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!” and then, in Turkish: “Don’t forget Aleppo! Don’t forget Syria!” Trump immediately released a statement characterizing the assassin as a “radical Islamic terrorist.”

How did Trump know this right away? The murderer was certainly angry at Russia’s backing of Syrian President Assad in the civil war that has reduced much of that country to rubble. Is that fact alone enough to put this particular killer in the same ideological category as ISIS? That may turn out to be the case, but Trump doesn’t wait for the full story before tweeting, and certainly doesn’t seem to consider such questions important in the first place.

It’s a safe a guess that no serious presidential candidate had ever done so in the midst of a campaign before this year. Yet the one who did got elected president.

Trump turned the murder of more than four dozen people into a political wedge issue. Party over country. Politics over security. That’s what Republicans do. Could you imagine Barack Obama doing that? Could you imagine Trump not?

Ask yourself what kind of thinking lies behind the decision to do so. Is it just naked ambition? Is it a sense of entitlement that runs so deep that doing anything necessary to gain power becomes justified? It’s not solely about one individual, however, given how widespread is the phenomenon of Republicans putting party over country, party over security, or party over democracy (see: Carolina, North and Garland, Merrick).

The strikes occurred at about 11 a.m . ET on Sunday , a source familiar with the matter told CNN . They stand as the first significant military response in retaliation for attacks by the Shia militia group , known as Kataib Hezbollah , that have injured numerous American military personnel , according to US officials .
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman described the strikes against the group as `` precision defensive strikes '' that `` will degrade '' the group 's ability to conduct future attacks against coalition forces .
Defense Secretary Mark Esper briefed President Donald Trump Saturday before carrying them out with the President 's approval , according to a US official familiar with the strikes .
At least 25 people were killed in the US airstrikes , according to a statement Sunday from the Popular Mobilization Units , a Tehran-backed Shiite militia also known as the Hashd al-Shaabi .
Kataib Hezbollah is a group under the Popular Mobilization Units .

Speaking from the President 's Florida resort , Pompeo said the US took `` decisive action '' and said threats against American forces had been ongoing for `` weeks and weeks . ''
`` We will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy , '' Pompeo said .
Esper said Sunday 's meeting with the President included discussing `` other options available '' without providing further detail . He added that the US `` would take additional actions as necessary to ensure that we act in our own self-defense and we deter further bad behavior from militia groups or from Iran . ''
US officials said the five targets included three Kataib Hezbollah locations in Iraq and two in Syria . Those locations included weapon storage facilities and command and control locations that the group uses `` to plan and execute attacks on OIR ( Operation Inherent Resolve ) coalition forces , '' according to the Pentagon .
The strikes all came from the air using F-15 Strike Eagle fighter planes , the US official familiar with the strikes said . Secondary explosions were observed after some of the strikes , indicating the sights may have housed ammunition .
While there were multiple strikes , the sites being hit were relatively small , the official told CNN . Whether the US decides to strike further will depend on the activities of the militia , they said , and whether it conducts additional attacks against US interests .
American officials have blamed the group for attacks like one on Friday on a base near Kirkuk , Iraq , that killed a US civilian contractor and injured four other US service members .
Hoffman asserted again in his statement that the group has links to Iranian forces .
`` KH has a strong linkage with Iran 's Quds Force and has repeatedly received lethal aid and other support from Iran that it has used to attack OIR coalition forces , '' he said .
Abdelkarim Khalaf , spokesman of the commander of Iraq 's Armed Forces , said during a live interview on state television , Al-Iraqiya TV , that Esper informed Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi half an hour before the US airstrikes .
`` The Iraqi Prime Minister expressed his strong objection to this unilateral decision and his concern that it would lead to further escalation and demanded that he ( Esper ) stop it ( airstrikes ) immediately , '' Khalaf said .
He added that `` these strikes represent a treacherous stab in the back . ''
Abdul Mahdi said the Baghdad government rejects `` unilateral action '' by coalition forces inside his country , according to a statement carried on state television .
`` We have already confirmed our rejection of any unilateral action by coalition forces or any other forces inside Iraq . We consider it a violation of Iraq 's sovereignty and a dangerous escalation that threatens the security of Iraq and the region , '' the Iraqi prime minister said .
The US had been pushed to the brink of retaliation against Iran or its proxies before Sunday 's strikes , specifically after attacks this summer on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and Iran 's downing of a US drone in June .
US officials , including Pompeo , repeatedly stressed that any threat to the freedom of navigation in the Gulf and the oil trade would be considered unacceptable , but the Trump administration took no action .

national_defense,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2020/1/2/21047655/iran-us-strike-general-qassem-suleimani-pentagon-news,Killing Iran’s Qassem Suleimani changes the game in the Middle East,2020-01-02,"Daniel Byman, Emily Stewart, Aja Romano, Julia Belluz, Jillian Weinberger, Amy Drozdowska, Matthew Yglesias","On Thursday night , the Pentagon announced that the United States killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani , the head of Iran ’ s paramilitary forces , in an airstrike in Iraq “ at the direction of the President . ”
The strike that took out Soleimani also reportedly killed the leader of Kataib Hezbollah , an Iranian proxy militia in Iraq that has repeatedly attacked US and allied forces and recently launched rockets at a US military base . Those attacks killed an American contractor , which led the United States to respond and kill 25 operatives in attacks in Iraq and Syria . In separate operations , US forces have also captured and arrested leaders of other important Iraqi militias with close ties to Iran .
The killing of Soleimani , the long-time head of Iran ’ s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force ( IRGC-QF ) is likely to prove a watershed in Washington ’ s relations with Iraq and Iran and will substantially affect the overall US position in the Middle East . The blowback may be huge , and much depends on how well prepared the United States is for Iran ’ s response and that of its many proxies in the Middle East .
Based on the Trump administration ’ s record in the region , there is reason to be worried .
It ’ s hard to overstate Soleimani ’ s influence . Because Iran ’ s conventional forces are weak , Tehran often works through militias , terrorist groups , and other proxies to advance its interests abroad . The IRGC takes the lead for many of these operations . In Iraq , and in other countries where Iran plays both a military and political role — such as Yemen , Lebanon , Syria , Afghanistan , as well as with the Palestinians — the IRGC is often the dominant actor in Iran ’ s foreign policy , or at least an important voice .
In April , the Trump administration took the unusual step of officially designating the IRGC as a terrorist group even though it is an arm of the Iranian state , and thus not a non-state actor , unlike most of the entities on the US list of terrorist organizations .
Soleimani has been the architect of many of Iran ’ s most contentious foreign policy issues , and he and the IRGC-QF are responsible for the deaths of many Americans .
The Quds Force , with perhaps between 10,000 and 20,000 fighters in its organization , provides training , weapons , organizational guidance , and other support to a range of pro-Iran groups .
The IRGC , with the Quds Force in the lead , is the key Iranian liaison with the Lebanese Hezbollah , the strongest paramilitary organization in Lebanon — and one that has attacked Israel and the US at Iran ’ s behest . The Quds Force also works with Palestinian terrorist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad , among other nefarious organizations in other countries . When the United States clashed with pro-Iran forces in Iraq , the Quds Force made them far more deadly , providing them after 2005 with sophisticated explosives that could penetrate US armored vehicles , killing almost 200 Americans .
Having been at the helm of the Quds Force since 1998 , Soleimani has cultivated a power network in Iran itself and through the IRGC ’ s many proxies . He is a symbol of Iran ’ s power , prestige , and reach .
Iran ’ s response to Soleimani ’ s killing will be serious , and unpredictable
With Soleimani ’ s death there will be hell to pay — and because of Quds Force ’ s reach , Iran will have multiple theaters in which to attack the United States .
Attacks on US forces and facilities in Iraq are particularly likely . Tehran has spent over 15 years building up extensive networks among militia groups and politicians in Iraq . Earlier this week , before Soleimani ’ s death , Iran was able to rapidly mobilize local proxies to violently demonstrate at the US Embassy in Baghdad , creating a grave security risk to personnel there , even as Tehran ’ s local allies avoided killing more Americans . Now the gloves are likely to come off .
In the strike that killed Soleimani , the United States also reportedly took out the head of the pro-Iran militia Kataib Hezbollah , Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis , and several other senior pro-Iran figures in Iraq . Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for numerous attacks on US and Iraqi forces , often at Iran ’ s behest . This , too , will not go unpunished : In addition to wanting to please Iran , pro-Iran militias in Iraq will be angered by al-Muhandis ’ s death and the arrests of their leaders and eager to avenge them .
Soleimani ’ s killing is only likely to strengthen Iran ’ s hand , politically
Many Iraqi politicians , by necessity and in some cases by choice , have close ties to Iran , and pressure will grow to oust US forces from the country . If there is a back-and-forth between the United States and Iran , it is simply the case that Iran has more allies and more influence there , and many Iraqi leaders are likely to bow to Iranian pressure .
US military forces in Afghanistan and Syria are also at risk , though both are already well defended due to threats from ISIS , the Taliban , and other dangerous groups . The IRGC and its proxies may also strike at official US embassies and other government-related targets . In 1983 , the Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah blew up the US Embassy in Beirut as well as the Marine barracks there , killing 220 Marines , and dozens of other Americans . Civilians too may be in the crosshairs . Some of Iran ’ s proxies lack the skill to strike at well-defended official targets , so Tehran may also seek to send a broader message in order to intimidate the United States .

Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s paramilitary forces, in an airstrike in Iraq “at the direction of the President.”

The strike that took out Soleimani also reportedly killed the leader of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy militia in Iraq that has repeatedly attacked US and allied forces and recently launched rockets at a US military base. Those attacks killed an American contractor, which led the United States to respond and kill 25 operatives in attacks in Iraq and Syria. In separate operations, US forces have also captured and arrested leaders of other important Iraqi militias with close ties to Iran.

The killing of Soleimani, the long-time head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF) is likely to prove a watershed in Washington’s relations with Iraq and Iran and will substantially affect the overall US position in the Middle East. The blowback may be huge, and much depends on how well prepared the United States is for Iran’s response and that of its many proxies in the Middle East.

Based on the Trump administration’s record in the region, there is reason to be worried.

It’s hard to overstate Soleimani’s influence. Because Iran’s conventional forces are weak, Tehran often works through militias, terrorist groups, and other proxies to advance its interests abroad. The IRGC takes the lead for many of these operations. In Iraq, and in other countries where Iran plays both a military and political role — such as Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, as well as with the Palestinians — the IRGC is often the dominant actor in Iran’s foreign policy, or at least an important voice.

In April, the Trump administration took the unusual step of officially designating the IRGC as a terrorist group even though it is an arm of the Iranian state, and thus not a non-state actor, unlike most of the entities on the US list of terrorist organizations.

Soleimani has been the architect of many of Iran’s most contentious foreign policy issues, and he and the IRGC-QF are responsible for the deaths of many Americans.

The Quds Force, with perhaps between 10,000 and 20,000 fighters in its organization, provides training, weapons, organizational guidance, and other support to a range of pro-Iran groups.

The IRGC, with the Quds Force in the lead, is the key Iranian liaison with the Lebanese Hezbollah, the strongest paramilitary organization in Lebanon — and one that has attacked Israel and the US at Iran’s behest. The Quds Force also works with Palestinian terrorist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, among other nefarious organizations in other countries. When the United States clashed with pro-Iran forces in Iraq, the Quds Force made them far more deadly, providing them after 2005 with sophisticated explosives that could penetrate US armored vehicles, killing almost 200 Americans.

Having been at the helm of the Quds Force since 1998, Soleimani has cultivated a power network in Iran itself and through the IRGC’s many proxies. He is a symbol of Iran’s power, prestige, and reach.

Iran’s response to Soleimani’s killing will be serious, and unpredictable

With Soleimani’s death there will be hell to pay — and because of Quds Force’s reach, Iran will have multiple theaters in which to attack the United States.

Attacks on US forces and facilities in Iraq are particularly likely. Tehran has spent over 15 years building up extensive networks among militia groups and politicians in Iraq. Earlier this week, before Soleimani’s death, Iran was able to rapidly mobilize local proxies to violently demonstrate at the US Embassy in Baghdad, creating a grave security risk to personnel there, even as Tehran’s local allies avoided killing more Americans. Now the gloves are likely to come off.

In the strike that killed Soleimani, the United States also reportedly took out the head of the pro-Iran militia Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and several other senior pro-Iran figures in Iraq. Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for numerous attacks on US and Iraqi forces, often at Iran’s behest. This, too, will not go unpunished: In addition to wanting to please Iran, pro-Iran militias in Iraq will be angered by al-Muhandis’s death and the arrests of their leaders and eager to avenge them.

Soleimani’s killing is only likely to strengthen Iran’s hand, politically

Many Iraqi politicians, by necessity and in some cases by choice, have close ties to Iran, and pressure will grow to oust US forces from the country. If there is a back-and-forth between the United States and Iran, it is simply the case that Iran has more allies and more influence there, and many Iraqi leaders are likely to bow to Iranian pressure.

US military forces in Afghanistan and Syria are also at risk, though both are already well defended due to threats from ISIS, the Taliban, and other dangerous groups. The IRGC and its proxies may also strike at official US embassies and other government-related targets. In 1983, the Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah blew up the US Embassy in Beirut as well as the Marine barracks there, killing 220 Marines, and dozens of other Americans. Civilians too may be in the crosshairs. Some of Iran’s proxies lack the skill to strike at well-defended official targets, so Tehran may also seek to send a broader message in order to intimidate the United States.

Although Iran is likely to strike back, the scale and scope of its response are hard to predict. Hardliners there will call for making the United States pay for Soleimani’s death. In addition, a conflict with the United States may prove a useful way for the regime to deflect attention from Iran’s declining economy and the massive protests that have rocked the country.

However, Iran has long recognized its military weakness compared to the United States, and its leaders know that it can only lose if there is an all-out confrontation. In the many years of US-Iran confrontations, Iran has provoked Washington with terrorist attacks and by supporting anti-US proxies but also tried to back down when things looked as if they might get out of control. It is not clear, however, if the same script applies after the killing of a key figure like Soleimani.

Saunders, Brian Mcnicoll, Roger Kaplan, Jared Whitley","“ Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds ” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The events that have followed — namely , a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests , with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East .
In fact , much of this is overblown . For one thing , the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East , and those are not being drawn down anytime soon . Insofar as many of the pundits , analysts , and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster , they primarily have themselves to blame , however popular bashing Trump might be .
Indeed , these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria . They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear : namely , that after the military defeat of the Islamic State , U.S. forces should leave . As the president ’ s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates , he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises . When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria , he meant it . The message should have been clear : devise an orderly withdrawal plan .
But that is not what happened . Instead , efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria . The advocates for this “ stay indefinitely ” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops . They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria ’ s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “ land route ” to the Mediterranean .
In reality , none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria : countering the Islamic State . At the same time , the “ stay indefinitely ” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF : the issue of relations with Turkey , which considers ( with some justification ) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has fought the Turkish state for decades .
Regardless of what one thinks of Turkey ’ s approach towards the PKK , it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant . Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF ’ s territory . As such , Turkey could be the SDF ’ s main gateway to the outside world , rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region . Thus , for the interests of the SDF ’ s longterm economic prospects ( among other things ) , some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world .
Unfortunately , though , policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey ’ s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough . Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria , many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures : thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links , the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River , and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF .
Others argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely . This view is implausible . A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side ’ s attack , but it is not an absolute deterrent here . To understand why , consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria . In the northwest of Syria ( specifically the city of Idlib and its environs ) , Turkey set up multiple small military outposts in the insurgent-held areas ostensibly as part of enforcing a “ deescalation ” scheme in coordination with Russia . In practice , the goal has been to block any further Syrian government offensives on the northwest and prevent further refugee flows into Turkey .
While Russia has shown some understanding of Turkey ’ s concerns in this regard , it also wishes to assist the Syrian government in restoring its control over the area and will not tolerate the indefinite presence of designated “ terrorist ” groups harassing Syrian government and Russian positions . Russia thus gave Turkey time to clear a demilitarized buffer zone of the likes of Hay ’ at Tahrir al-Sham ( a designated “ terrorist ” group ) . When that did not materialize and the insurgent harassments of Syrian government and Russian positions continued , the Syrian government and Russia launched a military campaign that retook important areas in south Idlib and north Hama . The Turkish military outposts did not do anything to stop the offensive ( indeed , they could not do so ) , and in effect the Syrian government and Russia worked around one of the outposts in north Hama . A ceasefire then followed , but it should be clear that it will not last if Turkey can not crack down on the groups that are designated as “ terrorist . ”
That episode should also have been a lesson for U.S. policymakers . Turkey ’ s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly said he would launch an incursion against the SDF to the east of the Euphrates River ( where U.S. forces in Syria have primarily been stationed ) , and in 2018 Turkey had carried through with its threats to destroy the SDF enclave in the Afrin area , where the U.S. had no presence . What would have stopped Turkey from finding ways to work around U.S. positions as part of its incursion against the SDF east of the Euphrates River and essentially forcing the small U.S. garrisons — confronted by much larger Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent proxies — to get out of the way ?
Thus , Trump ’ s indication to Erdoğan that he wished to leave Syria and would not oppose an incursion likely hastened the Turkish operations against the SDF . But it was not the decisive factor in determining whether or not those operations would have eventually occurred anyway . Had the U.S. wished to deter Turkey indefinitely , it would have had to deploy far more troops in northeast Syria . For comparison , the much more extensive Turkish military presence in the insurgent-held north Aleppo countryside between Afrin and Jarabulus functions as an effective deterrent against Russian and Syrian government military action so long as Turkey maintains that large presence .
Of course , the advocates of the “ stay indefinitely ” course did not dare to confront these realities and argue for a more extensive U.S. presence , knowing that such advocacy would be politically unacceptable . They preferred to argue that the small U.S. troop presence in northeast Syria as an example of a deployment that was strategically effective and inexpensive .
Ultimately , the debate about the U.S. role in Syria boils down to the question of how far the U.S. should invest troops and resources into a foreign deployment . Those who advocated an indefinite presence are delusional if they think the prior status quo was sustainable . If they had thought more carefully about the idea of making the SDF-held areas a U.S. protectorate that could function independently of the wider environment , they should have accepted that such a project would have required far more troops and money to be poured in .
In any case , they should still be asked why they did not come up with an exit plan but instead thought they could defy the president ’ s wishes . They are the ones far more deserving of the accusation of betrayal for making misleading commitments , promises , and reassurances to the SDF .","“Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

One such momentous decision was to finally begin striking at the main source of the Islamic State ’ s financing — the columns of oil trucks heading to the black market — a cash flow that has been ongoing since the U.S. began the air war in August 2014 .
Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said top Pentagon leadership and Secretary of State John F. Kerry began the sessions in October .
“ We meet about every three or four weeks on specific issues in a campaign , ” he told the House Armed Services Committee at a hearing on war strategy that included Defense Secretary Ashton Carter as a witness .
“ I think it ’ s fair to say there was a recognition — Secretary Carter and Secretary Kerry recognized that we weren ’ t as integrated across the government as we should be , ” Gen. Dunford said .
“ So about two months ago , we began to meet on a periodic basis to attack specific issues , ” he said . “ So far , the oil issue is actually an outcome of the first meeting that we had , and the most recent meeting was on foreign fighters because that clearly requires the whole government . ”
“ Am I satisfied with the level of integration ? No . We ’ re working on that , ” he said .
Gen. Dunford ’ s disclosure came under questioning from Rep. Seth Moulton , Massachusetts Democrat and a former Marine Corps officer and platoon leader who did four tours in the Iraq War . He wondered aloud whether the State Department was helping as much as it could .
The testimony about oil and a flawed interagency process brought complaints from the committee ’ s newer , more hawkish Republican members who have military combat experience .
Rep. Martha McSally , a former Air Force A-10 pilot and the first woman pilot to fly into combat , recalled air power seminars that called for the maximum strikes possible .
“ You identify those centers of gravity or critical capabilities and vulnerabilities , and then you unleash American air power that overwhelmingly goes after them , ” the Arizona Republican said . “ We ’ re just now realizing oil trucks are moving . It ’ s been reported from the very beginning I ’ m deeply concerned about the lack of using American air power for all it brings to the fight . ”
Mr. Carter testified that it was not until recently that the U.S. developed the intelligence to distinguish which trucks were carrying Islamic State oil . With that knowledge , over 400 trucks have been destroyed , he said .
But that raised another question : Why does the Obama administration consider truck drivers not to be enemy combatants ? The U.S. gives the drivers a leaflet warning to run from their vehicles before aircraft strike the convoys .
To some lawmakers , putting truck drivers off-limits symbolizes all that is wrong with Mr. Obama ’ s war strategy , in which so much care is taken to avoid civilian casualties that U.S. jets return to bases , their ordnance still intact .
“ They [ the drivers ] knew they were funding ISIS , and they are not enemy combatants ? ” Rep. Jim Bridenstine , Oklahoma Republican , told Mr. Cater , who appeared irked by his line of questioning .
“ I ’ m astonished , ” said Mr. Bridenstine , a Navy Reserve carrier pilot who has flown the E-2C Hawkeye surveillance plane and the F-18 fighter .
“ These were people who were making a buck , so we gave them every opportunity to survive the strike , ” the defense secretary said .
Gen. Dunford said the procedure goes this way : two air volleys in front of and behind each convoy , and a leaflet drop warning . Then the trucks are hit .
Mr. Carter generally painted an upbeat war picture . Syrian rebels have taken back territory and are moving toward the Islamic State ’ s self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa while the Kurdish peshmerga troops in northern Iraq have defeated the Islamist group , also known as ISIL and ISIS , in several key battles .
“ All these efforts have shrunk the ISIL-controlled territory , he said . “ We are gathering momentum on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq ” as “ the U.S. is continuing to accelerate the military campaign against ISIL . ”
One important new move is the creation of a “ specialized expeditionary targeting force ” that will involve putting an unspecified number of U.S. special operations forces into Iraq on a “ standing ” or permanent basis — boots on the ground .
Its missions in both Iraq and Syria will include raids to capture or kill Islamic State leaders , intelligence gathering and hostage rescue .
“ That creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence , which generates more targets , more raids and more momentum , ” Mr. Carter said .
To date , the U.S. has only captured a handful of Islamic State operatives , Gen. Dunford said , adding , “ The lack of human intelligence hinders our campaign .
“ We want a victory over ISIL that sticks , ” Mr. Carter said .
According to Mr. Carter , the new expeditionary force will be “ larger ” than 50 . The U.S. has more than 3,000 troops in Iraq , and President Obama had separately announced some weeks ago that he ’ d be sending 50 special operations forces to Syria .","It was not until two months ago — as the war against the Islamic State was over a year old — that the Pentagon and the State Department began regular high-level planning meetings to make big decisions on how to defeat the terror army in Iraq and Syria, the nation’s top military officer told Congress on Tuesday.

Mr. Carter testified that it was not until recently that the U.S. developed the intelligence to distinguish which trucks were carrying Islamic State oil. With that knowledge, over 400 trucks have been destroyed, he said.

But that raised another question: Why does the Obama administration consider truck drivers not to be enemy combatants? The U.S. gives the drivers a leaflet warning to run from their vehicles before aircraft strike the convoys.

To some lawmakers, putting truck drivers off-limits symbolizes all that is wrong with Mr. Obama’s war strategy, in which so much care is taken to avoid civilian casualties that U.S. jets return to bases, their ordnance still intact.

“They [the drivers] knew they were funding ISIS, and they are not enemy combatants?” Rep. Jim Bridenstine, Oklahoma Republican, told Mr. Cater, who appeared irked by his line of questioning.

“I’m astonished,” said Mr. Bridenstine, a Navy Reserve carrier pilot who has flown the E-2C Hawkeye surveillance plane and the F-18 fighter.

“These were people who were making a buck, so we gave them every opportunity to survive the strike,” the defense secretary said.

Gen. Dunford said the procedure goes this way: two air volleys in front of and behind each convoy, and a leaflet drop warning. Then the trucks are hit.

Mr. Carter generally painted an upbeat war picture. Syrian rebels have taken back territory and are moving toward the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa while the Kurdish peshmerga troops in northern Iraq have defeated the Islamist group, also known as ISIL and ISIS, in several key battles.

“All these efforts have shrunk the ISIL-controlled territory, he said. “We are gathering momentum on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq” as “the U.S. is continuing to accelerate the military campaign against ISIL.”

One important new move is the creation of a “specialized expeditionary targeting force” that will involve putting an unspecified number of U.S. special operations forces into Iraq on a “standing” or permanent basis — boots on the ground.

Its missions in both Iraq and Syria will include raids to capture or kill Islamic State leaders, intelligence gathering and hostage rescue.

“That creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence, which generates more targets, more raids and more momentum,” Mr. Carter said.

To date, the U.S. has only captured a handful of Islamic State operatives, Gen. Dunford said, adding, “The lack of human intelligence hinders our campaign.

“We want a victory over ISIL that sticks,” Mr. Carter said.

According to Mr. Carter, the new expeditionary force will be “larger” than 50. The U.S. has more than 3,000 troops in Iraq, and President Obama had separately announced some weeks ago that he’d be sending 50 special operations forces to Syria.

An uptick in deaths

Tara McKelvey, BBC News, White House Reporter

Human-rights activists complained about the drone programme under the Obama administration, saying the operations were overly secretive and hid the fact that civilians were sometimes killed in the strikes.

President Obama responded by saying that strikes were carried out in a precise manner - and that intelligence officials would release data on civilians who were accidentally killed in the strikes that occurred outside of war zones. President Trump has built on the existing programme and made it even more ambitious.

During Mr Obama's eight years in office, 1,878 drone strikes were carried out, according to researchers. Since Mr Trump was elected in 2016, there have been 2,243 drone strikes. The Republican president has also made some of the operations, the ones outside of war zones, more secretive. As a result, things have different today: under Mr Trump, there are more drone strikes - and less transparency.

What is the reaction?

Lawmakers and rights groups have criticised Mr Trump's decision, saying it could allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes without accountability.

""The Trump administration's action is an unnecessary and dangerous step backwards on transparency and accountability for the use of lethal force, and the civilian casualties they cause,"" Rita Siemion of Human Rights First told AFP news agency.

U.S. forces are preparing to evacuate nearly 400 people working for Lockheed Martin Corp and Sallyport Global from an Iraqi military base north of Baghdad over potential security threats, Iraqi military sources said on Friday.

The sources did not give any details about the threats. Three bases hosting U.S. forces in Iraq have been attacked in the past week with no claims of responsibility. Local officials blamed Iran-backed Shi’ite militias for one of the incidents.

Trump on Friday spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about Middle East stability and the oil market, the White House said.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday she and fellow EU leaders “are concerned about the situation and support diplomatic negotiations, a political solution for a very tense situation.”

Some global airlines are re-routing flights to avoid Iran-controlled airspace over the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman, they said on Friday after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration barred U.S. air carriers from the area.

TRUMP MESSAGE TO IRAN

News of the Trump message to Iran, delivered through Oman overnight, broke shortly after the New York Times reported that Trump had called off air strikes targeting Iranian radar and missile batteries at the last minute.

“In his message, Trump said he was against any war with Iran and wanted to talk to Tehran about various issues,” one Iranian official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“He gave a short period of time to get our response, but Iran’s immediate response was that it is up to Supreme Leader Khamenei to decide about this issue.”

A second Iranian official said: “We made it clear that the leader is against any talks, but the message will be conveyed to him to make a decision.

“However, we told the Omani official that any attack against Iran will have regional and international consequences.”

Khamenei has the last say on all state matters and has ruled out any talks with Washington while Tehran is under sanctions.

Trump’s decision in May to tighten sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports led to the latest tensions. In May 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from a 2015 accord between Iran and major powers under which Tehran curtailed its path to building a nuclear bomb in return for sanctions relief.",www.reuters.com,center,SkUSkvMtav8uUfpY

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Friday night’s attack in Paris was another reminder that we are in a real war.

It is vital that we understand what the real war is and who the real enemy is.

The real war is not geographic and it is not defined by ISIS. The real war is worldwide and the real enemy is Islamic supremacy in all its forms. The center of gravity is not Syria. The center of gravity is the internet.

We are confronted by a virus that is closer to epidemiology than to traditional state-to-state warfare. We will have to eradicate this virulent religious intolerance and violence here at home and across the planet. This is an extraordinarily difficult challenge.

Our elites have been hiding from the real war and the real challenge because it frightens them. They keep trying to redefine the problem so it can be solved without rethinking what we are doing.

Month after month the problem grows harder, the danger grows bigger, and more radicals are recruited. The elites wring their hands and hide. Each major attack leads to anguish, statements of sympathy and expressions of condemnation, but prompts no change in strategy and no effective action. These elites could be called the ostrich generation. They bury their heads in the sand and hide from reality.

Now let’s put last weekend’s tragedy in the context of the real war. Paris was, of course, only a skirmish in the larger war.

In the last two weeks, a Russian airliner was bombed in Egypt a terrorist stabbed four people in California after planning to behead someone and praising Allah and carrying the Islamic State flag, scores were killed by car bombs in Lebanon, people continued to be killed in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan … and eight terrorists carried out very visible, ruthless attacks in Paris.

Paris was so vivid, so symbolic, and so well televised that it became the center of attention.

Suddenly French President Francois Hollande announced that these coordinated attacks by eight terrorists were an “act of war.” He promised to fight with “all the necessary means, and all terrains, inside and outside, in coordination with our allies.” Mr. Hollande promised a “pitiless” effort.

There are three key questions about Mr. Hollande’s sudden militancy.

First, why wasn’t the attack on the magazine Charlie Hebdo and the Jewish grocery store back in January an act of war?

Second, does this declaration of war by the French president mean that victory is their goal and they have thought about how painful and expensive the Russian experience in Chechnya, the Israeli experience in the Palestinian territories, the Pakistani experience in the northwest frontier and the Egyptian experience of trying to police the Sinai have been?

Third, are they as prepared to wage war at home against the internal enemy as they are to bomb Syria? Today’s announcement by the Interior Ministry that some mosques that teach sharia and jihadism would be closed was a good start. There are, however, an estimated 47 mosques dedicated to sharia and jihad in the Paris region alone. Closing all of them would be a historic struggle.

First, we have to define the real war and the real enemy.

Then, we have to define victory and establish a strategy to achieve victory.

Then, we have to ensure we have the systems and structures to implement that strategy.

If we don’t do all three, we can’t expect to start winning the real war.

He says Obama authorized killing of Anwar al-Awlaki by U.S. drone in Yemen
Attorney general said U.S. citizens are n't immune to attack , put forth criteria for these cases
Bergen : Many Americans would argue such a decision requires review by courts
President Barack Obama is the first American president known to have authorized the assassination of a US citizen .
On September 30 , 2011 , Anwar al-Awlaki , a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in New Mexico in 1971 , was killed by an American drone in Yemen along with another U.S. citizen , Samir Khan , who grew up in New York City and Charlotte , North Carolina .
Al-Awlaki had played an operational role in al Qaeda 's affiliate in Yemen , al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- for instance , tasking the `` underwear bomber , '' Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , to bring down an American airliner over the United States .
AbdulMutallab attempted to bring down Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 , but luckily his underwear bomb did n't detonate correctly .
Khan had played more of a supporting role for AQAP as the editor of the group 's online magazine , Inspire , which has inspired a number of terrorists , including the two brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon last year .
The killings of two American citizens by a U.S. drone without a judicial process caused considerable outrage on both the left and the right .
Since then there has been far more public discussion of the secretive drone program , both by U.S. government officials , including President Obama , and at public hearings about drones in Congress . But will al-Awlaki and Khan be the last Americans to die in a U.S. drone strike ?
U.S. officials are now debating whether to kill with a drone another American citizen who is part of al Qaeda and believed to be plotting attacks against the United States , a senior U.S. official tells CNN .
JUST WATCHED U.S. citizen may be target of drone Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH U.S. citizen may be target of drone 02:24
JUST WATCHED U.S. might kill American terror suspect Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH U.S. might kill American terror suspect 02:18
The Associated Press first reported this development but is withholding the name of the targeted individual .
There has been speculation but no confirmation about who the individual might be . At least a couple of other American citizens or permanent residents are known to play important roles in al Qaeda today .

He says Obama authorized killing of Anwar al-Awlaki by U.S. drone in Yemen

Attorney general said U.S. citizens aren't immune to attack, put forth criteria for these cases

Bergen: Many Americans would argue such a decision requires review by courts

President Barack Obama is the first American president known to have authorized the assassination of a US citizen.

On September 30, 2011, Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in New Mexico in 1971, was killed by an American drone in Yemen along with another U.S. citizen, Samir Khan, who grew up in New York City and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Al-Awlaki had played an operational role in al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- for instance, tasking the ""underwear bomber,"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, to bring down an American airliner over the United States.

AbdulMutallab attempted to bring down Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, but luckily his underwear bomb didn't detonate correctly.

Peter Bergen

Khan had played more of a supporting role for AQAP as the editor of the group's online magazine, Inspire, which has inspired a number of terrorists, including the two brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon last year.

The killings of two American citizens by a U.S. drone without a judicial process caused considerable outrage on both the left and the right.

Since then there has been far more public discussion of the secretive drone program, both by U.S. government officials, including President Obama, and at public hearings about drones in Congress. But will al-Awlaki and Khan be the last Americans to die in a U.S. drone strike?

U.S. officials are now debating whether to kill with a drone another American citizen who is part of al Qaeda and believed to be plotting attacks against the United States, a senior U.S. official tells CNN.

JUST WATCHED U.S. might kill American terror suspect Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH U.S. might kill American terror suspect 02:18

The Associated Press first reported this development but is withholding the name of the targeted individual.

There has been speculation but no confirmation about who the individual might be. At least a couple of other American citizens or permanent residents are known to play important roles in al Qaeda today.

One name that has been mentioned in media reports is that of California-born Adam Gadahn, who for the past decade has operated as a leading al Qaeda propagandist. In 2006 Gadahn was the first American charged with treason in more than half a century.

However, there is, at least so far, no public information that Gadahn has played an operational role in al Qaeda's terrorist plots, and therefore it is unlikely that he would be placed on a ""kill list,"" unless his role in al Qaeda has changed of late from propagandist to operational planner.

According to a senior U.S. administration official, Gadahn is not the subject of the ongoing high-level discussions about whether a new name should be added to the kill list.

In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2013, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder laid out the legal rationale the government uses to determine if an American citizen can be killed in a drone strike.

In the letter, Holder said that based on Supreme Court decisions during World War II, merely being an American citizen does not make one ""immune from being targeted."" Holder also asserted that an American who poses an ""imminent threat of violent attack against the United States"" and is in a location where capture ""is not feasible"" could be killed.

Holder explained that al-Awlaki ""plainly satisfied all these conditions"" as he had recruited the underwear bomber and instructed him to blow up an U.S. airliner ""when it was over American soil."" Al-Awlaki was also killed in a remote part of Yemen where a U.S. ground operation to capture him was deemed unfeasible by the Obama administration.

There is a certain irony in Holder's legal reasoning. The FBI was monitoring al-Awlaki's e-mail account for years before he was killed. To monitor his e-mail , the FBI had to get a court order.

Yet the decision to target al-Awlaki for death was made without any kind of judicial proceeding. As Vicki Divoll, a former assistant general counsel for the CIA, nicely put it a year before al-Awlaki was killed in the drone strike, ""Awlaki's right to privacy exceeds his right to life.""

Khan was killed in the same drone strike that killed al-Awlaki, but according to a senior U.S. official, that was unintentional and was merely a byproduct of Khan traveling in the same car as al-Awlaki when the drone strike occurred.

In sum, Khan's role as the editor of Inspire magazine was not enough to put him on a kill list.

When it comes to targeting a U.S. citizen for death, American officials, by their own account, will make particular efforts to determine how dangerous an al Qaeda operative that person really is. In the eyes of many Americans, however, a decision to kill one of their own should also be subject to judicial review.

There has been no significant evidence yet made available to support that assertion , however — something that disconcerts even some Republicans , who remember the intelligence failures that dogged the run-up to the Iraq War .
Still , for now , some Republicans believe the president has won a victory over his liberal critics , eliminating an American adversary while being apparently able to avoid major negative repercussions .
“ He managed his way through a significant international crisis and came out the victor , ” said GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak . “ He clearly won on a very important national security issue . The world ’ s worst terrorist is off the battlefield , he didn ’ t have to pay much of a price at all , and he has restored deterrence with Iran . ”
Impeachment , which had been Topic A in American politics , has been sidelined by the focus on Iran .

Republicans , meanwhile , hope that the debate will put the Democrats at odds with the position of the American public at large .
Mackowiak noted that the matter was sure to come up at the next televised Democratic debate , in Iowa on Tuesday .
“ All the Democrats will have to answer whether it was right to take Soleimani out , ” he predicted . “ I would guess 80 percent of the country would say yes and the Democrats will say no . ”
There has not yet been extensive polling on that point but the surveys that have emerged suggest a nation much more closely divided .
An Economist/YouGov poll conducted Jan. 5-7 indicated that the strike against Soleimani was approved of by 44 percent of Americans and disapproved of by 38 percent .
As with virtually every issue in contemporary politics , responses broke heavily along partisan lines — only 15 percent of Democrats approved of the drone strike , but it was backed by 84 percent of Republicans .
Some Democrats remain fiercely critical of Trump ’ s conduct , pointing to the de facto destruction of the nuclear deal and Trump ’ s continued pressing of sanctions against Iran .

There has been no significant evidence yet made available to support that assertion, however — something that disconcerts even some Republicans, who remember the intelligence failures that dogged the run-up to the Iraq War.

Still, for now, some Republicans believe the president has won a victory over his liberal critics, eliminating an American adversary while being apparently able to avoid major negative repercussions.

“He managed his way through a significant international crisis and came out the victor,” said GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak. “He clearly won on a very important national security issue. The world’s worst terrorist is off the battlefield, he didn’t have to pay much of a price at all, and he has restored deterrence with Iran.”

The controversy has also roiled the domestic political landscape.

Impeachment, which had been Topic A in American politics, has been sidelined by the focus on Iran.

The issue has put foreign policy at the center of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, with the Iowa caucuses less than a month away.

Biden’s allies say this could be to his benefit, since it reminds voters of his experience in foreign policy. But the danger is that it also reminds the electorate of Biden’s 2002 Senate vote to give Bush the authority to wage war in Iraq.

Republicans, meanwhile, hope that the debate will put the Democrats at odds with the position of the American public at large.

Mackowiak noted that the matter was sure to come up at the next televised Democratic debate, in Iowa on Tuesday.

“All the Democrats will have to answer whether it was right to take Soleimani out,” he predicted. “I would guess 80 percent of the country would say yes and the Democrats will say no.”

There has not yet been extensive polling on that point but the surveys that have emerged suggest a nation much more closely divided.

An Economist/YouGov poll conducted Jan. 5-7 indicated that the strike against Soleimani was approved of by 44 percent of Americans and disapproved of by 38 percent.

As with virtually every issue in contemporary politics, responses broke heavily along partisan lines — only 15 percent of Democrats approved of the drone strike, but it was backed by 84 percent of Republicans.

Some Democrats remain fiercely critical of Trump’s conduct, pointing to the de facto destruction of the nuclear deal and Trump’s continued pressing of sanctions against Iran.

“You cannot claim to want deescalation and then announce new sanctions with no clear goal. This is not a measured response!” she added.

But the rhetoric was even more heated on the other side.

The Trump campaign, in a Wednesday email, insisted that Sanders’s criticism of the strike on Soleimani meant he “can’t be trusted to defend American lives.”

With Trump scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday evening, there will be plenty more where that came from.

“At the next rally, what’s he going to be talking about?” Doug Heye, a former communications director of the Republican National Committee, asked rhetorically. “‘I killed a terrorist.’”

For much of his presidency , Donald Trump has backed the military , promising to support them as much as possible . But over the past two weeks , it seems that his administration has taken policies that affect the Pentagon without keeping it in the loop .
Take what happened right after Trump ’ s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last week . During a press conference , Trump vowed to end joint military drills with South Korea , catching the Defense Department almost , if not entirely , by surprise .
And on Monday , Trump announced the creation of an entirely new military service — the space force . The problem is there was no official , Pentagon-approved plan to make one yet , which is why Trump immediately dispatched Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to look into establishing the new service .
And when speaking to reporters last Wednesday , Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis was obviously uncomfortable answering questions about what role , if any , the Pentagon may play in housing thousands of child migrants — seemingly trying to keep his department out of the political maelstrom .
This only adds to Trump ’ s complicated relationship with the military . Trump also surprised the Pentagon last summer by ordering a ban on transgender military service , withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal , and contradicting top defense officials by saying that he wants US troops out of Syria .
But the president and the Pentagon seem more out of sync now than ever , as NBC News reported first on Monday morning — and experts have some theories as to why .
John Bolton took over as national security adviser in April , which means there may still be some growing pains . “ It ’ s not surprising that with a new National Security Council team there would be hiccups in communication , particularly if previously Mattis was closer to the president himself than [ former National Security Adviser ] H.R . McMaster , ” Loren Schulman , a defense expert at the Center for a New American Security think tank , told me .
It could also be that the defense secretary wants to avoid the spotlight and not convey the Pentagon ’ s priorities more forcefully in public , allowing others to dictate the national security agenda . “ Secretary Mattis has had a much lower profile , but that may well be his intent as he contemplates his own future , ” says Mark Groombridge , formerly a top Bolton adviser at the State Department and United Nations .
Dana White , the top DOD spokesperson , told me it was “ pure silliness ” to conclude Mattis is out of the president ’ s decision-making loop , the same response she gave to NBC News .
Whatever the reason , it ’ s disconcerting to see the Pentagon caught off guard in a time of great uncertainty , especially as relations with North Korea enter a sensitive stage while there ’ s and turmoil on America ’ s southern border .
That , to put it mildly , is not the best way for the world ’ s greatest military to operate .
Trump kicked off the tumultuous past two weeks with a striking statement in Singapore .
“ We will stop the war games [ with South Korea ] which will save us a tremendous amount of money , ” Trump said a June 12 press conference after meeting with North Korea ’ s leader . “ Under the circumstances we are negotiating a comprehensive and complete deal . It is inappropriate to have war games . ”
That was a big announcement . America ’ s security relationship with South Korea is the backbone of their alliance , and joint military exercises are the most visible way for Washington to show its commitment to Seoul . That ’ s why one would expect the president and his team to work with the South Koreans to cancel the drills responsibly .
But that ’ s not what happened , as Seoul and the Pentagon had no idea Trump would make that statement . In fact , America ’ s 28,500 troops in South Korea were still preparing for a joint exercise in August . A spokesperson for the US military in South Korea told the New York Times on June 12 that they had “ received no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises — to include this fall ’ s schedule Ulchi Freedom Guardian , ” referring to the drill ’ s name .
And on June 18 , a week after Trump ’ s announcement , the Pentagon announced it would not hold the August exercise with South Korea . “ Consistent with President Trump ’ s commitment and in concert with our Republic of Korea ally , the United States military has suspended all planning for this August ’ s defensive ‘ wargame , ’ ” White , the top Pentagon spokesperson , said in a statement . White also noted that both countries have yet to make any decisions about other joint exercises .
On that same day , Trump stunned the military and Congress by announcing his desire to create a space force . Should it materialize , the space force would become the sixth military service . It would centralize the armed force ’ s activities in space , which currently reside mostly with the Air Force , under a whole new military branch .
The US has not created a new military service since 1947 when Congress authorized the Air Force . Forming a new branch out of thin air would require tons of planning and bureaucratic reorganization — but that didn ’ t matter to the president .
Instead , Trump assigned his top military adviser to figure out how to create the space force mere seconds after announcing his desire to establish it . Here ’ s the exchange during a space-related event at the White House last Monday :
TRUMP : We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force — separate but equal . It is going to be something . So important . Gen. Dunford , if you would carry that assignment out , I would be very greatly honored , also . Where ’ s Gen. Dunford ? General ? Got it ? DUNFORD : We got it . TRUMP : Let ’ s go get it , General .
According to the Wall Street Journal on June 22 , Trump made the stunning announcement after feeling that the Pentagon had stonewalled him for months . Trump had said since at least March he wanted the US to have a space force .
But Mattis , Dunford , and top Air Force officials all previously argued against creating the new military branch . Plus , the Pentagon studied the issue and effectively made the case that this “ will happen , but now is not the time , ” a source told the Journal .
Trump , however , clearly wants the space force to become a thing sooner rather than later .
In another example of the increasing disconnect , last Wednesday Mattis had trouble answering questions about how the Pentagon might house around 20,000 child migrants on military bases .

Share All sharing options for: Why does the Pentagon keep getting surprised by Trump?

For much of his presidency, Donald Trump has backed the military, promising to support them as much as possible. But over the past two weeks, it seems that his administration has taken policies that affect the Pentagon without keeping it in the loop.

Take what happened right after Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last week. During a press conference, Trump vowed to end joint military drills with South Korea, catching the Defense Department almost, if not entirely, by surprise.

And on Monday, Trump announced the creation of an entirely new military service — the space force. The problem is there was no official, Pentagon-approved plan to make one yet, which is why Trump immediately dispatched Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to look into establishing the new service.

And when speaking to reporters last Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis was obviously uncomfortable answering questions about what role, if any, the Pentagon may play in housing thousands of child migrants — seemingly trying to keep his department out of the political maelstrom.

This only adds to Trump’s complicated relationship with the military. Trump also surprised the Pentagon last summer by ordering a ban on transgender military service, withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, and contradicting top defense officials by saying that he wants US troops out of Syria.

But the president and the Pentagon seem more out of sync now than ever, as NBC News reported first on Monday morning — and experts have some theories as to why.

John Bolton took over as national security adviser in April, which means there may still be some growing pains. “It’s not surprising that with a new National Security Council team there would be hiccups in communication, particularly if previously Mattis was closer to the president himself than [former National Security Adviser] H.R. McMaster,” Loren Schulman, a defense expert at the Center for a New American Security think tank, told me.

It could also be that the defense secretary wants to avoid the spotlight and not convey the Pentagon’s priorities more forcefully in public, allowing others to dictate the national security agenda. “Secretary Mattis has had a much lower profile, but that may well be his intent as he contemplates his own future,” says Mark Groombridge, formerly a top Bolton adviser at the State Department and United Nations.

Dana White, the top DOD spokesperson, told me it was “pure silliness” to conclude Mattis is out of the president’s decision-making loop, the same response she gave to NBC News.

Whatever the reason, it’s disconcerting to see the Pentagon caught off guard in a time of great uncertainty, especially as relations with North Korea enter a sensitive stage while there’s and turmoil on America’s southern border.

That, to put it mildly, is not the best way for the world’s greatest military to operate.

It’s been a rough few weeks for the Pentagon

Trump kicked off the tumultuous past two weeks with a striking statement in Singapore.

“We will stop the war games [with South Korea] which will save us a tremendous amount of money,” Trump said a June 12 press conference after meeting with North Korea’s leader. “Under the circumstances we are negotiating a comprehensive and complete deal. It is inappropriate to have war games.”

That was a big announcement. America’s security relationship with South Korea is the backbone of their alliance, and joint military exercises are the most visible way for Washington to show its commitment to Seoul. That’s why one would expect the president and his team to work with the South Koreans to cancel the drills responsibly.

But that’s not what happened, as Seoul and the Pentagon had no idea Trump would make that statement. In fact, America’s 28,500 troops in South Korea were still preparing for a joint exercise in August. A spokesperson for the US military in South Korea told the New York Times on June 12 that they had “received no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises — to include this fall’s schedule Ulchi Freedom Guardian,” referring to the drill’s name.

And on June 18, a week after Trump’s announcement, the Pentagon announced it would not hold the August exercise with South Korea. “Consistent with President Trump’s commitment and in concert with our Republic of Korea ally, the United States military has suspended all planning for this August’s defensive ‘wargame,’” White, the top Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement. White also noted that both countries have yet to make any decisions about other joint exercises.

On that same day, Trump stunned the military and Congress by announcing his desire to create a space force. Should it materialize, the space force would become the sixth military service. It would centralize the armed force’s activities in space, which currently reside mostly with the Air Force, under a whole new military branch.

The US has not created a new military service since 1947 when Congress authorized the Air Force. Forming a new branch out of thin air would require tons of planning and bureaucratic reorganization — but that didn’t matter to the president.

Instead, Trump assigned his top military adviser to figure out how to create the space force mere seconds after announcing his desire to establish it. Here’s the exchange during a space-related event at the White House last Monday:

TRUMP: We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force — separate but equal. It is going to be something. So important. Gen. Dunford, if you would carry that assignment out, I would be very greatly honored, also. Where’s Gen. Dunford? General? Got it? DUNFORD: We got it. TRUMP: Let’s go get it, General.

According to the Wall Street Journal on June 22, Trump made the stunning announcement after feeling that the Pentagon had stonewalled him for months. Trump had said since at least March he wanted the US to have a space force.

But Mattis, Dunford, and top Air Force officials all previously argued against creating the new military branch. Plus, the Pentagon studied the issue and effectively made the case that this “will happen, but now is not the time,” a source told the Journal.

Trump, however, clearly wants the space force to become a thing sooner rather than later.

In another example of the increasing disconnect, last Wednesday Mattis had trouble answering questions about how the Pentagon might house around 20,000 child migrants on military bases. Government officials visited four military bases in the past two weeks to see if they could potentially keep the children.

Reporters wanted to know what that signaled. The testy exchange, as transcribed by Task & Purpose’s Jeff Schogol, is worth reading:

REPORTER: This has been going on for several weeks. So they have identified four bases… MATTIS: We support whatever they need.

If you watch the edited video of the press conference above, it’s noticeable just how uncomfortable Mattis is.

“His body language said it all,” Groombridge, the former Bolton adviser, told me. “He will salute and follow orders to provide shelter but wants absolutely nothing to do with the political controversy swirling around this issue. His constant referral of the issue back to Homeland Security and Health and Human Services is clear evidence of this fact.”

However, it could also be that Mattis was uncomfortable speaking to reporters on camera by himself — something he typically tries to avoid.

Mattis purposely keeps his head down

It’s hard to know, especially now, just how much influence Mattis has with the president. According to NBC News, Trump and Mattis went from speaking several times a day on the phone to the secretary finding out about major policy decisions after the fact.

But whatever Mattis wants to achieve, he and other top Pentagon officials will likely continue to try to persuade Trump quietly because what the president wants is not necessarily what the Pentagon recommends.

“I am fully convinced that both the secretary and Joint Chiefs chairman are defaulting to a very passive public affairs posture and active and substantive private policy posture where they are being heard,” a former White House official told me.

Of course, it seems hard to convince Trump of anything. “I think perhaps [Mattis] has accepted the fact that no one in the administration is really able to stay in step with an unpredictable and unconventional boss,” says the former official.

Private consultation is one thing, but Mattis also doesn’t like explaining the Pentagon’s priorities much to the public.

Mattis has yet to conduct a press conference of his own in the Pentagon briefing room. He’s only appeared on one Sunday news show. He has yet to sit down for a profile. And he’s scaled back the number of reporters that travel with him from about 11 to six (or eight if a television crew comes along). In effect, Mattis doesn’t aim to make news.

That’s on purpose, Doug Wilson, a Pentagon senior spokesperson in the Obama administration, told me in March. “I think the way he’s dealing with the press both reflects his own natural instincts about not wanting to be in the limelight,” he said, “and also reflects the realities of this administration where focusing on your job and putting your nose to the grindstone is the best way to ensure you get to keep doing your job.”

But one has to wonder if failing to communicate the Pentagon’s priorities and viewpoint in the public sphere makes it harder for the private advice to resonate. After all, Trump is famously moved to act by what he sees on television.

After withdrawing the last U.S. troops in 2011 , President Barack Obama declared the country “ sovereign , stable and self-reliant. ” No such luck . Iraq plunged back into chaos as the Islamic State stormed the region last year , and the fall of Ramadi in May revived questions about how , and whether , the country can be salvaged .
As Americans try to understand what $ 2 trillion and nearly 4,500 American lives really accomplished , partisans are battling over how much blame falls on Obama , who left Iraq , and on President George W. Bush , who took us there . “ If you fought in Iraq , it worked , ” 2016 presidential candidate Lindsey Graham recently said . “ It ’ s not your fault it ’ s going to hell . It ’ s Obama ’ s fault. ” Naturally , Democrats see it differently : “ This represents the failed policies that took us down this path 10 years ago , ” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said .
Who ’ s right ? Could Iraq have remained stable if Obama had left behind a small troop contingent ? Did Bush ’ s “ surge ” really stabilize the country ? In June , ███ Magazine assembled a dozen experts—including veterans of both administrations from the State Department , White House , Pentagon and the CIA—and asked a simple question : Who lost Iraq ? —Michael Crowley
Michael Crowley : Ambassador Khalilzad , you were in Iraq from 2005 to 2007 . Describe the trajectory Iraq was on when you left , and the Iraq that Obama inherited when he was inaugurated in January 2009 .
Zalmay Khalilzad : It was a very difficult period . Especially in the aftermath of the al-Askari Mosque bombing in 2006 , the sectarian violence became front and center—a very large number of fatalities and causalities , both Shia and Sunni—and the rise of Al Qaeda in Iraq . We began a more concerted effort training Iraqi troops , which resulted in significant growth in their size and capabilities . The new Iraqi government led by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki showed more willingness to use force against the Shia militias in Basra and Baghdad ’ s Sadr City . Additionally , the excesses committed by Al Qaeda in Iraq against the Sunni community was beginning to turn some Sunnis against them . With increased outreach to the Sunnis , we began to have significant numbers of them work with us .
There were still some issues unresolved—there was no oil law for the distribution of resources , there still was no reform of de-Baathification . These were self-inflicted wounds , if you like—mistakes we made , in my judgment , at the very beginning . But I think the Iraqis were heading in the right direction . You had a government that acquired greater national legitimacy . There was a greater Sunni participation in government compared to an earlier period . The level of violence , by the end of the Bush administration , was significantly down compared to 2006 , early 2007 .
We ’ re still talking about Iraq , but relatively speaking , I would say it was on a positive trajectory with some big issues still unresolved .
MC : Kim , tell us more about the security situation when President Obama arrived .
The five participants in our roundtable discussion . | Illustration by Louisa Bertman
Kim Kagan : The security situation in Iraq was dramatically improved by operations conducted by surge troops—violence in Baghdad and in Iraq fell dramatically over the course of 2007 . And in 2008 , U.S. forces partnered with the Iraqi security forces , pushed AQI out of Baghdad , out of Diyala and all the way to Mosul , where the Al Qaeda elements were greatly reduced over time by follow-on operations and special forces operations . The Shia militias , which posed a threat to the sovereignty of the Iraqi government , had been greatly diminished by the operations that Prime Minister Maliki and U.S. forces undertook in 2008 and were no longer militarily viable within Iraq .
By Army Lt. Gen. Daniel P. Bolger America lost in Iraq because generals—guys like me—misused our great all-volunteer military . We train , organize and equip our fighting men and women to smash conventional , uniformed enemy forces . Go in , kill ’ em and get the hell out . In 2003 , due to happenstance , ignorance and no small amount of arrogance , we recommended staying in force in Iraq—Vietnam redux , but this time “ done right. ” America ’ s elected leaders agreed . The American people went along with it . So we tried to use more than 100,000 of our troops to defeat an entrenched insurgency and to build viable democratic institutions in a country we barely understood . Over time , we learned how to hunt terrorist leaders . We got a better grip on Iraqi society and culture . But we never got a better grip on the suspicious , beleaguered , heartbroken Iraqi people . They ’ re the real losers of this hard war , and they ’ ve been in anguish for decades . Their latest oppressors are the vicious gunmen of ISIL , the guerrillas we left in the field when we drew down in 2011 . One thing is pretty clear : Social work from the barrel of a gun is not a winning formula . Army Lt. Gen. Daniel P. Bolger ( ret . ) , who served in Iraq and Afghanistan , is author of Why We Lost : A General ’ s Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars . Illustration by Louisa Bertman
The two main threats to Iraqi state security had been significantly diminished by 2008 and over the course of 2009 . Our U.S. forces were handing over security to Iraqi security forces , such that U.S. forces came out of the major cities of Iraq , and handed responsibility for those cities back to the Iraqi security forces . One of the principles behind the way that the U.S. had constructed its surge operations was that the U.S. had special tie-in capabilities that the Iraqi security forces did not have , because they were still growing , still developing skills . So clearing cities was something the U.S. did with Iraqi security forces ’ support .
As those cities became more peaceful , as the population returned , as AQI left , the Iraqi security forces could handle the security environment in the urban centers . But AQI was not destroyed . It had not lost the will to fight . It was potentially reduced from an organization that had high-end terrorist capabilities that could threaten the state , to an insurgency , a group that had very limited capacity to act as a terrorist organization , but still had some will to fight , and still had some organization , some command and control left over , primarily in the Mosul area .
MC : John , what did the threat to the U.S. or western interests in the region emanating from Iraq look like at the time Obama took office ?
John McLaughlin : If you go all the way back to 2008 , the Arab Spring or Awakening was still years away . In 2008 , Al Qaeda central was on the run but not defeated . We were still very much on guard against attacks on the United States ; we were just two years after detecting the attempt by Al Qaeda-related people to put together an operation over the Atlantic out of London—the planes plot . So Al Qaeda in that period is still very dangerous but not particularly noteworthy insofar as its capability in Iraq was seen .
MC : Ambassador Hill , you get to Iraq at the start of Obama ’ s first term . What does that Iraq look like—is it on a trajectory to a place where it can stand on its own ?
Chris Hill : There was perhaps more optimism than the facts might have justified . For example , there was a view that somehow Maliki had gotten in the saddle , that he understood the need for outreach to the various groups and was prepared to continue the payments to the so-called Sons of Iraq . There was an overall kind of optimistic mood , but I must say , in talking to the Sunni leaders who were part of his cabinet , you certainly didn ’ t get the sense there was any reason to be optimistic . You certainly got the impression when you talked to people that it wasn ’ t going well . Going out to Anbar , for example , and talking to Sunni sheiks out there , they were all prepared to work together in a kind of all-in Sunni party , but you certainly didn ’ t get the impression they were cutting Baghdad any slack or cutting Maliki any slack .
Overall , I found it surprisingly peaceful , in terms of kinetic stuff on the ground . But from the point of view of listening to politicians , no one was prepared to say that things were better—and , in fact , many of them felt that things were getting worse .
MC : Brian , you were on the Obama campaign . Did you guys come to Iraq with the assumption that it couldn ’ t be saved , so we had to get out and let it fend for itself ? Or was the thinking that Iraq was ready to stand on its own ?
Brian Katulis : That was a central focus : How does Iraq actually achieve or build on the security gains of the surge ? It ’ s true that the addition of U.S. forces in 2007 had an impact in changing security dynamics , but there were other factors too—including a pretty massive sectarian cleansing campaign that had happened in Baghdad from 2006 to 2008 . These issues of power sharing , which Ambassador Hill alluded to , were nowhere close to being resolved .
We did a report in late 2008 that analyzed where Iraq stood in terms of its power-sharing and politics . That was always one of the key fundamental rationales for the surge—that it would open the door to power-sharing . Our conclusion was that it had not , and that many of the grievances of the Sunni community had not been adequately addressed . There ’ s an absence of political framework to this day that deals with the grievances of Sunni communities in Iraq and in Syria . That sense of injustice , corruption and poor governance actually provides an opening for groups like AQI and ISIL .
Essentially for a dozen years , the U.S. has been searching for an overarching strategy for its engagement , not only in Iraq but the broader Middle East . One of the consequences of the 2003 Iraq War was that—largely unintended—we upended a policy of dual containment of Iran and Iraq . That inadvertently facilitated the expansion of Iranian influence in the region . Our presence in Iraq created a massive rallying cry and recruitment tool and live training ground for all the sorts of types of groups that we ’ re now still dealing with . I remember Ambassador Khalilzad even telling how he joked to Iranians about how he eliminated two of their biggest adversaries , the Taliban of Afghanistan and then Iraq .
Collectively , this is the Humpty Dumpty problem—how do we put it all back together again ? I ’ m not blaming the U.S. solely or the Iraq War itself , but I do see often a fixation on the tactical elements . We see this today—do we send 10,000 or 20,000 more troops to train Sunni tribes in Iraq ? That to me begs the question of what is the overarching political framework that would be sustainable for the communities that feel the sense of grievances , that feel like there hasn ’ t been power-sharing for decades ?
MC : Should I take from your answer that Iraq was not salvageable when Obama came into office ?
By James Jeffrey Iraq is not lost . “ Lost ” in any reasonable sense of this question would be to disintegrate as a country ( “ Who lost Yugoslavia ? ” ) or fall into totally hostile hands ( “ Who lost Vietnam ? ” ) . Neither fate has befallen Iraq . That said , it is not a successful country . If Iraq is ever truly lost , the answer will be the Iraqi people . If the question , rather , is , “ Who lost the American dream of a democratic , fully independent , stable Iraqi partner for regional stability and in the global war against terror , ” the answer is : the U.S. did . In stark contrast to the situation in Eastern European countries in 1989 and 1990 , the large majority of the Iraqi population did not identify with the American or Western value system or demonstrate a deep desire to see a system analogous to that in the West imposed on Iraq from without . Despite the above , the United States remained engaged for almost eight years in an effort to achieve the above state of affairs , without ultimate success . Had we remained longer in Iraq , made fewer mistakes and—in particular—shaken the image of an occupying force in the minds of , by every poll , the majority of the Arab population , the United States might have been successful , but this was not the case . James Jeffrey , U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2010 to 2012 , is distinguished visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Peace . Illustration by Louisa Bertman
BK : The primary responsibility lies in the hands of Maliki and the Iraqi leadership that did not seize the moment . We could blame various U.S. officials , but the leaders of these countries are responsible for the fundamental dynamics . We can help . We ’ ve given them an opportunity . Did they seize it ? The answer , I think , is no .
KK : President Obama and Prime Minister Maliki share blame and responsibility for the developments in Iraq from 2010 onward . The Iraqi security forces were strained much earlier than January 2014 , when Fallujah fell . ISIL systematically not only conducted spectacular attacks , but deliberately undermined the Iraqi security forces . After the “ waterfall ” withdrawal of American troops over the course of 2010 , and the complete withdrawal of troops at the end of 2011 , the Iraqi security forces were not continually being developed . Nor were they being supported by some of the unique capabilities we as Americans can bring to the battlefield—like intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , continued training in how to do operational planning , and how to replenish the Iraqi security forces , which were taking causalities .
But Prime Minister Maliki bears responsibility . He did not employ the Iraqi security forces effectively . He did not put enough leadership in charge of Iraqi security forces . And he did not design—or allow to be designed—good operations to respond to Al Qaeda in Iraq .
By August 2013 , the Iraqi security forces were no longer combat-effective—they had taken so many losses , they were not commanded and controlled well—and that should have been an early indicator to us in Washington that something needed to be done , and that they faced a threat of a magnitude that the Iraq security forces could not handle .
MC : Last August , President Obama said the withdrawal from Iraq was not “ my decision . ” There ’ s a debate as to whether the Iraqis would have tolerated an enduring American presence , and Obama officials say probably not . Is the question of whether Obama lost Iraq moot because the Iraqis would not have allowed us to stay in substantial numbers ? Or could he have done more , politically , to accomplish that ?
ZK : I have talked to Prime Minister Maliki about that period , and I ’ ve talked to the defense minister of Iraq and others . And they say they wanted some number of U.S. troops to stay , but what they didn ’ t want to do is to go to Parliament on this issue of immunity that we required , and that this was entangled in part of the domestic Iraqi politics . From our side , on the other hand , President Obama insisted on a Parliament-approved agreement giving our troops immunity . Could we have worked out something ? It ’ s hard for me to judge .
CH : The issue of a residual troop presence is to some extent a little too much American solipsism—that it ’ s all about us and our troop presence . But , nonetheless , I found many Iraqis , including senior politicians , who were prepared to say to one group of people , “ Yes , we want to see American troops , ” and then they would say an hour later to another group , “ No , we don ’ t want American troops. ” I ’ m not sure the Iraqis were entirely committed or entirely honest about saying whether they wanted troops or not .
I found this across the board—where they would say one thing to one person and another thing to another person . Especially for visitors coming from Washington , Iraqis had this sort of feeling they should say what they were expected to say , and I ’ m not sure it ’ s necessarily what they believed .
In getting there in April 2009 , I certainly had the impression the Iraqis were very much conflicted about the idea of a continuing American role . When Maliki announced that American troops would no longer be in the populated areas , there was such a note of pride in his voice—the infidels have been forced to retreat . The key is that the politics of Iraq didn ’ t necessarily line up with what I would consider their best interests .
And finally , I ’ d like to say in regard to the Sunnis—there ’ s no question the Sunni community felt aggrieved in how Maliki handled things , how the Shia generally handled things , but I think to understand the Sunni perspective is not just that of an aggrieved minority . I think they feel like they have a kind of strategic depth that goes all the way through the Middle East . And that strategic depth that the Sunnis have should have come to bear in sort of pressuring the majority Shia in Iraq . Like all things in Iraq , I think it was more complicated .
JM : I think there ’ s danger in focusing too narrowly on things like Maliki ’ s behavior , the [ Status of Forces ] agreement , and so forth . To ask the question “ who lost Iraq ? ” is not a fair question . To focus on it that way is a little like saying , “ How do we explain Hitler ? ” “ Well , let ’ s look at the 1932 elections. ” I would pull the camera back here a little bit . All of those were factors in what brought us to the Iraq of today . Certainly , it ’ s beyond dispute that Maliki failed to reach out appropriately to the Sunni community . It ’ s beyond dispute that the training of soldiers doesn ’ t equip them to fight ; it ’ s the will that equips them to fight . There ’ s a big difference between training and the will to fight . All that is true .
But if you pull the camera back here , remember that in 2011 , we had the Arab Awakening and remember that Syria went drastically bad , largely because of [ Syrian President Bashar ] Assad ’ s reaction to what were legitimate protests in the area . Syria is about 70 percent Sunni and that is the real engine that is drawing in fighters for ISIL at something like 1,000 a month .
Think of it in concentric circles : We ’ ve been talking about the innermost circle—all of the stuff going on around Maliki and the SOFA agreement and so forth . Take the next circle out and look more broadly at the region . You have the magnetic power of the Syrian uprising gone bad , pulling in fighters who are going to affiliate with someone . If it was not ISIL , I suspect it would have been al-Nusra—which , for a period of time in 2012 or so , remember , our focus was really on al-Nusra , which seemed to be surging at that point in northeast Syria and making dramatic gains . ISIL came in and exploited that , and that ’ s another story .
Then if you pull the camera back even further , a third concentric circle out , you really have to say—I risk sounding too much like an academic here—but you ’ ve got to go back to Sykes-Picot , which created the modern Middle East . We ’ re still dealing with the aftermath of lines drawn in the sands in 1916 . It ’ s taken 100 years of sectarian turmoil to control for a good period of that time , but ultimately , breaking through to get us to this point . All of that is in the mix here . Perhaps among the sparks were the behavior of Maliki and our failure to get a SOFA agreement and so forth , but I think the whole issue of how Iraq ended up where it is has to take all of those broader factors into consideration as well .
By Thomas E. Ricks I do n't think Iraq was ever America 's to lose . We did help Saddam Hussein lose it , and we did help hand it over to the Iranians—at least the capital and the south . But I think the people who really lost Iraq are short-sighted Shiite leaders . They had the upper hand but still played like they were the underdogs . They could have brought the Sunnis on board with a generous offer of semi-autonomy and respect for sectarian differences . Instead , as soon as Uncle Sam was out of the way , they took a series of steps to alienate the Sunnis and so to encourage the growth of ISIL . Thomas E. Ricks , who covered Iraq for the Washington Post , is the author of Fiasco : The American Military Adventure in Iraq . By Wendy Anderson President Bush made the mistake of invading Iraq in the first place . President Obama has made his share of mistakes as well—withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 was terribly premature . But so have the Iraqis , particularly former Prime Minister Maliki . And , let ’ s not forget the Sunnis , who ’ ve played their own unhelpful role . Iraq ’ s neighbors have also consistently used the chaos in Iraq to advance their own interests . Obama ’ s strategy today is imperfect but sound and defensible . He has worked hard at enlisting the region to support Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi . He continues to pressure Iraqi leadership for internal political reconciliation , without which nothing we do will be permanent . He views ISIL as a regional problem and not just an Iraq and Syria problem . He could do more—speed up the pace of providing Iraqis with training and equipment , fortifying their will to fight ; embed our advisers in Iraqi forces ; supply forward air controllers and additional air support ; consider arming Sunni fighters directly , to name a few—options he ’ s apparently considering . Bottom line : Whether Iraq has been lost remains to be seen . Wendy Anderson has held multiple senior positions in the U.S. Department of Defense from 2010 to 2014 . Illustrations by Louisa Bertman
MC : Brian , were there mistakes that even President Obama would concede at this point ?
BK : Yes , absolutely . I think those problems many of us identified—a lack of political unity and power-sharing inside of Iraq—the administration attempted to work on those issues , but the real question is : Did it actually have a strategy that could have produced the result ? Was it as high of a priority as other issues that came up ? This is at a time in the administration where the overall theme was to try to pivot beyond the challenges of the Middle East , that we had spent more than a decade investing a lot of our money , time and effort , and that we wanted to move beyond that . One of the biggest mistakes is just relative inattention . Iraq , inside the Obama White House , just became less of a focus .
Then look at the 2012 reelection campaign and some of the statements made about Iraq . When you measure it against what was happening with the Maliki government and what was happening on the ground , there ’ s a gap between the two . Even on the eve of ISIL taking over Fallujah , you had statements coming from the White House that downgraded and downplayed the threat that ISIL posed .
Quite certainly , 2014 was a wake-up call for everyone ; I think the administration more or less has got the right re-engagement strategy here . These problems that John McLaughlin identified , the broader historical trends , I think this president has a deep appreciation for that , and that ’ s why they ’ ve been very cautious and largely judicious , but there are big gaps even to this day in their strategies . Syria is one of them . You can ’ t talk about Iraq without linking the problem of Syria , because ISIL certainly does .
Yes , mistakes were made , a larger part of it was—not just a sense of exhaustion—but this sense of , “ OK , we have a different set of strategic priorities as a country , we want to invest in other parts of the world. ” When you look back with 20-20 hindsight , they downgraded Iraq way too much , even at a time of turmoil and chaos with the Arab uprisings .
JM : I would say that that mistake occurred in the context of a larger mistake that was taking place roughly during the 2011 to 2013 time frame—that was more broadly to underestimate the remaining power of Al Qaeda or extremism generally . This was a period when people were talking in the administration , and more broadly , about “ strategic defeat of terrorism ” and so forth . Yet , if one looks at that time , and many of us were saying this at the time , there were at least three trends at the time that were enlivening the movement .
Then the third thing was—I believed and tried to document a couple times that this was a period when terrorists were going to school on what had not worked for them up to that point . You look at documents that came out of Mali , the French operation there , you look at what al-Nusra was doing , what Al Qaeda was doing in Yemen—they were going to school on their failure to be able to hold sway over populations in areas they occupied , saying , we have to think about governing a little bit here—picking up the trash , having people not being so harsh with Sharia law .
All of those trends were operating at a time when I think the administration was starting to relax a little too much about the terrorist threat .
ZK : One other factor that needs to be taken into account is the intense regional competition and Shia-Sunni dimension . Frankly , in the decision-making that took place , this dimension was not adequately taken into account in terms of both effect and its implications . On balance , the administration was caught flat-footed with regard to it .
With the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq , a vacuum was created , which the regional powers would like to fill . They did it by aligning with different internal forces in particular in Iraq , but you also see it in Syria . The result was the Turks moving closer to the Kurds and some Sunni groups , the Saudis developing relations with the other Sunnis , with Iran coming in more heavily . Iran had benefited from some of what happened in Iraq , but in the aftermath of our withdrawal , their relative influence further increased .
If we look forward from where we are , I don ’ t think you can solve the situation in Iraq and Syria without the regional players , whose roles have become much more important in shaping things . Our role , somewhat diminished—although still the most important external power—has to be taken into account and addressed .
By James Miller The Iraq war was a bad strategic choice , poorly executed by the Bush administration . At the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom on March 19 , 2003 , President Bush said , “ We will accept no outcome but victory. ” Instead , the administration compounded the error of its war of choice by failing to define and adequately resource a strategy for its execution . A new strategy , starting in 2007 with the surge and outreach to Sunni tribal leaders , helped significantly , but the fact remains that the war ’ s resulting instability has empowered Iran and increased the global terrorist threat . Iraq is not yet lost . But it is a near-run thing , due to Iraq ’ s—and in particular former Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki ’ s—failure to build on the hard-fought security gains provided by the U.S. military by establishing a truly national Iraqi Army and making good on commitments to Sunnis in Iraq . In his remaining 18 months in office , President Obama should not define success in Iraq as minimizing the U.S. military role or presence . Instead , he should aim to hand off to his successor a situation where ISIL is on the road to defeat , Iraq is on the road to a sustainable political balance that includes the Sunnis , and U.S. resolve is unquestioned . Achieving these goals will require continued and indeed increased support on the ground from the U.S. military , and persistent engagement with Iraqis by the president and senior members of his administration . James Miller was undersecretary of defense for policy from 2012 to 2014 . Illustration by Louisa Bertman
CH : All of that is absolutely true—this idea that the administration failed to address these broader Sunni-Shia issues—but I think part of it had to do with this big roll-out of the “ pivot strategy. ” The pivot strategy , to pay more attention to Asia , was sound in that regard , but it created unintended consequences . The chief unintended consequence was that we no longer cared about the machinations of the Middle East . And if you combine that with some of the U.S. energy strategy , with the development of fracking and all of this , there ’ s a perception that somehow the Middle East was yesterday ’ s news—and moreover , someone else ’ s news . I think there was a definite sense that America was moving on .
KK : The White House adopted a strategy of partnership with countries in the Middle East that was not genuine partnership . The White House strategy was one of outsourcing , in the sense that because the strategy had pivoted to Asia—the idea was that local players and regional players could and should supervise the dynamics of the region . Partnership with American leadership is a strategy that may succeed in some circumstances , but partnership without American leadership has led to this competition between the Saudis and the Iranians , between the Turks and the Egyptians , and , rather than actually empowering regional leaders to take action consistent with the interests of the United States , has actually accelerated the regional conflict in the Middle East .
BK : I largely agree with a lot of those points . I think , in 2015 , the Middle East is in this particularly intense period of multipolar and multidimensional conflict with itself ; actors are using resources—it ’ s not just arming and equipping proxies in various places—but also offering all types of economic support in places like Iraq and Syria . An important point to make is that the U.S. leadership still is desired . This anti-ISIL coalition offers an important opportunity not yet seized—to channel the energies , the resources of those actors in the region to more constructive ends .
The problem is that we still are in a very tactical and reactive crisis-management mode . There ’ s very little discussion about : How do all of these efforts—the U.S. now back from being disengaged—how does it use its leadership to drive toward some sort of well-defined end state , both in Iraq and then especially in Syria ? The two problems are now combined . That ’ s the opportunity Washington needs to discuss , rather than just react to serious setbacks like Ramadi and Palmyra . How do we use this conversation to do things like drive toward the political consensus that is so obviously missing when we can ’ t get an Authorization for the Use of Military Force 10 months into an air campaign ?
MC : Brian , for all kinds of understandable reasons we ’ ve talked a lot about mistakes made since 2009 . They ’ re fresher in memory . But a lot of Democrats consider the original sin the invasion of Iraq . Is the nightmare we ’ re seeing an outgrowth of an ill-advised decision to invade Iraq in 2003 ? Is that the unavoidable truth here ?
BK : Look , in the ending of our longstanding policy strategy—the containment of Iran and Iraq—we have inadvertently unleashed a lot of forces , and a lot of those forces were poised in any case to explode , given the demographic and social and political challenges . So , yes , there was the original sin of the 2003 Iraq War , but let ’ s remind everybody that a lot of Democrats were themselves implicated in that , in votes in Congress . What the Iraq War did , especially starting in 2005 and 2006—it made Americans much more divided , and it made our national security debate overall much more caustic . I say this as someone who quite frankly engaged in some of this back then , and I don ’ t think it was all very helpful in terms of defining what the end goal could be .
That worries me . I brought up AUMF because it is a debate that in our Congress , whether Republican or Democrat , there are very few voices that have been stalwarts in saying , “ We need to define this. ” I see the AUMF issue not just as the right legal authority , but how do we actually have a national debate on national security on Iraq , Syria and ISIL ? The problem isn ’ t just Republican versus Democrat , right ?
There ’ s a fracturing in the consensus among internationalists within both parties . It ’ s a struggle for the definition of how do Americans interact with the rest of the world , including the Middle East , in these complicated and dangerous sets of issues ? I don ’ t know that our 2016 debate will resolve this . My hope is that we can remove the deadlock and the stasis that exists within both parties . Some of that is the consequence of the perception that somehow politicians think in this country that the costs of making national security questions a partisan wedge issue , in fights on the Hill and in election campaigns , are low . I think actually the costs are pretty high , and that ’ s the gridlock we have on AUMF .
ZK : It is a problem inside both parties and across the two parties . I wholeheartedly endorse that . Having said that , I do believe that there are a few things that we need to take into account in that debate and that this is a different , a changed situation—the old Middle East prior to Iraq wasn ’ t working well , and inducing crises and threats , and a new one and current one is also doing the same—but it ’ s different . The difference is this ISIL threat is a serious threat , bigger in many ways than Al Qaeda was , and we need to have a strategy for containing and ultimately defeating it . That ’ s the military part , but there ’ s a need for a regional compact , and we need much more of an act of diplomacy to move things toward an understanding among the regional players . I would put equal importance on the nuclear dialogue with Iran and the regional strategy and politics of Iran , because , in part , the Iranian push for domination has caused the suffering that Brian talked about earlier , and , in part , the response has been this extremist terrorist thing .
Also , the policies of Saudis and the Turks have been a response , in part , to the crisis now emanating from this region . The threat has become so great—now there ’ s a dangerous Saudi-Iranian war over Yemen—can our diplomacy , working with allies , bring about a dialogue to have some rules of the game agreed to among the regional players ? I don ’ t think you begin to address the challenges of this area without a regional understanding addressing some of the longstanding issues , such as the Shia-Sunni divide , how the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia don ’ t accept the Shiites as Muslim . We can ’ t unilaterally produce those , but I think we need to bring together the people who can . We don ’ t have a strategy , we don ’ t have a plan and we ’ re not as engaged on that in my view .
By John Negroponte Iraq was our war between 2003 and 2011 , with U.S. forces in the lead and Iraqis in support . Today it is their war , with them in the lead and us in support . This reversal of roles calls for some accompanying humility on our part . For a U.S. official to say that the Iraqis “ have lost their will to fight ” must resonate terribly in that country . They are taking the brunt of casualties now , and there still are many patriotic Iraqis willing to die in defense of their country . Clearly , they can use our help in such areas as training , equipment , logistics , air support and intelligence . Our nation has a long-term interest in the battle against ISIL in Iraq so as to deny the political descendants of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi a platform from which they can terrorize the rest of the Middle East and beyond . The government of Iraq will most likely prevail in the fight over the long term , but it would be far better for our posture in the region if it is able to do this with our proactive assistance rather than with the exclusive help of Iran . Our public commentary should be compatible with achieving this objective . Iraq is not lost yet . John Negroponte , U.S. ambassador to Iraq in 2004 and 2005 and director of national intelligence from 2005 to 2007 , also served in the State Department and White House . Illustration by Louisa Bertman
CH : We have to construct a strategy looking forward , and Zalmay is quite right that we have a Sunni-Shia divide . I would not assume that ISIL is a product of Maliki not giving enough ministerial portfolio to the Sunnis . Certainly , Maliki could have done more with Sunni outreach , but ISIL represents a broader issue in the Middle East . We need a broader strategy , we need to be talking to the Saudis , talking to the Iranians—not just about nuclear things but about broader issues because that ’ s where the competition is going on right now . We need to deal with it , and certainly our country needs to be able to do more than one thing at a time , to talk about the pivot and to talk about the need for broader security arrangements in the Middle East .
I don ’ t think Syria can be solved with more guns . We need political arrangements . Only through political arrangements , not through provisional elections and provisional governments and provisional constitutional laws , but only through lasting political arrangements can you get people to stop and get people out of their foxholes . Only then can you really identify moderates . These issues are all connected—Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Syria—and I do think we need some broader strategies .
JM : Two places to start , because you can ’ t do everything at once , that are essential to a good outcome—one military , the other diplomatic . On the military side , territory has to be taken back from ISIL—if we don ’ t do that , they continue to have a caliphate , they continue to have stature , they continue to develop recruits and continue to have credibility .
Second , diplomatically , along the lines of what Chris just said , I don ’ t know if any of us have the formula , but the way has to be found to meet , satisfy , respond to the grievances of the Sunnis , who comprise as I said earlier , about 70 percent of Syria and roughly 25 percent or thereabouts of Iraq . That is probably a political and diplomatic job . The U.N. is hacking away at it , not too successfully . Someone needs to put together a strategy that might in the case of Syria combine some military pressure with some intense , what I called at one point , “ heroic diplomatic activity . ”
One nightmare we haven ’ t talked about : What if ISIL gets into Damascus ? That would be the ultimate nightmare . We talked about in various places the possibility of getting into Baghdad . Assad is weakening , and you don ’ t want that regime to come to that end ; you want that to come to some other end that we have some control over .
MC : Kim , Jeb Bush was confronted at a campaign event by a young woman who said , “ Your brother created ISIS. ” Her theory was that disbanding the Iraqi military in 2003 was the worst decision here , in that the Islamic State relies heavily on the expertise of these disenfranchised former Baathist Iraqi military guys . Does that still resonate as a kind of tragic mistake , setting these well-trained military guys loose on the country ?
KK : President Bush made mistakes , quite a lot of them , in 2003 . But I think that focusing on the idea of an original sin to assign blame takes us away from what the discussion in Washington must be right now . We are in 2015—we face a threat in Iraq , in Syria , indeed a global threat in ISIL , we face a global threat in Al Qaeda and its affiliates , and our discussion in Washington needs to move away from discussion of blame , responsibility and original sin , and focus on what should come .
One question is : Is Iraq lost ? It is a supposition of this discussion that someone is responsible for losing Iraq . We still as the United States of America , the Iraqis still , the world still has opportunities to shape and change the situation , such that the question of who lost Iraq shouldn ’ t be on our minds . The question on our minds should be : How is it that we , the United States , can construct a strategy that will bring sufficient security to the Middle East that our own interests and our own homeland are no longer threatened to this degree ?","For a brief, happy—and misguided—moment, most Americans stopped thinking about Iraq. After withdrawing the last U.S. troops in 2011, President Barack Obama declared the country “sovereign, stable and self-reliant.” No such luck. Iraq plunged back into chaos as the Islamic State stormed the region last year, and the fall of Ramadi in May revived questions about how, and whether, the country can be salvaged.

As Americans try to understand what $2 trillion and nearly 4,500 American lives really accomplished, partisans are battling over how much blame falls on Obama, who left Iraq, and on President George W. Bush, who took us there. “If you fought in Iraq, it worked,” 2016 presidential candidate Lindsey Graham recently said. “It’s not your fault it’s going to hell. It’s Obama’s fault.” Naturally, Democrats see it differently: “This represents the failed policies that took us down this path 10 years ago,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said.

Who’s right? Could Iraq have remained stable if Obama had left behind a small troop contingent? Did Bush’s “surge” really stabilize the country? In June, Politico Magazine assembled a dozen experts—including veterans of both administrations from the State Department, White House, Pentagon and the CIA—and asked a simple question: Who lost Iraq? —Michael Crowley



***

Michael Crowley: Ambassador Khalilzad, you were in Iraq from 2005 to 2007. Describe the trajectory Iraq was on when you left, and the Iraq that Obama inherited when he was inaugurated in January 2009.

Zalmay Khalilzad: It was a very difficult period. Especially in the aftermath of the al-Askari Mosque bombing in 2006, the sectarian violence became front and center—a very large number of fatalities and causalities, both Shia and Sunni—and the rise of Al Qaeda in Iraq. We began a more concerted effort training Iraqi troops, which resulted in significant growth in their size and capabilities. The new Iraqi government led by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki showed more willingness to use force against the Shia militias in Basra and Baghdad’s Sadr City. Additionally, the excesses committed by Al Qaeda in Iraq against the Sunni community was beginning to turn some Sunnis against them. With increased outreach to the Sunnis, we began to have significant numbers of them work with us.

There were still some issues unresolved—there was no oil law for the distribution of resources, there still was no reform of de-Baathification. These were self-inflicted wounds, if you like—mistakes we made, in my judgment, at the very beginning. But I think the Iraqis were heading in the right direction. You had a government that acquired greater national legitimacy. There was a greater Sunni participation in government compared to an earlier period. The level of violence, by the end of the Bush administration, was significantly down compared to 2006, early 2007.

We’re still talking about Iraq, but relatively speaking, I would say it was on a positive trajectory with some big issues still unresolved.

MC: Kim, tell us more about the security situation when President Obama arrived.

The five participants in our roundtable discussion. | Illustration by Louisa Bertman

Kim Kagan: The security situation in Iraq was dramatically improved by operations conducted by surge troops—violence in Baghdad and in Iraq fell dramatically over the course of 2007. And in 2008, U.S. forces partnered with the Iraqi security forces, pushed AQI out of Baghdad, out of Diyala and all the way to Mosul, where the Al Qaeda elements were greatly reduced over time by follow-on operations and special forces operations. The Shia militias, which posed a threat to the sovereignty of the Iraqi government, had been greatly diminished by the operations that Prime Minister Maliki and U.S. forces undertook in 2008 and were no longer militarily viable within Iraq.

By Army Lt. Gen. Daniel P. Bolger America lost in Iraq because generals—guys like me—misused our great all-volunteer military. We train, organize and equip our fighting men and women to smash conventional, uniformed enemy forces. Go in, kill ’em and get the hell out. In 2003, due to happenstance, ignorance and no small amount of arrogance, we recommended staying in force in Iraq—Vietnam redux, but this time “done right.” America’s elected leaders agreed. The American people went along with it. So we tried to use more than 100,000 of our troops to defeat an entrenched insurgency and to build viable democratic institutions in a country we barely understood. Over time, we learned how to hunt terrorist leaders. We got a better grip on Iraqi society and culture. But we never got a better grip on the suspicious, beleaguered, heartbroken Iraqi people. They’re the real losers of this hard war, and they’ve been in anguish for decades. Their latest oppressors are the vicious gunmen of ISIL, the guerrillas we left in the field when we drew down in 2011. One thing is pretty clear: Social work from the barrel of a gun is not a winning formula. Army Lt. Gen. Daniel P. Bolger (ret.), who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, is author of Why We Lost: A General’s Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. Illustration by Louisa Bertman

The two main threats to Iraqi state security had been significantly diminished by 2008 and over the course of 2009. Our U.S. forces were handing over security to Iraqi security forces, such that U.S. forces came out of the major cities of Iraq, and handed responsibility for those cities back to the Iraqi security forces. One of the principles behind the way that the U.S. had constructed its surge operations was that the U.S. had special tie-in capabilities that the Iraqi security forces did not have, because they were still growing, still developing skills. So clearing cities was something the U.S. did with Iraqi security forces’ support.

As those cities became more peaceful, as the population returned, as AQI left, the Iraqi security forces could handle the security environment in the urban centers. But AQI was not destroyed. It had not lost the will to fight. It was potentially reduced from an organization that had high-end terrorist capabilities that could threaten the state, to an insurgency, a group that had very limited capacity to act as a terrorist organization, but still had some will to fight, and still had some organization, some command and control left over, primarily in the Mosul area.

MC: John, what did the threat to the U.S. or western interests in the region emanating from Iraq look like at the time Obama took office?

John McLaughlin: If you go all the way back to 2008, the Arab Spring or Awakening was still years away. In 2008, Al Qaeda central was on the run but not defeated. We were still very much on guard against attacks on the United States; we were just two years after detecting the attempt by Al Qaeda-related people to put together an operation over the Atlantic out of London—the planes plot. So Al Qaeda in that period is still very dangerous but not particularly noteworthy insofar as its capability in Iraq was seen.

MC: Ambassador Hill, you get to Iraq at the start of Obama’s first term. What does that Iraq look like—is it on a trajectory to a place where it can stand on its own?

Chris Hill: There was perhaps more optimism than the facts might have justified. For example, there was a view that somehow Maliki had gotten in the saddle, that he understood the need for outreach to the various groups and was prepared to continue the payments to the so-called Sons of Iraq. There was an overall kind of optimistic mood, but I must say, in talking to the Sunni leaders who were part of his cabinet, you certainly didn’t get the sense there was any reason to be optimistic. You certainly got the impression when you talked to people that it wasn’t going well. Going out to Anbar, for example, and talking to Sunni sheiks out there, they were all prepared to work together in a kind of all-in Sunni party, but you certainly didn’t get the impression they were cutting Baghdad any slack or cutting Maliki any slack.

Overall, I found it surprisingly peaceful, in terms of kinetic stuff on the ground. But from the point of view of listening to politicians, no one was prepared to say that things were better—and, in fact, many of them felt that things were getting worse.

MC: Brian, you were on the Obama campaign. Did you guys come to Iraq with the assumption that it couldn’t be saved, so we had to get out and let it fend for itself? Or was the thinking that Iraq was ready to stand on its own?

Brian Katulis: That was a central focus: How does Iraq actually achieve or build on the security gains of the surge? It’s true that the addition of U.S. forces in 2007 had an impact in changing security dynamics, but there were other factors too—including a pretty massive sectarian cleansing campaign that had happened in Baghdad from 2006 to 2008. These issues of power sharing, which Ambassador Hill alluded to, were nowhere close to being resolved.

We did a report in late 2008 that analyzed where Iraq stood in terms of its power-sharing and politics. That was always one of the key fundamental rationales for the surge—that it would open the door to power-sharing. Our conclusion was that it had not, and that many of the grievances of the Sunni community had not been adequately addressed. There’s an absence of political framework to this day that deals with the grievances of Sunni communities in Iraq and in Syria. That sense of injustice, corruption and poor governance actually provides an opening for groups like AQI and ISIL.

Essentially for a dozen years, the U.S. has been searching for an overarching strategy for its engagement, not only in Iraq but the broader Middle East. One of the consequences of the 2003 Iraq War was that—largely unintended—we upended a policy of dual containment of Iran and Iraq. That inadvertently facilitated the expansion of Iranian influence in the region. Our presence in Iraq created a massive rallying cry and recruitment tool and live training ground for all the sorts of types of groups that we’re now still dealing with. I remember Ambassador Khalilzad even telling how he joked to Iranians about how he eliminated two of their biggest adversaries, the Taliban of Afghanistan and then Iraq.

Collectively, this is the Humpty Dumpty problem—how do we put it all back together again? I’m not blaming the U.S. solely or the Iraq War itself, but I do see often a fixation on the tactical elements. We see this today—do we send 10,000 or 20,000 more troops to train Sunni tribes in Iraq? That to me begs the question of what is the overarching political framework that would be sustainable for the communities that feel the sense of grievances, that feel like there hasn’t been power-sharing for decades?

MC: Should I take from your answer that Iraq was not salvageable when Obama came into office?

By James Jeffrey Iraq is not lost. “Lost” in any reasonable sense of this question would be to disintegrate as a country (“Who lost Yugoslavia?”) or fall into totally hostile hands (“Who lost Vietnam?”). Neither fate has befallen Iraq. That said, it is not a successful country. If Iraq is ever truly lost, the answer will be the Iraqi people. If the question, rather, is, “Who lost the American dream of a democratic, fully independent, stable Iraqi partner for regional stability and in the global war against terror,” the answer is: the U.S. did. In stark contrast to the situation in Eastern European countries in 1989 and 1990, the large majority of the Iraqi population did not identify with the American or Western value system or demonstrate a deep desire to see a system analogous to that in the West imposed on Iraq from without. Despite the above, the United States remained engaged for almost eight years in an effort to achieve the above state of affairs, without ultimate success. Had we remained longer in Iraq, made fewer mistakes and—in particular—shaken the image of an occupying force in the minds of, by every poll, the majority of the Arab population, the United States might have been successful, but this was not the case.

BK: The primary responsibility lies in the hands of Maliki and the Iraqi leadership that did not seize the moment. We could blame various U.S. officials, but the leaders of these countries are responsible for the fundamental dynamics. We can help. We’ve given them an opportunity. Did they seize it? The answer, I think, is no.

KK: President Obama and Prime Minister Maliki share blame and responsibility for the developments in Iraq from 2010 onward. The Iraqi security forces were strained much earlier than January 2014, when Fallujah fell. ISIL systematically not only conducted spectacular attacks, but deliberately undermined the Iraqi security forces. After the “waterfall” withdrawal of American troops over the course of 2010, and the complete withdrawal of troops at the end of 2011, the Iraqi security forces were not continually being developed. Nor were they being supported by some of the unique capabilities we as Americans can bring to the battlefield—like intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, continued training in how to do operational planning, and how to replenish the Iraqi security forces, which were taking causalities.

But Prime Minister Maliki bears responsibility. He did not employ the Iraqi security forces effectively. He did not put enough leadership in charge of Iraqi security forces. And he did not design—or allow to be designed—good operations to respond to Al Qaeda in Iraq.

By August 2013, the Iraqi security forces were no longer combat-effective—they had taken so many losses, they were not commanded and controlled well—and that should have been an early indicator to us in Washington that something needed to be done, and that they faced a threat of a magnitude that the Iraq security forces could not handle.

MC: Last August, President Obama said the withdrawal from Iraq was not “ my decision .” There’s a debate as to whether the Iraqis would have tolerated an enduring American presence, and Obama officials say probably not. Is the question of whether Obama lost Iraq moot because the Iraqis would not have allowed us to stay in substantial numbers? Or could he have done more, politically, to accomplish that?

ZK: I have talked to Prime Minister Maliki about that period, and I’ve talked to the defense minister of Iraq and others. And they say they wanted some number of U.S. troops to stay, but what they didn’t want to do is to go to Parliament on this issue of immunity that we required, and that this was entangled in part of the domestic Iraqi politics. From our side, on the other hand, President Obama insisted on a Parliament-approved agreement giving our troops immunity. Could we have worked out something? It’s hard for me to judge.

CH: The issue of a residual troop presence is to some extent a little too much American solipsism—that it’s all about us and our troop presence. But, nonetheless, I found many Iraqis, including senior politicians, who were prepared to say to one group of people, “Yes, we want to see American troops,” and then they would say an hour later to another group, “No, we don’t want American troops.” I’m not sure the Iraqis were entirely committed or entirely honest about saying whether they wanted troops or not.

I found this across the board—where they would say one thing to one person and another thing to another person. Especially for visitors coming from Washington, Iraqis had this sort of feeling they should say what they were expected to say, and I’m not sure it’s necessarily what they believed.

In getting there in April 2009, I certainly had the impression the Iraqis were very much conflicted about the idea of a continuing American role. When Maliki announced that American troops would no longer be in the populated areas, there was such a note of pride in his voice—the infidels have been forced to retreat. The key is that the politics of Iraq didn’t necessarily line up with what I would consider their best interests.

And finally, I’d like to say in regard to the Sunnis—there’s no question the Sunni community felt aggrieved in how Maliki handled things, how the Shia generally handled things, but I think to understand the Sunni perspective is not just that of an aggrieved minority. I think they feel like they have a kind of strategic depth that goes all the way through the Middle East. And that strategic depth that the Sunnis have should have come to bear in sort of pressuring the majority Shia in Iraq. Like all things in Iraq, I think it was more complicated.

JM: I think there’s danger in focusing too narrowly on things like Maliki’s behavior, the [Status of Forces] agreement, and so forth. To ask the question “who lost Iraq?” is not a fair question. To focus on it that way is a little like saying, “How do we explain Hitler?” “Well, let’s look at the 1932 elections.” I would pull the camera back here a little bit. All of those were factors in what brought us to the Iraq of today. Certainly, it’s beyond dispute that Maliki failed to reach out appropriately to the Sunni community. It’s beyond dispute that the training of soldiers doesn’t equip them to fight; it’s the will that equips them to fight. There’s a big difference between training and the will to fight. All that is true.

But if you pull the camera back here, remember that in 2011, we had the Arab Awakening and remember that Syria went drastically bad, largely because of [Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s reaction to what were legitimate protests in the area. Syria is about 70 percent Sunni and that is the real engine that is drawing in fighters for ISIL at something like 1,000 a month.

Think of it in concentric circles: We’ve been talking about the innermost circle—all of the stuff going on around Maliki and the SOFA agreement and so forth. Take the next circle out and look more broadly at the region. You have the magnetic power of the Syrian uprising gone bad, pulling in fighters who are going to affiliate with someone. If it was not ISIL, I suspect it would have been al-Nusra—which, for a period of time in 2012 or so, remember, our focus was really on al-Nusra, which seemed to be surging at that point in northeast Syria and making dramatic gains. ISIL came in and exploited that, and that’s another story.

Then if you pull the camera back even further, a third concentric circle out, you really have to say—I risk sounding too much like an academic here—but you’ve got to go back to Sykes-Picot, which created the modern Middle East. We’re still dealing with the aftermath of lines drawn in the sands in 1916. It’s taken 100 years of sectarian turmoil to control for a good period of that time, but ultimately, breaking through to get us to this point. All of that is in the mix here. Perhaps among the sparks were the behavior of Maliki and our failure to get a SOFA agreement and so forth, but I think the whole issue of how Iraq ended up where it is has to take all of those broader factors into consideration as well.

By Thomas E. Ricks I don't think Iraq was ever America's to lose. We did help Saddam Hussein lose it, and we did help hand it over to the Iranians—at least the capital and the south. But I think the people who really lost Iraq are short-sighted Shiite leaders. They had the upper hand but still played like they were the underdogs. They could have brought the Sunnis on board with a generous offer of semi-autonomy and respect for sectarian differences. Instead, as soon as Uncle Sam was out of the way, they took a series of steps to alienate the Sunnis and so to encourage the growth of ISIL. Thomas E. Ricks, who covered Iraq for the Washington Post , is the author of Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq. By Wendy Anderson President Bush made the mistake of invading Iraq in the first place. President Obama has made his share of mistakes as well—withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 was terribly premature. But so have the Iraqis, particularly former Prime Minister Maliki. And, let’s not forget the Sunnis, who’ve played their own unhelpful role. Iraq’s neighbors have also consistently used the chaos in Iraq to advance their own interests. Obama’s strategy today is imperfect but sound and defensible. He has worked hard at enlisting the region to support Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. He continues to pressure Iraqi leadership for internal political reconciliation, without which nothing we do will be permanent. He views ISIL as a regional problem and not just an Iraq and Syria problem. He could do more—speed up the pace of providing Iraqis with training and equipment, fortifying their will to fight; embed our advisers in Iraqi forces; supply forward air controllers and additional air support; consider arming Sunni fighters directly, to name a few—options he’s apparently considering. Bottom line: Whether Iraq has been lost remains to be seen. Wendy Anderson has held multiple senior positions in the U.S. Department of Defense from 2010 to 2014. Illustrations by Louisa Bertman

MC: Brian, were there mistakes that even President Obama would concede at this point?

BK: Yes, absolutely. I think those problems many of us identified—a lack of political unity and power-sharing inside of Iraq—the administration attempted to work on those issues, but the real question is: Did it actually have a strategy that could have produced the result? Was it as high of a priority as other issues that came up? This is at a time in the administration where the overall theme was to try to pivot beyond the challenges of the Middle East, that we had spent more than a decade investing a lot of our money, time and effort, and that we wanted to move beyond that. One of the biggest mistakes is just relative inattention. Iraq, inside the Obama White House, just became less of a focus.

Then look at the 2012 reelection campaign and some of the statements made about Iraq. When you measure it against what was happening with the Maliki government and what was happening on the ground, there’s a gap between the two. Even on the eve of ISIL taking over Fallujah, you had statements coming from the White House that downgraded and downplayed the threat that ISIL posed.

Quite certainly, 2014 was a wake-up call for everyone; I think the administration more or less has got the right re-engagement strategy here. These problems that John McLaughlin identified, the broader historical trends, I think this president has a deep appreciation for that, and that’s why they’ve been very cautious and largely judicious, but there are big gaps even to this day in their strategies. Syria is one of them. You can’t talk about Iraq without linking the problem of Syria, because ISIL certainly does.

Yes, mistakes were made, a larger part of it was—not just a sense of exhaustion—but this sense of, “OK, we have a different set of strategic priorities as a country, we want to invest in other parts of the world.” When you look back with 20-20 hindsight, they downgraded Iraq way too much, even at a time of turmoil and chaos with the Arab uprisings.

JM: I would say that that mistake occurred in the context of a larger mistake that was taking place roughly during the 2011 to 2013 time frame—that was more broadly to underestimate the remaining power of Al Qaeda or extremism generally. This was a period when people were talking in the administration, and more broadly, about “strategic defeat of terrorism” and so forth. Yet, if one looks at that time, and many of us were saying this at the time, there were at least three trends at the time that were enlivening the movement.

Then the third thing was—I believed and tried to document a couple times that this was a period when terrorists were going to school on what had not worked for them up to that point. You look at documents that came out of Mali, the French operation there, you look at what al-Nusra was doing, what Al Qaeda was doing in Yemen—they were going to school on their failure to be able to hold sway over populations in areas they occupied, saying, we have to think about governing a little bit here—picking up the trash, having people not being so harsh with Sharia law.

All of those trends were operating at a time when I think the administration was starting to relax a little too much about the terrorist threat.

ZK: One other factor that needs to be taken into account is the intense regional competition and Shia-Sunni dimension. Frankly, in the decision-making that took place, this dimension was not adequately taken into account in terms of both effect and its implications. On balance, the administration was caught flat-footed with regard to it.

With the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, a vacuum was created, which the regional powers would like to fill. They did it by aligning with different internal forces in particular in Iraq, but you also see it in Syria. The result was the Turks moving closer to the Kurds and some Sunni groups, the Saudis developing relations with the other Sunnis, with Iran coming in more heavily. Iran had benefited from some of what happened in Iraq, but in the aftermath of our withdrawal, their relative influence further increased.

If we look forward from where we are, I don’t think you can solve the situation in Iraq and Syria without the regional players, whose roles have become much more important in shaping things. Our role, somewhat diminished—although still the most important external power—has to be taken into account and addressed.

By James Miller The Iraq war was a bad strategic choice, poorly executed by the Bush administration. At the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom on March 19, 2003, President Bush said, “We will accept no outcome but victory.” Instead, the administration compounded the error of its war of choice by failing to define and adequately resource a strategy for its execution. A new strategy, starting in 2007 with the surge and outreach to Sunni tribal leaders, helped significantly, but the fact remains that the war’s resulting instability has empowered Iran and increased the global terrorist threat. Iraq is not yet lost. But it is a near-run thing, due to Iraq’s—and in particular former Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki’s—failure to build on the hard-fought security gains provided by the U.S. military by establishing a truly national Iraqi Army and making good on commitments to Sunnis in Iraq. In his remaining 18 months in office, President Obama should not define success in Iraq as minimizing the U.S. military role or presence. Instead, he should aim to hand off to his successor a situation where ISIL is on the road to defeat, Iraq is on the road to a sustainable political balance that includes the Sunnis, and U.S. resolve is unquestioned. Achieving these goals will require continued and indeed increased support on the ground from the U.S. military, and persistent engagement with Iraqis by the president and senior members of his administration.

CH: All of that is absolutely true—this idea that the administration failed to address these broader Sunni-Shia issues—but I think part of it had to do with this big roll-out of the “pivot strategy.” The pivot strategy, to pay more attention to Asia, was sound in that regard, but it created unintended consequences. The chief unintended consequence was that we no longer cared about the machinations of the Middle East. And if you combine that with some of the U.S. energy strategy, with the development of fracking and all of this, there’s a perception that somehow the Middle East was yesterday’s news—and moreover, someone else’s news. I think there was a definite sense that America was moving on.

KK: The White House adopted a strategy of partnership with countries in the Middle East that was not genuine partnership. The White House strategy was one of outsourcing, in the sense that because the strategy had pivoted to Asia—the idea was that local players and regional players could and should supervise the dynamics of the region. Partnership with American leadership is a strategy that may succeed in some circumstances, but partnership without American leadership has led to this competition between the Saudis and the Iranians, between the Turks and the Egyptians, and, rather than actually empowering regional leaders to take action consistent with the interests of the United States, has actually accelerated the regional conflict in the Middle East.

BK: I largely agree with a lot of those points. I think, in 2015, the Middle East is in this particularly intense period of multipolar and multidimensional conflict with itself; actors are using resources—it’s not just arming and equipping proxies in various places—but also offering all types of economic support in places like Iraq and Syria. An important point to make is that the U.S. leadership still is desired. This anti-ISIL coalition offers an important opportunity not yet seized—to channel the energies, the resources of those actors in the region to more constructive ends.

The problem is that we still are in a very tactical and reactive crisis-management mode. There’s very little discussion about: How do all of these efforts—the U.S. now back from being disengaged—how does it use its leadership to drive toward some sort of well-defined end state, both in Iraq and then especially in Syria? The two problems are now combined. That’s the opportunity Washington needs to discuss, rather than just react to serious setbacks like Ramadi and Palmyra. How do we use this conversation to do things like drive toward the political consensus that is so obviously missing when we can’t get an Authorization for the Use of Military Force 10 months into an air campaign?

MC: Brian, for all kinds of understandable reasons we’ve talked a lot about mistakes made since 2009. They’re fresher in memory. But a lot of Democrats consider the original sin the invasion of Iraq. Is the nightmare we’re seeing an outgrowth of an ill-advised decision to invade Iraq in 2003? Is that the unavoidable truth here?

BK : Look, in the ending of our longstanding policy strategy—the containment of Iran and Iraq—we have inadvertently unleashed a lot of forces, and a lot of those forces were poised in any case to explode, given the demographic and social and political challenges. So, yes, there was the original sin of the 2003 Iraq War, but let’s remind everybody that a lot of Democrats were themselves implicated in that, in votes in Congress. What the Iraq War did, especially starting in 2005 and 2006—it made Americans much more divided, and it made our national security debate overall much more caustic. I say this as someone who quite frankly engaged in some of this back then, and I don’t think it was all very helpful in terms of defining what the end goal could be.

That worries me. I brought up AUMF because it is a debate that in our Congress, whether Republican or Democrat, there are very few voices that have been stalwarts in saying, “We need to define this.” I see the AUMF issue not just as the right legal authority, but how do we actually have a national debate on national security on Iraq, Syria and ISIL? The problem isn’t just Republican versus Democrat, right?

There’s a fracturing in the consensus among internationalists within both parties. It’s a struggle for the definition of how do Americans interact with the rest of the world, including the Middle East, in these complicated and dangerous sets of issues? I don’t know that our 2016 debate will resolve this. My hope is that we can remove the deadlock and the stasis that exists within both parties. Some of that is the consequence of the perception that somehow politicians think in this country that the costs of making national security questions a partisan wedge issue, in fights on the Hill and in election campaigns, are low. I think actually the costs are pretty high, and that’s the gridlock we have on AUMF.

ZK: It is a problem inside both parties and across the two parties. I wholeheartedly endorse that. Having said that, I do believe that there are a few things that we need to take into account in that debate and that this is a different, a changed situation—the old Middle East prior to Iraq wasn’t working well, and inducing crises and threats, and a new one and current one is also doing the same—but it’s different. The difference is this ISIL threat is a serious threat, bigger in many ways than Al Qaeda was, and we need to have a strategy for containing and ultimately defeating it. That’s the military part, but there’s a need for a regional compact, and we need much more of an act of diplomacy to move things toward an understanding among the regional players. I would put equal importance on the nuclear dialogue with Iran and the regional strategy and politics of Iran, because, in part, the Iranian push for domination has caused the suffering that Brian talked about earlier, and, in part, the response has been this extremist terrorist thing.

Also, the policies of Saudis and the Turks have been a response, in part, to the crisis now emanating from this region. The threat has become so great—now there’s a dangerous Saudi-Iranian war over Yemen—can our diplomacy, working with allies, bring about a dialogue to have some rules of the game agreed to among the regional players? I don’t think you begin to address the challenges of this area without a regional understanding addressing some of the longstanding issues, such as the Shia-Sunni divide, how the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia don’t accept the Shiites as Muslim. We can’t unilaterally produce those, but I think we need to bring together the people who can. We don’t have a strategy, we don’t have a plan and we’re not as engaged on that in my view.

By John Negroponte Iraq was our war between 2003 and 2011, with U.S. forces in the lead and Iraqis in support. Today it is their war, with them in the lead and us in support. This reversal of roles calls for some accompanying humility on our part. For a U.S. official to say that the Iraqis “have lost their will to fight” must resonate terribly in that country. They are taking the brunt of casualties now, and there still are many patriotic Iraqis willing to die in defense of their country. Clearly, they can use our help in such areas as training, equipment, logistics, air support and intelligence. Our nation has a long-term interest in the battle against ISIL in Iraq so as to deny the political descendants of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi a platform from which they can terrorize the rest of the Middle East and beyond. The government of Iraq will most likely prevail in the fight over the long term, but it would be far better for our posture in the region if it is able to do this with our proactive assistance rather than with the exclusive help of Iran. Our public commentary should be compatible with achieving this objective. Iraq is not lost yet.

CH: We have to construct a strategy looking forward, and Zalmay is quite right that we have a Sunni-Shia divide. I would not assume that ISIL is a product of Maliki not giving enough ministerial portfolio to the Sunnis. Certainly, Maliki could have done more with Sunni outreach, but ISIL represents a broader issue in the Middle East. We need a broader strategy, we need to be talking to the Saudis, talking to the Iranians—not just about nuclear things but about broader issues because that’s where the competition is going on right now. We need to deal with it, and certainly our country needs to be able to do more than one thing at a time, to talk about the pivot and to talk about the need for broader security arrangements in the Middle East.

I don’t think Syria can be solved with more guns. We need political arrangements. Only through political arrangements, not through provisional elections and provisional governments and provisional constitutional laws, but only through lasting political arrangements can you get people to stop and get people out of their foxholes. Only then can you really identify moderates. These issues are all connected—Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria—and I do think we need some broader strategies.

JM: Two places to start, because you can’t do everything at once, that are essential to a good outcome—one military, the other diplomatic. On the military side, territory has to be taken back from ISIL—if we don’t do that, they continue to have a caliphate, they continue to have stature, they continue to develop recruits and continue to have credibility.

Second, diplomatically, along the lines of what Chris just said, I don’t know if any of us have the formula, but the way has to be found to meet, satisfy, respond to the grievances of the Sunnis, who comprise as I said earlier, about 70 percent of Syria and roughly 25 percent or thereabouts of Iraq. That is probably a political and diplomatic job. The U.N. is hacking away at it, not too successfully. Someone needs to put together a strategy that might in the case of Syria combine some military pressure with some intense, what I called at one point, “heroic diplomatic activity.”

One nightmare we haven’t talked about: What if ISIL gets into Damascus? That would be the ultimate nightmare. We talked about in various places the possibility of getting into Baghdad. Assad is weakening, and you don’t want that regime to come to that end; you want that to come to some other end that we have some control over.

MC: Kim, Jeb Bush was confronted at a campaign event by a young woman who said , “Your brother created ISIS.” Her theory was that disbanding the Iraqi military in 2003 was the worst decision here, in that the Islamic State relies heavily on the expertise of these disenfranchised former Baathist Iraqi military guys. Does that still resonate as a kind of tragic mistake, setting these well-trained military guys loose on the country?

KK: President Bush made mistakes, quite a lot of them, in 2003. But I think that focusing on the idea of an original sin to assign blame takes us away from what the discussion in Washington must be right now. We are in 2015—we face a threat in Iraq, in Syria, indeed a global threat in ISIL, we face a global threat in Al Qaeda and its affiliates, and our discussion in Washington needs to move away from discussion of blame, responsibility and original sin, and focus on what should come.

One question is: Is Iraq lost? It is a supposition of this discussion that someone is responsible for losing Iraq. We still as the United States of America, the Iraqis still, the world still has opportunities to shape and change the situation, such that the question of who lost Iraq shouldn’t be on our minds. The question on our minds should be: How is it that we, the United States, can construct a strategy that will bring sufficient security to the Middle East that our own interests and our own homeland are no longer threatened to this degree?

national_defense,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12387600/susan-rice-vox,Think the world is on fire? Obama’s national security adviser says things are better than ever.,2016-08-18,Zack Beauchamp,"Between ISIS attacks , Russian aggression in Syria and Ukraine , and Brexit , it can feel a lot like the world has been falling apart these past few years .
So it ’ s surprising — and perhaps a little disconcerting — to learn that Susan Rice , President Barack Obama ’ s national security adviser , is actually optimistic about the state of the world right now .
`` This is a much more hopeful and positive period in history than we have seen certainly in our lifetimes , '' she told me in early August when I sat down with her in the White House to talk about the Obama administration ’ s foreign policy . `` I tell my kids this : that they couldn ’ t be luckier to be living in this world at this time . ''
It ’ s easy to dismiss this as simple happy talk from an administration defending its foreign policy record . But this optimistic view is central to how the Obama administration views the world — and is also at the heart of one of the central contradictions of Obama ’ s foreign policy .
Team Obama sees themselves not just in terms of the crisis of the day but also in terms of a much broader , and more positive , arc of human history . They didn ’ t create these trends that make this , in their eyes , the best time in human history to be alive , but they see it as their job to safeguard them .
`` Compare the era we ’ re living in today to the losses we suffered in World War II or even in the Vietnam War ''
This results in a foreign policy focused — to a degree most people don ’ t appreciate — on protecting this system from threats . The long view causes them to focus on addressing long-term threats to the system ’ s stability , like climate change or a nuclear Iran . But the flip side is that they ’ re more wary about trying to solve immediate crises , like the Syrian civil war .
These crises , while bad , don ’ t threaten the fundamental system . And ambitious schemes to solve them risk dragging the US into costly and counterproductive quagmires that could draw focus and resources away from graver dangers .
`` ISIS is not an existential threat to the United States , '' Obama once told the Atlantic ’ s Jeffrey Goldberg . `` Climate change is a potential existential threat to the entire world if we don ’ t do something about it . ''
Their approach has had its share of successes , but they ’ ve never managed to explain it to voters without seeming out of touch — see , for example , Obama ’ s now-infamous comments labeling ISIS the `` JV team '' of terrorism . Only two polls of Americans in the past year have given Obama neutral or positive marks on foreign policy — even as his overall approval ratings have risen .
The result is a sharp tension at the heart of the Obama administration ’ s foreign policy . Team Obama tries to take the long view , and occasionally succeeds — see the Paris climate change agreement or the Iran nuclear deal . But the issues that command attention from both the American public and American allies often are more immediate , and require the Obama administration to divert resources toward daily crises that they would prefer to mostly ignore . These issues , like Syria , have come to define Team Obama ’ s time in office in the public eye .
So you get an administration that wants to pivot to Asia but ends up leading a war on ISIS . An administration that touts the long-term decline in violence but looks feckless when it comes to Syria . An administration that ’ s surprisingly honest about the limited threat terrorism poses to American lives but ends up focusing on it anyway .
What I wanted to understand in talking to Rice was this : How does the Obama administration think about this contradiction ? What don ’ t they think people get about their view of the world getting better , and how do they manage the tension between what the American people want and what they think America needs ?
The basic starting point , according to Rice , is that the world is better than it ever has been — and it ’ s getting better still :
We are in an era where , as the president has often said , if you didn ’ t know who you were going to be , or whether you were going to be male or female ; white , black , Asian , Native American , Latino , [ or ] something else ; if you didn ’ t know if you were going to be straight or gay — if you didn ’ t know anything about who you were going to be and you had to pick a time in which to be born… You would pick this time . Because the odds of success for any individual are much higher in the aggregate than they ’ ve ever been .
Rice ’ s support for this theory was a series of rattled-off metrics .
`` More people are free of poverty than ever before , conflict between states is less than ever before , technology is providing extraordinary opportunities for advancement , and health and agriculture and well-being , '' Rice says . `` Compare the era we ’ re living in today to the losses we suffered in World War II or even in the Vietnam War , or compare the economic challenges we face now to the Great Depression . ''
Rice is right on the evidence . The number of people living at $ 1.25 per day or less declined by roughly 1.1 billion people between 1990 and 2015 . The number of war deaths per 100,000 people worldwide has increased in the past three years , owing largely to the war in Syria , but is still far lower than it was even 20 years ago . Average global life expectancy worldwide was 48 in 1950 ; it was 71.4 in 2015 .
Obama and his advisers see these improvements as the product of a network of global institutions and dominant ideas — things like the global free trade regime , the United Nations , America ’ s alliance networks in Europe and East Asia , and the like . They believe this basic international order has worked to make the world a much better place than it ’ s ever been .
Because Team Obama sees the world ’ s basic institutions through this very positive lens , they ’ re focused on protecting them . The most important foreign policy task , for Team Obama , is to make sure the world keeps getting better .
That means , first and foremost , protecting the current system from things that threaten it .
`` We can renew the international system that has enabled so much progress , or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back by an undertow of instability , '' Obama said in a 2014 address to the United Nations . `` We can shape the course of this century , as our predecessors shaped the post-World War II age . ''
Think about the Obama administration ’ s stated priorities over the years : the pivot to Asia , the push for global climate change agreements , the nuclear negotiations with Iran . Each was designed to address something that could at least theoretically threaten important parts of the system : a conflict-ridden relationship with China , catastrophic climate change , a nuclear Iran .
In those cases , the Obama administration was willing to take risks and spearhead ambitious new policy initiatives , because the tail risk of inaction was extremely high .
The administration is less willing to act , by contrast , when it comes to immediate crises — significant problems that nonetheless don ’ t pose systemic threats . The Obama administration has been very wary of getting pulled into a major involvement in Syria , for example , or a large-scale troop deployment to fight ISIS .
That ’ s because they see both US military strength and political influence as key institutions that help make the world better . `` For all of our warts , the United States has clearly been a force for good in the world . If you compare us to previous superpowers , we act less on the basis of naked self-interest , and have been interested in establishing norms that benefit everyone , '' Obama told Goldberg .
As a result , they ’ re hesitant of risky schemes that expend both , seeing them as potential quagmires that risk squandering that important influence on secondary concerns .
`` For the president , Iraq was the defining issue , '' Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told the New Yorker ’ s David Remnick . `` We spent a trillion dollars in Iraq and had troops there for a decade , and you can ’ t say it wielded positive influence . ''
Contrast this with the Bush administration . After 9/11 , the administration concluded the world wasn ’ t actually trending in a better direction . Jihadism threatened civilization itself , and a radical new approach was necessary to address the threat .
That means the Bush administration was willing try out more high-risk policies , like invading Iraq and attempting to transform it into a democracy at gunpoint . The Obama administration , because it thinks things are generally going well , can afford to be a bit more conservative . They don ’ t need to try to create utopias , because they think we ’ re on the road to one .
If this outlook reminds you a bit of Francis Fukuyama ’ s `` End of History '' thesis — the idea that history is trending , inexorably , toward a kind of liberal democratic utopia — well , that might not be such a shock .
When I asked Rice what she thought of Fukuyama , she had some nice things to say ( a rarity in an era when Fukuyama is more mocked for missing the rise of Islamism and the financial crisis than anything else ) .
`` I actually am a fan of Francis Fukuyama , '' she said . `` I am an optimist , and I see our future as bright . ''
But the American public doesn ’ t share the Obama administration ’ s point of view . They don ’ t see a world where everything is getting better ; they look at terrorist attacks and civil wars and see a world on fire . This makes it very difficult for the administration to foreground its long-term vision and priorities , even at the times when it might want to .
This is a point the president himself acknowledged , somewhat implicitly , in an interview with ███ ’ s Matt Yglesias last year .
`` There 's just not going to be a lot of interest in a headline story that we have cut infant mortality by really significant amounts over the last 20 years or that extreme poverty has been slashed or that there 's been enormous progress with a program we set up when I first came into office to help poor farmers increase productivity and yields , '' Obama said .
I asked Rice why she thinks their view of long-term progress doesn ’ t really resonate with the public . The first thing she said was , more or less , that Americans are kind of ignorant of how much better things have gotten .
`` What I would say is , certainly in this country — I won ’ t speak for the rest of the world — I think there is an absence of historical perspective , which is partly a function of our education and it ’ s partly a function of our public leaders , '' she says . `` People don ’ t look back and even say , you know , ‘ Remember World War II , and just how incredibly convulsive that period was ? ’ Or the Great Depression . Or even the 1960s . ''
The issue , she thinks , isn ’ t that Americans are dumb ; it ’ s that basic trends in 21st-century media , security , and economics make it very difficult for ordinary Americans to develop this sense of perspective .
Start with media and security . The constant drumbeat of terrorist attacks globally , together with new technology that makes it astonishingly easy for people to follow news anywhere , allows terrible breaking news to drown out less sexy but more significant global trends . That makes people feel scared , not satisfied , with the state of the world .
`` These relatively small-scale but horrific and deadly terrorist attacks that have come with a degree of frequency as of late , in the wake of [ ISIS ’ s ] rise … understandably have people very uneasy and unnerved , '' Rice says . `` What happens in any corner of the world is on the iPhone of any individual in any other part of the world , so we have much greater awareness of all that is happening in various different places that may be upsetting or disconcerting or downright scary . ''
`` The threat to Americans from terrorism is less than the threat to die in car accidents ''
Economics plays a similar role . While the world may have gotten better for a lot of people , particularly in the developing world , many Americans just haven ’ t seen similar gains . Some , particularly those working in sectors like manufacturing , have experienced serious losses .
Rice links these losses to globalization and technological development . `` We are dealing with some dislocations that have come from the disparities that have arisen as a result of globalization and in the need to adjust to new patterns of trade and investment to deal with technology , '' she says .
Once again , she ’ s not wrong . One widely cited study found that the growth of China ’ s manufacturing sector cost the US about a million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2007 . Automation likely played an even bigger role than globalization in destroying blue-collar American jobs .
What ’ s interesting is that these same factors were responsible for the global progress Rice had just been touting . China ’ s economic growth , powered by the manufacturing sector , was responsible for a huge amount of the global decline in extreme poverty . Technological advancement has been instrumental in curing diseases and making basic goods available to even the world ’ s poorest people .
Yet the harms are more salient to a lot of Americans than the benefits . The fact that there ’ s dramatically less extreme poverty in China doesn ’ t really register on a daily level . Nobody walks around thinking , `` I ’ m so thankful to NATO for helping prevent World War III . '' Economic pain among real Americans you know feels a lot more immediate and tangible , even if these harms are outweighed by the aggregate gains .
That makes it very hard for the administration to sell its big-picture vision without seeming like it ’ s being condescending or missing the point in practice . You can talk all you want about solving climate change or managing China ’ s rise peacefully — but it ’ s terrorism , Syria , and the US economy that voters really care about .
This conflict , between the administration ’ s worldview and public perceptions , leads to a deep internal tension in the Obama administration policy .
The Asia pivot , the attempt to refocus US foreign policy away from the Middle East and toward East Asia , is a good example . This fits squarely with the Obama administration ’ s worldview : The rise of China really is far more important for the stability of global institutions than most anything going on in the Middle East . Yet Obama ’ s foreign policy was consumed by managing the post–Arab Spring crisis .
This owes , in part , to fears of terrorism — a broader issue that illuminates the basic tension between Team Obama ’ s aspirations and policy . The Obama administration is in the weird position of investing heavily in fighting a threat that they all but openly acknowledge isn ’ t that severe — because people think it ’ s scarier than it is , and the administration can ’ t persuade them otherwise .
From a world historical view , terrorism barely registers as a problem . In 2015 , fewer people were killed by terrorists worldwide than were murdered in the United States alone . Jihadist terrorists , the ones people worry about the most , have demonstrated zero ability to take and hold territory . ISIS has come the closest , but its territorial empire is shrinking and now is widely expected to collapse .
Despite this , the administration has spent tremendous amounts of money — at least $ 100 billion per year , by one expert estimate — on counterterrorism . This amount of resources in the past eight years is kind of at odds with the Obama administration ’ s eye toward the things that really matter in the long run .
I asked Rice how she could justify this given that roughly as many Americans are killed per year by their own furniture as they are by terrorists . ( This is true ; it falls on them by accident . )
`` It ’ s more than a question of how many lives are taken ''
In objective terms , Rice admits , the threat to American lives really isn ’ t that high : `` You are correct that the threat to Americans from terrorism is less than the threat to die in car accidents , to die of the flu , or any number of things we could list . ''
However , she said , terrorism poses a particular threat to the lives of American service members and diplomats , to whom we owe special duties . `` When we have embassies around the world , we have American citizens traveling around the world , when we have American servicemen and women deployed around the world , that is part of our way of life and it is part of who we are and who we aim to be as Americans , '' she says .
Rice ’ s other argument for aggressively fighting terrorism is more interesting : Terrorism isn ’ t just a threat because it kills people . Successful attacks bring broader social consequences for American society and the economy .
`` The threat , I would argue , has got to be measured not only in the number of lives but in the risk that it poses to our economy , our social cohesion , our international presence , and our leadership , '' she says . `` It ’ s more than a question of how many lives are taken . ''
What Rice didn ’ t say is that these consequences are all the result of irrational overreaction to terrorism — which is the conclusion implied by her own analysis .
If , objectively speaking , terrorism doesn ’ t kill very many Americans , attacks really shouldn ’ t have a major effect on the US economy or people ’ s attitudes toward their fellow Muslim citizens . And yet people panic out of proportion to the body count , prompting market losses , expensive security policies , and a surge in Islamophobia .
While Obama , Rice , and other leading officials talk a lot about the big foreign policy picture , the truth is that no administration can afford to govern solely by looking at the long arc of history .
Rice and Obama are ultimately constrained by the public ’ s priorities . If people care about terrorism more than they care about China or climate change , then you can ’ t prioritize China or climate change over terrorism . Battles with jihadist groups will , inevitably , become a more defining element of the administration ’ s foreign policy ( at least in the here and now ) .
Sometimes , the tension between the Obama worldview and the demands of practical politics ends up making the administration look a little foolish . Syria is , perhaps , the most glaring case in point .
Since the civil war began in 2011 , the Obama administration has been deeply wary of getting pulled into an Iraq or Vietnam-style quagmire there . Yet they knew , at the same time , that they couldn ’ t simply stand by and watch a country collapse
The result was a policy that attempted to influence the course of the conflict without getting deeply involved . The most famous example was Obama ’ s `` red line '' for intervention , the use of chemical weapons . Obama was trying to use the threat of American force to head off the actual use of force in Syria .
When Bashar al-Assad brazenly crossed that line , gassing hundreds in the town of Ghouta in August 2013 , the Obama administration initially announced a plan to respond with force . But the president ultimately decided against enforcing his own red line , going to Congress to ask for legal authorization ( a vote that would likely fail ) .
His reasoning for the policy shift , as laid out in the Goldberg interview , is perhaps the purest case of his long game worldview trumping calls to manage a short-term crisis . Obama believes , very strongly , that for the United States to preserve its ability to shape the world for the better , it needs to stay out of unnecessary and counterproductive conflicts .
His decision to avoid sliding into Syria , in his mind , isn ’ t just about one conflict : It was prioritizing the maintenance of a key global institution over trying to ameliorate a crisis , even though it made him look bad .
`` I ’ m very proud of this moment , '' he told Goldberg . `` The fact that I was able to pull back from the immediate pressures and think through in my own mind what was in America ’ s interest , not only with respect to Syria but also with respect to our democracy , was as tough a decision as I ’ ve made — and I believe ultimately it was the right decision to make . ''
This decision seemed incoherent , even weak : Why would Obama go back on his own red line ? But in Obama ’ s mind , this was helping to cement one of his most critical big picture goals : Protecting American influence and power from the impulse to squander it on short-term crises .
This kind of tradeoff , in many ways , will come to define the Obama administration ’ s legacy . If they are right , and the world ’ s institutions continue to deliver a progressively better world despite current upheavals , they may well look prescient . But if they are wrong , and these institutions begin to falter , their legacy will look decidedly less positive .
That ’ s the trouble with the long game : In the short run , you can ’ t really be sure if it paid off .","Between ISIS attacks, Russian aggression in Syria and Ukraine, and Brexit, it can feel a lot like the world has been falling apart these past few years.

So it’s surprising — and perhaps a little disconcerting — to learn that Susan Rice, President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, is actually optimistic about the state of the world right now.

""This is a much more hopeful and positive period in history than we have seen certainly in our lifetimes,"" she told me in early August when I sat down with her in the White House to talk about the Obama administration’s foreign policy. ""I tell my kids this: that they couldn’t be luckier to be living in this world at this time.""

It’s easy to dismiss this as simple happy talk from an administration defending its foreign policy record. But this optimistic view is central to how the Obama administration views the world — and is also at the heart of one of the central contradictions of Obama’s foreign policy.

Team Obama sees themselves not just in terms of the crisis of the day but also in terms of a much broader, and more positive, arc of human history. They didn’t create these trends that make this, in their eyes, the best time in human history to be alive, but they see it as their job to safeguard them.

""Compare the era we’re living in today to the losses we suffered in World War II or even in the Vietnam War""

This results in a foreign policy focused — to a degree most people don’t appreciate — on protecting this system from threats. The long view causes them to focus on addressing long-term threats to the system’s stability, like climate change or a nuclear Iran. But the flip side is that they’re more wary about trying to solve immediate crises, like the Syrian civil war.

These crises, while bad, don’t threaten the fundamental system. And ambitious schemes to solve them risk dragging the US into costly and counterproductive quagmires that could draw focus and resources away from graver dangers.

""ISIS is not an existential threat to the United States,"" Obama once told the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg. ""Climate change is a potential existential threat to the entire world if we don’t do something about it.""

Their approach has had its share of successes, but they’ve never managed to explain it to voters without seeming out of touch — see, for example, Obama’s now-infamous comments labeling ISIS the ""JV team"" of terrorism. Only two polls of Americans in the past year have given Obama neutral or positive marks on foreign policy — even as his overall approval ratings have risen.

The result is a sharp tension at the heart of the Obama administration’s foreign policy. Team Obama tries to take the long view, and occasionally succeeds — see the Paris climate change agreement or the Iran nuclear deal. But the issues that command attention from both the American public and American allies often are more immediate, and require the Obama administration to divert resources toward daily crises that they would prefer to mostly ignore. These issues, like Syria, have come to define Team Obama’s time in office in the public eye.

So you get an administration that wants to pivot to Asia but ends up leading a war on ISIS. An administration that touts the long-term decline in violence but looks feckless when it comes to Syria. An administration that’s surprisingly honest about the limited threat terrorism poses to American lives but ends up focusing on it anyway.

What I wanted to understand in talking to Rice was this: How does the Obama administration think about this contradiction? What don’t they think people get about their view of the world getting better, and how do they manage the tension between what the American people want and what they think America needs?

How the Obama administration sees the world

The basic starting point, according to Rice, is that the world is better than it ever has been — and it’s getting better still:

We are in an era where, as the president has often said, if you didn’t know who you were going to be, or whether you were going to be male or female; white, black, Asian, Native American, Latino, [or] something else; if you didn’t know if you were going to be straight or gay — if you didn’t know anything about who you were going to be and you had to pick a time in which to be born… You would pick this time. Because the odds of success for any individual are much higher in the aggregate than they’ve ever been.

Rice’s support for this theory was a series of rattled-off metrics.

""More people are free of poverty than ever before, conflict between states is less than ever before, technology is providing extraordinary opportunities for advancement, and health and agriculture and well-being,"" Rice says. ""Compare the era we’re living in today to the losses we suffered in World War II or even in the Vietnam War, or compare the economic challenges we face now to the Great Depression.""

Rice is right on the evidence. The number of people living at $1.25 per day or less declined by roughly 1.1 billion people between 1990 and 2015. The number of war deaths per 100,000 people worldwide has increased in the past three years, owing largely to the war in Syria, but is still far lower than it was even 20 years ago. Average global life expectancy worldwide was 48 in 1950; it was 71.4 in 2015.

Obama and his advisers see these improvements as the product of a network of global institutions and dominant ideas — things like the global free trade regime, the United Nations, America’s alliance networks in Europe and East Asia, and the like. They believe this basic international order has worked to make the world a much better place than it’s ever been.

Because Team Obama sees the world’s basic institutions through this very positive lens, they’re focused on protecting them. The most important foreign policy task, for Team Obama, is to make sure the world keeps getting better.

That means, first and foremost, protecting the current system from things that threaten it.

""We can renew the international system that has enabled so much progress, or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back by an undertow of instability,"" Obama said in a 2014 address to the United Nations. ""We can shape the course of this century, as our predecessors shaped the post-World War II age.""

Think about the Obama administration’s stated priorities over the years: the pivot to Asia, the push for global climate change agreements, the nuclear negotiations with Iran. Each was designed to address something that could at least theoretically threaten important parts of the system: a conflict-ridden relationship with China, catastrophic climate change, a nuclear Iran.

In those cases, the Obama administration was willing to take risks and spearhead ambitious new policy initiatives, because the tail risk of inaction was extremely high.

The administration is less willing to act, by contrast, when it comes to immediate crises — significant problems that nonetheless don’t pose systemic threats. The Obama administration has been very wary of getting pulled into a major involvement in Syria, for example, or a large-scale troop deployment to fight ISIS.

""I actually am a fan of Francis Fukuyama""

That’s because they see both US military strength and political influence as key institutions that help make the world better. ""For all of our warts, the United States has clearly been a force for good in the world. If you compare us to previous superpowers, we act less on the basis of naked self-interest, and have been interested in establishing norms that benefit everyone,"" Obama told Goldberg.

As a result, they’re hesitant of risky schemes that expend both, seeing them as potential quagmires that risk squandering that important influence on secondary concerns.

""For the president, Iraq was the defining issue,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told the New Yorker’s David Remnick. ""We spent a trillion dollars in Iraq and had troops there for a decade, and you can’t say it wielded positive influence.""

Contrast this with the Bush administration. After 9/11, the administration concluded the world wasn’t actually trending in a better direction. Jihadism threatened civilization itself, and a radical new approach was necessary to address the threat.

That means the Bush administration was willing try out more high-risk policies, like invading Iraq and attempting to transform it into a democracy at gunpoint. The Obama administration, because it thinks things are generally going well, can afford to be a bit more conservative. They don’t need to try to create utopias, because they think we’re on the road to one.

If this outlook reminds you a bit of Francis Fukuyama’s ""End of History"" thesis — the idea that history is trending, inexorably, toward a kind of liberal democratic utopia — well, that might not be such a shock.

When I asked Rice what she thought of Fukuyama, she had some nice things to say (a rarity in an era when Fukuyama is more mocked for missing the rise of Islamism and the financial crisis than anything else).

""I actually am a fan of Francis Fukuyama,"" she said. ""I am an optimist, and I see our future as bright.""

Why people don’t see the same progress Obama does

But the American public doesn’t share the Obama administration’s point of view. They don’t see a world where everything is getting better; they look at terrorist attacks and civil wars and see a world on fire. This makes it very difficult for the administration to foreground its long-term vision and priorities, even at the times when it might want to.

This is a point the president himself acknowledged, somewhat implicitly, in an interview with Vox’s Matt Yglesias last year.

How this tension plays out in practice

This conflict, between the administration’s worldview and public perceptions, leads to a deep internal tension in the Obama administration policy.

The Asia pivot, the attempt to refocus US foreign policy away from the Middle East and toward East Asia, is a good example. This fits squarely with the Obama administration’s worldview: The rise of China really is far more important for the stability of global institutions than most anything going on in the Middle East.

national_defense,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/feb/19/john-rood-top-pentagon-official-resign/,Top Pentagon official John Rood to resign,2020-02-19,"Mike Glenn, Ben Wolfgang","The Pentagon ’ s top policy official was pushed out of his job Wednesday at the direct request of President Trump , marking the latest senior defense official to leave his post in the last six months amid tensions over the extent of White House influence in military affairs .
John C. Rood , who has served as the Pentagon ’ s under secretary of defense for policy since January 2018 , formally resigned Wednesday , effective at the end of the month . Mr. Rood , a former Lockheed Martin executive who previously held posts at the State Department and Capitol Hill , signed off on the military aid package to Ukraine in early 2019 that became the central pillar in Mr. Trump ’ s subsequent impeachment trial .
Mr. Rood ’ s resignation came amid reports of clashes with other top foreign policy officials inside the Pentagon and at the White House .
Mr. Trump said little other than to wish Mr. Rood well .
“ I would like to thank John Rood for his service to our Country , and wish him well in his future endeavors ! ” Mr. Trump tweeted .
But in his resignation letter , Mr. Rood made clear that Mr. Trump actively sought to remove him from the position .
“ It ’ s my understanding from Secretary Esper that you requested my resignation … , ” reads the letter , a copy of which was obtained by The ███ . “ Senior administration officials appointed by the President serve at the pleasure of the President , and therefore , as you have requested , I am providing my resignation effective February 28 , 2020 . ”
James Anderson , the acting deputy under secretary of defense for policy , will take over Mr. Rood ’ s duties .
The departure is just the latest management challenge for Mr. Esper , who like a number of Cabinet secretaries has struggled to keep both his boss in the White House and the huge bureaucracy he leads at the Pentagon happy .
Mr. Rood ’ s resignation comes just weeks after Mr. Trump also fired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman , the top Ukraine expert at the White House ’ s National Security Council . Lt. Col. Vindman testified in the House ’ s impeachment proceedings on the president ’ s notorious July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky . Mr. Trump has openly hinted he expects the Pentagon to deal with Lt. Col. Vindman ’ s conduct .
Mr. Rood ’ s departure also marks at least the sixth top Pentagon official to step down over just the past six months , creating another major gap in the Defense Department ’ s leadership structure .

John C. Rood, who has served as the Pentagon’s under secretary of defense for policy since January 2018, formally resigned Wednesday, effective at the end of the month. Mr. Rood, a former Lockheed Martin executive who previously held posts at the State Department and Capitol Hill, signed off on the military aid package to Ukraine in early 2019 that became the central pillar in Mr. Trump’s subsequent impeachment trial.

Mr. Rood’s resignation came amid reports of clashes with other top foreign policy officials inside the Pentagon and at the White House.

Mr. Trump said little other than to wish Mr. Rood well.

“I would like to thank John Rood for his service to our Country, and wish him well in his future endeavors!” Mr. Trump tweeted.

But in his resignation letter, Mr. Rood made clear that Mr. Trump actively sought to remove him from the position.

“It’s my understanding from Secretary Esper that you requested my resignation …,” reads the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times. “Senior administration officials appointed by the President serve at the pleasure of the President, and therefore, as you have requested, I am providing my resignation effective February 28, 2020.”

James Anderson, the acting deputy under secretary of defense for policy, will take over Mr. Rood’s duties.

The departure is just the latest management challenge for Mr. Esper, who like a number of Cabinet secretaries has struggled to keep both his boss in the White House and the huge bureaucracy he leads at the Pentagon happy.

Mr. Rood’s resignation comes just weeks after Mr. Trump also fired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the White House’s National Security Council. Lt. Col. Vindman testified in the House’s impeachment proceedings on the president’s notorious July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Trump has openly hinted he expects the Pentagon to deal with Lt. Col. Vindman’s conduct.

Mr. Rood’s departure also marks at least the sixth top Pentagon official to step down over just the past six months, creating another major gap in the Defense Department’s leadership structure.

More broadly, however, analysts say the incident underscores Mr. Trump’s willingness to involve himself in the inner workings of the military, and to act when he feels his priorities are not being addressed.

In addition to moving billions of dollars once again from Pentagon projects to fund his U.S.-Mexico border wall, the president also faces allegations that he directly intervened in the military’s “war cloud” contract, pushing the Defense Department to award the $10 billion, 10-year deal to Microsoft rather than Amazon Web Services.

The blast is temporarily deafening and the shock knocks people to their knees.

Those able to pull themselves up describe a disorienting moment of stillness—a ringing in their ears that drowns out the chaos, the shattered bones and the crumbling of nearby buildings into a dusty mess of rebar and brick. But the quiet, like a slow motion scene in a movie, quickly gives way to confusion and frenetic activity; the ringing gives way to a blurring amalgamation of screaming and sirens.

This scene is too frequent, familiar as an al Qaeda (AQ) tactic, and again with its newest incarnation, ISIS. Headlines are dominated by ever-ruthless brutality, senseless violence, and unspeakable injustice, the audaciousness of which leaves us baffled.

This isn’t really new. Genghis Khan’s audacity and brutality unnerved his foes into submission.

But part of it is very new.

Although tiny compared to the Mongol hordes, operating with apparent orchestrated synergy, ISIS is seemingly everywhere. Deft battlefield advances interwoven with terrorist strikes create a frightening kinetic reality that flies and multiplies across 21st century connectivity to assault our senses and undermine our confidence. Like savvy investors, ISIS uses speed and digital leverage to geometrically increase their perceived power.

And in war, perception is reality.

We—the U.S. government, international community, and forces on the ground—have all the tools and resources required to defeat ISIS and any of its future manifestations. What we don’t have is an organized, unified approach and structure to harness our collective will, resources, personnel, equipment, intelligence, policy, and diplomatic efforts to defeat them. Success demands connecting an ever-dispersed and intricate organization into a Team of Teams.

In our fight against al Qaeda in Iraq in 2004, we found our elite team—with world-class technology, training, and intelligence—was losing to a comparatively ragtag group. We pulled all the traditional levers—more personnel, raids, and intelligence—to no avail. The ringing in our ears was too frequent, too disorienting.

The solution, we discovered, was internal.

Faced with a 21st century threat, we faced the hard realization that being a great team was not enough. We learned through painful trial and error the necessity of transforming into a system that mirrored the speed and interconnectedness of the distributed networks we were facing.

We—the U.S. government, international community, and forces on the ground—have all the tools and resources required to defeat ISIS and any of its future manifestations. What we don’t have is an organized, unified approach and structure to harness our collective will, resources, personnel, equipment, intelligence, policy, and diplomatic efforts to defeat them. Success demands connecting an ever-dispersed and intricate organization into a Team of Teams.

This will require a fundamental shift in the way we organize ourselves; the traditional command and control structures of large organizations like the government, military, or corporations were developed to provide order and efficiency at scale. But this comes at cost of speed and decentralized decision-making. Even in a hierarchical command of teams, decisions tend to be made at higher levels.

Bolton has written a memoir of his time in the White House under Trump titled “ The Room Where It Happened. ” The book is scheduled for release on Tuesday , though many excerpts have already appeared in the press .
A South Korean security official says that Bolton ’ s version of the events surrounding three U.S.-North Korea summits that took place from June 2018-June 2019 is “ distorted. ” In his book , Bolton claims that South Korean President Moon Jae-in set unrealistic expectations for the talks while pursuing his own agenda to unify the Korean peninsula . Bolton describes Moon as “ schizophrenic , ” according to Reuters .
“ It does not reflect accurate facts and substantially distorts facts , ” South Korea national security adviser Chung Eui-yong said , adding that Bolton ’ s published account of internal deliberations between the heads of state set a “ dangerous precedent . ”
“ Unilaterally publishing consultations made based on mutual trust violates the basic principles of diplomacy and could severely damage future negotiations , ” Chung said .
Trump has responded forcefully to the book , denying its claims and attacking Bolton as a “ wacko . ”
“ Wacko John Bolton ’ s ‘ exceedingly tedious ’ … book is made up of lies [ and ] fake stories . Said all good about me , in print , until the day I fired him . A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war . Never had a clue , was ostracized [ and ] happily dumped . What a dope ! ” Trump tweeted on last week , quoting a New York Times review critical of Bolton ’ s book .
The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the book from being published , claiming that Bolton violated rules against publishing classified information . Copies of the book have already been released to the press , however , so the lawsuit is largely moot for the sake of protecting any privileged information .
D.C . Circuit Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled in the case on Saturday denying a Trump administration request to block the book ’ s publishing date . Lamberth also warned Bolton that if the former national security adviser did not receive approval from the administration before publishing the book , he could forfeit his $ 2 million book advance and possibly more .
“ Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States , ” Lamberth wrote in his decision , according to The New York Times . “ He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil ( and potentially criminal ) liability . But these facts do not control the motion before the court . The government has failed to establish that an injunction will prevent irreparable harm . ”
Trump cheered the ruling , tweeted that it was a “ BIG COURT WIN against Bolton . ”
“ Bolton broke the law and has been called out and rebuked for so doing , with a really big price to pay . He likes dropping bombs on people , and killing them . Now he will have bombs dropped on him ! ” Trump said .

McCain out of sight during President Trump's visit,2019-06-01,,"WASHINGTON – The U.S , Navy acknowledged Saturday it had received a request to shield a U.S. warship bearing the name of former political rival John McCain from President Donald Trump 's view during the commander-in-chief 's visit to Japan last week – but did not comply .
“ A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain , however , all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President ’ s visit , '' according to a statement from Rear Adm. Charlie Brown , Chief of Navy Information , that the Pentagon released .
The one-paragraph statement did not mention who made the request and a Pentagon spokesperson did not respond to a request for further information .
In his statement , Brown also said there were `` no intentional efforts '' to exclude sailors on the McCain from attending the president 's address on Memorial day aboard the USS Wasp at Yokosuka Naval Base , south of Tokyo . The McCain is docked there for repairs .
The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that White House officials wanted the guided-missile destroyer to be kept `` out of sight '' during Trump 's visit to Japan , apparently fearful that the president would be upset at having to see the name of the late Arizona senator , a frequent target of the president 's anger .
The ship was named after McCain 's father and grandfather , both decorated admirals . The Navy added the name of Sen. McCain , a prisoner of war in Vietnam who emerged from captivity a war hero , to the ship in 2018 , according to the Journal .
Trump on Thursday said he had no knowledge of the request to keep the ship from view , saying , `` I would never do a thing like that . '' He described the aides that made the request as `` well meaning . ''
McCain 's daughter weighs in : Meghan McCain calls out Trump on warship controversy , says troops 'afraid ' to show her father 's name
'Tremendous disservice ' : President Donald Trump on the late Sen. John McCain : 'He did the nation a tremendous disservice '
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced Thursday that he asked his chief of staff to investigate what was behind obscuring the name of the USS John McCain during President Donald Trump 's visit to Japan .
`` The Navy is fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by the Secretary of Defense , '' Brown said in the statement released by the Pentagon .","USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – The U.S, Navy acknowledged Saturday it had received a request to shield a U.S. warship bearing the name of former political rival John McCain from President Donald Trump's view during the commander-in-chief's visit to Japan last week – but did not comply.

“A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President’s visit,"" according to a statement from Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, Chief of Navy Information, that the Pentagon released.

The one-paragraph statement did not mention who made the request and a Pentagon spokesperson did not respond to a request for further information.

In his statement, Brown also said there were ""no intentional efforts"" to exclude sailors on the McCain from attending the president's address on Memorial day aboard the USS Wasp at Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo. The McCain is docked there for repairs.

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that White House officials wanted the guided-missile destroyer to be kept ""out of sight"" during Trump's visit to Japan, apparently fearful that the president would be upset at having to see the name of the late Arizona senator, a frequent target of the president's anger.

The ship was named after McCain's father and grandfather, both decorated admirals. The Navy added the name of Sen. McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam who emerged from captivity a war hero, to the ship in 2018, according to the Journal.

Trump on Thursday said he had no knowledge of the request to keep the ship from view, saying, ""I would never do a thing like that."" He described the aides that made the request as ""well meaning.""

With 134 Republican members of the GOP-controlled House now signed on to a bill that would create a select committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks , Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , seethed that U.S. national security has “ deteriorated ” under President Obama ’ s watch .
“ If Benghazi is not an example of system failure before , during and after the attack , what would be ? ” asked Mr. Graham . “ If Boston is not an example of a pre-9/11 stovepiping mentality , what would be ? ”
Mr. Graham made the remarks on a day when Mr. Obama told reporters that he was unaware of recent accusations by Benghazi whistleblowers that they were being intimidated by the administration over their cooperation with congressional investigators .
While Mr. Obama pledged to look into the matter , State Department officials vowed closer communication with Congress about Benghazi while seeking to discredit a media report that claimed someone in the administration warned CIA and State Department officials not to speak out about the incident .
When asked about the report , Secretary of State John F. Kerry responded that “ there ’ s an enormous amount of misinformation out there ” and that he was appointing his own chief of staff , David Wade , to work directly with lawmakers in an effort to answer any questions related to the Benghazi attack , in which U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed .
“ We have to demythologize this issue and certainly depoliticize it , ” said Mr. Kerry . “ The American people deserve answers . I ’ m determined that this will be an accountable and open State Department as it has been in the past , and we will continue to do that , and we will provide answers . ”
Later Tuesday , another State Department official took on a dismissive posture toward a report Monday by Fox News . In the report , Washington power lawyer Victoria Toensing said she is representing a State Department employee who has been threatened by unidentified Obama administration officials not to cooperate with lawmakers seeking to keep the Benghazi attack in the headlines .
“ The State Department would never tolerate or sanction retaliation against whistleblowers on any issue , including this one , ” said the department ’ s deputy spokesman , Patrick Ventrell . “ That ’ s an obligation we take very seriously . ”
Mrs. Toensing , a former Justice Department official and former Republican counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , also told Fox that at least four career officials at the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency have retained attorneys or are in the process of doing so , as they prepare to provide sensitive information about the Benghazi attack to lawmakers on Capitol Hill .
Her claims appeared to dovetail with a letter written Friday to Mr. Kerry by Rep. Darrell E. Issa , California Republican , suggesting that the State Department is deliberately making it difficult for private lawyers to achieve security clearances needed for the lawyers to represent department officials .
“ In each case , witnesses may need to share sensitive or classified information with their lawyers , ” wrote Mr. Issa , the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . “ The Department ’ s unwillingness to make the process for clearing an attorney more transparent appears to be an effort to interfere with the rights of employees to furnish information to Congress . ”
But Mr. Ventrell on Tuesday said that the department ’ s leadership was “ not aware of any employees who have requested … security clearances for private attorneys in connection with Benghazi . ”
“ In the event of such requests , the department has a security clearance process in place under which clearances can be provided to private attorneys who are representing individual employees of this building , ” said Mr. Ventrell . “ We ’ re not aware of any . ”
The State Department ’ s office of inspector general had no comment on the situation Tuesday , although an official in the office said “ we really haven ’ t heard anything about it . ”
“ It ’ s not something that anybody has tried to get us involved in ” either on the administration ’ s behalf or from whistleblower lawyers , the official said .
Mrs. Toensing did not responded to multiple requests for comment .
It was not clear whether the State and CIA officials to whom Mrs. Toensing drew attention in the Fox report were among survivors of the Benghazi attack . Some of the survivors reportedly received treatment — even recently — at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for injuries sustained in the attack .
In a March 1 letter to Mr. Kerry , Republican Reps. Frank R. Wolf of Virginia and Jim Gerlach of Pennsylvania said that an unidentified but “ reliable source ” informed them that “ as many as 30 Americans ( including State Department and CIA personnel and government contractors ) may have been injured in the attack . ”
Regarding reports that Mr. Kerry had made a secret visit to one of the survivors at the hospital in Bethesda , Mr. Wolf said that “ if somebody ’ s still being treated six months after the attack , I think the American people need to have the truth . ”
In a statement Tuesday evening , Mr. Wolf said Mr. Kerry ’ s office never responded to his March 1 letter .
“ It is clear that the administration just wants the issue of Benghazi to go away , ” he said . “ But I sincerely hope that Congress will not aid this White House cover up of the mistakes made by high-level members of the administration that cost four brave Americans their lives . ”
Mr. Wolf also said 134 House Republicans “ have stood up to this cover-up ” by co-sponsoring a bill he introduced months ago to create a select committee to deepen investigations about Benghazi by several congressional committees .
“ Just one week has passed since the release of the interim progress report on Benghazi by the five committees currently investigating the attack , and already 14 more members of Congress have signed on ” to the bill calling for the creation of a separate , select committee , he said .
The president said Tuesday that he was unaware of any allegations of intimidation made by Benghazi whistleblowers .
“ I ’ m not familiar with this notion that anybody ’ s been blocked from testifying , ” Mr. Obama said in response to a question during a news conference in the White House briefing room . “ What I ’ ll do is find out what exactly you ’ re referring to . ”
The White House initially said the attack in Benghazi was likely spontaneous and sparked by demonstrations in other Middle Eastern cities against an amateur anti-Muslim YouTube video , which was produced by a U.S.-based Egyptian Christian .
Administration officials later characterized the attacks as an organized terrorist assault .
Mr. Graham , meanwhile , argued that the administration ’ s handling of the Benghazi attack was just the start of a pattern of bad management that also can be seen in the aftermath of the Boston bombings .
Democrats , including Mr. Obama , have defended the administration ’ s handling of the war on terrorism generally , by pointing to the death of Osama bin Laden and , joined by some Republicans , are cautioning against politicizing the Boston bombings .
Several lawmakers have defended the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community for not doing more to chase down intelligence chatter from Russia about the two suspects , both Chechen Muslims , prior to the bombings .
They note that the Kremlin did not respond to several entreaties from U.S. law enforcement for more information about the Tsarnaevs and note that Moscow has its own political reasons for exaggerating Chechens ’ ties to terrorism .

But there ’ s little doubt that the Trump administration feels unbound by allies ’ demands to be read into decisions like the airstrike in Baghdad . The president “ is the only decision-maker , ” says Heather Conley , an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Allies in the Middle East are also asking if Mr. Trump is signaling a retreat or a renewed commitment to their region , given his hostility to Iran ’ s rulers . Some may take comfort from his reiteration Wednesday of longstanding U.S. policy to deny Iran a nuclear weapon .
President Donald Trump ’ s decision last week to order the airstrike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani infuriated Iraq , on whose territory it took place . It also unsettled U.S. allies that had deployed forces alongside U.S. troops in Iraq and forced political leaders , once again , to weigh the risks of working with a U.S. president who shoots inconsistently from the hip .
America ’ s allies had a hard enough time dealing with the go-it-alone policies of the George W. Bush administration , epitomized by the Iraq invasion of 2003 .
But now those same allies , first and foremost in Europe and the Middle East , find themselves challenged by a go-it-alone American president in Donald Trump , who is often about as unpredictable with and independent of his own senior aides ’ counsel as he is toward America ’ s oldest and closest friends .
That uncomfortable new world struck again like a two-by-four between the eyes when Mr. Trump ordered the killing by drone strike last week of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani – considered second only to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in terms of power and prestige in Iran – after his arrival at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq .
The deadly strike , which reportedly divided the president ’ s national security staff and Pentagon officials , stunned allies and was seized upon by adversaries relishing any opportunity to highlight a “ rogue ” United States .
“ It is obvious , ” a smiling Ma Zhaoxu , China ’ s ambassador to the United Nations , told U.N. journalists Tuesday , “ that this unilateral action by the United States violated the basic norms of international relations . ”
The strike infuriated Iraq , which deemed it a violation of its national sovereignty . It left unconsulted European allies scrambling to protect forces deployed to Iraq to help train Iraqi military forces and fight ISIS .
And it left them wondering if they have on their hands an American president who feels unbound by international law and the rules of warfare described in the Geneva Convention – especially while Mr. Trump was threatening to bomb Iranian cultural sites if Tehran retaliated over General Soleimani ’ s death .
Iran did retaliate early Wednesday , sending at least a dozen ballistic missiles from its territory crashing down on two Iraqi bases housing some of the 5,500 U.S. troops in Iraq . No casualties were reported , and there was some indication – for example , the use of guided ballistic missiles , which are less erratic than rockets – that Iran intended its retaliatory strike as a warning and a matter of pride for domestic consumption , and sought to avoid any American deaths that would increase the likelihood of additional hostilities with the U.S .
President Trump addressed the nation from the White House Wednesday morning , saying no American or Iraqi casualties resulted from Iran ’ s missile strikes , and stating that he would not order any further military action in response at this time .
However he did announce new sanctions on Iran – signaling a return to his preferred means of pressuring what he repeatedly referred to as the Iranian “ regime ” – and he called on America ’ s NATO allies to become more deeply engaged in the Middle East .
Beyond Europe , the Soleimani strike left befuddled Mideast allies wondering if Mr. Trump had carried out another of his one-off actions – albeit a more spectacular and potentially consequential one – or if the U.S. is signaling a renewed commitment to the region for them to rely on .
“ This order to take out Soleimani reinforces with potentially disastrous consequences that this president is the only decision-maker , and that actions that matter very much not just to the United States but to the world are taken with complete unpredictability and aren ’ t in any way channeled through a normal interagency process or any consultation of allies , ” says Heather Conley , director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
“ Our closest allies can ’ t deal with the surprise and the unpredictability and the lack in so many cases of anything that looks like a plan , ” she adds . “ And so one consequence is that they are increasingly unwilling to contribute to U.S. operations and missions . ”
Mr. Trump ’ s call Wednesday for NATO to put more skin in the game in the Middle East seems likely to fall on deaf ears .
Ms. Conley points to an existing reluctance among allies to join the U.S. in the region – for example last year as part of an effort to protect oil tankers that were being targeted in the Strait of Hormuz . The British finally came aboard the operation , she adds , but they later hinted at a disconcerting confusion around the effort and a lack of clarity over just what the mission was .
On Tuesday Germany , Canada , Croatia , and other NATO allies of the U.S. began moving troops out of Iraq that have been deployed there to assist in training Iraqi forces to fight ISIS . In addition , NATO announced that it was temporarily suspending the counter-ISIS training mission , with European allies warning that the Islamic State would be the only winner if rising U.S.-Iran tensions diverted attention from counterterrorism efforts .
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday he was dispatching Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale to Brussels this week to consult with European partners , but some viewed the move as too little , too late .
“ It ’ s something , but this is where the gravity of the situation requires the secretary of state or the secretary of defense , ” says Ms. Conley . “ Our allies want to know where this is going , but right now no one does , ” she adds . “ I assume even [ Pompeo ] doesn ’ t know where the president will be taking this . ”
On the other hand , some analysts found that Mr. Trump ’ s statement Wednesday , with heavy use of the word “ regime ” to describe the Iranian government , was only shades removed from an articulation of a regime-change policy – and had Secretary Pompeo written all over it .
Still , the lack of any reliable sense of where Mr. Trump is going with regards to Iran has left regional allies to guess what might be coming next and to pursue new initiatives of their own – including efforts to reach out to Iran and secure some regional accommodation based on a U.S. disengagement from the region .
“ After the Soleimani strike , we ’ re standing at an interesting fork in the road , ” says Ilan Berman , a Middle East specialist and vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington . “ Our allies in the region are watching very closely : Does this turn out to be just a one-off where the president will take what we ’ re hearing from the Iraqis [ about demanding the departure of all foreign troops from Iraq ] and pick up our marbles and go home , ” he says .
Or , he adds , “ does the U.S. show a little patience , wait for the outrage [ over the Soleimani strike ] to abate , and then undertake some serious conversations with Beirut and Baghdad … that remove any doubt and confirm that America is not going anywhere ? ”
For some analysts , the Soleimani strike as well as Mr. Trump ’ s statement Wednesday suggesting an enduring commitment to the region – among other things , his reiteration of longtime U.S. policy to deny Iran a nuclear weapon – may reassure allies about U.S. involvement . Yet some anticipate regional allies in turn making demands of the U.S. that end up pushing all of Mr. Trump ’ s ungrateful-allies buttons .
“ The president is going to hear the complaints and what regional allies need , and he ’ s going to get tired of hearing ask , ask , ask , and not more of what [ allies ] plan to contribute , ” says Kirsten Fontenrose , former senior director for Gulf affairs at the National Security Council , and now director of the Atlantic Council ’ s Middle East Security Initiative .
Still , she says she expects to see more from the U.S. – everything from stepped up diplomacy to more materiel and counter-cyberattack cooperation – “ heading out to the region . ”

President Donald Trump’s decision last week to order the airstrike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani infuriated Iraq, on whose territory it took place. It also unsettled U.S. allies that had deployed forces alongside U.S. troops in Iraq and forced political leaders, once again, to weigh the risks of working with a U.S. president who shoots inconsistently from the hip.

America’s allies had a hard enough time dealing with the go-it-alone policies of the George W. Bush administration, epitomized by the Iraq invasion of 2003.

But now those same allies, first and foremost in Europe and the Middle East, find themselves challenged by a go-it-alone American president in Donald Trump, who is often about as unpredictable with and independent of his own senior aides’ counsel as he is toward America’s oldest and closest friends.

That uncomfortable new world struck again like a two-by-four between the eyes when Mr. Trump ordered the killing by drone strike last week of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani – considered second only to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in terms of power and prestige in Iran – after his arrival at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq.

The deadly strike, which reportedly divided the president’s national security staff and Pentagon officials, stunned allies and was seized upon by adversaries relishing any opportunity to highlight a “rogue” United States.

“It is obvious,” a smiling Ma Zhaoxu, China’s ambassador to the United Nations, told U.N. journalists Tuesday, “that this unilateral action by the United States violated the basic norms of international relations.”

The strike infuriated Iraq, which deemed it a violation of its national sovereignty. It left unconsulted European allies scrambling to protect forces deployed to Iraq to help train Iraqi military forces and fight ISIS.

And it left them wondering if they have on their hands an American president who feels unbound by international law and the rules of warfare described in the Geneva Convention – especially while Mr. Trump was threatening to bomb Iranian cultural sites if Tehran retaliated over General Soleimani’s death.

Iran did retaliate early Wednesday, sending at least a dozen ballistic missiles from its territory crashing down on two Iraqi bases housing some of the 5,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. No casualties were reported, and there was some indication – for example, the use of guided ballistic missiles, which are less erratic than rockets – that Iran intended its retaliatory strike as a warning and a matter of pride for domestic consumption, and sought to avoid any American deaths that would increase the likelihood of additional hostilities with the U.S.

President Trump addressed the nation from the White House Wednesday morning, saying no American or Iraqi casualties resulted from Iran’s missile strikes, and stating that he would not order any further military action in response at this time.

However he did announce new sanctions on Iran – signaling a return to his preferred means of pressuring what he repeatedly referred to as the Iranian “regime” – and he called on America’s NATO allies to become more deeply engaged in the Middle East.

Unpredictable actions

Beyond Europe, the Soleimani strike left befuddled Mideast allies wondering if Mr. Trump had carried out another of his one-off actions – albeit a more spectacular and potentially consequential one – or if the U.S. is signaling a renewed commitment to the region for them to rely on.

“This order to take out Soleimani reinforces with potentially disastrous consequences that this president is the only decision-maker, and that actions that matter very much not just to the United States but to the world are taken with complete unpredictability and aren’t in any way channeled through a normal interagency process or any consultation of allies,” says Heather Conley, director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

“Our closest allies can’t deal with the surprise and the unpredictability and the lack in so many cases of anything that looks like a plan,” she adds. “And so one consequence is that they are increasingly unwilling to contribute to U.S. operations and missions.”

Mr. Trump’s call Wednesday for NATO to put more skin in the game in the Middle East seems likely to fall on deaf ears.

Ms. Conley points to an existing reluctance among allies to join the U.S. in the region – for example last year as part of an effort to protect oil tankers that were being targeted in the Strait of Hormuz. The British finally came aboard the operation, she adds, but they later hinted at a disconcerting confusion around the effort and a lack of clarity over just what the mission was.

On Tuesday Germany, Canada, Croatia, and other NATO allies of the U.S. began moving troops out of Iraq that have been deployed there to assist in training Iraqi forces to fight ISIS. In addition, NATO announced that it was temporarily suspending the counter-ISIS training mission, with European allies warning that the Islamic State would be the only winner if rising U.S.-Iran tensions diverted attention from counterterrorism efforts.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday he was dispatching Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale to Brussels this week to consult with European partners, but some viewed the move as too little, too late.

“It’s something, but this is where the gravity of the situation requires the secretary of state or the secretary of defense,” says Ms. Conley. “Our allies want to know where this is going, but right now no one does,” she adds. “I assume even [Pompeo] doesn’t know where the president will be taking this.”

On the other hand, some analysts found that Mr. Trump’s statement Wednesday, with heavy use of the word “regime” to describe the Iranian government, was only shades removed from an articulation of a regime-change policy – and had Secretary Pompeo written all over it.

What’s his next step?

Still, the lack of any reliable sense of where Mr. Trump is going with regards to Iran has left regional allies to guess what might be coming next and to pursue new initiatives of their own – including efforts to reach out to Iran and secure some regional accommodation based on a U.S. disengagement from the region.

“After the Soleimani strike, we’re standing at an interesting fork in the road,” says Ilan Berman, a Middle East specialist and vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington. “Our allies in the region are watching very closely: Does this turn out to be just a one-off where the president will take what we’re hearing from the Iraqis [about demanding the departure of all foreign troops from Iraq] and pick up our marbles and go home,” he says.

Or, he adds, “does the U.S. show a little patience, wait for the outrage [over the Soleimani strike] to abate, and then undertake some serious conversations with Beirut and Baghdad … that remove any doubt and confirm that America is not going anywhere?”

For some analysts, the Soleimani strike as well as Mr. Trump’s statement Wednesday suggesting an enduring commitment to the region – among other things, his reiteration of longtime U.S. policy to deny Iran a nuclear weapon – may reassure allies about U.S. involvement. Yet some anticipate regional allies in turn making demands of the U.S. that end up pushing all of Mr. Trump’s ungrateful-allies buttons.

“The president is going to hear the complaints and what regional allies need, and he’s going to get tired of hearing ask, ask, ask, and not more of what [allies] plan to contribute,” says Kirsten Fontenrose, former senior director for Gulf affairs at the National Security Council, and now director of the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Security Initiative.

Still, she says she expects to see more from the U.S. – everything from stepped up diplomacy to more materiel and counter-cyberattack cooperation – “heading out to the region.”

For some experts in nuclear issues , the year ahead now opens the door to serious discussion of ways of fortifying the NPT , particularly by hardening the consequences of member states withdrawing from the treaty , as North Korea did in 2003 .
With the leaders of Iran , Turkey , Saudi Arabia , and other countries musing at times about the treaty ’ s unacceptable limits or even leaving the NPT , some say it ’ s time to focus on barring the door to a future wave of nuclear-arms proliferation .
“ If you have an extra year , it should be used to consider other ideas and priorities than what typically consumes the conversation , and new ways of interpreting the treaty to preserve its integrity , ” says Henry Sokolski , executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington .
It would be smart to focus a bit more on nonproliferation , and maybe a bit less on disarmament , “ which tends to consume everyone but doesn ’ t get the traction people are looking for , ” he says .
Some see a “ silver lining ” in the postponement , in that it offers an opportunity for global leadership .
“ The pandemic has thrown everything up in the air [ but ] leaders will be looking for ways to show their leadership and put it in a good light , ” says Rose Gottemoeller , a former undersecretary of state for arms control and international security , and until recently a deputy secretary general at NATO .
For example , she says President Donald Trump is likely to want a big foreign policy win to tout in his reelection campaign , and that could prompt the U.S. to take some disarmament action – such as extending the New START arms reduction treaty with Russia – before the November election .
More broadly , Ms. Gottemoeller says the context of a global pandemic can actually be a boon to the search for more cooperation on other issues .
“ I continue to believe that the coronavirus pandemic is providing an opportunity for leaders to come together around international institutions and agreements and to restate commitments to international cooperation , ” says Ms. Gottemoeller , now a distinguished lecturer at Stanford University ’ s Center for International Security and Cooperation in Palo Alto , California .
“ The NPT regime is no different , ” she adds , “ so I believe we ’ ll see [ treaty signatories ] … coming together around the position that ‘ this is a good treaty , let ’ s recommit to it and strengthen it going forward . ’ ”
Yet despite his hopes for new thinking on nuclear issues in the months ahead , Mr. Sokolski says he worries that a remarkably successful 50-year-old treaty might not last another decade .
The NPT took effect in 1970 based on the basic bargain that the five nuclear-armed states of the U.N. Security Council ( the U.S. , Russia , China , France , and the United Kingdom ) would move toward the elimination of all nuclear weapons , while the non-nuclear states committed to not seeking or developing such weapons but would have access to peaceful nuclear energy uses . The NPT took effect in a world where many countries had nuclear weapons programs , but today only India , Pakistan , Israel , and North Korea stand outside the treaty .
Over the last half-century , the two largest nuclear-weapons powers , the U.S. and Russia , have indeed sharply reduced their stockpiles . But more recently those two powers have shifted to modernizing their arsenals , as China has moved to expand its arsenal . Moreover the U.S. and Russia have moved away from disarmament treaties , with the last major treaty between them , New START , set to expire in February 2021 .
Increasingly non-weapons states see the nuclear powers as failing to hold up their end of the NPT bargain , a sentiment that has prompted some NPT members to pursue new initiatives without the major powers . In 2017 , 81 countries signed on to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons , a document rejected by the nuclear weapons states .
Given the percolating ire of the non-nuclear states , some experts say they are not certain that the postponement of the NPT review conference will lead to greater global unity on disarmament and nonproliferation down the road .
“ For sure the review conference ” set for next week “ was a train wreck waiting to happen , but nothing guarantees that we ’ ll find ourselves in nine months or a year in a better position , ” says Waheguru Pal Sidhu , an expert on multilateral and U.N. issues at New York University ’ s Center for Global Affairs . “ The opportunity is there , but there ’ s also a risk of even more disunity . ”
Much will depend on how countries , and especially the major powers , choose to address the coronavirus pandemic , Mr. Sidhu says . Proceeding with a spirit of “ we ’ re one world in this together ” could in turn foster a greater sense of cooperation on other issues , including nuclear weapons and proliferation . But a “ you ’ re on your own ” approach could sour the atmosphere of a major international effort like the NPT review .
“ People are talking about international solidarity for addressing COVID-19 , but on the other hand we have the proliferation really of these nation-first approaches – America first , Brazil first , India first – that set a tone that does not encourage greater cooperation , ” he says .
Some experts worry that what Ms. Gottemoeller calls the “ mischief-makers ” in the nuclear arena – foremost among them North Korea and Iran – could use the months before the NPT conference to advance their nuclear programs and further weaken the global nuclear nonproliferation regime .
But even there , Ms. Gottemoeller says the pandemic has changed her thinking on how some states are likely to proceed on nuclear issues over the coming months .
“ My view has shifted on this , I think the pandemic means they have less time and less incentive to make mischief , because they need the help of the international community , ” she says .

She cites the example of Saudi Arabia , which has alarmed the nonproliferation community with talk of purchasing nuclear facilities that could leave it in possession of the fuel and other building blocks for an eventual nuclear weapons program .
But other challenges are likely to put provocative moves like a nuclear program on the back burner , Ms. Gottemoeller says . “ I don ’ t think they ’ ll be focused at this moment on buying nuclear reactors . ”","“I continue to believe that the coronavirus pandemic is providing an opportunity for leaders to come together around international institutions and agreements and to restate commitments to international cooperation,” says Rose Gottemoeller, a former undersecretary of state for arms control and international security. “The NPT regime is no different,” she adds, “so I believe we’ll see [treaty signatories] … coming together around the position that ‘this is a good treaty, let’s recommit to it and strengthen it going forward.’”

“The NPT regime is no different,” she adds, “so I believe we’ll see [treaty signatories] … coming together around the position that ‘this is a good treaty, let’s recommit to it and strengthen it going forward.’”

A pessimistic view

Yet despite his hopes for new thinking on nuclear issues in the months ahead, Mr. Sokolski says he worries that a remarkably successful 50-year-old treaty might not last another decade.

The NPT took effect in 1970 based on the basic bargain that the five nuclear-armed states of the U.N. Security Council (the U.S., Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom) would move toward the elimination of all nuclear weapons, while the non-nuclear states committed to not seeking or developing such weapons but would have access to peaceful nuclear energy uses. The NPT took effect in a world where many countries had nuclear weapons programs, but today only India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea stand outside the treaty.

Over the last half-century, the two largest nuclear-weapons powers, the U.S. and Russia, have indeed sharply reduced their stockpiles. But more recently those two powers have shifted to modernizing their arsenals, as China has moved to expand its arsenal. Moreover the U.S. and Russia have moved away from disarmament treaties, with the last major treaty between them, New START, set to expire in February 2021.

Increasingly non-weapons states see the nuclear powers as failing to hold up their end of the NPT bargain, a sentiment that has prompted some NPT members to pursue new initiatives without the major powers. In 2017, 81 countries signed on to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a document rejected by the nuclear weapons states.

Given the percolating ire of the non-nuclear states, some experts say they are not certain that the postponement of the NPT review conference will lead to greater global unity on disarmament and nonproliferation down the road.

“For sure the review conference” set for next week “was a train wreck waiting to happen, but nothing guarantees that we’ll find ourselves in nine months or a year in a better position,” says Waheguru Pal Sidhu, an expert on multilateral and U.N. issues at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs. “The opportunity is there, but there’s also a risk of even more disunity.”

Much will depend on how countries, and especially the major powers, choose to address the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Sidhu says. Proceeding with a spirit of “we’re one world in this together” could in turn foster a greater sense of cooperation on other issues, including nuclear weapons and proliferation. But a “you’re on your own” approach could sour the atmosphere of a major international effort like the NPT review.

“People are talking about international solidarity for addressing COVID-19, but on the other hand we have the proliferation really of these nation-first approaches – America first, Brazil first, India first – that set a tone that does not encourage greater cooperation,” he says.

Less time for mischief?

Some experts worry that what Ms. Gottemoeller calls the “mischief-makers” in the nuclear arena – foremost among them North Korea and Iran – could use the months before the NPT conference to advance their nuclear programs and further weaken the global nuclear nonproliferation regime.

But even there, Ms. Gottemoeller says the pandemic has changed her thinking on how some states are likely to proceed on nuclear issues over the coming months.

“My view has shifted on this, I think the pandemic means they have less time and less incentive to make mischief, because they need the help of the international community,” she says.

She cites the example of Saudi Arabia, which has alarmed the nonproliferation community with talk of purchasing nuclear facilities that could leave it in possession of the fuel and other building blocks for an eventual nuclear weapons program.

But other challenges are likely to put provocative moves like a nuclear program on the back burner, Ms. Gottemoeller says. “I don’t think they’ll be focused at this moment on buying nuclear reactors.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,QKatURNRtMgdODwK

Starting Jan. 1, every woman in the Marines Corps was supposed to meet a new physical standard by performing three pullups. But that has been put off.

The Marine Corps announced it quietly. There was no news conference — just a notice on its social media sites and an item on its own TV show, The Corps Report.

Lance Cpl. Ally Beiswanger explained that the pullup test had been put off until sometime next year, to gather more data and ""ensure all female Marines are given the best opportunity to succeed.""

So far, female Marines are not succeeding. Fifty-five percent of female recruits tested at the end of boot camp were doing fewer than three pullups; only 1 percent of male recruits failed the test.

The three pullups is already the minimum required for all male Marines. Now the Marine Corps has postponed the plan, and that's raising questions about whether women have the physical strength to handle ground combat, which they'll be allowed to do beginning in 2016.

Marine officers would not talk to NPR on tape. They said they delayed the pullup requirement to avoid losing not only recruits but also current female Marines who can't pass the test.

The Marine Corps has been using it to test upper body strength for men for more than 40 years. And that upper body strength, they say, is necessary to serve in ground combat: to pull yourself out of a canal in Afghanistan, to climb over a mud wall, to carry an ammunition box.

Setting A Tougher Standard

For years, female Marines have had to meet a different standard — an exercise called the ""flexed arm hang"" (holding one's chin above the pullup bar for at least 15 seconds).

But beginning in 2016, women in the Marine Corps and Army will be allowed to serve in infantry, armor and artillery units. And they'll need to be strong enough to climb those mud walls and carry ammunition.

Robert Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, says the delay shows that women just can't meet the same standards.

""Young women, in spite of all the training and all the best intentions, are not going to be the equal of young men in terms of upper body strength,"" Maginnis says. ""You've got to have a lot of upper body strength to lift the stuff. Been there, done that.""

Maginnis just wrote a book called Deadly Consequences: How Cowards are Pushing Women into Combat. He says the issue has more to do with politics than protecting the nation.

A Former Marine Says It's Possible

However, Greg Jacob, a former Marine, says women can build the strength they need for pullups, and he has seen it done.

He served as a Marine infantry officer in the Balkans and Africa, and now he works for the Service Women's Action Network, a group that advocates for military women. When he was a Marine trainer in North Carolina, he required his female instructors to knock out pullups just like the guys.

""At first, a lot of women weren't able to do it,"" Jacob says. ""They were able to do one, some were able to do two, but what happened was by having that standard and enforcing that standard, it made my Marines, it made the troops go to the gym and train to that standard.""

But it virtually ensures that Iranian responses like last year ’ s attacks on Persian Gulf shipping and Saudi oil fields will continue. ” Editorial Board , Washington Post

After failing to retaliate for a long series of Iranian attacks in 2019 , Trump has established a degree of deterrence with Iran… [ But ] Contrary to Trump ’ s Tuesday night tweet , all is far from well… “ Trump constantly reiterates that he will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon , but it ’ s closer to that goal now than it was when Trump took office… To reach a [ nuclear ] deal , Trump will need to moderate his demands… The best Trump can realistically hope for is a strengthened nuclear deal with a longer time line , greater inspection requirements and some limits on long-range missiles .

The right applauds Trump ’ s speech and argues that his Iran strategy has been successful .
“ President Trump is not usually known for restraint , but his brief speech to the nation Wednesday morning showed tough-minded restraint of just the right sort…
“ By announcing a further tightening of the sanctions that are already crippling Iran ’ s economy , Trump shows that the U.S. will not meekly accept even a largely failed missile attack on its military bases — and he does it without further violence . By leading with the assertion that the U.S. will never allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons , and by returning to it several times , the president made clear the main imperative that has driven , and must drive , American grand strategy toward Iran . Yet , by refraining from any immediate military action , Trump provided room for Iran to de-escalate and accept his closing offer of peace . ”
“ Military experts will be debating this for a while , but if a country fires 22 missiles at targets and doesn ’ t kill anyone , either they ’ re really bad at their jobs or this operation was primarily symbolic . The Iranians could have tried other methods more likely to kill Americans last night , but they didn ’ t . The Iranian Air Force stayed within its own territory . They ’ re telling their people that they won a great victory . The message to us , between the lines , is that they don ’ t want this fight to get any bigger…
“ If the fight ends now , the United States is the big winner . We killed Soleimani , demonstrated that we can target just about anyone in the Iranian regime and eliminate them without warning , and have , so far , not lost any American lives in the Iranian counterattack , nor have our Iraqi allies . ”
“ In the run-up to the attack on Soleimani , Shiite militias under the general 's ultimate direction were firing rockets at U.S. troops , and Iran had orchestrated an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad . This came on top of months of broader escalation , including the targeting of drones and tankers in the Arabian Sea and attacks on Saudi oil fields . It was necessary for Trump to do something significant to reestablish deterrence against Iran . Killing Soleimani was a way to weaken Iran severely and reestablish deterrence in a targeted way… Trump ’ s foreign policy positions have been criticized as incoherent . But his recent actions on Iran are the most consistent manifestation yet of his foreign policy impulse to project strength while avoiding protracted wars . ”
“ President Trump has demonstrated that he is uninterested in the lofty goals of nation-building and regime change that once characterized his party… On Wednesday , he vowed that Iran would not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon ‘ as long as I am president. ’ And yet in that same speech , Trump extended a hand of cooperation to Iran . ‘ The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran , ’ he said . ‘ We should work together on this and other shared priorities. ’ This doesn ’ t sound like a man bent on regime change by military force . They are the words of a president who seeks to deter Iran from targeting Americans and building nuclear weapons…
“ It ’ s sometimes said that war is the failure of diplomacy . That ’ s not quite right . More often , war is the failure of deterrence . ”
“ The [ Iranian ] regime received windfall concessions upon signing the 2015 nuclear deal , the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , including tens of billions in cash and billions more from new access to the global economy . But instead of using its newfound riches to invest in the Iranian people — as hoped for by Obama and his supporters — Tehran instead doubled down on its efforts to disrupt the Middle East… It is true that a more aggressive U.S. posture against Iran could lead to additional threats against U.S. installations and interests , such as Tuesday ’ s limited missile strikes against bases housing American troops in Iraq . But that possibility has to be weighed against the fact that Iran has already claimed hundreds of American lives and has been busy plotting and planning future attacks…
“ After two years of crippling U.S. sanctions ( Iran ’ s GDP contracted by nearly 10 percent in 2019 ) , a restive public , and a U.S. administration willing to back up its diplomacy with force , the regime confronts existential choices . Will it try to maintain its position as the world ’ s leading state sponsor of terror while squandering countless resources on internal repression and nuclear and ballistic missile programs ? Or , will it choose the path of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s , recognizing it is backed into a strategic corner , and negotiate a peaceful way out ? ”
“ If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? … the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . ”
Others note , “ I ’ d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump ’ s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “ I think Joe Sixpack ’ s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama ’ s approval at the same point in his presidency .

After failing to retaliate for a long series of Iranian attacks in 2019, Trump has established a degree of deterrence with Iran… [But] Contrary to Trump’s Tuesday night tweet, all is far from well… “Trump constantly reiterates that he will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, but it’s closer to that goal now than it was when Trump took office… To reach a [nuclear] deal, Trump will need to moderate his demands… The best Trump can realistically hope for is a strengthened nuclear deal with a longer time line, greater inspection requirements and some limits on long-range missiles. And even achieving that modest outcome would probably require a suspension of some economic sanctions to lure the Iranians back to the negotiating table.” Max Boot, Washington Post

“President Donald Trump’s speech on Iran will not go down in memory as eloquent or inspiring — but it gave the world what it needed most today: an opportunity for de-escalation… For Iranians, although Trump hardly offered an olive branch, the absence of threats of military force should be the key takeaway; it may be the first time the announcement of more sanctions would be welcome in Tehran . Moreover, in several parts of the speech, Trump referenced a desire to see a peaceful and prosperous Iran — without any obvious suggestion of regime change being the prerequisite.” Meghan L. O’Sullivan, Bloomberg

From the Right

The right applauds Trump’s speech and argues that his Iran strategy has been successful.

“President Trump is not usually known for restraint, but his brief speech to the nation Wednesday morning showed tough-minded restraint of just the right sort…



“By announcing a further tightening of the sanctions that are already crippling Iran’s economy, Trump shows that the U.S. will not meekly accept even a largely failed missile attack on its military bases — and he does it without further violence. By leading with the assertion that the U.S. will never allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons, and by returning to it several times, the president made clear the main imperative that has driven, and must drive, American grand strategy toward Iran. Yet, by refraining from any immediate military action, Trump provided room for Iran to de-escalate and accept his closing offer of peace.”

Quin Hillyer, Washington Examiner

“Military experts will be debating this for a while, but if a country fires 22 missiles at targets and doesn’t kill anyone, either they’re really bad at their jobs or this operation was primarily symbolic. The Iranians could have tried other methods more likely to kill Americans last night, but they didn’t. The Iranian Air Force stayed within its own territory. They’re telling their people that they won a great victory. The message to us, between the lines, is that they don’t want this fight to get any bigger…



“If the fight ends now, the United States is the big winner. We killed Soleimani, demonstrated that we can target just about anyone in the Iranian regime and eliminate them without warning, and have, so far, not lost any American lives in the Iranian counterattack, nor have our Iraqi allies.”

Jim Geraghty, National Review

“In the run-up to the attack on Soleimani, Shiite militias under the general's ultimate direction were firing rockets at U.S. troops, and Iran had orchestrated an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. This came on top of months of broader escalation, including the targeting of drones and tankers in the Arabian Sea and attacks on Saudi oil fields. It was necessary for Trump to do something significant to reestablish deterrence against Iran. Killing Soleimani was a way to weaken Iran severely and reestablish deterrence in a targeted way… Trump’s foreign policy positions have been criticized as incoherent. But his recent actions on Iran are the most consistent manifestation yet of his foreign policy impulse to project strength while avoiding protracted wars.”

Editorial Board, Washington Examiner

“President Trump has demonstrated that he is uninterested in the lofty goals of nation-building and regime change that once characterized his party… On Wednesday, he vowed that Iran would not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon ‘as long as I am president.’ And yet in that same speech, Trump extended a hand of cooperation to Iran. ‘The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran,’ he said. ‘We should work together on this and other shared priorities.’ This doesn’t sound like a man bent on regime change by military force. They are the words of a president who seeks to deter Iran from targeting Americans and building nuclear weapons…



“It’s sometimes said that war is the failure of diplomacy. That’s not quite right. More often, war is the failure of deterrence.”

Eli Lake, Bloomberg

“The [Iranian] regime received windfall concessions upon signing the 2015 nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, including tens of billions in cash and billions more from new access to the global economy. But instead of using its newfound riches to invest in the Iranian people — as hoped for by Obama and his supporters — Tehran instead doubled down on its efforts to disrupt the Middle East… It is true that a more aggressive U.S. posture against Iran could lead to additional threats against U.S. installations and interests, such as Tuesday’s limited missile strikes against bases housing American troops in Iraq. But that possibility has to be weighed against the fact that Iran has already claimed hundreds of American lives and has been busy plotting and planning future attacks…



“After two years of crippling U.S. sanctions (Iran’s GDP contracted by nearly 10 percent in 2019), a restive public, and a U.S. administration willing to back up its diplomacy with force, the regime confronts existential choices. Will it try to maintain its position as the world’s leading state sponsor of terror while squandering countless resources on internal repression and nuclear and ballistic missile programs? Or, will it choose the path of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, recognizing it is backed into a strategic corner, and negotiate a peaceful way out?”

Stuart Gottlieb and Danielle Pletka, The Hill

“If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy. In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors?… the nation does not want another war. How we avoid it, however, is becoming difficult to see. John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing, but his soul is marching on.”

Patrick Buchanan, The American Conservative

Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After all that has emerged about Trump so far, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”

Let’s See Where Their Priorities Are.",,"Ari Rabin-Havt, Liza Featherstone, Peter Frase, Seth Ackerman, Bhaskar Sunkara, Michael Youhana, Luke Savage, Pankaj Mehta, Lindsay Koshgarian","In 2007 , when Democrats took control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1994 , the Iraq War was at its zenith . Ending the war was the top priority for progressives .
At that time , a centrist senior Democratic aide pulled me aside and told me that my lefty friends and I were being irrational . Democrats could not push to end the war in Iraq or , in fact , take any steps to roll back the ever-burgeoning Pentagon budget . Doing so would electorally weaken the party , condemning us to defeat . That , according to her , was the lesson of the post–Vietnam War era .
While ahistorical , that fear loomed large in post–September 11 Washington , DC . For the most part , Democrats have been participants in the rapid expansion of the military budget .
In September 2017 , as the # Resistance raged among liberal circles , President Donald Trump ’ s first National Defense Authorization bill arrived on the floor of the United States Senate . Despite the calls to oppose the president on every front , the overwhelming majority of Democrats voted to massively increase the Pentagon ’ s budget , this time by more than $ 80 billion annually , fulfilling one of Trump ’ s campaign promises . Only four Democrats — Kirsten Gillibrand , Patrick Leahy , Jeff Merkley , and Ron Wyden — voted , along with Bernie Sanders , against the bill . They were joined by three Republicans : Bob Corker , Mike Lee , and Rand Paul . Despite no major military conflicts , this budget approached defense spending at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The fear that was expressed to me in 2007 still had a hold on elected Democrats a decade later . In a country with millions of people still lacking basic social welfare , the budget is a bloated disgrace . Nearly half of this public money feeds the bottom lines of defense contractors .
Many of these corporations have been fined for defrauding the government , yet they still get to line up every year , hat in hand , and walk away with billions of dollars . The Poor People ’ s Campaign noted in their Moral Budget that “ one contractor alone , Lockheed Martin , took in more than $ 35 billion in Pentagon contracts in 2018 — nearly as much as the entire $ 40 billion budget for the State Department and USAID combined. ” The Project on Government Oversight has tracked at least eighty-eight instances of misconduct by Lockheed Martin , resulting in nearly $ 768 million in penalties since 1995 .
Everyone in Washington knows this . Everyone sees the waste . Everyone knows the source : the combination of fear about seeming weak on defense combined with a lobbying and campaign contribution system that rewards those who allow this corruption to continue .
When the Senate reconvenes following its current two-week recess , it will once again take up a Defense Authorization bill delivering a policy victory to the White House and the military-industrial complex in the form of budget increases .
Yet there is some hope of change . Bernie Sanders offered an amendment before the Senate went on break that would cut the Pentagon ’ s budget by 10 percent in order to “ create a federal grant program to fund health care , housing , childcare and educational opportunities for cities and towns experiencing a poverty rate of 25 % or more . ”
While the federal government could — and obviously should — create this program without cutting funds to anything , this amendment puts into stark view the policy choices Congress is making .
The likelihood of this amendment receiving the required sixty votes is infinitesimal , but the coalition emerging behind it demonstrates Sanders ’ s continued influence . Even though they voted for Trump ’ s defense increase in 2017 , Massachusetts senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey signed on as cosponsors of this amendment .
A greater sign of the mainstreaming of this position took place on Friday afternoon when Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to proclaim his support for the Sanders ’ s amendment , writing , “ Proud I fought alongside @ SenSanders to ensure we vote in July on his amendment to cut $ 740B defense budget by 10 % and put $ $ into priorities like health care , housing , childcare in communities with 25 % + poverty — including many communities of color . . . I proudly support the amendment . ”
This vote is the beginning of a campaign . Cutting the defense budget can move from being a backwater issue , championed by Barbara Lee in the House and Bernie Sanders in the Senate , to becoming an actual reality in 2021 .
In this conversation , one trap that must be avoided at all costs is the notion that these cuts are about reducing the federal deficit . The current amendment on the floor makes sense as a rhetorical device , particularly in this moment when impoverished communities are disproportionately suffering from the impacts of the pandemic . The choice now will be clear for legislators voting . Do you support money for defense contractors or dollars for the communities in your state who need it the most ? The amendment is specifically targeted this way by exempting cuts to salaries and health care .
Additionally , those who make an economic argument for increased military spending are not being truthful . According to a report from the Political Economic Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts , “ federal spending on domestic programs in health care , education , clean energy and infrastructure creates more jobs , dollar for dollar , than military spending . ”
This fight over defense spending that will take place behind the scenes over the next year is one that will either strengthen the power of the Left on Capitol Hill or sap it . The ever-increasing military budget is directly connected to the weapons of war that protesters confronted on the streets of American cities while protesting police murders .
It is not shocking that the greatest champions of increasing the military budget , like Senator Tom Cotton , were also the ones calling for those very weapons to be used against demonstrators .

Several lawmakers said Congress received no advance notice of Trump ’ s announcement , leaving them fuming and scratching their heads .
“ I don ’ t know what they ’ ve done , but this is chaos , ” Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGraham says Trump should be allowed to undo DACA order ███ 's 12:30 Report : Dems , GOP dig in for public impeachment hearings ███ 's Morning Report - Witness transcripts plow ground for public impeachment testimony MORE ( R-S.C. ) , a staunch Trump ally and Armed Services Committee member , told reporters , adding that he planned to discuss the matter with Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisFormer Mattis staffer : Trump 'shooting himself in the foot ' on foreign policy Former staffer hits back at Mattis 's office over criticism of tell-all book Former speechwriter for General James Mattis : Has the national security state grappled with Donald Trump ? MORE .
Shortly before that , Graham said in a statement that a troop withdrawal would be an “ Obama-like mistake , ” a jab sure to catch the attention of a president driven in part by diverging from his predecessor .
On Wednesday morning , Trump declared victory against ISIS in Syria in a tweet after The Wall Street Journal , followed by The Washington Post , reported that he was preparing an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria .
“ We have defeated ISIS in Syria , my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency , ” Trump tweeted .
The Pentagon had no immediate comment on the news reports or Trump ’ s tweets , other than to say the military campaign was continuing “ at this time . ”
The White House later confirmed in a statement the administration has `` started returning United States troops home '' but emphasized coalition efforts in Syria would proceed . It also reiterated Trump 's claim that `` the United States has defeated the territorial caliphate . ''
`` The United States and our allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interests whenever necessary , and we will continue to work together to deny radical Islamist terrorists territory , funding , support , and any means of infiltrating our borders , ” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement .
Hours later , the Pentagon released a four-sentence statement from the chief spokeswoman , saying the military has “ started the process of returning U.S. troops home from Syria as we transition to the next phase of the campaign . ”
“ The coalition has liberated the ISIS-held territory , but the campaign against ISIS is not over , ” spokeswoman Dana White said in the statement . “ For force protection and operational security reasons , we will not provide further details . ”
In addition to ongoing military options against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , those who favor keeping troops in Syria argue that a withdrawal would cede influence in the Middle East to Iran and Russia .
“ It ’ s a terrible decision , ” Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioGOP senators plan to tune out impeachment week Republicans warn election results are 'wake-up call ' for Trump Paul 's demand to out whistleblower rankles GOP colleagues MORE ( R-Fla. ) said Wednesday . “ I hope it can be entirely or at least partially reversed , or we ’ re going to pay a big price for it in the years to come . ”

A senior administration official said on a background call with reporters that the number of lawmakers called by the afternoon was “ large . ”
Inhofe said he and his committee “ should have known ” and expressed concern about protection for U.S.-backed Kurdish forces going forward .
Asked about Trump ’ s assertion of victory over ISIS , Inhofe paused , before saying , “ we ’ ve made great strides . ”

Corker later went to the White House to meet with Trump , but the meeting was canceled while he was there and instead he spoke with Bolton .
Returning to the Capitol , Corker called Trump ’ s decision “ in many ways even worse ” than Obama ’ s withdrawal from Iraq that critics say allowed for the growth of ISIS . Corker accused Trump of abandoning the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) “ six to eight weeks ” away from clearing ISIS from its territory .
“ I doubt there ’ s anybody in the Republican Caucus in the Senate that just isn ’ t stunned by this precipitous decision , ” Corker said . “ My sense is that it ’ s been a shock throughout the administration that this type of decision was made . … It ’ s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication , with this little preparation . ”
He added that based on conversations with people close to the decision , he does not see the decision being reversed and that Trump has “ made his mind up . ”
Corker also said that “ to his knowledge ” allies in the coalition fighting ISIS also were not consulted ahead of the announcement .
In the background call with reporters on Wednesday afternoon , the senior administration official had no details on a timeline for withdrawal , how many troops have already left or whether the military would continue airstrikes in Syria , referring questions to the Pentagon .
The official said the withdrawal would be done in an “ orderly fashion , ” adding the Pentagon was “ working [ on the timeline ] right now . ”
Reports citing unnamed officials said State Department personnel will withdraw from the country as well . A department spokesperson declined to comment , citing “ operational security reasons . ”
The State Department canceled its regularly scheduled press briefing for Wednesday .
Despite Trump ’ s declaration of victory , independent analyses and lawmakers say ISIS continues to hold territory in Syria .

Several lawmakers said Congress received no advance notice of Trump’s announcement, leaving them fuming and scratching their heads.

“I don’t know what they’ve done, but this is chaos,” Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGraham says Trump should be allowed to undo DACA order The Hill's 12:30 Report: Dems, GOP dig in for public impeachment hearings The Hill's Morning Report - Witness transcripts plow ground for public impeachment testimony MORE (R-S.C.), a staunch Trump ally and Armed Services Committee member, told reporters, adding that he planned to discuss the matter with Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisFormer Mattis staffer: Trump 'shooting himself in the foot' on foreign policy Former staffer hits back at Mattis's office over criticism of tell-all book Former speechwriter for General James Mattis: Has the national security state grappled with Donald Trump? MORE.

Shortly before that, Graham said in a statement that a troop withdrawal would be an “Obama-like mistake,” a jab sure to catch the attention of a president driven in part by diverging from his predecessor.

On Wednesday morning, Trump declared victory against ISIS in Syria in a tweet after The Wall Street Journal, followed by The Washington Post, reported that he was preparing an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.

“We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,” Trump tweeted.

The Pentagon had no immediate comment on the news reports or Trump’s tweets, other than to say the military campaign was continuing “at this time.”

The White House later confirmed in a statement the administration has ""started returning United States troops home"" but emphasized coalition efforts in Syria would proceed. It also reiterated Trump's claim that ""the United States has defeated the territorial caliphate.""

""The United States and our allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interests whenever necessary, and we will continue to work together to deny radical Islamist terrorists territory, funding, support, and any means of infiltrating our borders,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.

Hours later, the Pentagon released a four-sentence statement from the chief spokeswoman, saying the military has “started the process of returning U.S. troops home from Syria as we transition to the next phase of the campaign.”

“The coalition has liberated the ISIS-held territory, but the campaign against ISIS is not over,” spokeswoman Dana White said in the statement. “For force protection and operational security reasons, we will not provide further details.”

In addition to ongoing military options against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), those who favor keeping troops in Syria argue that a withdrawal would cede influence in the Middle East to Iran and Russia.

“It’s a terrible decision,” Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioGOP senators plan to tune out impeachment week Republicans warn election results are 'wake-up call' for Trump Paul's demand to out whistleblower rankles GOP colleagues MORE (R-Fla.) said Wednesday. “I hope it can be entirely or at least partially reversed, or we’re going to pay a big price for it in the years to come.”

National security adviser John Bolton called some senators after the news broke Wednesday, with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn John CornynMcConnell, GOP leaders say they won't be watching House impeachment hearing GOP senators warn against Trump firing intelligence community official Falling investment revives attacks against Trump's tax cuts MORE (R-Texas) saying they were among those who received calls. A senior administration official said on a background call with reporters that the number of lawmakers called by the afternoon was “large.”

Cornyn said senators were “surprised” at the announcement.

Inhofe said he and his committee “should have known” and expressed concern about protection for U.S.-backed Kurdish forces going forward.

Asked about Trump’s assertion of victory over ISIS, Inhofe paused, before saying, “we’ve made great strides.”

Vice President Pence took the brunt of GOP ire during lunch at the Capitol.

Corker later went to the White House to meet with Trump, but the meeting was canceled while he was there and instead he spoke with Bolton.

Returning to the Capitol, Corker called Trump’s decision “in many ways even worse” than Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq that critics say allowed for the growth of ISIS. Corker accused Trump of abandoning the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) “six to eight weeks” away from clearing ISIS from its territory.

“I doubt there’s anybody in the Republican Caucus in the Senate that just isn’t stunned by this precipitous decision,” Corker said. “My sense is that it’s been a shock throughout the administration that this type of decision was made. … It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication, with this little preparation.”

He added that based on conversations with people close to the decision, he does not see the decision being reversed and that Trump has “made his mind up.”

Corker also said that “to his knowledge” allies in the coalition fighting ISIS also were not consulted ahead of the announcement.

In the background call with reporters on Wednesday afternoon, the senior administration official had no details on a timeline for withdrawal, how many troops have already left or whether the military would continue airstrikes in Syria, referring questions to the Pentagon.

The official said the withdrawal would be done in an “orderly fashion,” adding the Pentagon was “working [on the timeline] right now.”

Reports citing unnamed officials said State Department personnel will withdraw from the country as well. A department spokesperson declined to comment, citing “operational security reasons.”

The State Department canceled its regularly scheduled press briefing for Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s declaration of victory, independent analyses and lawmakers say ISIS continues to hold territory in Syria.

“ISIS is not defeated in Syria. It controls territory, retains significant fighting forces and is reconstituting those forces,” the Institute for the Study of War tweeted Wednesday, along with its map of ISIS’s areas of control, attack and support as of mid-November.

The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria backing local forces fighting ISIS.

Troops were first deployed to Syria in October 2015.

During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to “bomb the shit” out of ISIS and then quickly bring troops home, chastising what he saw as years of failed nation-building missions in the Middle East and elsewhere.

His advisers, though, had so far persuaded him to stay the course on U.S. military operations around the world. In Afghanistan, Trump agreed after months of deliberations to send thousands more troops and keep them there indefinitely.

In Syria, Trump first suggested an imminent withdrawal in March. During a speech about infrastructure, he made a seemingly off-the-cuff remark that the United States will “be coming out of Syria, like, very soon.”

Days later, he reiterated, “I want to get out. I want to bring those troops home.”

But then Trump agreed in April to leave U.S. troops there until ISIS was defeated, though he was said to have given the military a six-month timeline to do so.

After that, administration officials including Bolton and special envoy for Syria engagement James Jeffrey have talked about an indefinite troop commitment. In September, Bolton pledged troops would not leave until Iranian forces do.

Operations in the past few months have focused on routing ISIS from its remaining pockets in the Middle Euphrates River Valley. On Friday, the SDF declared victory over ISIS in Hajin, the last major town held by the terrorist group, but several villages and other areas remain under ISIS control.

Last week, the administration’s special envoy for the anti-ISIS coalition, Brett McGurk, characterized a hypothetical withdrawal as “reckless.”

“Obviously, it would be reckless if we were just to say, ‘Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.’ I think anyone who’s looked at a conflict like this would agree with that,” McGurk, an Obama administration holdover, told reporters.

Trump’s decision comes after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan threatened to launch a new assault against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria. Those forces make up the bulk of the SDF, but Ankara considers them terrorists connected to Kurdish insurgents in Turkey.

On Monday, Erdoğan said he got “positive answers” from Trump during a Friday phone call on Syria.

“ The threat is much more immediate now and so it ’ s clear that we can ’ t repeat the same approach – failed approach of the past , ” H.R . McMaster , the adviser , said during a security conference with Homeland Security Chief John Kelly .
He said it would be insanity to continue to do the same thing the U.S. has done for years and expect a different result .
McMaster ’ s comments come a day before Trump is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in . South Korea ’ s new leader vowed to stand firmly with Trump against North Korea , downplaying his past advocacy for a softer approach toward the isolated regime .
`` Together we will achieve the dismantlement of North Korea 's nuclear program , peace on the Korean Peninsula and eventually peace in Northeast Asia , '' Moon said .
The talks between Moon and Trump , which begin with dinner on Thursday night and then formal talks on Friday , come amid intense wrangling over North Korea .
China is pushing the United States to start negotiations with the North . That prospect appears unlikely as Trump grows frustrated over Beijing 's level of economic pressure on the North , its wayward ally .
North Korea shows no sign of wanting to restart talks on abandoning its nuclear weapons program .
Moon told The Washington Post that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is `` unreasonable '' and `` very dangerous '' and that pressure was necessary . But Moon said sanctions alone would not solve the problem , and dialogue was needed `` under the right conditions . ''
The THAAD missile defense is also expected to be on the agenda . Seoul delayed the full deployment of the U.S. system that is intended to protect South Korea and the 28,000 U.S. forces on the peninsula .
Moon 's government has ordered an environmental review before allowing additional launchers for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system . South Korean officials say that does not mean they are placating China or reversing the decision , which risks angering Washington .
The U.S. has stepped up shows of military force near the Korean Peninsula under Trump , and outrage in Washington over North Korea has only grown since the death last week of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier . He had spent 17 months in detention in the totalitarian nation for stealing a propaganda poster and returned home this month in a coma . Three other Americans and six South Koreans are still being held in the North .","The Trump administration is considering a wider range of strategies on how to deal with North Korea, including the military option, Trump's national security adviser said Wednesday.

“The threat is much more immediate now and so it’s clear that we can’t repeat the same approach – failed approach of the past,” H.R. McMaster, the adviser, said during a security conference with Homeland Security Chief John Kelly.

He said it would be insanity to continue to do the same thing the U.S. has done for years and expect a different result.

McMaster’s comments come a day before Trump is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. South Korea’s new leader vowed to stand firmly with Trump against North Korea, downplaying his past advocacy for a softer approach toward the isolated regime.

""Together we will achieve the dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program, peace on the Korean Peninsula and eventually peace in Northeast Asia,"" Moon said.

The talks between Moon and Trump, which begin with dinner on Thursday night and then formal talks on Friday, come amid intense wrangling over North Korea.

China is pushing the United States to start negotiations with the North. That prospect appears unlikely as Trump grows frustrated over Beijing's level of economic pressure on the North, its wayward ally.

North Korea shows no sign of wanting to restart talks on abandoning its nuclear weapons program.

Moon told The Washington Post that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is ""unreasonable"" and ""very dangerous"" and that pressure was necessary. But Moon said sanctions alone would not solve the problem, and dialogue was needed ""under the right conditions.""

The THAAD missile defense is also expected to be on the agenda. Seoul delayed the full deployment of the U.S. system that is intended to protect South Korea and the 28,000 U.S. forces on the peninsula.

Moon's government has ordered an environmental review before allowing additional launchers for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system. South Korean officials say that does not mean they are placating China or reversing the decision, which risks angering Washington.

The U.S. has stepped up shows of military force near the Korean Peninsula under Trump, and outrage in Washington over North Korea has only grown since the death last week of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier. He had spent 17 months in detention in the totalitarian nation for stealing a propaganda poster and returned home this month in a coma.

David Petraeus: ""You can't completely get out of endless wars""",,,"Former CIA director and retired Gen. David Petraeus , who previously commanded coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , spoke with `` 60 Minutes ' '' John Dickerson on the `` CBS This Morning '' podcast about the state of ISIS in the wake of the killing of its longtime leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .
While Petraeus said the death of al-Baghdadi is `` a very significant blow '' to the Islamic State , he emphasized , `` what we 're seeking is not the temporal defeat , not just one defeat or one senior leader . This is about the enduring defeat of the Islamic State . '' Petraeus also highlighted that there are other Islamic state entities around the world including in South Asia that al-Baghdadi was not directing on a daily basis .
When asked about President Trump 's repeated promise to end what he calls America 's `` endless wars , '' Petraeus said , `` I absolutely understand the desire and the desirability of getting out of endless wars . Nobody understands that better than the individual who commanded our forces at the height of each of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and then the overall Middle East and Central Asia as the commander of U.S. Central Command . So I am again absolutely supportive of that except that you ca n't completely get out of endless wars because you end up going back into them . ''
He also noted , `` I 'm not aware of any large demonstrations in the United States against the continued operations in Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan . We 've actually gotten these down to very modest numbers compared to say the 165,000 American men and women I was privileged to lead an Afghan in Iraq during the surge or the 100,000 U.S. and 50,000 additional coalition during the surge in Afghanistan . ''
Noting the rise of populism across the globe , Petraeus said , `` The democratic countries of the world are not necessarily completely on top of their game . '' Petraeus told Dickerson , `` You see populism in the United States . You see it especially in Washington , D.C. where the center has been hollowed out of Congress because of party primaries , gerrymandering of vast amounts of money , some of it not accountable , the lack of civics education around it all , all series of different issues that have led us to a point where the government shuts down and many of the budgets are not approved in time for the start of the fiscal year . ''
In assessing the qualities he would look for in the next president of the United States , Petraeus emphasized it 's about getting the `` big ideas right . '' He told Dickerson this includes `` a degree of operational or strategic judgment that is typically founded on considerable experience and understanding of the past of history of how we arrived at the point we are today . ''
Above all , `` it comes back to the first task of a strategic leader and again a strategic leader is someone who is truly making the decisions that matter , '' Petraeus said . He added the next president will need `` the ability to work with others to galvanize the government and to get the bureaucracy and certainly Congress as well sufficiently working together to turn big ideas into reality on the ground . ''
Petraeus also talked about other foreign policy issues including why it 's important to have a `` coherent and comprehensive '' approach in the U.S relationship with China , deal with Russia `` firmly not provocatively , '' as well as the importance of having allies noting `` coalition maintenance takes a lot of effort but it 's worth it .

Bush-signed legislation that Mr. Obama has criticized and wanted to repeal since last year .
Since beginning airstrikes last month against the Islamic State , also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL , the White House has said it does not need congressional approval to carry out such missions .
Last week , on the 13th anniversary of al Qaeda ’ s attacks on the United States , the administration announced why , saying President Bush ’ s Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution in 2001 is all the authority Mr. Obama needs .
In a May 2013 speech to a military audience at the National Defense University , Mr. Obama portrayed the law as dated and as a potential blank check to get the U.S. into wars .
“ The AUMF is now nearly 12 years old , ” he said . “ Unless we discipline our thinking , our definitions , our actions , we may be drawn into more wars we don ’ t need to fight , or continue to grant presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states . ”
Last week , The ███ asked a National Security Council spokeswoman whether the president still wants to repeal the authorization , given the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group .
“ On the 2001 AUMF , we remain committed to engaging with Congress and the American people to refine , and ultimately repeal , the AUMF , ” the spokeswoman said . “ The president has made clear that he wishes to take America off a permanent war footing . ”
Two days later , the White House cited the authorization as Mr. Obama ’ s go-ahead for airstrikes on the Islamic State .
Said Charles “ Cully ” Stimson , a national security law analyst at the Heritage Foundation : “ There ’ s not only a disconnect but a failure to clearly articulate in a public forum the legal basis for the strikes . ”
White House press secretary Josh Earnest defended the irony of the president ’ s reliance on a war authorization law that he has wanted to be changed and repealed since at least 2013 .
Mr . Earnest did not repeat the call for repeal Thursday as he explained to reporters why the 2001 resolution applies to the Islamic State .
“ The president is ready to engage in a conversation with members of Congress as it relates to this specific AUMF , ” he said . “ And we welcome or would welcome a show of support from the United States Congress for the strategy that the president has laid out . ”
Mr. Obama went on national TV Wednesday night to announce a counterterrorism campaign to destroy the Islamic State over time . The U.S. will provide airstrikes , intelligence , training and advice . Iraqis and Syrians will muster their ground forces .
Mr. Obama campaigned for re-election as a president who was put into office to “ end wars , not start them . ”
The Obama administration has not given a name to the military operation , a departure from past Pentagon practices .
Congressional aides said that , by relying on a law tied to the Bush administration , Mr. Obama avoids signing new legislation that would officially and historically link him to the war against the Islamic State .
Mr. Stimson believes the constitutional lawyer in Mr. Obama “ would prefer to work with Congress for a narrowly tailored ISIS-specific AUMF that has a ‘ sunset ’ provision within it . ”
“ But the political reality is that if he were to ask for one and not get it , that would be politically damaging , ” the national security analyst said . “ If he were to ask for one and get it , then he would be the author , the owner , of an Obama AUMF , which probably , according to their political calculus , would hurt them even more . ”
The 2001 law authorizes military force against al Qaeda and its associated groups . The Obama administration argues that the Bush authorization applies to the Islamic State group , a version of al Qaeda in Iraq , which waged war against U.S. troops and the Baghdad government beginning in 2004 .
“ It is the view of this administration that the 2001 AUMF continues to apply to ISIL , ” Mr . Earnest said .
Although al Qaeda and the Islamic State have had public disagreements over how and whom to kill , and in what numbers , some al Qaeda fighters view the offshoot as the one created in Osama bin Laden ’ s image .
“ So these ties between ISIL and al Qaeda persist , ” Mr . Earnest said .
As for Mr. Obama ’ s call to repeal the authorization he now embraces , Mr . Earnest said the president has always said , “ Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue . ”
In August , the White House justified its bombing campaign in Iraq as the prerogative of the commander in chief . It also has sent at least seven notifications to Congress about actions against the Islamic State to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act .
Mr. Stimson said the letters “ are a direct reflection of the administration ’ s public stated position that these are more like counterterrorism operations and not war , like against Taliban and al Qaeda and associates .

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Friday that Iran was responsible for an attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.

""Iran did do it,"" he said during a wide-ranging 50-minute interview on Fox News. “It was them that did it.” He also called Iran, ""a nation of terror.""

The president pointed to a video the U.S. military released, Fox News reported, that officials say shows Iran’s Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded limpet mine from one of the oil tankers targeted near the Strait of Hormuz. The video suggests that the Islamic Republic sought to remove evidence of its involvement from the scene.

Iran has denied being involved, accusing the U.S. instead of waging an “Iranophobic campaign” against it.

The U.S. Navy rushed to assist the stricken vessels in the Gulf of Oman, off the coast of Iran, including one that was set ablaze Thursday by an explosion.

The ships’ operators offered no immediate explanation on who or what caused the damage against the Norwegian-owned MT Front Altair and the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous. Each was loaded with petroleum products, and the Front Altair burned for hours, sending up a column of thick, black smoke.

While Iran has denied being involved in the attack, Tehran previously used mines against oil tankers in 1987 and 1988 in the “Tanker War,” when the U.S. Navy escorted ships through the region.

The black-and-white footage, as well as still photographs released by the U.S. military’s Central Command on Friday, appeared to show the limpet mine on the Kokuka Courageous.

A Revolutionary Guard patrol boat pulled alongside the ship and removed the mine, Central Command spokesman Capt. Bill Urban said.

“The U.S. and the international community stand ready to defend our interests, including the freedom of navigation,” Urban said. “The United States has no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East. However, we will defend our interests.”

Iran earlier denied involvement via a statement from its mission to the United Nations.

“The U.S. economic war and terrorism against the Iranian people as well as its massive military presence in the region have been and continue to be the main sources of insecurity and instability in the wider Persian Gulf region and the most significant threat to its peace and security,” the statement said.

national_defense,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/05/obama-un-ambassador-pick-comments/,Obama's UN ambassador pick has history of controversial comments ,2013-06-05,,"The former White House adviser and longtime Obama friend nominated Wednesday as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has a history of controversial comments that could haunt her in confirmation -- including likening U.S. foreign policies to those of the Nazis .
In a March 2003 New Republic magazine essay , Samantha Power wrote that American foreign policy needs a `` historical reckoning '' which would entail `` opening the files '' and `` acknowledging the force of a mantra we have spent the last decade promoting in Guatemala , South Africa , and Yugoslavia . ''
She continued : “ Instituting a doctrine of the mea culpa would enhance our credibility by showing that American decision-makers do not endorse the sins of their predecessors . When ( German Chancellor Willy ) Brandt went down on one knee in the Warsaw ghetto , his gesture was gratifying to World War II survivors , but it was also ennobling and cathartic for Germany . Would such an approach be futile for the United States ? ''
Republicans in the Senate , which must approve Power for the diplomatic post , could press her during her confirmation hearing on a number of other topics , including comments she 's made on Libya and Israel . If confirmed , Power would take over for Susan Rice , whom Obama appointed as his new national security adviser . Rice , unlike Power , will not face a confirmation hearing .
Power , aside from being a well-known foreign policy expert , is also married to Obama 's former regulatory `` czar '' Cass Sunstein .
More On This ... Obama names Susan Rice as national security adviser despite Benghazi controversy
Asked Wednesday if the White House is girding for a contentious confirmation , Press Secretary Jay Carney said , “ We would not expect one . ”
He lauded Power ’ s “ remarkable career ” as a journalist and foreign policy adviser , as well as her “ passion ” for issues like shedding light on genocide .
But others say her views on the Middle East spark concerns about her position on Israel . She once suggested the possibility of military intervention in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute .
During a 2002 interview with Harry Kreisler , host of Conversations with History , a program produced by the University of California Berkeley Institute of International Studies , Power said America needs “ a willingness to actually put something on the line in sort of helping the situation . ''
“ Not of the old , you know , Srebrenica kind or the Rwanda kind , but a meaningful military presence , because it seems to me at this stage -- and this is true of actual genocides as well and not just , you know , major human rights abuses , which we 're seeing there . But -- is that you have to go in as if you 're serious , you have to put something on the line , ” she said .
The Republican Jewish Coalition questioned Power 's nomination saying she `` has a record of statements that are very troubling to Americans who support Israel . ''
`` We urge members of the U.S. Senate to question her closely about her past statements and writings , '' RJC Executive Director Matt Brooks said in a written statement . `` She must respond to the strong doubts about her views raised by that record . Senators should also examine her tenure as head of the President 's Atrocity Prevention Board to see what results , if any , came out of her time there . ''
Carney defended Power ’ s record on Israel , saying she “ consistently led ” against efforts to “ delegitimize ” the nation . He said she consistently has supported Israel ’ s “ right to defend itself , ” worked to block efforts to single out Israel at the U.N. Security Council after the deadly standoff with a Gaza-bound flotilla , and opposed the unilateral push for Palestinian statehood .

In a March 2003 New Republic magazine essay, Samantha Power wrote that American foreign policy needs a ""historical reckoning"" which would entail ""opening the files"" and ""acknowledging the force of a mantra we have spent the last decade promoting in Guatemala, South Africa, and Yugoslavia.""

She continued: “Instituting a doctrine of the mea culpa would enhance our credibility by showing that American decision-makers do not endorse the sins of their predecessors. When (German Chancellor Willy) Brandt went down on one knee in the Warsaw ghetto, his gesture was gratifying to World War II survivors, but it was also ennobling and cathartic for Germany. Would such an approach be futile for the United States?""

Republicans in the Senate, which must approve Power for the diplomatic post, could press her during her confirmation hearing on a number of other topics, including comments she's made on Libya and Israel. If confirmed, Power would take over for Susan Rice, whom Obama appointed as his new national security adviser. Rice, unlike Power, will not face a confirmation hearing.

Power, aside from being a well-known foreign policy expert, is also married to Obama's former regulatory ""czar"" Cass Sunstein.

Asked Wednesday if the White House is girding for a contentious confirmation, Press Secretary Jay Carney said, “We would not expect one.”

He lauded Power’s “remarkable career” as a journalist and foreign policy adviser, as well as her “passion” for issues like shedding light on genocide.

But others say her views on the Middle East spark concerns about her position on Israel. She once suggested the possibility of military intervention in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.

During a 2002 interview with Harry Kreisler, host of Conversations with History, a program produced by the University of California Berkeley Institute of International Studies, Power said America needs “a willingness to actually put something on the line in sort of helping the situation.""

“Not of the old, you know, Srebrenica kind or the Rwanda kind, but a meaningful military presence, because it seems to me at this stage -- and this is true of actual genocides as well and not just, you know, major human rights abuses, which we're seeing there. But -- is that you have to go in as if you're serious, you have to put something on the line,” she said.

The Republican Jewish Coalition questioned Power's nomination saying she ""has a record of statements that are very troubling to Americans who support Israel.""

""We urge members of the U.S. Senate to question her closely about her past statements and writings,"" RJC Executive Director Matt Brooks said in a written statement. ""She must respond to the strong doubts about her views raised by that record. Senators should also examine her tenure as head of the President's Atrocity Prevention Board to see what results, if any, came out of her time there.""

Carney defended Power’s record on Israel, saying she “consistently led” against efforts to “delegitimize” the nation. He said she consistently has supported Israel’s “right to defend itself,” worked to block efforts to single out Israel at the U.N. Security Council after the deadly standoff with a Gaza-bound flotilla, and opposed the unilateral push for Palestinian statehood.

“Samantha Power is a proven friend and supporter of Israel and the U.S.-Israel relationship,” he said.

President Obama, calling her ""experienced, effective and energetic,"" urged the Senate to confirm Power ""without delay.""

Power would come into the role at a time when the U.S. is weighing whether to get more involved in the Syrian civil war. Power is on record supporting the U.S. decision to intervene militarily in Libya in 2011 which ultimately led to the toppling of the country’s leader Muammar Qaddafi.

""But if you are poor and she is telling you some story about how Obama is going to take your job away, maybe it will be more effective. The amount of deceit she has put forward is really unattractive,"" she added.

Power resigned from Obama’s campaign following her comments.

""And I extend my deepest apologies to Senator Clinton, Senator Obama and the remarkable team I have worked with over these long 14 months.""

“I’d be very surprised if they did that. What they want is to have him out of the Army,” he says--not the public outcry that would likely come if Bergdahl faced jail time after five years as a Taliban captive.

“I think they just want to get rid of them, and to send a strong signal that this type of behavior will not be tolerated.”

This behavior includes reportedly leaving his combat outpost, Mest-Lalak, in Paktika Province in dangerous eastern Afghanistan in June, 2009.

Bergdahl was returned to the United States after a prisoner swap that was arranged earlier this year.

It is remains unclear whether Bergdahl intended to return to his outpost, or not.",www.csmonitor.com,center,CIvlrNjsFVOJrtq1

How US has – and hasn’t – changed Afghanistan,2019-12-03,Scott Peterson,"In September , President Donald Trump ended nearly a year of controversial negotiations for a U.S. military pullout with the Taliban , as the talks were on the cusp of agreement . Last week , however , he announced during his first visit to the country that talks would resume . Whatever the U.S. presence remains from here , questions persist about one of the most ambitious nation-building efforts in the post-World War II era : Just how fragile is the change to Afghan society , and what has all that American taxpayer cash left behind ?
But there are contradictions in that progress . Infrastructure projects that were supposed to open doors have been tempered by corruption and mismanagement . And the U.S. presence and money did create a sense of dependency among Afghans .
Once-unthinkable strides have been made in women ’ s rights , education for girls , and the creation of a middle class with high expectations for a civil society .
American troops remain locked in the longest war in U.S. history . Over the course of 18 years in Afghanistan , the United States has spent billions of dollars on the war and to rebuild there . The cumulative effect of the U.S. presence does not reflect the fortune spent , but it has changed the nation .
On a crisp early winter day in late 2003 , Afghan President Hamid Karzai took a pair of scissors from a tray offered by a schoolgirl – she was dressed for the ceremonial occasion in a purple velvet brocade dress with a reddish orange headscarf – and cut a ribbon to officially inaugurate the resurfaced Kabul-Kandahar highway .
On hand was then-U.S . Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad , who recalled in his speech how President George W. Bush had phoned him every other day to push for the first layer of asphalt to be laid on this flagship nation-building enterprise before winter snows set in . Even today , local Afghans call this vital 300-mile stretch of highway the “ Mr . Bush Project . ”
“ There were some problems that we pointed out , but they were ignored , because President Bush would say , ‘ Before the snow falls , the black line should be connected to Kandahar , ’ ” recalls an Afghan engineer who worked on the project for an American company . “ The black line was the first priority ; the second actually was quality , ” the engineer says , noting how U.S. politics had driven the rebuilding timeline . “ But in the next year , too many problems came out ... because of the speed . They pushed too fast . ”
AIJAZ RAHI/AP/FILE Then-President Hamid Karzai ( center , in brown robe ) inaugurates the Kabul-Kandahar highway in 2003 . The road was central to U.S. nation-building efforts but has been wracked by problems .
The highway was portrayed as the symbol of the American commitment to rebuild Afghanistan after decades of war and after U.S. forces orchestrated the ousting of the archconservative Taliban and Al Qaeda in November 2001 , following the 9/11 attacks . Mr. Bush promised the United States would succeed as nation builders . He noted the history of military conflicts in Afghanistan was “ one of initial success followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure , ” but vowed in April 2002 that America was “ not going to repeat that mistake. ” It would instead create a nation “ free from this evil [ that ] is a better place in which to live . ”
Yet the Kabul-Kandahar highway is emblematic of how America ’ s immense ambition in Afghanistan has yielded a mixed result of victories and defeats . The cumulative effect of the U.S. presence here does not reflect the fortune spent , but it clearly has changed the nation – often for the better .
Despite the ribbon-cutting fanfare , this highway would eventually be crushed under the heavy weight of traffic it was not designed to carry . It would split with micro-cracks caused by explosions of roadside bombs and blown-up bridges and culverts . Insecurity also restricted maintenance , as it would hobble the entire U.S. effort .
Indeed , 18 years after they first arrived , U.S. troops remain locked in the longest war in American history , and the cost in blood and treasure has been high . More than 2,400 U.S. military personnel have died since 2001 . And in the first nine months of 2019 alone , the United Nations counts 2,563 Afghan civilians killed .
The Taliban insurgency now controls or has influence across more than half of Afghanistan and is advancing . Yet the price of reconstruction paid by the U.S. has now topped $ 132 billion – never mind the far higher cost of the war itself , which is at least six times greater , official figures show . By comparison , the entire Marshall Plan to rebuild 16 European countries after World War II took some $ 100 billion in today ’ s dollars .
Despite the huge investment , Afghanistan ’ s streets are not paved with gold . There is little here , in fact , that looks like Western Europe : Poverty remains endemic , corruption is chronic , and much of the money poured into rebuilding has been lost , mismanaged , or spent on dubious projects . Persistent insecurity only highlights how the authority of the U.S.-backed government is diminishing .
Yet Afghans note that other , less quantifiable metrics of progress give more reason for optimism . Their nation and society have been irreversibly transformed by the American effort here . Once-unthinkable strides have been made in women ’ s rights , education for girls , and the creation of a middle class with high expectations for a civil society .
The U.S. presence and money , to be sure , did create a sense of dependency among Afghans . It enabled not only corruption , but also the “ thinking that somebody else is going to do your job for you : The Americans are going to come , they are going to build my army , they are going to fight the Taliban and Al Qaeda , they are going to fix my country , ” says Masood Karokhail , director of The Liaison Office , a Kabul-based group that facilitates peace and rebuilding .
At the same time , however , he says that efforts by the U.S. and other donors instilled an Afghan version of the American dream . Afghans now demand more political rights and to live better lives .
“ Those thousands of workshops that happened across the country on women ’ s rights , on youth , freedom ... each of those have left something in our minds , ” says Mr. Karokhail . “ For a country that had been a very traditional , closed society , suddenly it was exploding not only with cash but also information . ”
In September , President Donald Trump ended nearly a year of controversial negotiations for a U.S. military pullout with the Taliban , as the talks were on the cusp of agreement . Last week , however , he announced during his first visit to the country that talks would resume . Whatever U.S. presence remains from here , questions persist about one of the most ambitious nation-building efforts in the post-World War II era : Just how fragile is the change to Afghan society , especially in Kabul and other urban centers , and what has all that American taxpayer cash left behind ?
In 2001 , Afghanistan was certainly a different place . The country was coming out of five years of austere Taliban rule that forbade women from working outside the home , forbade schooling for girls , and even forbade photographic images of a human face . Taliban checkpoints were strewn with confiscated videotapes and music CDs .
Afghans describe their society then as a “ desert ” – hopeless and lost in time .
“ Just the level of human flourishing since the arrival of American troops – you can actually talk about an influx of resources creating babies that don ’ t die , and kids that get educated , ” says Graeme Smith , an Afghanistan analyst for the International Crisis Group , a Brussels-based think tank .
The statistics charting such upward trends are impressive . But they are tempered by “ waste , fraud and abuse ” that U.S. auditors in 2017 said had tarnished 29 % of the $ 52.7 billion in spending they examined .
“ We can ’ t rebuild it into a little America , ” John Sopko , the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction , whose office produces voluminous quarterly reports and audits for Congress , told The Hill , a U.S. political website , in June 2018 . “ I think that was one of the problems . We wanted to turn this into Kansas . ”
“ We designed and funded a lot of programs that the Afghans didn ’ t even know about until we turned it over to them , ” Mr. Sopko said . “ Basically , dollar bills were falling from the sky . ”
The contradictions of progress in Afghanistan – and a lack of it – are evident at the Ariana Kabul Private High School in north Kabul , which teaches 350 students on a shoestring budget . It offers a 50 % discount for girls , to encourage their attendance , and also takes in a number of street kids for free .
“ Most women in our community are illiterate , so if a mother is educated , it will have a direct effect , ” says Laila Dost , the school ’ s director . “ Our policy is to pave the way for poor urban boys and girls . ”
They share the same classrooms and same desks up to the sixth grade . Boys and girls are separated at higher grades . Such a mixed school was impossible under the Taliban in the late 1990s , when one teacher here organized secret classes for girls .
“ Officially it was a holy Quran course , ” recalls Homira Kohi . “ Every student carried a holy Quran in their hand , and their [ regular ] books in their backpack . If the Taliban came , they were to immediately take hold of the Quran . ”
The official Taliban curriculum “ was all about conflict , guns , and bombs , ” she says . Students recited sentences like , “ My father has a gun , and with his gun he goes on jihad. ” Ms. Kohi was excited when the Taliban fell because Afghans thought the militants would be in the country “ forever . ”
“ Every human is struggling for their desire ; we struggled so much for education , ” she says . “ Now there is a huge difference in the desire of the people . ”
But the continuing challenges of the Ariana school are evident in the deeply rutted dirt road in front of the school . A local member of Parliament lives on this street and – even though his son goes to the school – has prevented neighbors from taking up a collection to pave it . He worries that a better road will only make it easier for a suicide car bomber to attack . Ms. Dost herself has paid for gravel to be spread in front of the school when it rains and snows , because politicians “ build big buildings , but only “ think about themselves . ”
In the school ’ s basement , no lighting exists in two classrooms , the library , and a science area where a large periodic table hangs from the wall along with models of the human body – their sexual organs modestly covered with tape .
The rooms are dark because Kabul and 16 provinces , nearly half of the country , were without power in mid-September for the third time in two years . The Taliban sabotaged transmission lines bringing electricity from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan .
Power should be available from the vast $ 335 million Tarakhil Power Plant built by the U.S. to provide the capital city with energy . But the project , completed in 2010 and labeled the “ white elephant of Kabul , ” has proved unsustainable because it requires far more diesel fuel to operate than Afghanistan can afford .
DAVID GOLDMAN/AP/FILE Sayed Rasoul , an engineer , works in the power station at the Kajaki Dam in Afghanistan ’ s Helmand province . Large parts of the country are periodically without power because of disruptions caused by Taliban fighters and poor project choices made by U.S. and Afghan officials .
“ Each hour , that plant uses 40,000 liters ” of diesel , says an electrical engineer with a detailed understanding of the project , who asked not to be named . That would cost $ 35,000 or $ 40,000 per hour , and multiplied by 24 hours , “ it ’ s a huge amount , ” he says .
The Tarakhil plant , he adds , “ was better for Dubai or Saudi Arabia , not for Afghanistan . Because of that , people ask : Why didn ’ t they build three dams with this money ? ” Indeed , the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in 2015 found that Tarakhil was severely underutilized , operated at less than 1 % capacity , and risked becoming a “ catastrophic failure . ”
The U.S. should have known about the difficulty of finding a steady supply of diesel fuel . Soon after the American arrival , another U.S. program sought to bring diesel generators to every village in the country to provide electricity . But most of them were idle within months .
If half the families in a village don ’ t have “ 10 afghanis [ 13 cents ] to buy bread , how do they pay 20 afghanis every night for fuel ? ” asks the Afghan road engineer . “ Actually , 20 afghanis is very little . But for local village people they have no work , no resources , nothing . ”
Stories abound of war profiteering . Afghan contractors and businesspeople have shipped ill-gotten gains to Dubai , United Arab Emirates , and beyond , while ordinary people scratch for bread or risk their lives on the migrant routes to Europe . But such realities mask real positive change in Afghanistan .
“ Donor countries have put blood and treasure into this country , and they have made a lot of sacrifice , ” says Abdallah al-Dardari , the country representative of the United Nations Development Program in Kabul . “ Afghanistan today is not the Afghanistan of 2001 . ”
One result , says Mr. al-Dardari , is that the country “ has done a paradigm shift on the road to democracy , ” which includes political and media freedom .
Another is the “ resilience ” of the society and its institutions . Even though illiteracy and poverty are high , he says , people are much more sophisticated about understanding the importance of development and aid .
Still , U.S. nation builders “ were very ambitious for a very long time , ” says a veteran Western official in Kabul . “ For the amount of money , they got very little . ... Their return on investment is very low , but they did achieve something . ”
On the positive side , the official notes that without the money put into rebuilding the Afghan security forces – despite high casualty rates and corruption – “ we would be worse off , and the Taliban would probably have taken over again by force . ”
U.S. and other donor funding has been instrumental , too , in helping groups such as the Afghan Midwives Association ( AMA ) . Since 2001 , it has helped expand the number of trained Afghan midwives from 467 to 15,000 . It has reduced maternal mortality from 1,600 deaths per 100,000 live births to between 800 and 1,200 deaths .
The improvement is evident in the “ stories ” quilted on 3-by-4-foot cloth , presented by midwives from each province to the AMA , as part of an annual competition . One narrative depicts a woman pregnant with triplets who experienced abnormal bleeding . But she gets the care she needs – and all survive . Two decades ago , the mother and babies would likely have perished , says Farzana Darkhani , AMA ’ s executive director .
“ Fortunately , these cases are [ today ] very easily managed by midwives , ” says Ms. Darkhani . “ Because community awareness has also been improved , they know about the danger signs and can bring mothers to health facilities to take care of them . ”
Fawzia Koofi , a former lawmaker from the province of Badakhshan , has witnessed positive change in the country as well . When her father set up a local school four decades ago , girls had no chance to attend and families were even reluctant to send boys : The fear was they would be forced to serve in the army and learn something that contradicted their values .
“ This is not something you can see because it ’ s not a building , it is not something measurable , ” says Ms. Koofi . “ But if you go to the same community now , even much more remote areas , people come and ask me to build schools for their girls . That is a transformation in the mindset of people , in society . ”
Improving the status of women extends beyond the classroom . Zan TV , or “ Women ’ s TV , ” is a channel that broadcasts shows about women ’ s issues , with the aim of empowering Afghan women . “ If there were still a Taliban regime , it ’ s clear : There would be no Zan TV , no freedom , ” says Shogofa Sediqi , chief executive officer of Zan TV . She also points out that boys forced to wear turbans during the Taliban era are now professors and advisers to the president .

All this means that , as costly as the U.S. support of Afghanistan has been in the 18 years since the toppling of the Taliban , it has wrought significant change in a society gripped by war for decades .
“ The important things that changed are in people ’ s minds , ” says Ms. Sediqi , who notes that when she first chose to be a journalist , her uncles and other relatives were opposed . “ Those who prevented me , now they are proud of me and say , ‘ Your work is great , ’ ” she says . “ Changes start from my own family .

Because of that, people ask: Why didn’t they build three dams with this money?” Indeed, the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in 2015 found that Tarakhil was severely underutilized, operated at less than 1% capacity, and risked becoming a “catastrophic failure.”

The U.S. should have known about the difficulty of finding a steady supply of diesel fuel. Soon after the American arrival, another U.S. program sought to bring diesel generators to every village in the country to provide electricity. But most of them were idle within months.

If half the families in a village don’t have “10 afghanis [13 cents] to buy bread, how do they pay 20 afghanis every night for fuel?” asks the Afghan road engineer. “Actually, 20 afghanis is very little. But for local village people they have no work, no resources, nothing.”

Stories abound of war profiteering. Afghan contractors and businesspeople have shipped ill-gotten gains to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and beyond, while ordinary people scratch for bread or risk their lives on the migrant routes to Europe. But such realities mask real positive change in Afghanistan.

“Donor countries have put blood and treasure into this country, and they have made a lot of sacrifice,” says Abdallah al-Dardari, the country representative of the United Nations Development Program in Kabul. “Afghanistan today is not the Afghanistan of 2001.”

One result, says Mr. al-Dardari, is that the country “has done a paradigm shift on the road to democracy,” which includes political and media freedom.

Another is the “resilience” of the society and its institutions. Even though illiteracy and poverty are high, he says, people are much more sophisticated about understanding the importance of development and aid.

Still, U.S. nation builders “were very ambitious for a very long time,” says a veteran Western official in Kabul. “For the amount of money, they got very little. ... Their return on investment is very low, but they did achieve something.”

On the positive side, the official notes that without the money put into rebuilding the Afghan security forces – despite high casualty rates and corruption – “we would be worse off, and the Taliban would probably have taken over again by force.”

U.S. and other donor funding has been instrumental, too, in helping groups such as the Afghan Midwives Association (AMA). Since 2001, it has helped expand the number of trained Afghan midwives from 467 to 15,000. It has reduced maternal mortality from 1,600 deaths per 100,000 live births to between 800 and 1,200 deaths.

The improvement is evident in the “stories” quilted on 3-by-4-foot cloth, presented by midwives from each province to the AMA, as part of an annual competition. One narrative depicts a woman pregnant with triplets who experienced abnormal bleeding. But she gets the care she needs – and all survive. Two decades ago, the mother and babies would likely have perished, says Farzana Darkhani, AMA’s executive director.

“Fortunately, these cases are [today] very easily managed by midwives,” says Ms. Darkhani. “Because community awareness has also been improved, they know about the danger signs and can bring mothers to health facilities to take care of them.”

SCOTT PETERSON/GETTY IMAGES/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR “If you go to the same community now, even much more remote areas, people come and ask me to build schools for their girls. That is a transformation in the mindset of people, in society.” – Fawzia Koofi, a former lawmaker from Badakhshan province, speaking from her office in Kabul about changes in the country

Fawzia Koofi, a former lawmaker from the province of Badakhshan, has witnessed positive change in the country as well. When her father set up a local school four decades ago, girls had no chance to attend and families were even reluctant to send boys: The fear was they would be forced to serve in the army and learn something that contradicted their values.

“This is not something you can see because it’s not a building, it is not something measurable,” says Ms. Koofi. “But if you go to the same community now, even much more remote areas, people come and ask me to build schools for their girls. That is a transformation in the mindset of people, in society.”

Improving the status of women extends beyond the classroom. Zan TV, or “Women’s TV,” is a channel that broadcasts shows about women’s issues, with the aim of empowering Afghan women. “If there were still a Taliban regime, it’s clear: There would be no Zan TV, no freedom,” says Shogofa Sediqi, chief executive officer of Zan TV. She also points out that boys forced to wear turbans during the Taliban era are now professors and advisers to the president.

All this means that, as costly as the U.S. support of Afghanistan has been in the 18 years since the toppling of the Taliban, it has wrought significant change in a society gripped by war for decades.

“The important things that changed are in people’s minds,” says Ms. Sediqi, who notes that when she first chose to be a journalist, her uncles and other relatives were opposed. “Those who prevented me, now they are proud of me and say, ‘Your work is great,’” she says. “Changes start from my own family. From this, so many minds are changed.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,6l8p6vWvozrVxCK5

A U.S. forces spokesman confirmed the incident in southern Helmand province , hours after President Donald Trump spoke by phone with chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Baradar Akhund on Tuesday , the first known conversation between a U.S. leader and a top Taliban official .
The Taliban fighters “ were actively attacking an ( Afghan National Security Forces ) checkpoint . This was a defensive strike to disrupt the attack , ” Colonel Sonny Leggett , a spokesman for U.S . Forces , Afghanistan , said in a tweet .
He said Washington was committed to peace but would defend Afghan forces if needed .
“ Taliban leadership promised the ( international ) community they would reduce violence and not increase attacks . We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments , ” he said .
In a series of posts on Twitter late on Wednesday , U.S. Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad did not refer to the U.S. strike , but said : “ Increasing violence is a threat to the peace agreement and must be reduced immediately . ”
Khalilzad said the United States was committed to facilitating a prisoner exchange and would “ support each side to release significant numbers . ”
Other U.S. officials appeared to play down the Taliban attacks .
“ There is no attacks on 34 provincial capitals , there is no attacks in Kabul , there ’ s no high profile attacks , there ’ s no suicide bombers , there ’ s no vehicle borne suicide , no attack against the U.S. forces , no attack against coalition , ” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said during a hearing .
“ Yes , there were significant numbers of attacks , small attacks . They were all beaten back , ” Milley said .
The air strike was the first by the United States against the Taliban in 11 days , when a reduction in violence agreement had begun between the sides in the lead up to Saturday ’ s pact .

Since the signing , the Taliban had decided on Monday to resume normal operations against Afghan forces , though sources have said they will continue to hold back on attacks on foreign forces .

A U.S. forces spokesman confirmed the incident in southern Helmand province, hours after President Donald Trump spoke by phone with chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Baradar Akhund on Tuesday, the first known conversation between a U.S. leader and a top Taliban official.

The Taliban fighters “were actively attacking an (Afghan National Security Forces) checkpoint. This was a defensive strike to disrupt the attack,” Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. Forces, Afghanistan, said in a tweet.

He said Washington was committed to peace but would defend Afghan forces if needed.

“Taliban leadership promised the (international) community they would reduce violence and not increase attacks. We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments,” he said.

In a series of posts on Twitter late on Wednesday, U.S. Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad did not refer to the U.S. strike, but said: “Increasing violence is a threat to the peace agreement and must be reduced immediately.”

Khalilzad said the United States was committed to facilitating a prisoner exchange and would “support each side to release significant numbers.”

Other U.S. officials appeared to play down the Taliban attacks.

“There is no attacks on 34 provincial capitals, there is no attacks in Kabul, there’s no high profile attacks, there’s no suicide bombers, there’s no vehicle borne suicide, no attack against the U.S. forces, no attack against coalition,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said during a hearing.

“Yes, there were significant numbers of attacks, small attacks. They were all beaten back,” Milley said.

The air strike was the first by the United States against the Taliban in 11 days, when a reduction in violence agreement had begun between the sides in the lead up to Saturday’s pact.

Since the signing, the Taliban had decided on Monday to resume normal operations against Afghan forces, though sources have said they will continue to hold back on attacks on foreign forces.

The Taliban has declined to confirm or deny responsibility for any of the attacks.

Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said in a Tweet that “according to the plan (the Taliban) is implementing all parts of the agreement one after another in order to keep the fighting reduced.”

A senior Taliban commander in Helmand who declined to be named said that a drone had targeted their position.

“As far as I know we didn’t suffer any human losses but we are working on it and sent our team to the area,” he told Reuters, adding that the group’s senior leadership in Afghanistan had called an emergency meeting to discuss what he described as a “major violation” of the agreement.

“THINGS COULD SPIRAL”

Experts said the public agreement was vague on details around ongoing violence in the country, but that the air strike and comments from U.S. officials suggested the United States had a plan to ensure reduced violence against Afghan forces and civilians.

“It is significant. I don’t think it signals the collapse of the whole U.S.-Taliban agreement ... (but) you can easily see how things could spiral,” said Andrew Watkins, a senior analyst covering Afghanistan at International Crisis Group.

At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance… Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. ” Edward B. Foley , Politico
“ In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid , the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation . There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter. ” Noah Feldman , Bloomberg
“ Trump ’ s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it ’ s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there ’ s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But… ‘ even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. ’ …
“ This conflict must end , now . The House of Representatives calls on the President to put peace before politics , and work with us to advance an enduring solution to end this crisis and save lives. ” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-NY ) , Speaker.gov
“ Expected or not , Donald Trump ’ s veto of a bipartisan Congressional resolution to end US military involvement in Saudi Arabia ’ s murderous war in Yemen is an outrage . It will prolong the unspeakable suffering of millions of Yemeni civilians , the blameless victims of Riyadh ’ s vicious proxy war with Iran and its Houthi allies… Congress should now move heaven and earth , in the name of Yemen ’ s starving children and the majority of Americans who oppose the Saudis ’ war , to override Trump ’ s veto . ” Simon Tisdall , The Guardian
“ Trump , like his predecessors , has taken advantage of a decaying system of checks and balances. ” According to Senator Sanders ( I-VT ) , “ the congressional votes on Yemen represent ‘ the beginning of a national debate over when and where we go to war and Congress ’ s authority over those interventions. ’ For that debate to have meaning , the override vote must take on new meaning . It is about Yemen , of course , but it is also about the role of Congress . This is the point at which Congress can begin to restore checks and balances on issues of war and peace . ” John Nichols , The Nation
“ Trump 's refusal to halt America 's contribution to the world 's most acute humanitarian crisis is utterly indefensible… Equally absurd is Trump 's insistence that the United States is ‘ not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen ’ beyond its counterterrorism operations… Suffice it to say if any foreign country offered intelligence sharing , logistics support , blockade assistance , and refueling for airstrikes on American soil , we would consider that nation ‘ engaged in hostilities in or affecting ’ the United States , and rightly so. ” Bonnie Kristian , The Week
“ The war in Yemen… has killed more than 50,000 people and left more than 20 million Yemenis in need of humanitarian assistance . The US helps the Saudi-led coalition , which also includes the United Arab Emirates and several other Gulf Arab and African countries , by providing them with intelligence , selling them arms and ammunition , and , until late last year , fueling warplanes . That means the US is partially culpable for the death and destruction… “ [ The resolution ] was a clear rebuke of Trump ’ s foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia… the result of progressive antiwar activism and a rare bipartisan coalition of progressive and conservative lawmakers to claw back war-approving authority from the president. ” Tara Golshan , Vox
“ Successive White Houses have pledged to deeply reform America ’ s war on terror ; it 's the follow-through that ’ s underwhelmed . With Bernie Sanders and a resurgent left running strong in the Democratic primary , the president risks having the antiwar vote , such as it is , stolen out from underneath him… the strong-arming of Assange combined with Tuesday ’ s rare veto have some asking what exactly they voted for . ”
“ Trump could have issued a much overdue correction by fully removing the U.S. from a conflict it had no business being involved with from the beginning . This is a man , after all , who campaigned on extricating the U.S. from endless wars with no strategic purpose . Signing the War Powers Resolution Tuesday would have been a win-win-win situation : a win for the president , for the country , and for the Yemeni people . ”
“ The administration very much wants to have things both ways… Supporters of the war are desperate to claim at the same time that U.S. involvement is so meager that it doesn ’ t amount to hostilities but also so vitally important that it must not be ended… if the U.S. role were really as small as they sometimes claim , there would be no danger in ending it , and if it is as significant as they say at other times it is absolutely appropriate for Congress to shut it down because Congress never authorized it . ”
Some argue that `` a declaration of war requires an affirmative act of Congress . A bipartisan majority ’ s rejection of American participation in the Yemeni conflict is anything but an affirmation . And when the Constitution requires congressional affirmation , then congressional rejection can ’ t be vetoed by the president . ”
Supporters of the veto , however , acknowledge that “ Saudi Arabia has caused famine and misery in Yemen .

At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again, Republicans cannot hide behind a claim that they are [the] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment.” Edward B. Foley, Politico

“In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.” Noah Feldman, Bloomberg

“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’…

“This conflict must end, now. The House of Representatives calls on the President to put peace before politics , and work with us to advance an enduring solution to end this crisis and save lives.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-NY), Speaker.gov

“Expected or not, Donald Trump’s veto of a bipartisan Congressional resolution to end US military involvement in Saudi Arabia’s murderous war in Yemen is an outrage. It will prolong the unspeakable suffering of millions of Yemeni civilians, the blameless victims of Riyadh’s vicious proxy war with Iran and its Houthi allies… Congress should now move heaven and earth, in the name of Yemen’s starving children and the majority of Americans who oppose the Saudis’ war, to override Trump’s veto .” Simon Tisdall, The Guardian

“Trump, like his predecessors, has taken advantage of a decaying system of checks and balances.” According to Senator Sanders (I-VT), “the congressional votes on Yemen represent ‘the beginning of a national debate over when and where we go to war and Congress’s authority over those interventions.’ For that debate to have meaning, the override vote must take on new meaning. It is about Yemen, of course, but it is also about the role of Congress. This is the point at which Congress can begin to restore checks and balances on issues of war and peace .” John Nichols, The Nation

“Trump's refusal to halt America's contribution to the world's most acute humanitarian crisis is utterly indefensible… Equally absurd is Trump's insistence that the United States is ‘not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen’ beyond its counterterrorism operations… Suffice it to say if any foreign country offered intelligence sharing, logistics support, blockade assistance, and refueling for airstrikes on American soil , we would consider that nation ‘engaged in hostilities in or affecting’ the United States, and rightly so.” Bonnie Kristian, The Week

“The war in Yemen… has killed more than 50,000 people and left more than 20 million Yemenis in need of humanitarian assistance. The US helps the Saudi-led coalition, which also includes the United Arab Emirates and several other Gulf Arab and African countries, by providing them with intelligence, selling them arms and ammunition, and, until late last year, fueling warplanes. That means the US is partially culpable for the death and destruction… “[The resolution] was a clear rebuke of Trump’s foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia… the result of progressive antiwar activism and a rare bipartisan coalition of progressive and conservative lawmakers to claw back war-approving authority from the president.” Tara Golshan, Vox

From the Right

The right is generally critical of the veto.

“Successive White Houses have pledged to deeply reform America’s war on terror; it's the follow-through that’s underwhelmed. With Bernie Sanders and a resurgent left running strong in the Democratic primary, the president risks having the antiwar vote, such as it is, stolen out from underneath him… the strong-arming of Assange combined with Tuesday’s rare veto have some asking what exactly they voted for.”

Curt Mills, The National Interest

“Trump could have issued a much overdue correction by fully removing the U.S. from a conflict it had no business being involved with from the beginning. This is a man, after all, who campaigned on extricating the U.S. from endless wars with no strategic purpose. Signing the War Powers Resolution Tuesday would have been a win-win-win situation: a win for the president, for the country, and for the Yemeni people.”

Daniel DePetris, Washington Examiner

“The administration very much wants to have things both ways… Supporters of the war are desperate to claim at the same time that U.S. involvement is so meager that it doesn’t amount to hostilities but also so vitally important that it must not be ended… if the U.S. role were really as small as they sometimes claim, there would be no danger in ending it, and if it is as significant as they say at other times it is absolutely appropriate for Congress to shut it down because Congress never authorized it.”

Daniel Larison, The American Conservative

Some argue that ""a declaration of war requires an affirmative act of Congress. A bipartisan majority’s rejection of American participation in the Yemeni conflict is anything but an affirmation. And when the Constitution requires congressional affirmation, then congressional rejection can’t be vetoed by the president.”

David French, National Review

Supporters of the veto, however, acknowledge that “Saudi Arabia has caused famine and misery in Yemen. It has destroyed not just schools but school buses, and prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid… it’s easy to see why members of Congress would want to end U.S. support for the Saudis’ war in Yemen. Nonetheless, this approach is short-sighted. To focus solely on Saudi Arabia’s role in the Yemen conflict is to give Iran a pass for making it worse — by, for example, giving its Houthi clients missiles capable of reaching Riyadh. If the Houthis prevail, then Iran will have access to a port in the Red Sea, from which it can make more mischief in the Middle East…



“It’s not only possible but necessary to criticize the Saudis and their depravities, while still recognizing that it’s better for the U.S. if they prevail in Yemen and help to contain Iran.”

“If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy. In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment.

Whether it succeeded on any of those counts may depend where observers sit on the polarized U.S. political spectrum . But while it was largely a stay-the-course speech rather than one that heralds swift or significant changes to the anti-terrorism approach Obama has pursued throughout his presidency , the President did make several proposals and highlight some evolution in how the United States will go after ISIS in Syria and Iraq .
He notably put the emphasis on Congress to take action on making it more difficult for terrorists to acquire guns in the United States and to enact changes to visa programs in the wake of the San Bernardino attack . Obama also wants lawmakers to finally put the war against ISIS on firm legal footing .
Here is a look at the President 's proposals -- and the chances that they will actually happen .
`` If Congress believes , as I do , that we are at war with ISIL , it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists . ''
The United States has spent more than a year pounding ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria from the air . Obama has sent Special Operations forces to Syria and several thousand soldiers are in Iraq . Now , there are plans for the Pentagon to send a specialized expeditionary force to Iraq to target ISIS . But officially , this is an undeclared war .
The administration has cited authorizations that permitted both the war in Iraq and the fight against al Qaeda to justify its actions but has repeatedly called on Congress to update its mandate to reflect the new threat from ISIS .
Despite Obama 's comments in his address , the White House is not optimistic that Congress will move soon . The administration introduced its proposal in February , hoping to get a jump on the political season . But like much else touching on the war on terror , the presidential and congressional elections in 2016 are now weighing on lawmakers .
Democrats running for re-election are wary of tough votes authorizing a new war that may upset the party 's dovish grass roots .
Republicans do n't like the President 's proposal , but they have n't drafted their own version and punt by saying the administration already claims to have sufficient authority . And there 's a dispute over language . The White House request for an AUMF lasting three years included a provision that prevents `` enduring offensive ground combat operations . ''
Republicans , who want a more robust U.S. effort and are wary of tying the hands of a possible future GOP president , rejected such restrictions .
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday that the version of the authorization that the administration sent to Congress earlier this year would `` limit '' the military , so `` it would have to be something different . ''
`` Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun ... this is a matter of national security . We also need to make it harder for people to buy powerful assault weapons like the ones that were used in San Bernardino . ''
Just as the Newtown massacre and other mass killings did not budge the politics of gun control , the same dynamic applies after San Bernardino -- one reason why Obama is now framing gun control as a matter of `` national security . ''
Making it more difficult for a potential terrorist to buy a gun , in essence , would entail making it more difficult for everyone to buy a gun .
That 's why die-hard Second Amendment supporters in both parties are wary of the idea , with many Republicans and Democrats unenthusiastic about a tough vote on guns in an election year -- especially those from rural districts where gun rights are a potent issue for many voters .
In fact , even the day after the San Bernardino killings , the Republican-controlled Senate rejected a bill that would prevent people on a federal terrorism watch list from buying guns .

House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday told the Wisconsin State Journal in an interview that Obama 's no-fly list plan was a `` distraction , '' saying many people ended up on such databases erroneously and risked losing their due process rights , a concern echoed by some 2016 GOP hopefuls .
McCarthy made it clear Monday that Republicans are not inclined to take up the proposal that the President pushed to deny guns to those on the terror watch list used by airlines .
Some congressional Republicans want a judge to weigh in on whether someone should be on the list before his or her constitutional right to bear arms is taken away .
Obama 's other gun control efforts have repeatedly hit a brick wall in Congress , and he has frequently expressed frustration at his failure to do more despite ordering a series of executive actions . His efforts to pass an assault weapons ban , for instance , failed in 2013 .
The White House is preparing an executive order to expand background checks , given its expectation that nothing will make it through legislatively .
But White House officials say the legal and administrative challenges are difficult to surmount , and that the order is going to take some time to prepare .
And the President has acknowledged that wielding his own executive power can not be as effective as action from Congress .
`` We should put in place stronger screening for those who come to America without a visa so that we can take a hard look at whether they 've traveled to war zones . ''
Obama also said that he had ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and State to review the visa program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country as a fiancee of a U.S. citizen .
The visa waiver program appears to be one rare area where there is bipartisan agreement on how to act . The Paris attacks especially alarmed U.S. security experts because of the fear that thousands of Europeans have traveled to Syria to fight with ISIS . And if those people have European passports , they do n't need a visa to enter the United States , potentially making it possible for ISIS to easily dispatch operatives into the United States .
One measure being considered in the House and likely to get White House support would ensure that nationals of Iraq , Syria , Iran or Sudan , or those who 've visited those countries since 2011 , can not travel to the United States without a visa .
Instead , individuals from designated countries will have to be vetted through a more rigorous process . It requires countries who participate in the visa waiver program to share counterterrorism information or risk being cut out . And it also enhances screening for criminal activity .
The bill is expected to pass with a big bipartisan vote in the House on Tuesday and may be added to broad government spending bills so has a good chance of being signed into law soon .
Still , changing the visa waiver program is fraught with diplomatic complications . Visa-free travel to the United States is a prized privilege for many national governments and is strongly supported by the U.S. tourism industry . And changes to the program could also spark reprisals and complications for Americans who travel abroad .
`` We can not turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam . ''
This horse is already out of the barn . Several prominent GOP presidential candidates -- Donald Trump and Marco Rubio , for instance -- have declared that America is facing a civilizational war against radical Islam . They have bashed Democrats like Obama and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton for not using similar terminology , arguing it shows they do n't comprehend the nature of the threat or prefer to avoid offense rather than accurately delineate the enemy .
The President and his former secretary of state argue that using such terminology stigmatizes every Muslim and actually plays into ISIS 's hands by making it seem like a legitimate representative of a great faith .
This is a dispute that will continue up to the 2016 election and beyond .
`` The threat from terrorism is real , but we will overcome it . We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us . ''
It is not just Congress that Obama sees as frustrating his effort to combat ISIS . The realities of the conflict-torn Middle East , a region festering with sectarian hatred , geopolitical gambits by major nations and a collapse of the political order that has been in place for a century are posing imposing obstacles to U.S. strategy .
On the upside , the President can legitimately claim to have assembled a 65-nation coalition to go after ISIS in a campaign that includes air strikes in Iraq and Syria that have killed thousands of militants , covert intelligence work and an effort to choke the extremist group 's financial network .
But there is a glaring reason why Obama has struggled to effectively sell his strategy : It does not seem sufficiently broad , kinetic or aggressive to accomplish the goal around which he built his speech -- the ultimate destruction of ISIS .
Another factor weighing against a big change in strategy is the self imposed limit that Obama has placed on the entire enterprise . He is staying faithful to his refusal to commit U.S. troops to another major Middle East entanglement -- citing the quagmire that developed after the Iraq War .

Even if the air campaign against ISIS in strongholds like Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq succeeds -- progress may be fleeting without a vast ground force to secure territory , consolidate gains and allow space for the return of administrative politics .
But Western leaders , with Iraq in mind , have little desire or political backing to commit a vast land army .

Obama also wants lawmakers to finally put the war against ISIS on firm legal footing.

Here is a look at the President's proposals -- and the chances that they will actually happen.

Legal framework

What the President said:

""If Congress believes, as I do, that we are at war with ISIL, it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists.""

Its prospects:

The United States has spent more than a year pounding ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria from the air. Obama has sent Special Operations forces to Syria and several thousand soldiers are in Iraq. Now, there are plans for the Pentagon to send a specialized expeditionary force to Iraq to target ISIS. But officially, this is an undeclared war.

The administration has cited authorizations that permitted both the war in Iraq and the fight against al Qaeda to justify its actions but has repeatedly called on Congress to update its mandate to reflect the new threat from ISIS.

But it has not yet happened. Why?

Despite Obama's comments in his address, the White House is not optimistic that Congress will move soon. The administration introduced its proposal in February, hoping to get a jump on the political season. But like much else touching on the war on terror, the presidential and congressional elections in 2016 are now weighing on lawmakers.

And there's a dispute over language. The White House request for an AUMF lasting three years included a provision that prevents ""enduring offensive ground combat operations.""

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday that the version of the authorization that the administration sent to Congress earlier this year would ""limit"" the military, so ""it would have to be something different.""

Guns

The United States officially says it ’ s not going . But even the possibility of an abrupt U.S. withdrawal is seen as an Iranian achievement . “ This is a major , major victory for Iran , ” says Toby Dodge at the London School of Economics . “ If you look at key U.S. allies within the security system , the American troops going home leaves them hugely exposed . ”
“ The killing of Soleimani , however you look at it ... has made it impossible for American troops to remain in our country , ” says an Iraqi official in Baghdad . “ It is the crossing of the boundaries of the coalition. ” At the same time , the official says losing U.S. assistance “ is going to be detrimental to the military institutions that we are trying to stand up . ”
The U.S. military presence in Iraq has been instrumental in leading a Western coalition in the fight against Islamic State and in training Iraqi forces to fight on their own . Analysts say both of those strategic U.S. goals are now in jeopardy in the fevered aftermath of the killing of Iran ’ s Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani .
With his death , Iran ’ s Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani may be about to achieve one goal he strove for in life : Withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq .
Saying the United States had breached Iraqi sovereignty when it assassinated Iran ’ s most powerful general with a drone strike in Baghdad , the Iraqi parliament voted unanimously Sunday , albeit without minority Sunni or Kurdish lawmakers present , for the removal of the remaining 5,500 U.S. troops in the country .
The American military presence has been instrumental in leading a coalition of Western nations in Iraq and Syria to fight the Islamic State ( ISIS ) and in rebuilding and training Iraqi forces to wage that battle on their own .
Analysts say that both of those strategic U.S. goals are now in jeopardy in the fevered aftermath of the killing of General Soleimani . His funeral processions in Iraq and Iran drew millions of devotees , and , in a show of Iranian nationalist unity , drew vows of “ severe revenge . ”
“ The killing of Soleimani , however you look at it , and whatever you think of Qassem Soleimani , has made it impossible for American troops to remain in our country , ” says an Iraqi official in Baghdad who asked not to be named .
“ It ’ s a breach of sovereignty , flying these armed drones without authorization or knowledge of the Iraqi government [ and ] conducting a lethal strike within our country on a foreign official , ” he says . “ It is seen as American overreach . It is the crossing of the boundaries of the coalition . ”
Defense Secretary Mark Esper denied late Monday that the U.S. had decided to withdraw its troops , despite the leak of an unsigned letter from the top U.S. commander in Iraq notifying Baghdad of force movements in the “ coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement . ”
“ We respect your sovereign decision to order our departure , ” wrote U.S. Marine Corps Brig . Gen. William Seely . The Pentagon called the letter a draft and a “ mistake. ” Days earlier , U.S. troops had already suspended the anti-ISIS fight to harden their positions against the risk of attack from Iran or its loyalist allies .
Even the possibility of an abrupt American withdrawal from Iraq – not on Washington ’ s terms , but forced by Iraqi leaders – was being seen by some as a “ victory ” for Iran . The U.S. has invested $ 1 trillion and some 4,500 American lives to create , as initially envisioned , a pro-American , democratic bastion in the Middle East .
Those aspirations evaporated long ago , after years of U.S. missteps in Iraq were met with violent chaos and insurgency , resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis . A two-volume , 1,300-page U.S. Army study of the Iraq war published in 2018 found that “ an emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor . ”
Tuesday , the burial of the Iranian commander who did much to orchestrate that outcome was delayed , after more than 50 mourners were killed in a crush in his home city of Kerman , in central Iran .
On Monday , Iran ’ s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei openly wept at General Soleimani ’ s coffin , as he led prayers in Tehran . Eulogies praised the general as a national hero and “ martyr ” for the axis of resistance he did so much to create against the influence of the U.S. and its regional allies .
Now his killing is triggering a fundamental reassessment of the American military presence in Iraq and beyond that analysts say will undermine the fight against a rejuvenating ISIS and leave Iraq and its security forces increasingly vulnerable to pressure from Iran ’ s proxies .
“ Soleimani ’ s legacy was that the big plan to attack U.S. bases was to trap the Americans into an overblown military response , and no one realized how overblown it would be , ” says Prof. Toby Dodge , an Iraq expert at the London School of Economics .
“ This is a major , major victory for Iran . And it means key [ U.S.-Iran ] balance players , from the [ Iraqi ] president on down , will now have to run for hiding , because they can ’ t reach out to the West and forge a new alliance , ” says Professor Dodge , who visits Iraq several times a year .
“ If you look at key U.S. allies within the security system , the American troops going home leaves them hugely exposed and without much courage that things are going to get better . ”
At a stroke , the anti-Iran sentiment that grew during months of anti-government protests in Baghdad , leading to attacks on Iranian consulates and pro-Iran parties in Shiite cities across the south , has been replaced in the headlines by anti-American feeling .
The anti-U.S. backlash began after a Dec. 29 American missile strike on the Iran-backed Kata ’ ib Hezbollah militia , killing 25 . Its members , in turn , attacked the U.S. Embassy , breaching and burning its outer walls .
Now political reforms demanded by Iraqi protesters have , at best , been put on the back burner as the shockwaves reverberate from the assassination .
And the ramifications of forcing out U.S. troops would be profound for Iraq , where the initial American withdrawal in 2011 – after the 2003 invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein and the attempts to rebuild state and military institutions – led to deeply pro-Shiite sectarian politics . Those paved the way in 2014 for the Sunni jihadist onslaught of ISIS .
General Soleimani is credited by many Iraqis for swiftly intervening to save Baghdad from ISIS by providing materiel and advisers and for supporting a popular mobilization force that would turn into the powerful Iran-backed Shiite militias in the country today .
But it has been the systematic American-led effort to rebuild and train the Iraqi security forces , which disintegrated in the face of the ISIS advance , that will be critical for Iraq ’ s future . U.S. and coalition airpower was also instrumental in driving back ISIS .
“ We have seen during the war against ISIS just how effective coalition training is , and how the most successful troops in battle were the ones trained by the coalition , ” says the Iraqi official . “ To lose that support is not a good thing for Iraq . It is going to be detrimental to the military institutions that we are trying to stand up , which are still nascent , which still need training wheels as they learn to ride their bike . ”
Indeed , Iraqi forces are still far from self-sufficient despite years of U.S. funding and training , according to the quarterly U.S. military inspector general ’ s report to Congress published in October .
Iraqi forces ’ ability to “ find and fix ” a target remains a “ major shortfall , ” the report found , and noted that “ exploitation capability is ‘ virtually non-existent ’ without Coalition assistance . ”
Iraq ’ s acting prime minister , Adil Abdul-Mahdi – who owed his position to a deal brokered by General Soleimani , and who officially resigned last November in the face of the street protests – told parliament Sunday that “ urgent measures ” were needed to remove U.S. forces from Iraq .
President Donald Trump reacted angrily to the Iraqi parliament move . He said if Iraq kicked out U.S. troops , it should be made to repay “ billions ” of dollars spent on Al-Balad airbase – though far less was spent on that base and , according to a 2008 agreement , all U.S. military infrastructure left behind when the U.S. first withdrew in 2011 became Iraqi .
Mr. Trump also vowed to impose sanctions on Iraq heavier than those now imposed on Iran , which are crippling Iran ’ s economy . That is a sensitive subject for Iraqis , who often blame tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other Western nations on Iraq during the last 13 years of Saddam Hussein ’ s rule for the deaths of half a million Iraqi children .
At the very least , analysts say , Washington is unlikely to renew Iraq ’ s waiver from U.S. sanctions on Iran when they come up for renewal next month . That result alone could affect everything from the critical supply of Iranian electricity to Iraq , to preventing trade using dollars .

On Monday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei openly wept at General Soleimani’s coffin, as he led prayers in Tehran.

Susan Rice can’t do any of those things.

She has zero credibility with the media, on Capitol Hill, with the foreign policy community and foreign leaders, and is so badly tarnished by the Benghazi scandal that she walks into the job on Day One weak and wounded.

The most obvious problem is her disastrous performance on the Sunday talk shows peddling the administration’s fairy tale on Benghazi; when she was either complicit in the cover-up or incompetent.

Either she knew what really happened and deliberately lied to the American people or she was a mere actress who read the script she was given and didn’t know enough to question whether the words she spoke were accurate.

Rice might have been able to overcome the Benghazi debacle if she had other strong credentials, for example being a senior military officer like Colin Powell and Brent Scowcroft, or a respected academic like Henry Kissinger and Zbig Brzezinski. But Susan Rice is none of these.

When the spotlight was on her at the U.N. she was an ineffective ambassador who couldn't get Russia or China on board to deal with Syria or impose strict sanctions against Iran.

Not only did she fail to persuade those key members of the Security Council, she didn't know it until after the votes on sanctions were taken!



Benghazi was supposed to be her audition for the Secretary of State job -- go on all the Sunday talk shows and be the Obama administration’s primary spokesman.

She was so eager for the try out that she didn't stop and ask why they wanted her. The decision to send someone from the administration to appear on all five talk shows is a decision made at the highest levels of the White House.

It should have been the Secretary of State, or maybe Secretary of Defense, or CIA chief, or NSC Adviser or White House Chief of Staff – they were part of the decision process.

Susan Rice was the one senior administration official who knew nothing about events leading up to Benghazi and the attack itself, yet the White House asked her to go on those shows?

Alarm bells should have gone off in her head!

I checked their schedules and most of the other senior officials were in Washington and available that morning. It’s just that they were smarter than Rice and realized it was a poisoned chalice.



So what is Obama thinking with the Rice appointment? He’s doubling down and circling the wagons. He's rewarding Rice for being a loyal (if incompetent) soldier. He is hanging tough on the scandals and claiming that he knew nothing about them until he read about them in the papers.

On the other hand, maybe Obama's appointment of Rice is smarter than it looks on the surface.

By appointing Rice to the NSC job the president can invoke executive privilege and claim she doesn’t have to testify on Capitol Hill. And even if she does talk about Benghazi, at some point, she will certainly be a loyal soldier if she is now sitting just steps from the Oval Office.

“By declaring that the United States will respond with airstrikes to any attacks on American targets or assets, Mr. Trump is drawing a bright red line that Iran cannot cross. And yet, Iran relies on a network of proxy actors from Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Must they all respect Mr. Trump’s red line? There are plenty of hotheads in those proxy forces that will be incensed by the assassination, the same way young men with weapons and minimal discipline often are… Mr. Trump can’t keep an entire region from crossing his red line, making violent conflict all the more likely if the president holds to it… ‍ “It is crucial that influential Republican senators like Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Mitch McConnell remind Mr. Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and keep Mr. Trump from stumbling further into war with Iran.”
