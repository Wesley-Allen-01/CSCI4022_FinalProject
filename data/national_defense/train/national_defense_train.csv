The Pentagon has said US troops are being deployed to Saudi Arabia to defend American interests from ""emergent credible threats"".

The move comes amid heightened tensions with Iran over the safety of shipping lanes in the Gulf.

Saudi Arabia confirmed that King Salman had approved the move ""to strengthen regional security and stability"".

What's the background?

Tensions between the US and Iran have worsened since Washington unilaterally withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. The US has since tightened sanctions it re-imposed on Iran's oil sector.

Last month, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz, accusing it of violating Iranian airspace. The US insisted the drone had been over international waters at the time, and condemned it as an unprovoked attack.

The US has also called on Iran to release a Panamanian-flagged tanker and 12 of its crew, which was seized by Revolutionary Guards on Sunday during a naval patrol. Iran said the vessel had been smuggling fuel.

Then on Thursday President Donald Trump said a US warship had destroyed an Iranian drone that came too close. Iran has denied losing a drone.

This dawning realization is forcing the Obama administrations to consider `` a whole new approach '' to the domestic terror threat , Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told The New York Times Saturday .

The US launched a cyber-attack on Iranian weapons systems on Thursday as President Trump pulled out of air strikes on the country, US reports say.

The cyber-attack disabled computer systems controlling rocket and missile launchers, the Washington Post said.

It was in retaliation for the shooting down of a US drone as well as attacks on oil tankers that the US has blamed Iran for, the New York Times said.

There is no independent confirmation of damage to Iranian systems.

The US is set to impose further sanctions on Iran that President Trump has described as ""major"".

He said the sanctions were needed to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and economic pressure would be maintained unless Tehran changed course.

Speaking in Jerusalem, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said the details of the new sanctions were likely to be announced on Monday.

Nobody had granted Iran ""a hunting licence in the Middle East,"" he added.

Tensions between the US and Iran have risen since the US last year pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reinstated sanctions, triggering economic meltdown in Iran.

Last week Iran said it would exceed internationally agreed limits on its nuclear programme.

Mr Trump has said he does not want war with Iran, but warned the country would face ""obliteration"" if conflict broke out.

What did the US cyber-attack do?

The attack had been planned for several weeks, the sources told US media outlets, and was suggested as a way of responding to the mine attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman.

It was aimed at weapons systems used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which shot down the US drone last Thursday and which the US says also attacked the tankers.

Both the Washington Post and AP news agency said the cyber-attack had disabled the systems. The New York Times said it was intended to take the systems offline for a period of time.

On Saturday the US Department for Homeland Security warned that Iran was stepping up its own cyber-attacks on the US.

Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said ""malicious cyberactivity"" was being directed at US industries and government agencies by ""Iranian regime actors and their proxies"".

They were using ""destructive 'wiper' attacks"", he said, using tactics such as ""spear phishing, password spraying and credential stuffing"" in a bid to take control of entire networks.

Iran has also been trying to hack US naval ship systems, the Washington Post reported.

What has Trump said?

He hasn't commented on the cyber-attack reports. On Friday he said he had pulled out of launching conventional strikes on Iran because he had been told that 150 Iranians would be killed.

How have US sanctions hit Iran?

The reinstatement of US sanctions last year - particularly those imposed on the energy, shipping and financial sectors - caused foreign investment to dry up and hit oil exports.

The sanctions bar US companies from trading with Iran, but also with foreign firms or countries that are dealing with Iran.

This has led to shortages of imported goods and products that are made with raw materials from abroad, most notably babies' nappies.

The plunging value of the rial has also affected the cost of locally produced staples such as meat and eggs, which have soared in price.

What happened to the US drone?

Iran's IRGC said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"".

But US military officials maintain the drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at the time.

Interested in North Korea ? Add North Korea as an interest to stay up to date on the latest North Korea news , video , and analysis from ███ . Add Interest
The test occurred just days after the North Korean regime launched its ninth missile this year . U.S. officials say today 's test had been planned for years .
The ground-based interceptor launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California shortly after 3:30 p.m . ET . A little more than one hour later , the Pentagon confirmed that it had successfully collided with an ICBM-class target over the Pacific Ocean .
The ICBM-target was launched from the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands , 4,200 miles away .
`` The intercept of a complex , threat-representative ICBM target is an incredible accomplishment for the GMD [ Ground-based Missile Defense ] system and a critical milestone for this program , '' said Missile Defense Agency Director Vice Adm. Jim Syring . `` This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland , and this test demonstrates that we have a capable , credible deterrent against a very real threat . I am incredibly proud of the warfighters who executed this test and who operate this system every day . ''
The ground-based interceptor system is mainly designed to counter a North Korean missile threat , but a U.S. official said Tuesday 's long-scheduled test was coincidental to North Korea 's increased missile testing this year .
This was the 18th test of the ground-based interceptor . The last one , in June 2014 , was the first success since 2008 . The system was nine for 17 since 1999 with other types of shorter-range target missiles . Tuesday 's ICBM target had never been tested before .
There are 32 ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely , Alaska , and four at Vandenberg .
The Missile Defense Agency said in its 2018 fiscal year budget overview that it would deploy eight additional ground-based interceptors in Alaska by the end of 2017 , for a total of 44 , `` to improve protection against North Korean and potential Iranian ICBM threats as they emerge . ''
The U.S. tests its ICBMs about twice every year . Earlier this month , the Air Force Global Strike Command test-launched an unarmed Minuteman III ICBM equipped with a single test re-entry vehicle from Vandenberg . The re-entry vehicle landed at Kwajalein Atoll .
`` These test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system , providing valuable data to ensure a continued safe , secure and effective nuclear deterrent , '' the Air Force Global Strike Command said in a statement .
North Korea has spent the last decade working to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the continental United States . Though North Korea has conducted nine missiles tests in 2017 , none have been ICBMs .
The ground-based interceptor being tested Tuesday is different from the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system deployed in South Korea , which is designed to intercept missiles at a lower altitude in their terminal stage .
The last test North Korea conducted , on May 28 , was assessed as a short-range ballistic missile , which landed in the Sea of Japan , according to U.S. Pacific Command .
Two weeks earlier , North Korea tested a KN-17 medium-range ballistic missile , the first successful launch of its kind for the nation .
The Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada told reporters that the missile reached an unprecedented altitude of 1,245 miles . Experts said the missile would have flown much farther if it had been launched on a maximum trajectory — perhaps capable of reaching U.S. military bases in Guam .","The U.S. has ""successfully intercepted"" an intercontinental ballistic missile during the first test of its ground-based intercept system, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said Tuesday.

Jim Syring. ""This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat. I am incredibly proud of the warfighters who executed this test and who operate this system every day.""

The ground-based interceptor system is mainly designed to counter a North Korean missile threat, but a U.S. official said Tuesday's long-scheduled test was coincidental to North Korea's increased missile testing this year.

This was the 18th test of the ground-based interceptor. The last one, in June 2014, was the first success since 2008. The system was nine for 17 since 1999 with other types of shorter-range target missiles. Tuesday's ICBM target had never been tested before.

There are 32 ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, and four at Vandenberg.

The Missile Defense Agency said in its 2018 fiscal year budget overview that it would deploy eight additional ground-based interceptors in Alaska by the end of 2017, for a total of 44, ""to improve protection against North Korean and potential Iranian ICBM threats as they emerge.""

The U.S. tests its ICBMs about twice every year. Earlier this month, the Air Force Global Strike Command test-launched an unarmed Minuteman III ICBM equipped with a single test re-entry vehicle from Vandenberg. The re-entry vehicle landed at Kwajalein Atoll.

""These test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, providing valuable data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent,"" the Air Force Global Strike Command said in a statement.

Growing threat from North Korea

North Korea has spent the last decade working to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the continental United States. Though North Korea has conducted nine missiles tests in 2017, none have been ICBMs.

The ground-based interceptor being tested Tuesday is different from the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system deployed in South Korea, which is designed to intercept missiles at a lower altitude in their terminal stage.

The last test North Korea conducted, on May 28, was assessed as a short-range ballistic missile, which landed in the Sea of Japan, according to U.S. Pacific Command.

Two weeks earlier, North Korea tested a KN-17 medium-range ballistic missile, the first successful launch of its kind for the nation.

The Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada told reporters that the missile reached an unprecedented altitude of 1,245 miles. Experts said the missile would have flown much farther if it had been launched on a maximum trajectory — perhaps capable of reaching U.S. military bases in Guam.",www.abcnews.go.com,left,mPVHriWgY3ZpTLjj

“ There ’ s a level of dissatisfaction among the uniformed military that I ’ ve never seen in my time here , ” said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain in an interview . “ For some of us who are a little older , let ’ s go back and read the Pentagon Papers — what the administration is doing is the kind of incrementalism that defined much of the Vietnam conflict . ”
The Arizona Republican is known as a fierce critic of President Obama ’ s foreign policy , but his complaints were echoed by an unlikely source : Rep. Adam Smith , the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee .
“ Frustration among the uniformed service is real , ” the Washington Democrat said , adding that the administration “ does keep things in the White House and has not been more inclusive in the decision-making process . ”
But Mr. Smith also defended the administration ’ s overall approach to the troubled Middle East , arguing that the “ sheer complexity of the situation ” following the Arab Spring and the rise of the Islamic State — also known as ISIS — have defied a simple U.S. solution . “ I don ’ t think dropping 50,000 U.S. troops down is going to fix the situation , ” he said .
Both lawmakers made their comments in interviews with The ███ this week ahead of Saturday ’ s third annual Reagan National Defense Forum , a summit expected to feature much soul-searching about America ’ s current role in the Middle East and beyond among officials and analysts from both inside and outside the administration .

Bush administration officials as Condoleezza Rice . While Mr. Heubusch told The Times that the hope is “ to create a dialogue without partisanship , ” he also said a key underpinning of the forum is to get people reflecting on what Ronald Reagan became known for more than anything else in his time in office — his success in bringing an end to the Cold War . ”
“ And he did that , ” Mr. Heubusch said , “ through his whole peace through strength strategy . ”
Mr. Smith said Republican leaders deserve a fair share of the blame for the polarized debate because of what he said was political posturing against nearly every aspect of President Obama ’ s Middle East policy .
Some of the attacks are so derisive , he said , that they have effectively crippled the prospects for serious national security discussions on Capitol Hill .
“ I don ’ t think [ Sen. McCain ] falls into this — but there are others , and they criticize everything the administration does . They criticize [ the president ] for taking out [ former Libyan strongman Moammar ] Gadhafi and for not taking out [ Syrian President Bashar ] Assad . There ’ s just a lot of partisanship on the Republican side that contributes to the discord over the current Syria policy and they deny the fact that they do not have much of an answer themselves for what should be done differently . ”
But Mr. McCain argued that the frustration on Capitol Hill and at the Pentagon stems from the administration ’ s “ complete lack of any kind of coherent strategy , much less a strategy that would have any success on the battlefield ” against Islamic State and the Assad regime .
“ We ’ re sending 50 — count them , 50 — special operations soldiers to Syria , and they will have ‘ no combat role , ’ the president says , ” said Mr. McCain . “ Well , what are they being sent there for ? To be recreation officers ? You ’ re in a combat zone , and to say they ’ re not in combat is absurd . ”
But the White House , he argued , has effectively blinded itself to such absurdities by promoting a system over the past seven years that suppresses dissenting voices . “ Compliant and easily led military leaders get promoted , ” he said . “ People who have spoken truth to power get retired . ”
He pointed to the cases of Marine Gen. James Mattis , reportedly dismissed as head of U.S. Central Command in 2013 for pressuring civilian officials in the White House on potential military options against Iran ; and Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn , allegedly pushed out as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency last year amid clashes with the White House over his leadership style .
When it comes to actual policy , Mr. McCain lamented , the administration pursues half-measures and decisions , “ when they are made , consistently disregard recommendations from the uniformed military . ”
Such recommendations , he argued , often get overridden by National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice and Senior Adviser to the President Valerie Jarrett , both of whom are close to the president .
The White House this week tried to go on the offensive over its decision not to engage more deeply in the Middle East ’ s wars — dispatching Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Ben Rhodes to talk at a highly publicized “ Defense One ” summit in Washington .
“ The fact of the matter is , the United States could spend every last resource we have in the Middle East , ” Mr. Rhodes said at the summit . “ There could be a justification for us to take complete ownership of events in Syria , of events in Yemen , of events in Iraq . The question is , is that smart strategy ? Does that make sense ?
“ The president ’ s judgment is , it doesn ’ t , ” he said , adding that “ if you spent a trillion dollars in Iraq over a decade with 150,000 U.S. troops serving there and Iraq is in the situation it is today , what leads you to believe that there is some resource allocation from the United States that ’ s going to put Syria back together in the near future ? ”
Some lawmakers , particularly hawks on the Republican side , complain that administration officials like Mr. Rhodes falsely present America ’ s options in all-or-nothing terms as an excuse not to take forceful action .
“ Sometimes indecision , the decision not to make a decision , is itself a choice , ” House Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman Edward R. Royce , California Republican , said at a hearing this week . “ The choice was made in the United States not to stop [ Islamic State ] when it could have been stopped . ”
The failure to break Islamic State ’ s hold on Syria and Iraq , and its spread into North Africa , have resulted in “ very poisoned relations that now exist between many in both houses of Congress and the president , ” said Mr. McCain . “ There ’ s a total lack of confidence in the president ’ s leadership , ” he said .
Mr. McCain said Mr. Obama ’ s past claims that things were improving in the region have undercut his credibility today .
“ All you have to do is look at a map of the Middle East in 2009 and then compare it to a map of today , ” he said .
Polls also suggest American voters are increasingly wary of the administration ’ s response to the wars in Syria , Iraq and Libya , which have killed more than a quarter-million people and spawned a vast refugee crisis stretching into Europe during recent years .

In search of a strategy

Hypersonics are generally defined as missiles that can fly more than five times the speed of sound .
Gen. John Hyten , commander of U.S. Strategic Command , last week described a hypersonic as a missile that starts out “ like a ballistic missile , but then it depresses the trajectory and then flies more like a cruise missile or an airplane . So it goes up into the low reaches of space , and then turns immediately back down and then levels out and flies at a very high level of speed . ”
In November , China reportedly conducted two tests of a ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle that U.S. assessments expect to reach initial operating capability around 2020 . The country had already conducted at least seven tests of experimental systems from 2014 to 2016 .
Meanwhile , earlier this month , Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a flashy state of the nation address to tout a slate of new weapons , including a hypersonic missile he claimed was “ invincible ” against U.S. missile defenses .

The U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said a U.S. warship successfully shot down a medium-range ballistic missile in a test off Hawaii on Wednesday, as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to press ahead with more missile tests in the Pacific.

The USS John Paul Jones detected and tracked a missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai with its onboard radar, before intercepting it with SM-6 missiles, the MDA said.

It said it marked the second time an SM-6 missile has successfully intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile in a test.

MDA Director Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves said the test marked a ""key milestone.""

""We will continue developing ballistic missile defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves,"" Greaves said in a statement.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will meet Wednesday at the Pentagon with South Korea's Defense Minister Song Young-moo, the Pentagon said. The two will discuss possible responses to North Korea's provocative actions, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.

North Korea on Wednesday released images of its intermediate-range ballistic missile launch over Japan a day before.

The official Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday that the Hwasong-12, the first missile the nation has fired over Japan, was “guided” by leader Kim Jong Un and observed by senior officials.

“Involved in the drill were Hwasong artillery units…tasked with striking the bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces located in the Pacific operational theater,” the KCNA reported.

It said the launch of the intermediate-range rocket was “part of the muscle-flexing” in reaction to ongoing military drills by the U.S. and South Korea, “in disregard” for Pyongyang’s “meaningful and crucial warning.”

The North sees the military exercises as a preparation for war.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile traveled nearly 1,700 miles and reached a maximum height of 341 miles as it flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido early Tuesday.

Kim expressed ""great satisfaction"" with what he called a “meaningful prelude” to containing the U.S. territory of Guam, which he has threatened to fire four missiles toward.

President Trump warned Tuesday that ""all options are on the table"" in response to North Korea's latest missile launch. A military one seems unlikely, security analysts said.

The U.N. Security Council said it “strongly condemns” the missile test and the North’s launching of three ballistic missiles into the sea on Aug. 25. It demanded that Pyongyang “immediately cease all such actions” in a statement following an emergency meeting Tuesday. It did not announce new sanctions.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his country will “fully and completely” abide by U.N. Security Council sanctions and would work with other council members on how best to react to the North’s latest action.

“We will make a necessary response,” Wang said. China, North Korea’s most important ally, accounts for about 90% of the North’s foreign trade.

“We think that China has a role to play and we’d encourage China to do everything it can to bring pressure on North Korea to stop this,” she said.

Maj. Gen. William Gayler , director of operations for Africa Command , told The Associated Press that the strike targeted the al-Shabab extremist group , noting that two members of the al Qaeda-linked group were killed in the strike along with the civilians .
Gayler added that the military investigated the Feb. 23 , 2019 , strike due to online allegations of civilian casualties , and that footage showed what appeared to be a civilian being carried away from the site strike .
“ We didn ’ t see the other individual or the wounded individuals . But because we ’ re trying to be transparent and as open as we can , when we know that we ’ ve more likely than not killed the one male , why would we dispute the other killed and three wounded , ” he told the news service .

Gayler said , however , the investigation was inordinately long and that Gen. Stephen Townsend , head of Africa Command , has been insistent that future investigations must be finished more quickly and that the command must complete quarterly reports on civilian casualty allegations the same way U.S. Central Command does in the Middle East .
“ While we follow very precise and rigorous standards , in instances where we fail to meet our expectations , we will admit the mistake , ” Townsend said in the report . “ We have the highest respect for our Somali friends , and we are deeply sorry this occurred . ”
Africa Command said in the report that its investigation `` assessed the deaths and injuries occurred due to the effects of U.S. munitions or secondary explosions caused by explosives stored by al-Shabaab at the location of the strike . ''
`` In adherence to established procedures , the command has notified the Federal Government of Somalia and appropriate U.S. authorities verifying the credibility of the allegations and the fact that two civilians were unintentionally killed and three were injured as a result of an airstrike , '' it added .

national_defense,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/vindman-testimony-trump-national-security-000305,NSC official testifies Trump undermined national security with Ukraine pressure,2019-10-28,"Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle, Kyle Cheney","Vindman , who became the first White House official to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry , also wrote that he reported Trump ’ s July 25 phone call with Zelensky to the NSC ’ s top lawyer after listening in on the conversation from the White House Situation Room alongside other national security officials .
It was the second time Vindman had raised concerns to the NSC ’ s lead counsel about a campaign by Trump , his associates and some U.S. officials to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations intended to benefit Trump politically .
“ I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma , it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained , ” Vindman wrote . Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member .
“ This would all undermine U.S. national security , ” Vindman added . “ Following the call , I again reported my concerns to NSC ’ s lead counsel . ”
Vindman , an Army combat veteran who served in Iraq , became the first official who listened in on Trump ’ s phone call with Zelensky to speak with investigators , providing a firsthand account of what House Democrats have said is a blatant abuse of power by the president . His opening statement leans heavily on his military service and a “ sense of duty ” to his country .
“ I am a patriot , and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country , irrespective of party or politics , ” Vindman wrote in his opening statement , adding his family fled the Soviet Union when he was just 3½ . Vindman was also wounded by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq and received a Purple Heart .
“ As an active duty military officer , the command structure is extremely important to me , ” Vindman wrote , defending his decisions to express his concerns about Trump to his higher-ups . “ On many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities . ”
Ahead of Vindman ’ s testimony , Trump railed against the senior official on Twitter , calling the officer a “ Never Trumper ” and saying he had “ never even heard of ” Vindman .
The Trump-Zelensky phone call is at the center of House Democrats ’ impeachment inquiry . Investigators have gathered evidence that Trump sought to withhold nearly $ 400 million of critical military aid to Ukraine and refuse a White House meeting with Zelensky until the Ukrainian leader publicly stated his intention to launch Trump ’ s desired investigations .
Vindman also wrote that he would appear before investigators under subpoena — an indication the White House tried to prevent him from testifying . He also told investigators he is not the whistleblower who reported concerns about the White House handling of Ukraine to the intelligence community ’ s inspector general — though many of his concerns mirror the complaint that put the House on a path toward impeachment .
Democratic lawmakers have accused Republicans of using the closed-door depositions to learn the name of the whistleblower , who Trump ’ s GOP allies believe should be interviewed and publicly identified .
Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan , the top Republican on the Oversight Committee , told reporters that Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) was preventing GOP lawmakers from pressing Vindman on whom he spoke with after Trump ’ s call with Zelensky .

“ Following the debriefing meeting , I reported my concerns to the NSC ’ s lead counsel , ” Vindman wrote . “ Dr . Hill also reported the incident to the NSC ’ s lead counsel . ”
Sondland , for his part , told lawmakers earlier this month he did not remember discussing the Bidens with State Department or White House officials .
“ I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son , nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens , ” Sondland said .
Hill testified earlier this month that she met with NSC lawyer John Eisenberg twice , at Bolton ’ s urging , to relay similar concerns . Both Vindman and Hill met with NSC lawyers on the same day , July 10 , after Bolton abruptly ended the meeting with Ukraine ’ s top national security official , Oleksandr Danylyuk .
Vindman ’ s testimony also appears to corroborate aspects of William Taylor ’ s testimony before impeachment investigators last week .

His and Vindman ’ s postures represent a stark contrast with that of Charles Kupperman , a former Bolton aide who was deemed by the White House to be “ absolutely immune ” from testifying because of his proximity to Trump . Kupperman refused to comply with a House subpoena on Monday and is seeking a court order about whether to defer to the White House or Congress .","Vindman, who became the first White House official to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry, also wrote that he reported Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky to the NSC’s top lawyer after listening in on the conversation from the White House Situation Room alongside other national security officials.

It was the second time Vindman had raised concerns to the NSC’s lead counsel about a campaign by Trump, his associates and some U.S. officials to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations intended to benefit Trump politically.

“I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,” Vindman wrote. Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member.

“This would all undermine U.S. national security,” Vindman added. “Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC’s lead counsel.”

Vindman, an Army combat veteran who served in Iraq, became the first official who listened in on Trump’s phone call with Zelensky to speak with investigators, providing a firsthand account of what House Democrats have said is a blatant abuse of power by the president. His opening statement leans heavily on his military service and a “sense of duty” to his country.

“I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,” Vindman wrote in his opening statement, adding his family fled the Soviet Union when he was just 3½. Vindman was also wounded by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq and received a Purple Heart.

“As an active duty military officer, the command structure is extremely important to me,” Vindman wrote, defending his decisions to express his concerns about Trump to his higher-ups. “On many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities.”

Ahead of Vindman’s testimony, Trump railed against the senior official on Twitter, calling the officer a “Never Trumper” and saying he had “never even heard of” Vindman.

The Trump-Zelensky phone call is at the center of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Investigators have gathered evidence that Trump sought to withhold nearly $400 million of critical military aid to Ukraine and refuse a White House meeting with Zelensky until the Ukrainian leader publicly stated his intention to launch Trump’s desired investigations.

Vindman also wrote that he would appear before investigators under subpoena — an indication the White House tried to prevent him from testifying. He also told investigators he is not the whistleblower who reported concerns about the White House handling of Ukraine to the intelligence community’s inspector general — though many of his concerns mirror the complaint that put the House on a path toward impeachment.

Democratic lawmakers have accused Republicans of using the closed-door depositions to learn the name of the whistleblower, who Trump’s GOP allies believe should be interviewed and publicly identified.

Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, told reporters that Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was preventing GOP lawmakers from pressing Vindman on whom he spoke with after Trump’s call with Zelensky.

“When there’s a subpoena from Congress, we all get to ask the questions. And Adam Schiff doesn’t get to say, ‘Oh, you can answer our questions, but you can’t answer the Republicans’ questions,’” Jordan said. “If he’s so concerned about the rights of the Congress ... let us get our questions asked and answered.”

After Vindman’s deposition, Schiff accused Republicans of seeking to help Trump “exact political revenge” against the whistleblower, whose identity remains a secret.

“The president would love to punish the whistleblower. The president’s comments and actions have jeopardized the whistleblower’s safety,” Schiff told reporters. “The president's allies would like nothing better than to out this whistleblower. Our committee will not be a part of that. We will not stand for that.”

Troops Suffered Brain Injuries From Iranian Missile Strike
Eight U.S. troops diagnosed with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) arrived in the U.S. on Friday , according to Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman .
Hoffman said those troops are among a total of 34 American servicemembers diagnosed with TBI after the al Asad airbase where they were stationed in Iraq was hit by missiles fired by Iran on Jan. 8 . The attack was in reprisal for a U.S. drone strike Jan. 3 that killed top Iranian general Qassed Soleimani .
It was at least the third time U.S. officials have had to revise President Trump 's Jan. 8 claim that no Americans were injured by the Iranian missile barrage .
`` No Americans were harmed in last night 's attack by the Iranian regime , '' Trump declared at the White House hours after the Iranian attack . `` We suffered no casualties . ''
The 8 wounded American soldiers who arrived in the U.S. are part of a larger contingent of 18 troops diagnosed with TBI who were initially medically evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany . Those now in the U.S. will be treated on at out-patient basis either at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda , Md . or at their home bases , according to Hoffman .
The 9 U.S. troops who remain in Landstuhl will continue to undergo evaluation and treatment there . One American soldier who was diagnosed with TBI after the Iranian attack and transported to Kuwait has now returned to duty in Iraq ; 16 others who stayed in Iraq after being diagnosed with TBI have also returned to duty .
Asked whether those soldiers will be given Purple Hearts , since TBI now qualifies for this award bestowed on those wounded in enemy attacks , Hoffman was non-commital . `` That is a decision the services will have to make in due time , '' he said . `` I 'm not going to get ahead of the service secretaries on that . ''
Trump , for his part , downplayed reports of the U.S. troops sustaining concussion-type injuries when asked about them last week in Davos , Switzerland .
`` I heard that they had headaches , and a couple of other things , '' Trump said . `` But I would say , and I can report it is not very serious . Not very serious . ''
Regulations for receiving a Purple Heart award require that an injury caused by an enemy action that is diagnosed and treated by a medical professional be of such gravity that it removes the victim from duty for at least 48 hours .
Hoffman acknowledged that the numbers of troops diagnosed with TBI released by the Pentagon over the past two weeks have shifted , which he attributed to some of the symptoms of TBI taking time to develop .
`` What we saw was the number of people who were initially screened for concussion-like symptoms that showed up at one of the medical providers on the base saw their conditions improve rapidly , '' he said . `` Others we saw their conditions did n't improve — some got worse and had severe enough symptoms that they were transported on for further treatment .

`` The secretary 's direction is focused on the fact that if you look at the different types of reporting systems that we have , sometimes the administrative reporting of an injury is different than the medical reporting .

Even in normal times , these conflicts got little public scrutiny . But with attention more occupied than usual , some U.S. military operations have been escalating even further . In recent years , these conflicts have become even deadlier for innocent people . The Trump administration has shown itself to be not just indifferent , but positively encouraging of the killing of civilians in foreign wars . If there is a time to get away with killing people with no fear of accountability , it ’ s now . Yesterday , the Pentagon released its annual report on civilian casualties in its wars for the year 2019 . According to the report , 132 civilians were killed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , and Syria . In Yemen and Libya , countries where the U.S. also carries out airstrikes , the report simply claimed that no civilians were killed last year . “ All DoD ” — Department of Defense — “ operations in 2019 were conducted in accordance with law of war requirements , ” the report flatly stated , “ including law of war protections for civilians . ”
We already know from independent reports that Pentagon official figures on civilian casualties are , in general , woefully underreported . A 2017 investigation published by the New York Times found that , during a U.S. air campaign in Iraq , potentially thousands more civilians were killed than reported in official figures . In some cases , the military used video footage showing strikes on Islamic State positions as propaganda material , when in reality the footage showed airstrikes hitting homes full of civilians .

In some cases , the military has dismissed credible reports that its operations have killed Somali civilians .","The United States’s wars continue to rage in the Middle East and Africa against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even in normal times, these conflicts got little public scrutiny. But with attention more occupied than usual, some U.S. military operations have been escalating even further. In recent years, these conflicts have become even deadlier for innocent people. The Trump administration has shown itself to be not just indifferent, but positively encouraging of the killing of civilians in foreign wars. If there is a time to get away with killing people with no fear of accountability, it’s now. Yesterday, the Pentagon released its annual report on civilian casualties in its wars for the year 2019. According to the report, 132 civilians were killed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Syria. In Yemen and Libya, countries where the U.S. also carries out airstrikes, the report simply claimed that no civilians were killed last year. “All DoD” — Department of Defense — “operations in 2019 were conducted in accordance with law of war requirements,” the report flatly stated, “including law of war protections for civilians.”

We already know from independent reports that Pentagon official figures on civilian casualties are, in general, woefully underreported. A 2017 investigation published by the New York Times found that, during a U.S. air campaign in Iraq, potentially thousands more civilians were killed than reported in official figures. In some cases, the military used video footage showing strikes on Islamic State positions as propaganda material, when in reality the footage showed airstrikes hitting homes full of civilians. Independent monitoring groups like Airwars have also documented thousands of civilian deaths from U.S. aerial campaigns that have gone unacknowledged in official figures. The report issued to Congress this year was in line with new reporting requirements intended to provide more oversight about the impact of U.S. military operations on civilians. But the utility of these reported figures seems questionable: The military conducts almost no on-the-ground investigations of the impact of its strikes and is evidently willing to report figures that are absurdly low — literally incredible — for the sake of political expediency.

France , Russia and the coalition of Western countries now sound more bellicose than ever and have begun to act militarily .
But how simple is it to fashion a longer-term military plan ?
Here are five inconvenient facts for those who believe there is a simple military solution to Syria
ISIS and the Syrian regime have few military opponents . Dozens of militias crowd the battlefield , their allegiances as impenetrable as they are varied . It 's a mess -- but a few players stand out , often for bad reasons .
The biggest Sunni Arab force against them is called Jaish al-Fateh . It 's an alliance that includes moderates , those who are increasingly radical ( such as Ahrar al Sham which , despite being termed `` radical '' by the U.S. State Department , nevertheless condemned the Paris attacks ) , and al Nusra Front , al Qaeda 's affiliate in Syria .
This alliance -- which had seen such great success against the Assad regime that it prompted many to think the Russian intervention was intended mostly to slow its advance -- has itself faltered .
For a while , Jaish al-Fateh stopped operations when one part of the alliance disagreed over its anti-ISIS stance .
Meanwhile , the groups the West used to call `` moderates '' have been sidelined and underfunded and are tiny . The New Syria Force , which was the product of the Pentagon 's $ 500 million Train and Equip program , produced 54 fighters . Defections and clashes meant at one point the force only had five fighters left .
The other moderate force , the Syria Democratic Front , is also small and poorly supplied . Critics dismiss it as a fig-leaf group of Sunni Arabs to make the Kurdish forces they fight alongside seem more multiethnic .
Result : There are n't many pro-U.S. forces in Syria right now . The Assad regime now has fighting alongside it Hezbollah , which the U.S. considers a terrorist organization , and the Iranian militia , which fought the U.S. in Iraq . Al Qaeda is the most militarily effective part of the main anti-Assad regime alliance . Then there 's ISIS . Many look to the Kurds as the best allies against ISIS , but ...
The Kurds are sometimes mistrusted by the main group the U.S. badly needs to court : Sunni Arabs . They , in both Iraq and Syria , are the ones whose disillusionment with the Alawi and Shia regime in Damascus and the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad gave ISIS the oxygen to exist .
When the Assad regime bombed Sunni civilians at the beginning of the Syrian conflict , then continued daily for years , al Qaeda and then ISIS presented themselves as their protectors .
Sunnis are a minority in Iraq but a majority in Syria . Without their trust and cooperation , you ca n't expect to kick ISIS out . And the Sunnis do n't trust the Kurds . The Kurds in Syria have cooperated with the regime from the start -- or at least agreed not to fight each other .
And the Kurds are most interested in creating their own homeland in northern Syria , which they call Rojava . That means that when they liberate lands from ISIS , it ca n't immediately be guaranteed that they will welcome back the Sunnis who used to live there .
Even in Iraq it 's a problem : A Kurdish commander I met outside Sinjar last week said he felt all the Sunni Arabs around that area were ISIS supporters .
The upshot of this mistrust is an impediment for those who advocate using the Kurds as a ground force against ISIS . You ca n't expect to attack Raqqa , a Sunni Arab city , clear ISIS out and then be able to administer a large , angry Sunni population . Advocates of the Kurds say they can , and point to the fact that all the sides against ISIS are Syrians and have lived together in the past . But it will be a challenge .
You need Sunni Arabs -- and there are very few the U.S. wants to work alongside .
3 . Turkey is part of the problem , even though it 's in NATO
It was the Turkish failure to stop jihadists flooding into Syria in 2013 that enabled ISIS to grow . The Turkish-Syrian border remains porous and the Turks are , many say , more interested in fighting the Kurds in Turkey , Iraq and Syria , whom they consider terrorists , than they are in combating ISIS .
This has changed since ISIS attacked Ankara , the Turkish capital , in October and has become all the more violent in southern Turkey .

But it took the U.S. months to negotiate the use of the Incirlik airbase in southern Turkey to bomb Syria and Iraq . This was an advantage that Washington badly needed in order to reduce flight times and increase sorties -- yet the holdup came even while negotiating with a NATO ally .
Unless the border with northern Syria and Turkey is sealed , ISIS can continue to resupply its `` caliphate '' with new recruits and send attackers toward the West . Sealing that 900-kilometer ( 560-mile ) fence is an essential start -- but it has not happened yet .

Obama says it will take time , and that is unacceptable to both Parisians seeking retribution and Americans wanting the U.S. to retain its leadership role in vanquishing terrorists .
But the President 's challenge for clear alternatives has yet to be coherently answered . The White House has dealt with this reality for years , first by ignoring it , then by trying to stay out of it , even when its red lines over chemical weapons were crossed , and now by trying to contain it .
The time for an easy intervention was in 2012 , before ISIS , when the rebellion in Syria was moderate and the Assad regime not supported so strongly by Iran and Russia . Now things are different . They just are . It 's too late .
5 . There needs to be a local solution for what is a regional proxy war

But how simple is it to fashion a longer-term military plan?

Here are five inconvenient facts for those who believe there is a simple military solution to Syria

1. There are very few 'good guys' to back

ISIS and the Syrian regime have few military opponents. Dozens of militias crowd the battlefield, their allegiances as impenetrable as they are varied. It's a mess -- but a few players stand out, often for bad reasons.

The biggest Sunni Arab force against them is called Jaish al-Fateh. It's an alliance that includes moderates, those who are increasingly radical (such as Ahrar al Sham which, despite being termed ""radical"" by the U.S. State Department, nevertheless condemned the Paris attacks), and al Nusra Front, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria.

Al Qaeda is the most militarily effective part of the main anti-Assad regime alliance. Then there's ISIS. Many look to the Kurds as the best allies against ISIS , but ...

2. The Kurds? They aren't the solution to everything

The Kurds are sometimes mistrusted by the main group the U.S. badly needs to court: Sunni Arabs. They, in both Iraq and Syria, are the ones whose disillusionment with the Alawi and Shia regime in Damascus and the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad gave ISIS the oxygen to exist.

When the Assad regime bombed Sunni civilians at the beginning of the Syrian conflict, then continued daily for years, al Qaeda and then ISIS presented themselves as their protectors.

Sunnis are a minority in Iraq but a majority in Syria. Without their trust and cooperation, you can't expect to kick ISIS out. And the Sunnis don't trust the Kurds. The Kurds in Syria have cooperated with the regime from the start -- or at least agreed not to fight each other.

5. There needs to be a local solution for what is a regional proxy war

ISIS is a radical, nihilistic organization using the vacuum of chaos in Syria and Iraq to find a haven. That chaos is caused by the broader battle between Iran and Saudi Arabia (often with other Gulf states) vying to establish supremacy in the region.

Both nations have aging leadership, huge young populations and crashing incomes from low oil prices, and as a result see sweeping changes ahead in the region. Each seeks to get ahead of the other as quickly as possible.

But in Iraq, the West has shown that it is pretty useless at invading, remodeling and then administering a Middle Eastern country. Saudi Arabia and Iran know this and don't see that as a real prospect in the future.

The U.S. diplomatic strategy also recognizes this regional showdown, hence its focus at U.N.-administered peace talks in Vienna on getting Saudi Arabia and Iran to sit in the same room and agree on basic points about Syria's future.

The latest consensus even saw the U.N., U.S. and Russia all state that the backers of the various warring groups in Syria would make their proxies respect any U.N. ceasefire initiative. It's all very distant and optimistic as a prospect, but it does tackle the issue at its root cause: at the level of the Syrian militias' backers, rather than militarily on the ground.

In short, the region itself must get tired of the war and the chaos and seek to negotiate an end, as the West isn't going to be able to impose one.

Is there any good news?

One small historical comparison to ISIS is the Khmer Rouge.

That regime didn't attack the West, granted, but it was equally nihilistic and savage during its brief rule in Cambodia, after the turmoil of the Vietnam War.

After years of horror, the Khmer Rouge did eventually find itself isolated, unable to basically feed the populations it brutalized, and slowly collapsed as a result.

That takes time, as Obama says -- and that's not something those on the streets of Europe's capitals want to give ISIS right now.",www.cnn.com,center,QS5gnDuevbIFvnTH

When the launch window opens in mid-July , Chinese scientists will strive to send a probe to a planet that confused their ancestors with its constantly changing brightness and position in the sky .
The spacecraft , called Tianwen-1 , or the “ Quest for Heavenly Truth , ” will carry 13 scientific instruments to examine the Red Planet from orbit and on its surface . Tianwen-1 will examine how water ice is distributed on Mars , as well as the planet ’ s physical evolution and its habitability over time . The mission—consisting of an orbiter , lander , and rover—is “ the most ambitious thing one could do on a first attempt , ” says John Logsdon , a space policy expert at George Washington University .
The odds of a flawless mission are daunting : Of humanity ’ s dozens of attempts to orbit or land on Mars to date , only about half have succeeded . After some high-profile setbacks , NASA has deployed five landers , four rovers and multiple orbiters that have brought the world to life for scientists and the public alike . But China ’ s spacefaring experience beyond Earth orbit has been limited to several robotic moon missions and an orbiter that piggybacked on a failed Russian mission to the Martian moon Phobos in 2011 .
Two major risks confront the five-metric-ton Tianwen-1 , Logsdon says . First , China ’ s most powerful heavy-lift rocket , Long March 5 , has only launched three times—including a major failure in 2017 , when the rocket started to malfunction shortly after takeoff . It took more than two years for scientists to fix Long March 5 ’ s core-stage-engine problem and score a successful flight in late 2019 . Its track record makes observers nervous , however .
Second , Tianwen-1 ’ s lander must navigate the challenging Martian atmosphere , which is thick enough to overheat the probe but too thin to decelerate it sufficiently . The spacecraft ’ s entry , descent and landing technology uses a heat shield , a parachute and a retro-engine to slow its descent , an arrangement resembling that of earlier U.S. missions . Yet when the vessel is just 100 meters above the surface , it will pause , take snapshots of the area and quickly calculate the best landing spot . Then it will shift horizontally to center above that spot and carefully touch down with the lander ’ s four legs .
In November 2019 China tested this part of the landing procedure , which the nation had previously used successfully in its moon landings , in the province of Hebei . Foreign officials were invited to watch the test on-site . It was the last major public event for Tianwen-1 , however . Since then , the China National Space Administration ( CNSA ) has kept a low profile , and mission scientists have declined or ignored nearly all interview requests .
Should Tianwen-1 land successfully , its research could illuminate new aspects of Mars . For instance , both the orbiter and the rover are equipped with a ground-penetrating radar to chart geologic layers under the surface . The radar on the orbiter can “ see ” as deep as a few thousand meters , whereas the instrument on the rover has a shallower view but sharp centimeter-level resolution . “ China ’ s main goal [ with these radars ] is to explore the water-ice layer ” under the planet ’ s surface , says Wlodek Kofman of the Institute for Planetary Sciences and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France .
Tianwen-1 ’ s ability to measure Mars ’ s magnetic field excites Jim Bell of Arizona State University , principal investigator of the main camera on NASA ’ s Perseverance rover . One prevailing hypothesis is that the Red Planet used to have a global magnetic field like Earth 's , he says . When its smaller molten iron core cooled down , however , Mars gradually lost this shield , exposing the world to solar wind and radiation , thinning its atmosphere and dooming any water that might have flowed on its surface . Since 2014 NASA ’ s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution ( MAVEN ) mission has found ample evidence to support this scenario , but scientists crave a fuller picture . “ Tianwen-1 will be very useful in providing more evidence from a different orbit and from the ground , ” Bell says . He hopes the Chinese team will share data with the international community piecing together the environmental evolution of Mars .
Tianwen-1 will aim to land in the southern part of Utopia Planitia , a largely flat area between 25 and 30 degrees north of the Martian equator . Geologists have long suspected that this region is covered with ancient mudflows , pointing to stores of bygone water . “ It ’ s an interesting place to investigate potential past subsurface habitability , ” says Alfred McEwen , a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona .
The rover ’ s chance of finding water beneath Mars might be limited by its latitude , McEwen notes . Because it draws its power from solar panels , it must stay near the equator . Today water ice below the planet ’ s surface , most researchers believe , remains mainly at higher and cooler latitudes .
Tianwen-1 ’ s reliance on the sun compelled its team to design hardy instruments , says Rong Shu of the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences . “ Since our rover does not have radioisotope power , all the instruments need to endure temperatures as low as –90 degrees Celsius while at rest , and they operate in the temperature range of –40 to –30 degrees C , ” he adds .
The rover 's payload includes the Martian Surface Component Detector ( MarSCoDe ) , whose design was led by Shu . Similar to ChemCam on NASA ’ s Curiosity rover , MarSCoDe can fire short laser pulses to vaporize the surfaces of rocks from a few meters away . The instrument will “ sniff ” the ionized gas produced by these mini blasts and determine the type and quantity of chemical elements in the rocks .
Tianwen-1 is expected to reach Mars in February 2021 . It will spend about two months in a parking orbit , waiting for the best timing and surface conditions to land . China ’ s expanding radio telescope network of tracking and receiving stations will sustain communications between Earth and the probe .
Already , Chinese scientists are preparing for more missions in the Tianwen series , including ventures to return rock samples from Mars and an asteroid , to perform a flyby of Jupiter and to explore the margins of the sun ’ s vast heliosphere . But if Tianwen-1 reaches Mars as planned , Logsdon says , “ it will put China in the space exploration business in a big way . ”","With a five-meter-wide, 57-meter-tall rocket waiting to blast off from China’s southern island of Hainan, the nation is quietly making final preparations for its first independent trip to Mars.

The problem is our last war was against primitive religious fanatics in the Middle East and China is an emerging superpower with approaching-peer level conventional capabilities and an actual strategy for contesting the United States in all the potential battlespaces – land , sea , air , space and cyber . America is simply not ready for the Pacific war to come . We ’ re likely to lose .
In Desert Storm , Saddam Hussein was dumb enough to choose to face a U.S. military that was ready to fight its last war . That last war was the Cold War , where the Americans were prepared to fight a Soviet-equipped conscript army using Soviet tactics . And Saddam , genius that he was , decided to face America and its allies with a Soviet-equipped conscript army using Soviet tactics , except fractionally as effective as the Russians . It went poorly . I know – I was there at the VII Corps main command post as his entire army was annihilated in 100 hours .
Chances are that the Chinese will not choose to fight our strengths . In fact , those chances total approximately 100 % .
It ’ s called “ asymmetrical warfare ” in English . What it ’ s called in Chinese I have no idea , but Sun Tzu wrote about it . Don ’ t fight the enemy ’ s strength ; fight his weakness . Strike where he is not . Spread confusion about your intentions ; force him to lash out . It ’ s all there in The Art of War ; it ’ s just not clear anyone forming our current American military strategy has read it . Maybe they would if we labeled it “ Third World ” literature and said checking it out would check a diversity box for promotion .
We seem intent on fighting not the enemy we face but the enemy we want to face . This is a rookie mistake . And we ’ ve built our strategy around that error . Take aircraft carriers . I have a sentimental attachment to those potent floating fortresses – the Schlichters are usually Navy officers and I ’ m the random green sheep who went Army . There was a picture of my dad ’ s carrier ( the U.S.S . Lake Champlain ) hanging in my house as a kid . I love them – but in 2019 they ’ re a trap .
We ’ re hanging our whole maritime strategy in the Pacific Ocean around a few of these big , super-expensive iron airfields . If a carrier battle group ( a carrier rolls with a posse like an old school rapper ) gets within aircraft flight range of an enemy , then the enemy will have a bad day . So , what ’ s the super-obvious counter to our carrier strategy ? Well , how about a bunch of relatively cheap missiles with a longer range than the carrier ’ s aircraft ? And – surprise – what are the Chinese doing ? Building a bunch of hypersonic and ballistic anti-ship missiles to pummel our flattops long before the F-35s and F-18s can reach the Chinese mainland . We know this because the Chinese are telling us they intend to do it , with the intent of neutering our combat power and breaking our will to fight by causing thousands of casualties in one fell swoop .
The vulnerability of our carriers is no surprise ; the Navy has been warned about it for years . There are a number of ideas out there to address the issue , but the Navy resists . One good one is to replace the limited numbers of ( again ) super-expensive , short-range manned aircraft with a bunch more long range drones . Except that means the Naval aviation community would have to admit the Top Gun era is in the past , and that ’ s too hard . So they buy a bunch of pricy , shiny manned fighters that can ’ t get the job done .
Another mistake is over-prioritizing quality over quantity , which is the same mistake the Nazis made with their tanks . The Wehrmacht had the greatest tanks in the world – all top notch . Really good tanks . Tank-to-tank , they were the best – the dreaded Tiger had an 11.5-to-1 kill ratio . The Americans and Russians had merely decent tanks , just multiples more of them . Quantity has a quality all its own . Right now , America has something like 280 ships . We ’ ll have about 326 by 2023 . That ’ s to cover the entire world . We had 6,768 ships when WWII ended in August 1945
Of course , it would also be nice if the Navy would emphasize seamanship and basic skills again so that it could keep its super-expensive ships from running into other vessels . The U.S.S . Fitzgerald collision not only killed some of our precious sailors , but took out a key weapons platform – 1/280th of our entire fleet ! – because its officers failed again and again and because key systems on the ship were out of commission .
This is inexcusable , but it is being excused . The focus of our military has shifted from victory to satisfying the whims of politicians . Here ’ s a troubling thought – if you go to one of the service branches ’ War Colleges and poll the faculty and students about America ’ s greatest strategic threat , as many as 50 % of the respondents will tell you it is “ climate change. ” That ’ s not an exaggeration . Our military is supposed to be dealing with the Chinese military and its brain trust is obsessing about the weather in 100 years .
The Chinese are going to continue dumping exponentially more carbon than America into the air and preparing to take us down while we focus on this kind of frivolous nonsense . Did you know the Chinese are pillaging our tech here in America , while our intelligence community ’ s incompetence led to our spy networks in China being rolled up ? Probably not – these are one-day stories because the elite in DC and the media are busy trying to push the guy who won the last election out of office .
Here ’ s how the Chinese win . First , they take out our satellites . You know the GPS location service on your phone ? Satellites , which are easy to hit . Say “ bye-bye ” to much of the ability of our precision weapons to find their targets . Also up for destruction are the communications satellites we rely on to coordinate our operations . And then there is the Chinese cyberattack , not only on our military systems but on systems here at home that control civilian power , water and other logistics . A U.S military with no comms and no computers is essentially the Post Office with worse service . An America with a ruined internet is Somalia .
Then they hit our land bases on Guam , Okinawa and elsewhere with a blizzard of missiles , knocking them out and annihilating our aircraft on the ground . Maybe we could respond with B-2s flying from the continental United States . We have 19 whole combat-capable aircraft , assuming a 100 % operational readiness rate , which is just not a thing . We might even take out a few missile batteries on the Chinese coast . We won ’ t know the difference though . As for our carriers , if they come to play , they are likely going to get sunk , and if they stay out of the fight , they are merely useless – assuming quiet diesel subs do not find and sink them .
This is not a surprise . We play wargames against the Chinese all the time , and we lose .
Much of this seems to be picking on the Navy , but that ’ s only because the Navy would take the lead in a fight against the Chinses in the Pacific . The other branches have similar issues with strategy , leadership and equipment . So , what is the answer ? The answer may well be to reframe the question – instead of determining our objectives and then failing to provide the capabilities to achieve them , maybe we need to decide what capabilities we are willing to provide and form our strategic objectives to meet those realities . Moreover , we need to get it through our heads that no one is going to be as dumb as Saddam was and conveniently fight us the way we want to be fought . We need a complete strategic mindset revolution , one that moves from a few super-expensive systems to many affordable ones . We need to say good-bye to legacies of the 20th century , like mostly manned combat aircraft and a few huge carrier battle groups . We need to prepare to defeat the enemy we actually face , not the enemy we want to face .
On an equally cheery note , check out my novels People ’ s Republic , Indian Country and Wildfire , about an America split apart into red and blue nations at each other ’ s throats . Number Four is in progress for release this summer…and yeah , this time China is in the picture !","Nations famously tend to always try to fight the last war, and what America is preparing to do today with the newly assertive China is no exception.

A U.S military with no comms and no computers is essentially the Post Office with worse service. An America with a ruined internet is Somalia.

Then they hit our land bases on Guam, Okinawa and elsewhere with a blizzard of missiles, knocking them out and annihilating our aircraft on the ground. Maybe we could respond with B-2s flying from the continental United States. We have 19 whole combat-capable aircraft, assuming a 100% operational readiness rate, which is just not a thing. We might even take out a few missile batteries on the Chinese coast. We won’t know the difference though. As for our carriers, if they come to play, they are likely going to get sunk, and if they stay out of the fight, they are merely useless – assuming quiet diesel subs do not find and sink them.

This is not a surprise. We play wargames against the Chinese all the time, and we lose.

Much of this seems to be picking on the Navy, but that’s only because the Navy would take the lead in a fight against the Chinses in the Pacific. The other branches have similar issues with strategy, leadership and equipment. So, what is the answer? The answer may well be to reframe the question – instead of determining our objectives and then failing to provide the capabilities to achieve them, maybe we need to decide what capabilities we are willing to provide and form our strategic objectives to meet those realities. Moreover, we need to get it through our heads that no one is going to be as dumb as Saddam was and conveniently fight us the way we want to be fought. We need a complete strategic mindset revolution, one that moves from a few super-expensive systems to many affordable ones. We need to say good-bye to legacies of the 20th century, like mostly manned combat aircraft and a few huge carrier battle groups. We need to prepare to defeat the enemy we actually face, not the enemy we want to face.

Trump governs the tempo of the confrontation.

After losing its top strategist, military commander, and arch-terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian theocracy is weighing responses.

One, Iran can quiet down and cease military provocations.

After attacking tankers off its coast, destroying an oil refinery in Saudi Arabia, shooting down a U.S. drone, and being responsible for the killing and wounding of Americans in Iraq, Iran could now keep quiet.

It might accept that its strategy of escalation has failed to lead to any quantifiable advantage. Trump did not prove a passive “Twitter tiger,” as his critics mocked. Instead, he upped the stakes to Iran’s disadvantage and existential danger.

The chances, however, for such a logical and passive readjustment by Iran are nil.

Iran believes that Trump’s beefed-up sanctions have all but destroyed its economy and could now extend to secondary boycotts of nations trading with Iran. U.S. sanctions have also squeezed Iranian expeditionary efforts to forge a permanent hegemony and a Shiite crescent extending to the Mediterranean.

If unchecked, American economic pressure could eventually lead to a popular rebellion that would topple the theocracy. In sum, a return to the status quo is unlikely.

Two, Iran can agree to reenter talks about its nuclear program and offer a few concessions.

Iran could concede that the prior agreement was designed to bank Iranian cash and nuclear expertise that would eventually lead to its developing nuclear weaponry after a period of feigned good behavior.

The theocracy will view his death not just in terms of a strategic loss, but as a humiliation that cannot stand. Governments elsewhere in the Middle East are gloating over Soleimani’s killing, and especially over the thought of Iran’s inability to do much about it.

In reaction, Iran could strike American bases and allies in the region. The possibilities are endless. It might send more drones and missiles against other nations’ refineries. Hezbollah could shower Israeli cities with missiles. Iran might close the Strait of Hormuz in hopes of seeing the rest of the world suffer as it has.

Iran could also unleash its terrorist appendages to stage attacks on American and Israeli assets throughout Europe and the U.S., including military bases, airliners, and soft civilian targets.

Yet this choice is also unlikely.

The U.S. would not have to invade Iran to end it as a modern state. A strike against the U.S. or its overseas military installations would result in a devastating response. The theocracy knows that in hours, U.S. air power could take out all of Iran’s oil refineries, power stations, and military bases while suffering few if any causalities.

Given U.S. oil independence and the global adjustments to existing sanctions on Iranian oil, the near-permanent loss of Iran’s oil would not greatly damage the world economy.

As you watch the circus that is the 2016 presidential campaign, which candidate strikes you as having a coherent vision of national security for the post-Obama era? Who has told you what he (or she) will do about the rise of jihadi regimes and groups in the Middle East and well beyond? Who has made clear how the United States should respond to North Korea’s nuclear weapons, Chinese neo-imperialism and Russian revanchism?

In my view, none of them. We have, at most, impressions — less than reliable — regarding the candidates’ inclinations and tendencies. That’s disappointing but not entirely surprising. Voters get what they ask for. Most are not demanding that the candidates connect with them intellectually rather than just emotionally. Most are not asking to see the candidates’ plans to provide for the common defense in this perilous period. Too many seem eager only to have politicians to entertain them. The media feed into that. Too many want politicians to be their Santa Claus. The culture feeds into that.

Of course, all the candidates — even Donald Trump, belatedly — have teams of national security-foreign policy advisers. They meet, they talk, they churn out papers. That’s not the same as agreeing on the best — or, more realistically, least-bad — way to protect Americans against those who want to murder us and bury Western civilization. Look at the campaigns’ websites. You’ll see lots of posturing. What you won’t see is much that is concrete.

I recognize that if you’re President Obama or one of his supporters, you don’t agree that the next president ought to change course. On the contrary, you believe that Americans should stay the course charted by the current administration.

Over the years since Mr. Obama entered the White House, there has been an increasing number of terrorist groups carrying out an increasing number of terrorist attacks in an increasing number of countries resulting in an increasing number of victims. There is no reason to believe that trend line is about to turn down.

Meanwhile, little has been done to stem the continuing carnage in Syria and the ongoing genocide of Christians and other religious minorities in much of the Muslim world. The mass migration, mostly Muslim, from the Middle East and North Africa is having an impact on Europe that could be permanently transformative.

If the next president decides that America does indeed need to change course, this question will arise: Can America change course? After eight years heading in one direction, inertial forces come into play. Large ships of state rarely make sharp turns.

The next president may not have the tools and capabilities needed to enact significantly different policies. The military may require substantial restructuring and, having been shrunk over recent years, rebuilding. The intelligence community may need authorities it doesn’t at present enjoy. The next president will make political appointments, but career bureaucrats who have risen during Mr. Obama’s tenure may be reluctant agents of change.

As a voter, I’m heartened when I hear candidates say they will “tear up the Iran deal on Day One.” But as a policy analyst, I know that may not be possible or even advisable. At the very least, shouldn’t the new president take the time necessary to attempt to get allies on board? You think that will be quick or easy?

What’s more, bold new approaches require public support. That, too, takes time to nurture — especially after a campaign in which public opinion was catered to rather than shaped. Is there any candidate who strikes you as having the skills to “bring us together”?

So if the next president wants to fix what’s broken he (or she) will have his (or her) work cut out for him (or her). I’d argue that a new national security doctrine will be needed — a broad conceptual framework, a statement of principles that will serve to clarify objectives and outcomes.

He had just announced as much to a crowd in Ohio . The assembled military and national security advisers told him the move was rash and unwise . So he gave them six months .
Eight months later , planning for the withdrawal is now underway -- against the advice of those same officials , who warned in April that Russia and Iran would gain stronger footholds in Syria when the US presence there evaporates .
On Capitol Hill , even some of Trump 's GOP allies were warning of a grave mistake .
`` My sense is that it 's been a shock through the administration that this was made , '' Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker told reporters on Wednesday after returning from the White House , where he had traveled to meet with Trump but was told as he waited the meeting was canceled .
`` It 's hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication , with this little preparation , '' Corker said . `` I mean , my understanding is that we 're beginning to move out right now . ''
Hurried discussions continued Wednesday about the timing and pace of the troop withdrawal , which the White House said has already begun . The announcement lacked the formality of previous presidents ' declarations they would remove troops from war zones : the White House did not schedule any presidential remarks nor provide any concrete details of the decision .
Trump issued his first public comments on the decision Wednesday evening in a video message posted to Twitter , in which he pointed to the sky to reference US military personnel who have been killed in Syria .
`` We have won against ISIS , '' Trump said . `` We 've beaten them and we 've beaten them badly . We 've taken back the land and now it 's time for our troops to come back home . I get very saddened when I have to write letters or call parents or wives or husbands of soldiers who have been killed fighting for our country . ''
He added later , `` So our boys , our young women , our men , they 're all coming back and they 're coming back now . We won , and that 's the way we want it . '' Trump then pointed to the sky and said , `` And that 's the way they want it . ''
After historic victories against ISIS , it 's time to bring our great young people home ! pic.twitter.com/xoNjFzQFTp — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) December 19 , 2018
JUST WATCHED U.S. preparing for `` full '' and `` rapid '' withdrawal from Syria Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH U.S. preparing for `` full '' and `` rapid '' withdrawal from Syria 08:09
In conversations over the past several days , top presidential advisers have counseled Trump that withdrawing personnel from Syria would amount to a retreat from the region and allow adversarial nations to gain influence . Those cautioning against a rapid and immediate withdrawal included Defense Secretary James Mattis , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton , according to people familiar with the discussions .
Resistance to the move was strong among some in the administration . A senior administration official told CNN 's Jake Tapper that the President 's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria is `` a mistake of colossal proportions and the President fails to see how it will endanger our country . ''
`` Senior officials across the administration agree that the President 's decision-by-tweet will recklessly put American and allied lives in danger around the world , take the pressure off of ISIS -- allowing them to reconstitute -- and hand a strategic victory to our Syrian , Iranian and Russian adversaries , '' the official said .
Diplomatic sources from two countries in the region said their countries were not consulted or informed , and described the news of the planned withdrawal as a `` total surprise . ''
The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement Thursday that the decision will provide room for the `` revival of terrorism '' and will create a `` political and military vacuum . ''
Trump did alert one key ally two days ahead of the announcement : Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . In a phone call with Trump on Monday , and a subsequent conversation with Pompeo on Tuesday , the US leaders assured him the Americans had `` other ways of expressing their influence in the area , '' according to a statement from Netanyahu 's office .
In a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans , lawmakers gave Vice President Mike Pence an `` earful '' about the decision , according to Corker .

He had just announced as much to a crowd in Ohio. The assembled military and national security advisers told him the move was rash and unwise. So he gave them six months.

Eight months later, planning for the withdrawal is now underway -- against the advice of those same officials, who warned in April that Russia and Iran would gain stronger footholds in Syria when the US presence there evaporates.

On Capitol Hill, even some of Trump's GOP allies were warning of a grave mistake.

""My sense is that it's been a shock through the administration that this was made,"" Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker told reporters on Wednesday after returning from the White House, where he had traveled to meet with Trump but was told as he waited the meeting was canceled.

""It's hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication, with this little preparation,"" Corker said. ""I mean, my understanding is that we're beginning to move out right now.""

Hurried discussions continued Wednesday about the timing and pace of the troop withdrawal, which the White House said has already begun. The announcement lacked the formality of previous presidents' declarations they would remove troops from war zones: the White House did not schedule any presidential remarks nor provide any concrete details of the decision.

Trump issued his first public comments on the decision Wednesday evening in a video message posted to Twitter, in which he pointed to the sky to reference US military personnel who have been killed in Syria.

""We have won against ISIS ,"" Trump said. ""We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We've taken back the land and now it's time for our troops to come back home. I get very saddened when I have to write letters or call parents or wives or husbands of soldiers who have been killed fighting for our country.""

He added later, ""So our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won, and that's the way we want it."" Trump then pointed to the sky and said, ""And that's the way they want it.""

A 'total surprise'

JUST WATCHED U.S. preparing for ""full"" and ""rapid"" withdrawal from Syria Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH U.S. preparing for ""full"" and ""rapid"" withdrawal from Syria 08:09

In conversations over the past several days, top presidential advisers have counseled Trump that withdrawing personnel from Syria would amount to a retreat from the region and allow adversarial nations to gain influence. Those cautioning against a rapid and immediate withdrawal included Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Resistance to the move was strong among some in the administration. A senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that the President's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria is ""a mistake of colossal proportions and the President fails to see how it will endanger our country.""

""Senior officials across the administration agree that the President's decision-by-tweet will recklessly put American and allied lives in danger around the world, take the pressure off of ISIS -- allowing them to reconstitute -- and hand a strategic victory to our Syrian, Iranian and Russian adversaries,"" the official said.

Diplomatic sources from two countries in the region said their countries were not consulted or informed, and described the news of the planned withdrawal as a ""total surprise.""

The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement Thursday that the decision will provide room for the ""revival of terrorism"" and will create a ""political and military vacuum.""

Trump did alert one key ally two days ahead of the announcement: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a phone call with Trump on Monday, and a subsequent conversation with Pompeo on Tuesday, the US leaders assured him the Americans had ""other ways of expressing their influence in the area,"" according to a statement from Netanyahu's office.

In a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans, lawmakers gave Vice President Mike Pence an ""earful"" about the decision, according to Corker.

Speaking afterward, Corker said he felt badly for the vice president, who was acting as an emissary to angry lawmakers.

""He had talking points,"" Corker said. ""There's no way he could really defend. He did what a loyal soldier would do.""

Trump's top ally in the Senate, Sen. Lindsay Graham, was firmer.

""I want you to tell the President directly that this is a huge mistake,"" he said he told Pence. ""You are putting in motion ISIS getting a foothold again. They are not defeated.""

Pence addressed the issue by saying Trump ""made a commitment to get out of foreign entanglements,"" Graham said. But the vice president himself ignored reporters' questions on the matter, instead staring ahead blankly as he departed.

It was an astonishing level of pushback from Republicans who, time and again, have avoided overt criticism of their party's leader. It reflected deep unease among national security experts and advisers about the decision to abruptly withdraw troops from Syria without consulting members of Congress or gathering consensus among the administration's national security team.

It was Trump's decision

Ambassador: Strike On U.S. Bases Was 'Measured, Proportionate Response'",2020-01-09,Scott Neuman,"Iran 's U.N . Ambassador : Strike On U.S . Bases Was 'Measured , Proportionate Response '
Iran 's U.N. ambassador tells NPR that Tehran has no plans to step up a confrontation with the U.S. after it fired missiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq in `` a measured , proportionate response '' to the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani .
However , Majid Takht Ravanchi , speaking to Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep , says Iran is prepared for further action if the U.S. renews its aggression . He also denied the Trump administration 's assertion that Soleimani , the commander of Iran 's Quds Force , had been plotting an attack on U.S. persons or interests .
Ravanchi said Iran had `` acted in accordance with our rights based on the United Nations charter '' in the attack early Wednesday morning local time that targeted the Ain al-Assad air base in Iraq and a second U.S. base at Irbil with some two dozen ballistic missiles .
`` As far as Iran is concerned , that action was concluded last night , '' he said .
Asked whether Iran was finished with its retaliatory actions , he said , `` It depends on the United States . ''
`` If the U.S. ventures to attacking Iran again , definitely proportionate response will be taken in response to that attack , '' the U.N. envoy said .
In a nationally televised address on Wednesday , President Trump said that Iran appeared `` to be standing down '' after the attacks on the U.S. bases , in which he said `` no Americans were harmed . ''
There was reportedly only moderate damage at the bases , leading some analysts to speculate that Tehran responded in such a way as to deliberately avoid casualties .
Even so , some experts have warned that Iran 's missile attack could be a prelude to more attacks against the U.S. carried out instead by Tehran 's proxies in the region .
Ravanchi tells NPR that Iran is `` not responsible for any other people to do whatever they 're going to do . ''
`` I am not suggesting anything to accept or to reject any sort of actions by others , '' he said .

Ambassador: Strike On U.S. Bases Was 'Measured, Proportionate Response'

Iran's U.N. ambassador tells NPR that Tehran has no plans to step up a confrontation with the U.S. after it fired missiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq in ""a measured, proportionate response"" to the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

However, Majid Takht Ravanchi, speaking to Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep, says Iran is prepared for further action if the U.S. renews its aggression. He also denied the Trump administration's assertion that Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, had been plotting an attack on U.S. persons or interests.

Ravanchi said Iran had ""acted in accordance with our rights based on the United Nations charter"" in the attack early Wednesday morning local time that targeted the Ain al-Assad air base in Iraq and a second U.S. base at Irbil with some two dozen ballistic missiles.

""As far as Iran is concerned, that action was concluded last night,"" he said.

Asked whether Iran was finished with its retaliatory actions, he said, ""It depends on the United States.""

""If the U.S. ventures to attacking Iran again, definitely proportionate response will be taken in response to that attack,"" the U.N. envoy said.

In a nationally televised address on Wednesday, President Trump said that Iran appeared ""to be standing down"" after the attacks on the U.S. bases, in which he said ""no Americans were harmed.""

There was reportedly only moderate damage at the bases, leading some analysts to speculate that Tehran responded in such a way as to deliberately avoid casualties.

Even so, some experts have warned that Iran's missile attack could be a prelude to more attacks against the U.S. carried out instead by Tehran's proxies in the region.

Ravanchi tells NPR that Iran is ""not responsible for any other people to do whatever they're going to do.""

""I am not suggesting anything to accept or to reject any sort of actions by others,"" he said.

Mattis would have been the wiser choice.

On paper, Michael Flynn seems like a perfect fit for the post of Trump’s national-security adviser.

A former three-star general who led major intelligence operations across the globe, he has vast experience. Confronting a dangerous world, America’s next president will need all the experience he can get.

Yet experience does not alone equal effectiveness. Serving as the assistant to the president for national-security affairs is not easy. The adviser must guide the president on complex long-term and short-term security issues. He or she must also control the national-security bureaucracy to present the president with good options at short notice. Flynn will also have responsibility for domestic agencies that pertain to national-security concerns such as counterterrorism. It’s a big job, and history tells us what happens when the national-security adviser fails: American foreign policy sinks into the sea of bickering government agencies.

Appointed by acclaimed JSOC Commander General Stanley McChrystal, Flynn was involved in operations to destroy al-Qaeda in Iraq. But Flynn’s opponents believe that he takes too much credit for his Iraq experience. One individual who served with Flynn at JSOC describes him as General McChrystal’s yes man.

But this individual also told me that Flynn’s unpredictable nature at JSOC earned him the nickname “firehose.” The meaning? That unless held firmly to a task, Flynn would spray off dangerously in all directions.

Or maybe the coronavirus can cleverly keep hopping on jets between countries and states, sowing dissension as nations blame one other for its creation and contagion, and politicians seek to destroy each other rather than band together to kill the virus.

COVID-19 counts on globalization as it sneaks onto jets and ships. In a few hours, it can find a new home and new hosts to terrify — even thousands of miles away.

It is a vengeful enemy. It knows we have killed off or rendered impotent most of its fellow viruses. Its cousin, the flu, has not since 1918 translated its annual tactical wins into a strategic pandemic victory.

Viruses and anti-human microbes have not had a major win in America in decades, perhaps not since polio used to terrorize, cripple, and kill thousands of Americans annually.

COVID-19 believes our progress, confidence, and sophistication are not our strengths but rather our greatest weakness, as our vanity and assumed invulnerability render us ripe for panic.

The battle is upon us. But if we stay calm and rational, we can easily defeat the enemy, whose reputation is likely far scarier than its reality.

Or , as his campaign put it , to take care of “ all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do , but a politician has no clue. ” Last summer , about a month after declaring his candidacy , Trump unveiled a hotline for veterans to share ideas about how to overhaul the bureaucracy that served them . A campaign aide said that Trump himself would personally respond to some of the messages . “ I love all veterans and will help them finally lead the kind of lives that they should be leading , ” Trump declared at the time . Many of the veterans who called the hotline—855-VETS-352—say they were sent to an automated voicemail message telling them to email the campaign . Those who reached a live human were similarly instructed to send an email , or to mail their medical records to campaign headquarters at Trump Tower . It soon became evident that Trump had no actual plan in place to help anyone who contacted him through the hotline . Calling it a “ publicity stunt , ” one veteran wrote on PopularMilitary.com , “ We are not sure what the estimated wait time is , but it is probably safe to say you should hold on to your [ Veterans Affairs ] card for now. ” This perfunctory effort was perhaps to be expected , since Trump has a long and colorful history of showing disrespect toward men and women in uniform . He did not serve himself , avoiding the Vietnam War via four education deferments , followed by a medical deferment for bone spurs in his feet . ( His campaign notes that Trump received a high number in the draft lottery and was unlikely to ever be called up . ) But on numerous occasions , he has dismissed the experiences of those who did . In the 2015 biography Never Enough : Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success , Trump is quoted as saying , “ I always thought I was in the military ” because of his time at the New York Military Academy , an expensive boarding school 60 miles north of New York City where Trump brought women onto campus so often that his yearbook nickname was “ Ladies ’ Man. ” The author , Michael D ’ Antonio , writes that Trump believed the academy “ provided him with more military training than most actual soldiers . ”
In the 1990s , Trump made headlines for lobbying the New York State legislature to ban disabled veterans from working as street vendors around Trump Tower . “ Do we allow Fifth Avenue , one of the world ’ s finest and most luxurious shopping districts , to be turned into an outdoor flea market , clogging and seriously downgrading the area ? ” he wrote to a state assemblyman . Thirteen years later , he appealed again to then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg . “ Whether they are veterans or not , ” he wrote , “ [ the vendors ] should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street. ” At times , his remarks on veterans and military service have veered into outright mockery . In a 1997 interview with Howard Stern , Trump likened his determination to avoid sexually transmitted infections to serving in combat . His sex life in the 1980s was “ my personal Vietnam , ” he said . “ I feel like a great and very brave soldier. ” Last summer , he declared that Senator John McCain—a former Navy pilot who was held prisoner for five and a half years and tortured by the North Vietnamese—was “ not a war hero. ” His reasoning : “ I like people that weren ’ t captured. ” Meanwhile , when Trump has weighed in on national security questions , his remarks often reveal either ignorance or disdain for military expertise and the codes of conduct that govern the armed forces . “ I know more about ISIS than the generals do . Believe me , ” he boasted in one speech , adding , `` I ’ ve had a lot of wars of my own . I ’ m really good at war . '' His foreign policy prescriptions include proposals to “ bomb the shit out of ISIS , ” to “ take out ” the families of ISIS members and to torture terrorism suspects . ( “ Would I approve waterboarding ? You bet your ass I would , ” he told one crowd . “ And you know what ? If it does n't work , they deserve it anyway , for what they 're doing. ” ) When it was pointed out that soldiers couldn ’ t legally carry out those last two actions , Trump was unconcerned . `` They 're not going to refuse me . Believe me. ” ( He walked back that last statement the next day . ) The Geneva Conventions , he recently observed , have made American soldiers “ afraid to fight. ” Trump ’ s pronouncements on foreign policy , combined with his years of broadsides , have set off a very real fear within military circles about what might happen were he to become president . In the last two months , I spoke with dozens of people in the national security realm—current and retired officers , veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and former White House , State Department , Pentagon and CIA officials . The words they used to describe their mood : Terrified . Shocked . Appalled . Never before , they say , has a candidate gotten so close to the White House with such little respect for the military .
One former Marine infantry officer described Trump as a “ fake-bake-ing chicken hawk . ”
“ He completely misunderstands the military profession that he would head if he were the president , ” said Robert Killebrew , a retired colonel who served in the Army for more than 30 years . Others were less polite . In a pair of ads produced by the American Future Fund , a retired Special Forces commander named Michael Waltz calls Trump a draft-dodger who “ hasn ’ t served this country a day in his life , ” and a Vietnam veteran , Tom Hanton , says that Trump ’ s quip about POWs was “ the most infuriating comment I think I ’ ve heard from a politician in my entire life. ” One former Marine infantry officer described Trump to me as a “ fake-bake-ing chicken hawk ” whose “ knowledge of the Middle East could be trumped ( sorry ) by your average Georgetown sophomore. ” Trump ’ s chosen foreign policy advisers—which include a 2009 college graduate who touted his experience in the Model U.N. on his online résumé and another who used Kanye West lyrics to make arguments on his foreign policy blog—have only stoked these anxieties . “ Weirdo nobodies , ” was how one military historian characterized them to me . “ They ’ re probably the least qualified group of foreign policy and national security advisers I ’ ve ever seen or even heard of , ” said Richard Kohn , an expert in civil-military relations and retired professor at the University of North Carolina . A source with firsthand knowledge told me that Trump ’ s campaign pursued retired General David Petraeus , Middle East scholar Daniel Pipes and former U.N . Ambassador John Bolton , but all three men declined . In a TV appearance not long afterward , Trump said he wouldn ’ t hesitate to replace the members of his military team if they didn ’ t agree with him . ( Trump ’ s campaign didn ’ t respond to multiple requests for comment . ) For even the savviest of presidents , the relationship between a commander in chief and his military is famously fraught , an intricate dance of egos and agendas , worldviews and bureaucracies . A President Trump , however , could usher in a clash of historic proportions . “ If you take the man at his word , ” said Michael Breen , the president of the Truman National Security Project and a decorated former Army officer , “ we have a presidential candidate who seems to have committed himself to triggering what would probably be the greatest crisis in civil-military relations since the American Civil War . ”
One of the first tasks of a new president is finding the right people to surround himself with . His cabinet members are there to enact his agenda , and if they fail to do so , he can pressure them to resign or fire them . The president ’ s relationship with his military leaders is fundamentally different . While he gets to appoint both the secretary of defense as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the latter is an apolitical figure , not a partisan official . The incoming White House typically inherits the previous administration 's chair of the Joint Chiefs ( the leaders of the Army , Navy , Air Force , National Guard and Marines ) and combatant commanders . The president can not control what his generals say to Congress . And while he technically has the power to remove three- and four-star generals from service , it ’ s far riskier to dismiss a general than a cabinet member gone rogue . “ If a military official resigns , it ’ s a crisis in civil-military relations , ” said Peter Mansoor , a retired Army colonel and former executive officer under Petraeus . “ If a cabinet position does that , it ’ s just politics. ” Probably the most famous example of such a crisis was when President Harry Truman canned Douglas MacArthur—and that didn ’ t end well for Truman . MacArthur was revered for his leadership in WWII . ( One of his aides praised him as “ the greatest man since Christ. ” ) But after Truman named the 70-year-old general the supreme commander of Allied forces in the Pacific during the Korean War , MacArthur started ignoring orders , withholding information about his operations , and publicly questioning Truman ’ s policy . So Truman removed him from his post , effectively ending his military career . It was a deeply unpopular decision . Letters poured into the administration demanding Truman ’ s impeachment and calling him “ a Judas ” and “ the pig in the White House. ” Meanwhile , when MacArthur returned to the United States he was greeted with parades and endless praise . The Senate held hearings on MacArthur ’ s dismissal , during which the general blasted his president ’ s foreign policy . Truman , who privately said MacArthur ’ s testimony was “ a bunch of damn bullshit , ” never recovered , and in March 1952 , he announced he would not run for re-election . The military leadership ’ s independent nature gives it considerable power to fight back against a president it doesn ’ t like . As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the 1990s , for instance , Colin Powell nearly derailed President Bill Clinton ’ s administration in its first year . The military brass was skeptical of Clinton long before he arrived at the White House . He was the first antiwar president , having avoided the Vietnam War and once writing of “ loathing ” the military . During the 1992 campaign , he ’ d pledged to rewrite the military ’ s laws to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly .
Powell had no intention of letting this happen . The four-star general viewed the new president and his team as “ children , ” as diplomat Richard Holbrooke later recalled . Powell was a charming operator with an inspiring life story who had spent most of his nearly 35-year career in Washington and knew how to work the levers of power . ( “ You show me a general in Washington who ain ’ t political and I ’ ll show you a guy who ain ’ t going to get promoted again , and probably should not be a general in the first place , ” he once said . ) Shortly before Clinton ’ s inauguration , he told a class of Naval Academy midshipmen that if they found Clinton ’ s policy “ completely unacceptable and it strikes to the heart of your moral beliefs , then I think you have to resign. ” Five days after Clinton ’ s inauguration , Clinton met with Powell and the rest of the Joint Chiefs in the Roosevelt Room . “ [ Homosexuality ] is a problem for us , ” Powell informed the new president , according to a notetaker . One by one , the rest of the generals flatly opposed the president ’ s plan . Furthermore , as former White House aide George Stephanopoulos wrote in his memoir , the Joint Chiefs had already lined up congressional support for their position : “ Their message was clear : Keeping this promise will cost you the military . Fight us , and you ’ ll lose—and it won ’ t be pretty. ” And that ’ s essentially what happened . Powell did little to quash rumors that the entire Joint Chiefs would resign if Clinton went through with the policy . During the next nine months , the battle over the issue cost Clinton dearly . Eventually , he agreed to Powell ’ s proposed compromise , which we now know as “ Don ’ t Ask , Don ’ t Tell. ” “ The new president had been rolled , ” wrote historian Matthew Moten in his book Presidents and Their Generals . The Bush administration , meanwhile , provided a disturbing preview of the damage that can be done when a civilian leadership pushes the armed services to adopt policies of dubious legality . Donald Rumsfeld , Bush ’ s defense secretary , was regarded as uninterested in the military ’ s advice and dismissive of the Joint Chiefs . After September 11 , 2001 , Rumsfeld authorized the use of “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” —practices that exposed the U.S. to charges of violating the Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes Act . The decision set off years of turmoil within the armed services . Retired Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson , the former chief of staff to Colin Powell , who was by then secretary of state , said that there were numerous instances of individuals in the chain of command sitting on the order to introduce abusive—and , some thought , illegal—interrogation methods in December 2002 . “ There was never a collective agreement to do the things that Rumsfeld told people to do in that memo , ” Wilkerson recently told me . “ There were certain leaders that passed on and gave orders based on those documents , but there are lots and lots of people who walked away from it and refused to do it . ”
Former CIA general counsel John Rizzo predicted an employee “ exodus ” if Trump became president and followed through on his proposals .
Alberto Mora , the Navy 's general counsel , memorably fought to ban any use of enhanced interrogation techniques , which he believed were torture . Mark Fallon , the deputy commander of the Pentagon 's Criminal Investigation Task Force , similarly argued that allowing his agents to witness the acts described in Rumsfeld 's order , let alone implement them , would be disastrous . `` Either they 'll watch the law being broken , or , as sworn law enforcement officers , seeing laws being broken , they may try to arrest the military interrogators , ” he told his boss , CITF Commander Colonel Brittain Mallow , as recounted in ex-FBI agent Ali Soufan ’ s book , The Black Banners . “ Nothing good can come of this . '' Retired military officers told me that the effect of this kind of internal dissension can be crippling . `` You have usually an enormous decrease in morale because you sense that there 's nothing you can do about it , '' Wilkerson told me . `` Your values are being disrupted ; you feel powerless . '' Andrew Bacevich , a retired Army colonel and military historian , said that `` any policy that is inconsistently applied creates confusion and consternation in a hierarchical organization . '' On some occasions , the military has been able to use the tools at its disposal—the press , Congress , calculated leaks , endless bureaucratic maneuvering—to reshape a president ’ s entire policy . President Barack Obama , for instance , arrived in office determined to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . But he encountered two formidable opponents in Petraeus , the head of the U.S. Central Command , which coordinates military activities across the Middle East and Central Asia , and Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal , who the new president had named the top commander in Afghanistan . McChrystal ’ s effort began with a 66-page classified review of the war effort that reached the opposite conclusion to the one favored by Obama . In McChrystal ’ s assessment , he argued that he needed at least 40,000 more troops in order to succeed in Afghanistan . Petraeus , the respected architect of the surge who was being talked about as a future presidential candidate , stumped for additional troops in the media . Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , tacitly endorsed McChrystal ’ s plan in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee . Then the classified McChrystal report was leaked to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward . On September 21 , 2009 , the Post ran Woodward ’ s story on the front page : “ McChrystal : More Forces or ‘ Mission Failure. ’ ” The impact of this leak is hard to overstate . It essentially forced Obama to take ownership of the Afghan War—a move he and his aides had resisted . If he stuck with his preferred option , he would be contradicting a respected general in the field who was predicting near-apocalyptic consequences unless additional troops were dispatched . At a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , McChrystal was asked if a more modest approach could work . “ A strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position is probably a shortsighted strategy , ” he said . Obama was furious , according to Woodward ’ s book Obama ’ s Wars , telling his aides : “ We ’ ve got to stop this. ” In the end , he couldn ’ t . In a December 1 speech at West Point , Obama ordered 30,000 new troops into Afghanistan . McChrystal could—and did—find another 10,000 soldiers from the ranks of the coalition forces , which meant he got his 40,000 . The generals had won .
In the many books by and about Trump , and in interviews given by his employees past and present , a clear picture emerges of his leadership style . Trump prides himself on his unpredictability— “ My moves are totally uncalculated , ” he boasted to one biographer . He ’ s known as a micromanager who insisted on personally signing company checks and calling people his employees had already contacted to check their work . By his own admission , he gets “ bored too easily ” and relishes shaking up a company or an industry . “ My attention span is short and probably my least favorite thing to do is maintain the status quo , ” he has written . “ Instead of being content when everything is going fine , I start getting impatient and irritable. ” The culture at Trump ’ s company has been described as Darwinian . “ He really believed that having people fighting and in conflict for approval made them work harder , ” Trump ’ s former executive secretary , Rhona Graff , once recounted .
The military leaders that Trump would inherit are , by all indications , less forceful personalities than Powell , Petraeus or McChrystal , but it ’ s hard to imagine them responding well to this kind of behavior . The current Joint Chiefs chairman , Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford , is known as an especially skillful operator able to bridge the diplomatic and military worlds , with a low-key demeanor that helped to win over Obama . And in recent months , Dunford has found subtle ways to signal disapproval of Trump ’ s statements . When he was asked during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about Trump ’ s support for torture and attacking the families of suspected terrorists , Dunford didn ’ t mention Trump by name , but observed that such orders would have an “ adverse effect ” on “ the morale of the force ” and “ aren ’ t legal for them to do anyway. ” He also pushed back against Trump ’ s assertion that NATO was “ very obsolete ” by telling reporters , “ In my mind , the relevance of NATO is not at all in question. ” In an indication of how much Trump ’ s statements on national security have triggered intense debate within the military , Defense Secretary Ash Carter has made it clear he doesn ’ t want officials weighing in on campaign politics . The nation ’ s intelligence agencies have also been gripped by similar anxieties about the prospect of a Trump presidency . CIA Director John Brennan recently told NBC News that he would refuse to execute orders from a future president to use waterboarding . John Rizzo , the former CIA general counsel who worked at the agency for 35 years , told me that the employees he still spoke with were “ terrified ” at the prospect of reopening the debates over the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques . “ Deep concern is a mild way of putting the prospect of their commander in chief basically ordering them to go down this road again given all the trauma , ” he said . If Trump won and followed through on his proposals , Rizzo predicted an employee “ exodus. ” “ At a minimum , ” he went on , “ people would refuse to participate in anything resembling the former interrogation program and insist on a transfer to another part of the agency where they wouldn ’ t be involved in these things. ” Meanwhile , with Trump still in a strong position to clinch the Republican nomination , some current members of the military bureaucracy are starting to game out exactly what they would do if he were elected . There are some who think Trump ’ s brash persona might actually be an asset . Wilkerson , the retired Army colonel , told me he ’ d recently spoken to an active-duty colonel who thought Trump might force through welcome changes to the military establishment . “ If Trump comes in and shakes up these graybeard idiots , ” Wilkerson said the colonel told him , “ I ’ m all for it. ” But such sentiments seem very much the minority view . Earlier this year , Bryan McGrath , a defense consultant and former Navy officer of 21 years , watched in shock as Trump climbed to the top of the Republican field . He dusted off an anti-Trump manifesto he ’ d written the previous fall and sent it to Eliot Cohen , a former State Department adviser and professor at Johns Hopkins University . McGrath and Cohen polished up the letter , sent it to their contacts in the foreign policy community , and on March 2 published it on the website War on the Rocks with nearly 100 signatories . The letter charged that Trump would “ make America less safe ” and was “ utterly unfitted to the office . ”","When Donald Trump launched his bid for the White House, one of his earliest initiatives was a promise to help Americans who had gone to war for their country. Or, as his campaign put it, to take care of “all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do, but a politician has no clue.” Last summer, about a month after declaring his candidacy, Trump unveiled a hotline for veterans to share ideas about how to overhaul the bureaucracy that served them.

""Either they'll watch the law being broken, or, as sworn law enforcement officers, seeing laws being broken, they may try to arrest the military interrogators,” he told his boss, CITF Commander Colonel Brittain Mallow, as recounted in ex-FBI agent Ali Soufan’s book, The Black Banners. “Nothing good can come of this."" Retired military officers told me that the effect of this kind of internal dissension can be crippling. ""You have usually an enormous decrease in morale because you sense that there's nothing you can do about it,"" Wilkerson told me. ""Your values are being disrupted; you feel powerless."" Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel and military historian, said that ""any policy that is inconsistently applied creates confusion and consternation in a hierarchical organization."" On some occasions, the military has been able to use the tools at its disposal—the press, Congress, calculated leaks, endless bureaucratic maneuvering—to reshape a president’s entire policy. President Barack Obama, for instance, arrived in office determined to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he encountered two formidable opponents in Petraeus, the head of the U.S. Central Command, which coordinates military activities across the Middle East and Central Asia, and Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal, who the new president had named the top commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal’s effort began with a 66-page classified review of the war effort that reached the opposite conclusion to the one favored by Obama. In McChrystal’s assessment, he argued that he needed at least 40,000 more troops in order to succeed in Afghanistan. Petraeus, the respected architect of the surge who was being talked about as a future presidential candidate, stumped for additional troops in the media. Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, tacitly endorsed McChrystal’s plan in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Then the classified McChrystal report was leaked to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. On September 21, 2009, the Post ran Woodward’s story on the front page: “McChrystal: More Forces or ‘Mission Failure.’” The impact of this leak is hard to overstate. It essentially forced Obama to take ownership of the Afghan War—a move he and his aides had resisted. If he stuck with his preferred option, he would be contradicting a respected general in the field who was predicting near-apocalyptic consequences unless additional troops were dispatched. At a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, McChrystal was asked if a more modest approach could work. “A strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position is probably a shortsighted strategy,” he said. Obama was furious, according to Woodward’s book Obama’s Wars, telling his aides: “We’ve got to stop this.” In the end, he couldn’t. In a December 1 speech at West Point, Obama ordered 30,000 new troops into Afghanistan. McChrystal could—and did—find another 10,000 soldiers from the ranks of the coalition forces, which meant he got his 40,000. The generals had won.

In the many books by and about Trump, and in interviews given by his employees past and present, a clear picture emerges of his leadership style. Trump prides himself on his unpredictability—“My moves are totally uncalculated,” he boasted to one biographer. He’s known as a micromanager who insisted on personally signing company checks and calling people his employees had already contacted to check their work. By his own admission, he gets “bored too easily” and relishes shaking up a company or an industry. “My attention span is short and probably my least favorite thing to do is maintain the status quo,” he has written. “Instead of being content when everything is going fine, I start getting impatient and irritable.” The culture at Trump’s company has been described as Darwinian. “He really believed that having people fighting and in conflict for approval made them work harder,” Trump’s former executive secretary, Rhona Graff, once recounted.

The military leaders that Trump would inherit are, by all indications, less forceful personalities than Powell, Petraeus or McChrystal, but it’s hard to imagine them responding well to this kind of behavior. The current Joint Chiefs chairman, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, is known as an especially skillful operator able to bridge the diplomatic and military worlds, with a low-key demeanor that helped to win over Obama. And in recent months, Dunford has found subtle ways to signal disapproval of Trump’s statements. When he was asked during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about Trump’s support for torture and attacking the families of suspected terrorists, Dunford didn’t mention Trump by name, but observed that such orders would have an “adverse effect” on “the morale of the force” and “aren’t legal for them to do anyway.” He also pushed back against Trump’s assertion that NATO was “very obsolete” by telling reporters, “In my mind, the relevance of NATO is not at all in question.” In an indication of how much Trump’s statements on national security have triggered intense debate within the military, Defense Secretary Ash Carter has made it clear he doesn’t want officials weighing in on campaign politics. The nation’s intelligence agencies have also been gripped by similar anxieties about the prospect of a Trump presidency. CIA Director John Brennan recently told NBC News that he would refuse to execute orders from a future president to use waterboarding. John Rizzo, the former CIA general counsel who worked at the agency for 35 years, told me that the employees he still spoke with were “terrified” at the prospect of reopening the debates over the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. “Deep concern is a mild way of putting the prospect of their commander in chief basically ordering them to go down this road again given all the trauma,” he said. If Trump won and followed through on his proposals, Rizzo predicted an employee “exodus.” “At a minimum,” he went on, “people would refuse to participate in anything resembling the former interrogation program and insist on a transfer to another part of the agency where they wouldn’t be involved in these things.” Meanwhile, with Trump still in a strong position to clinch the Republican nomination, some current members of the military bureaucracy are starting to game out exactly what they would do if he were elected. There are some who think Trump’s brash persona might actually be an asset. Wilkerson, the retired Army colonel, told me he’d recently spoken to an active-duty colonel who thought Trump might force through welcome changes to the military establishment. “If Trump comes in and shakes up these graybeard idiots,” Wilkerson said the colonel told him, “I’m all for it.” But such sentiments seem very much the minority view. Earlier this year, Bryan McGrath, a defense consultant and former Navy officer of 21 years, watched in shock as Trump climbed to the top of the Republican field. He dusted off an anti-Trump manifesto he’d written the previous fall and sent it to Eliot Cohen, a former State Department adviser and professor at Johns Hopkins University. McGrath and Cohen polished up the letter, sent it to their contacts in the foreign policy community, and on March 2 published it on the website War on the Rocks with nearly 100 signatories. The letter charged that Trump would “make America less safe” and was “utterly unfitted to the office.”

Trump avoided the draft, but called his sex life in the 1980s “my personal Vietnam.” Citing his fear of sexually transmitted diseases, he said, ""I feel like a great and very brave soldier.” (Getty Images, Gregory Pace/Sygma/Corbis, AP Photo/Jack Kanthal.)",www.highline.huffingtonpost.com,left,zvd6wgoKhaeBBFOf

U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in a letter to President Trump that she plans to resign from her post effective in late May.

Wilson has been named as the sole finalist to be the next president of the University of Texas at El Paso, a position that the system's regents will vote on after a state-required waiting period of 21 days. She said she will resign after getting the job.

""It has been a privilege to serve alongside our Airmen over the past two years and I am proud of the progress that we have made restoring our nation's defense,"" she wrote. ""We have improved the readiness of the force; we have cut years out of acquisition schedules and gotten better prices through competition; we have repealed hundreds of superfluous regulations; and we have strengthened our ability to deter and dominate in space.""

It is space – in particular Trump's desire to a create a space force – that Pentagon sources say produced tensions between Wilson and the White House, who saw her as delaying the process. At the same time, Wilson was seen at one point as a contender to fill the role of secretary of defense. Patrick Shanahan, now the acting secretary of defense, has been more openly supportive of the idea of a space force.

In a memo last September, Wilson said creating a space force would cost about $13 billion over five years. ""The costs here are additive costs,"" she told Defense News. ""To stand up a department that's responsible for recruiting and training and planning and programming and budgeting and all of the leadership requirements that a department has, it's a major undertaking. It's a bold idea.""

Last month, the administration said the space force would be under the umbrella of the Air Force, at least temporarily. That was a shift from the ""separate but equal"" branch that Trump had initially proposed.

Wilson inherited an Air Force involved in numerous major airstrike campaigns. ""On many occasions, Wilson sounded the alarm about an overstretched Air Force — especially after years of sequestration-driven cuts — and worried that airmen were being asked to do much,"" Air Force Times reported. ""In a November 2017 press conference, Wilson and [Chief of Staff Gen.] Goldfein worried that repeated deployments were going to burn out airmen and could even break the force.""

Wilson, who graduated from the Air Force Academy and was an Air Force officer during the Cold War, had been leading the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology when she was tapped for this position.

She's a Republican and represented New Mexico in Congress from 1998 to 2009. She ran twice for Senate, in 2008 and 2012, and lost both times.

The University of Texas board of regents said in a statement that they unanimously voted in favor of Wilson on Friday.

""Dr. Wilson's broad experience in the highest levels of university leadership, and state and national government– whether securing federal grant awards, advising our nation's most important national research laboratories, raising philanthropic dollars or running large, dynamic organizations – will help ensure that UTEP continues its remarkable trajectory as a nationally recognized public research institution,"" Regents' chairman Kevin Eltife said.",www.npr.org,center,W2d2e87IRixRjwrV
