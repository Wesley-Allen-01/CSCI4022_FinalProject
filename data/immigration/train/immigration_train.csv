Authorities evacuated thousands of visitors from Liberty Island , where the statue stands , after a woman climbed to the statue 's base around 3 p.m. and remained for several hours before police took her into custody .
About 4,500 tourists were forced off the island when officials closed it , according to The New York Times , which said more than 20,000 tourists visit the Statue of Liberty every Fourth of July .
Media reports identify the woman as Therese Okoumou . Video shows her walking , sitting and lying down on different parts of the statue 's base near the foot and robes .

Rise and Resist , which reportedly formed after the 2016 election , said 40 people took part in the `` banner action '' and that Okoumou was one of them , though they were not aware of her plans to climb the statue later . According to the Daily News , Okoumou has taken part in several protests with the group previously .
National Park Service spokesman Jerry Willis told The Associated Press that at least six people were taken into custody for unfurling the banner . He said federal rules do not allow banners to hang at the monument , which is run by the park service .

Several lawmakers said there appeared to be no consensus over calls for granting legal status to the 11 million , many of whom have lived in the United States for years , after a 2 1/2-hour closed-door session .
`` We have a disagreement inside here , '' said Republican Representative Steve King , who guessed that his colleagues were split `` 50/50 '' on whether any of the undocumented residents should get legal status .
There will likely have to be an agreement between the Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate , which last month approved a comprehensive immigration bill backed by the White House that includes a pathway to citizenship .
Backers of the Senate bill insist some sort of path to citizenship must be part of any final bill that they help send to President Barack Obama to sign into law .
The Republican lawmakers said there was consensus that the U.S. border should be secured further against illegal crossings and suggested that House Speaker John Boehner could seek passage of such a bill as a first step toward a larger agreement .
Republican leaders issued a statement again rejecting a Senate-passed bill that puts the 11 million on a 13-year path to citizenship .
`` It 's hard not to be discouraged right now , '' said Senator Jeff Flake , the Arizona Republican who helped write the Senate bill and served 12 years in the House .
The Senate bill removes the threat of deportation for most illegal residents , but features several hurdles to citizenship , including learning English , paying back taxes and passing criminal background checks . It authorizes $ 46 billion for border security and to revamp the visa system to help high-tech firms , farmers and other businesses hire foreign workers .
Obama and his fellow Democrats have been calling for prompt action by the House . Earlier on Wednesday , the president told a group of Hispanic lawmakers that he was willing to do whatever it takes to help enact a bill .
Even former President George W. Bush , who rarely wades into policy debates , gave a boost to efforts in Congress . While the two-term Republican president did not embrace any particular bill , he said he hoped there would be a `` positive resolution . ''
Speaking in Dallas at a naturalization ceremony , Bush said , `` We have a problem . The laws governing the immigration system are n't working . ... The system is broken . ''
But House Republicans , who hold a 234-201 majority over Democrats , gave no indication of fast action on a major bill .
`` It is going to be a process of months , not days or weeks , '' Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma told Reuters in a telephone interview after Wednesday 's meeting .
`` I do n't see anything until late this year or early next year . It is going to take that long ; it is going to be that big of a debate , '' Cole added , referring to tough bargaining with the Senate .
Meanwhile , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is working on a plan to grant citizenship for children of illegal immigrants who are in the United States through no fault of their own , according to Republican lawmakers . In the past , Republicans have blocked such legislation .
But even that relatively modest step is controversial among some of the most conservative House Republicans .
`` You ca n't separate the ... kids from those ( parents ) who came across the border with a pack of contraband on their back , '' King said .
And Representative Mo Brooks said he recited a line from `` America the Beautiful '' to bolster his argument that legislation should not help those in the United States illegally : `` Confirm thy soul in self control , Thy liberty in law . ''
`` Anyone who has come to our country , their first step on American soil is to thumb their nose at American laws ... we should not award them with our highest honor , which is citizenship , '' Brooks said .
Earlier , the White House signaled that Obama will become more publicly engaged in the intensifying immigration debate in Congress .
The administration released a report arguing that passing sweeping immigration reforms such as the Senate 's would expand the economy 3.3 percent by 2023 and reduce the federal deficit by almost $ 850 billion over 20 years .
Thomas Donohue , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which wants comprehensive immigration reforms enacted , expressed hope that public support would prompt House Republicans to eventually back a major bill . `` If the arguments are compelling , this deal is not over by any means , '' he said .
The November presidential election , in which Obama captured more than 70 percent of the growing Hispanic vote , was seen by many Republicans as a wake-up call that their party must do more to appeal to minorities .
The call for comprehensive reform resonates with some Republican senators , who have to run in statewide elections , and with some prospective Republican presidential candidates .
But it holds less appeal to House Republicans who fear challenges from the conservative Tea Party movement if they back a pathway to citizenship , a core demand of Democrats .
According to a recent study by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report , which tracks congressional races , only 24 of the 234 House Republicans represent districts that are more than 25 percent Hispanic .

Adler, Mike Riggs, Charles Oliver, Peter Bagge, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Shikha Dalmia","Immigration is the most-heated domestic policy topic today . Leave aside questions about whether members of MS-13 , a violent gang started in Los Angeles , are `` animals '' or not and you still have Donald Trump dismissing migrants from `` shithole countries '' , members of Congress such as Rep. Steve King ( R-Iowa ) railing against `` somebody else 's baby '' , and Republicans pushing to reduce legal immigration by 50 percent . Democrats these days are mostly welcoming to `` dreamers '' but we 're just a few years removed from the policies of Barack Obama , who was arguably the `` most anti-immigrant president since Eisenhower '' and had no trouble deporting millions of Latinos and raiding workplaces suspected of employing undocumented workers .
Opponents of immigrants and immigration take their cues from President Trump , who opened his campaign for the Republican nomination by denouncing illegals entering from Mexico as nothing less than a criminal horde :
When Mexico sends its people , they 're not sending their best . They 're not sending you . They 're not sending you . They 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with us . They 're bringing drugs . They 're bringing crime . They 're rapists . And some , I assume , are good people .
Opponents advance a host of other , sometimes contradictory arguments to make their case . Immigrants , they say , are lazy and soak up massive amounts of welfare even while they are willing to work harder and for less money than natives ( a paradox known as `` Schrodinger 's Immigrant '' ) . The litany also includes : Immigrants bring down wages , illegals make a joke of the rule of law , newcomers do n't learn English , they vote Democratic , they destroy common culture , they are hotbeds of terrorism and crime , and on and on .
Supporters of current or expanded levels of immigration ( I 'm one ) dutifully rebut all these arguments and more by pointing to relevant data , economic theory , and history . We also underscore American ideals of inclusion and a history of immigrant entrepreneurship , among other things .
Needless to say , the two sides rarely convince one another , or even come to a common understanding of what facts are true and relevant .
Which makes a column appearing in today 's Wall Street Journal all the more interesting . Gerald F. Seib lays out a series of facts that I think everyone can agree on . They provide an excellent starting point for a different discussion about immigration , one that foregrounds the very sort of economic issues that both diehard Trump supporters and proponents of immigration can agree on . Among them :
Unemployment is at 3.9 percent , the lowest it has been in 17 years .
`` There are 6.6 million job openings in the U.S. , which means that , for the first time in history , there are enough openings to provide a job for every unemployed person in the country . ''
Employers all over the country—Seib mentions Maryland crab processors , Alaskan fisheries , farmers in the heartland , and New Hampshire restaurants— '' all say they are critically short of workers . ''
The relatively few slots for annual H-1B and H-2B visas ( for skilled and unskilled workers , respectively ) have been filled at record paces this year already .
`` The [ National Federation of Independent Business ] says that 22 % of small-business owners say finding qualified workers is their single most important business problem , more than those who cite taxes or regulations . ''
That 's a portrait of an economy that is stuck in second gear , unable to expand to meet increasing demand and grow . Given the general listlessness of the American economy for virtually the entirety of the 21st century , in which annual economic growth has averaged under 2 percent ( compared to about 3 percent from 1950 to 2000 ) , we may not be immediately capable of recognizing the opportunity in front of us .
The long-term prospects for a healthy economy face real problems , reports Seib , including :
`` The fertility rate for women aged 15 to 44 was 60.2 births per 1,000 women , the lowest since the government began tracking that rate more than a century ago . ''
Over the next three decades , the percentage of Americans over the age of 65 will become larger than the percentage under the age of 18 , `` a historic crossing of demographic lines . ''
Other sources underscore that immigration and births to immigrants , who tend to have more children than native-born women , are the only reasons why America 's population is growing slightly . Unless it is supplemented by immigration , the decline in birth rates will disastrously sink the labor market in years to come . To get a sense of what happens when a country ages dramatically and does n't replenish its population with younger residents , look to ultra-restrictionist Japan , which is the prime example of a First World `` demographic disaster . '' Japan , which has fewer people than it did in 2000 , is suffering a slow-motion economic collapse characterized by weak-to-nonexistent economic growth and an erosion of quality of life . As The Weekly Standard 's Jonathan V. Last wrote in What to Expect When No One 's Expecting : America 's Coming Demographic Disaster , Japan 's `` continuously falling birthrates '' has given rise to `` a subculture that dresses dogs like babies and pushes them around in carriages , and a booming market in hyper-realistic-looking robot babies . '' No major developed country , he cautions , has managed to consistently grow economically with a shrinking population .
As a hardcore , principled libertarian , I 'll defend anyone 's right to dress dogs however they want and buy whatever sorts of robots the market can produce , but I do n't think today 's Japan is anybody 's vision of making America great again .
The Journal 's Seib concludes that `` there is a good case that America 's economy—growing and thriving—has never needed immigrant labor more than it does now . '' Yet the congressional reaction to the current situation is to crack down on illegal immigration , especially through intrusive employer sanctions . Hardliners are also calling for reductions in legal immigration . Instead of giving DACA dreamers permanent legal status , they want to give them three-year renewable grants . When it comes to conventional immigration , they want to reduce current totals by `` by 260,000 slots a year , or 25 % . The libertarian Cato Institute , which is generally pro-immigration , says the reduction actually would be closer to 40 % ' which would be 'the largest policy-driven reduction in legal immigration since the awful , racially motivated acts of the 1920s . ' ''
Immigration is more complicated than economics , of course , but Seib 's cautious and fact-rich piece may provide a model for a meaningful conversation between pro-immigration forces and restrictionists . If the latter want to make America great , they surely recognize that this is something that we ca n't do on our own .

immigration,Guest Writer - Right,2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/13/kate-steinles-death-and-sanctuary-cities-what-good-are-our-laws-without-enforcement.html,OPINION: Kate Steinle's death and sanctuary cities: What good are our laws without enforcement? | Fox News,2015-07-13,Cal Thomas,"According to the Wall Street Journal , the last serious attempt to count the number of federal criminal laws appears to have been made in 1982 by a retired Justice Department official named Ronald Gainer . He failed , but the estimate then was “ …50 titles and 23,000 pages of federal law. ” Many more laws have been added since then .
One thing is certain : If you violate federal law you are likely to be punished with a fine , imprisonment or both . These laws are supposed to apply to everyone , unless , it seems , you are an illegal alien living in San Francisco , or any of the other sanctuary cities around the country .
By now , anyone not preoccupied with stories about shark attacks , the Confederate flag or singer Ariana Grande “ maliciously licking ” donuts she did not buy , has heard about 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle gunned down by an illegal alien while walking on a San Francisco pier with her father . Her accused killer is Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez , a felon from Mexico , who had been deported five times but always managed to sneak back in , choosing San Francisco , he reportedly said , because he knew it was a “ sanctuary city ” that would not deport him .
The concept of a sanctuary city comes from the Old Testament .
“ …if someone deliberately kills another person , then the slayer must be dragged even from my altar and be put to death . ( Exodus 21:14 ) . But if it was simply an accident permitted by God , I will appoint a place of refuge where the slayer can run for safety . ( Exodus 21:13 ) . These cities will be places of protection from a dead person ’ s relatives who want to avenge the death . The slayer must not be put to death before being tried by the community . ( Numbers 35:19 ) “ Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger . ... The congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger , and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled ; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil… ” ( Numbers 35:24-28 ) .
This ancient concept for a sanctuary city was not to shield a suspect from justice , but to guarantee justice was done . The suspected murderer would be given safe haven only until a trial was held . If he was found guilty , he was executed . If he was acquitted he was set free . But if he left the sanctuary city before the trial , “ the avenger of blood ” could kill him .
Officials in “ sanctuary cities ” pervert the concept of sanctuary by helping suspects evade the law . Congress should deny federal funds to these cities as long as they continue to ignore the law . President Obama is unlikely to speak , much less lead on this issue , because the Democratic Party thinks it can win the Hispanic vote in 2016 . Republicans and the Chamber of Commerce want cheap immigrant labor , so they will huff and puff but do nothing , hoping the controversy goes away . The public must not let this happen .
According to the Washington Post , there are an estimated 60 sanctuary cities around the country , including major cities like New York , Los Angeles and Houston , and these cities are unlikely to change their sanctuary policies anytime soon .
In fact , writes International Business Times , “ …a number of local leaders in U.S. cities have renewed their efforts to foster welcoming and inclusive communities for illegal aliens . So-called ‘ sanctuary policies ’ … are intended to signal to the undocumented community that it ’ s safe to come out of the shadows without the fear of being reported to federal authorities . ”
If laws are not enforced , what is the point of having them ?
If politicians are so afraid of losing the Hispanic vote that they do nothing in response to the murder of Kathryn Steinle , they should be removed from office . The notion that Hispanics won ’ t vote for a party that stands for justice is racist .","According to the Wall Street Journal, the last serious attempt to count the number of federal criminal laws appears to have been made in 1982 by a retired Justice Department official named Ronald Gainer. He failed, but the estimate then was “…50 titles and 23,000 pages of federal law.” Many more laws have been added since then.

One thing is certain: If you violate federal law you are likely to be punished with a fine, imprisonment or both. These laws are supposed to apply to everyone, unless, it seems, you are an illegal alien living in San Francisco, or any of the other sanctuary cities around the country.

By now, anyone not preoccupied with stories about shark attacks, the Confederate flag or singer Ariana Grande “maliciously licking” donuts she did not buy, has heard about 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle gunned down by an illegal alien while walking on a San Francisco pier with her father. Her accused killer is Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a felon from Mexico, who had been deported five times but always managed to sneak back in, choosing San Francisco, he reportedly said, because he knew it was a “sanctuary city” that would not deport him.

The concept of a sanctuary city comes from the Old Testament.

“…if someone deliberately kills another person, then the slayer must be dragged even from my altar and be put to death. (Exodus 21:14). But if it was simply an accident permitted by God, I will appoint a place of refuge where the slayer can run for safety. (Exodus 21:13). These cities will be places of protection from a dead person’s relatives who want to avenge the death. The slayer must not be put to death before being tried by the community. (Numbers 35:19) “Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger. ... The congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil…” (Numbers 35:24-28).

This ancient concept for a sanctuary city was not to shield a suspect from justice, but to guarantee justice was done. The suspected murderer would be given safe haven only until a trial was held. If he was found guilty, he was executed. If he was acquitted he was set free. But if he left the sanctuary city before the trial, “the avenger of blood” could kill him.

Officials in “sanctuary cities” pervert the concept of sanctuary by helping suspects evade the law. Congress should deny federal funds to these cities as long as they continue to ignore the law. President Obama is unlikely to speak, much less lead on this issue, because the Democratic Party thinks it can win the Hispanic vote in 2016. Republicans and the Chamber of Commerce want cheap immigrant labor, so they will huff and puff but do nothing, hoping the controversy goes away. The public must not let this happen.

According to the Washington Post, there are an estimated 60 sanctuary cities around the country, including major cities like New York, Los Angeles and Houston, and these cities are unlikely to change their sanctuary policies anytime soon.

In fact, writes International Business Times, “…a number of local leaders in U.S. cities have renewed their efforts to foster welcoming and inclusive communities for illegal aliens. So-called ‘sanctuary policies’ … are intended to signal to the undocumented community that it’s safe to come out of the shadows without the fear of being reported to federal authorities.”

`` We % u2019re off to a good start , '' Sen. Charles Schumer says
Sen. Chuck Grassley stills says legalization first is a problem
WASHINGTON — Senators who back a sweeping immigration law said Thursday they were heartened by the first big test of the proposal in which members of both parties were allowed to make changes to the bill .
The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee adopted eight amendments offered by Republicans and 13 from Democrats . Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , said some of the Republican amendments have helped strengthen the bill and should encourage more GOP members of Congress to consider voting for it .
`` We all know this is going to be a long , hard road but we 're off to a good start , '' Schumer said . `` I think our arguments are holding firm . ''
But Republican critics said the bill still ignores important demands on border security that will make it difficult to pass the Senate and especially the Republican-controlled House of Representatives .
Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , saw the committee vote down one of his amendments that would have tripled the size of the Border Patrol and quadrupled the number of drones and sensors used to patrol the southwest border with Mexico .
`` The American people want Congress to be serious about border security , '' Cruz said . `` That is true among Republicans and Democrats . It is true in red states and blue states . And it is with regret that the committee has consistently rejected any attempts to put real teeth in this bill to secure the border . ''
Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , and the ranking member on the committee , echoed the concerns of many Republicans worried that the bill allows the nation 's estimted 11 million unauthorized immigrants to get legal status before the nation 's borders are secured .
`` No one can dispute that this bill is legalization first and security second , '' Grassley said .
Cruz 's measure was one of seven GOP amendments that was voted down , compared to Democrats who did not have any of their amendments struck down .
That prompted Dan Stein , president of the Federation of American Immigration Reform , a group that opposes the bill , to call the hearing `` a complete sham of a process . '' Marielena Hincapié , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center , a group that supports the bill , said the senators fought off any `` poison pills '' that could doom the prospects of the bill .
The committee was focusing on the border security sections of the 867-bill during Thursday 's hearing – the first of several hearings when senators are expected to vote on more than 300 amendments that have been filed .
One of the biggest changes to the bill was an amendment filed by Grassley that ensures that the Department of Homeland Security focus on securing the entire southwestern border . According to the bill , Homeland Security must monitor 100 % of the border , and intercept 90 % of people crossing , only in sectors deemed `` high risk . '' That 's defined as sectors where 30,000 people were apprehended in the previous year , and in 2012 would have included three of the nine border sectors .
Grassley 's amendment requires the department to reach those goals in all border sectors .
The committee voted down a separate Grassley amendment that would have required that Homeland Security certify the entire border as secured before the nation 's unauthorized immigrants can be granted temporary legal status .
The bill as written only requires that Homeland Security create and submit a plan to secure the entire border before those immigrants can apply to become `` Registered Provisional Immigrants , '' which would allow them to legally reside and work in the country .
The committee is now finished with the border security portion of the bill . They must still vote on portions that deal with legalizing the nation 's 11 million unauthorized immigrants , enforcing immigration at work-sites and revamping the legal immigration system . The next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday , and there are still several ways in which any momentum on the bill may be disrupted :
The committee is set to resume hearing amendments after the lunch break and will continue throughout the day , and there still exists several ways in which any momentum on the bill may be disrupted :
Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , filed amendments to extend immigration rights and benefits to the spouses and families of LGBT couples who are in a `` long-term committed relationship . '' Immigration activists lobbied the Gang of Eight to include such provisions in their bill , but members held off . And while the idea has support from Democrats on the Judiciary committee , Republicans have warned that including the topic on an already-controversial bill could ruin any chances it has at clearing both chambers . Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , has said simply that adding LGBT immigration rights would `` kill the bill . ''
Many Republicans say the bill does n't do enough to fully secure the country 's border . The last time Congress passed a comprehensive immigration bill in 1986 , up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants were allowed to apply to become U.S. citizens . But the promise of border security did n't happen , leading to another wave of illegal immigration and more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country today . Republican senators , including Rep. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , have filed several amendments to require the border be certified as secure before people can get green cards and U.S. citizenship . Democrats believe the 13-year path to citizenship is already long enough and worry about putting many more barriers in front of them .
Most of the nation 's 11 million unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before Dec. 31 , 2011 , would be able to apply for a green card within 10 years , and U.S. citizenship within 13 years , after they have passed criminal background checks , paid taxes , learned English and civics and paid at least $ 2,000 in fees . But immigration activist groups , and some Democrats , feel that 's too difficult a process . Sen. Richard Blumenthal , D-Conn. , filed an amendment to move that cutoff date back to April 17 , 2013 , so recent arrivals are n't left out , and another one to allow young unauthorized immigrants to get a faster path . Adoption of those amendments could rankle Republicans and undermine the bill .
The current Senate bill allows most of the nation 's 11 million unauthorized immigrants to apply for temporary legal status and , eventually , full U.S. citizenship . But some Republicans , including Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Ala. , are trying to amend the bill to place some limits . Sessions , for example , has filed an amendment to bar anybody who could qualify for Medicare , Obamacare and other welfare programs from qualifying to get their green card . If the amendments prevent too many people from getting legal status , the bill could quickly lose the support of activist groups , Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration .
Many of the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have filed amendments to change the focus of the nation 's future legal immigration system . Some lawmakers , such as Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , want to make it easier for companies to hire foreign , high-skilled workers . The bill already increases the number of visas and green cards granted to people with advanced degrees , but Hatch and others believe it places too many barriers in front of U.S. businesses . Adding such provisions could upset some Republicans who are worried the bill already puts U.S. workers in jeopardy . The shift away from a family-based immigration system also worries some in Congress . Sen. Mazie Hirono , D-Hawaii , filed an amendment to allow U.S. citizens the ability to petition for their siblings – a part of U.S. immigration law that is repealed by the Gang of Eight bill .","The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on the amendments over the course of several hearings.

Sen. Chuck Grassley stills says legalization first is a problem

WASHINGTON — Senators who back a sweeping immigration law said Thursday they were heartened by the first big test of the proposal in which members of both parties were allowed to make changes to the bill.

The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee adopted eight amendments offered by Republicans and 13 from Democrats. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said some of the Republican amendments have helped strengthen the bill and should encourage more GOP members of Congress to consider voting for it.

That's defined as sectors where 30,000 people were apprehended in the previous year, and in 2012 would have included three of the nine border sectors.

Grassley's amendment requires the department to reach those goals in all border sectors.

The committee voted down a separate Grassley amendment that would have required that Homeland Security certify the entire border as secured before the nation's unauthorized immigrants can be granted temporary legal status.

The bill as written only requires that Homeland Security create and submit a plan to secure the entire border before those immigrants can apply to become ""Registered Provisional Immigrants,"" which would allow them to legally reside and work in the country.

The committee is now finished with the border security portion of the bill. They must still vote on portions that deal with legalizing the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants, enforcing immigration at work-sites and revamping the legal immigration system. The next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, and there are still several ways in which any momentum on the bill may be disrupted:

The committee is set to resume hearing amendments after the lunch break and will continue throughout the day, and there still exists several ways in which any momentum on the bill may be disrupted:

Same-Sex Immigration Rights

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., filed amendments to extend immigration rights and benefits to the spouses and families of LGBT couples who are in a ""long-term committed relationship."" Immigration activists lobbied the Gang of Eight to include such provisions in their bill, but members held off. And while the idea has support from Democrats on the Judiciary committee, Republicans have warned that including the topic on an already-controversial bill could ruin any chances it has at clearing both chambers. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said simply that adding LGBT immigration rights would ""kill the bill.""

Border Security Enhancements

Many Republicans say the bill doesn't do enough to fully secure the country's border. The last time Congress passed a comprehensive immigration bill in 1986, up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants were allowed to apply to become U.S. citizens. But the promise of border security didn't happen, leading to another wave of illegal immigration and more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country today. Republican senators, including Rep. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have filed several amendments to require the border be certified as secure before people can get green cards and U.S. citizenship. Democrats believe the 13-year path to citizenship is already long enough and worry about putting many more barriers in front of them.

Easier Path to Citizenship

Most of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before Dec. 31, 2011, would be able to apply for a green card within 10 years, and U.S. citizenship within 13 years, after they have passed criminal background checks, paid taxes, learned English and civics and paid at least $2,000 in fees. But immigration activist groups, and some Democrats, feel that's too difficult a process. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., filed an amendment to move that cutoff date back to April 17, 2013, so recent arrivals aren't left out, and another one to allow young unauthorized immigrants to get a faster path. Adoption of those amendments could rankle Republicans and undermine the bill.

Who Can Benefit

The current Senate bill allows most of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants to apply for temporary legal status and, eventually, full U.S. citizenship. But some Republicans, including Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., are trying to amend the bill to place some limits. Sessions, for example, has filed an amendment to bar anybody who could qualify for Medicare, Obamacare and other welfare programs from qualifying to get their green card. If the amendments prevent too many people from getting legal status, the bill could quickly lose the support of activist groups, Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration.

Workers vs. Relatives

Many of the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have filed amendments to change the focus of the nation's future legal immigration system. Some lawmakers, such as Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, want to make it easier for companies to hire foreign, high-skilled workers. The bill already increases the number of visas and green cards granted to people with advanced degrees, but Hatch and others believe it places too many barriers in front of U.S. businesses. Adding such provisions could upset some Republicans who are worried the bill already puts U.S. workers in jeopardy. The shift away from a family-based immigration system also worries some in Congress. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, filed an amendment to allow U.S. citizens the ability to petition for their siblings – a part of U.S. immigration law that is repealed by the Gang of Eight bill.

The broad agreement by the influential Gang of Eight senators amounts to the most serious bipartisan effort to act on the highly charged issue since George W. Bush’s comprehensive measure was defeated in the Senate in 2007.

GOP presidential candidates are falling over themselves to get on record with tough immigration plans . A string of them — Rand Paul , Chris Christie , Lindsey Graham , Scott Walker , Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum — have spoken out in some form against birthright citizenship . That 's the idea that being born on U.S. soil , regardless of your parents ' legal status , automatically makes you a U.S. citizen .
Ben Carson went even further , saying he wants to secure the border — where he claims there are caves in which immigrants can hide — by using drones .
`` You look at some of these caves and things out there , one drone strike , boom , and they 're gone , '' Carson said .
When it comes to the issue of birthright citizenship , while some conservatives disagree , a lot of legal scholars believe it is settled law , enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , and that it therefore would be fantastically difficult to overturn .
The flurry of tough positions on birthright citizenship is yet another sign of the power front-runner Donald Trump , with his inflammatory immigration rhetoric , has in the 2016 GOP race . The question for other Republicans is how to take tough — but still palatable for a general election — stances on the issue .
Both Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush have defended birthright citizenship , but they have said more needs to be done about women who might come into the U.S. expressly to have children . It 's unclear exactly what they would — or could — actually do .
`` If there 's abuse , if people are bringing , pregnant women are coming in to have babies simply because they can do it , then there ought to be greater enforcement , '' Bush told conservative radio host Bill Bennett this week , as reported by Politico . `` That 's [ the ] legitimate side of this . Better enforcement so that you do n't have these , you know , 'anchor babies , ' as they 're described , coming into the country . ''

Rubio told voters in Iowa this week , as reported by the Wall Street Journal , `` I 'm open to doing things that prevent people who deliberately come to the U.S. for purposes of taking advantage of the 14th Amendment , but I 'm not in favor of repealing it . ''
The problem is that it 's not certain exactly what the government could do to stop this from happening . ( Neither the Bush nor the Rubio campaign has responded to requests for comment from NPR . )
What the U.S. could do to prevent ( the few ) `` birth tourists ''
The closest thing to a law that could slow foreign women from having babies in the U.S. is that you ca n't lie about why you want a visa to the U.S. , said Muzaffar Chishti , director of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute 's office at New York University .
`` If you 're a Chinese woman coming to the U.S. as a tourist , you are making a representation to the U.S. government that I am coming to be a tourist , '' Chishti said . `` If it is established by a consular officer that the woman is not really coming for tourism , but is coming to deliver a baby , you can deny the visa . There 's no doubt about that . ''
But that 's tough to enforce under current regulations , says Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , a think tank that tends to advocate tighter immigration policies .
`` It 's not illegal [ for a foreign tourist to have a baby in the U.S. ] , though the State Department could put through regulation if they wanted to try to stop it , '' he says , for example , by more pointedly asking pregnant women if they 're coming simply to have a baby in the U.S .
This phenomenon of having a child on a tourist visa has come to be known as `` birth tourism , '' and many of the stories about it in the past few years have tended to center around women coming from China , where families are restricted in the number of children they can have .
In addition to asking more questions of pregnant women entering the country on tourist visas , likewise , Chishti said the government could crack down more on the clinics — or `` maternity hotels , '' as they are called — where these women routinely go to give birth .
Of course , that only applies to those who go through the visa process . The number of `` birth tourists '' may indeed be very small . Earlier this year , the Center on Immigration Studies , which favors more tightly monitoring `` birth tourism , '' estimated that there are 36,000 such women annually .
Stopping other immigrants from having children is a different story
But there are millions of people who entered the country illegally . Because the law did n't detect many of them when they came in , trying to stop them from having children is difficult , to say the least .
Likewise , millions of people came in legally but have overstayed their visas . Improving the entry-exit monitoring system could do a lot to bring down the number of people who are in the country illegally , Chishti said . But that does n't mean anything about their children .
`` To be sure , this recommendation applies to reducing the pool of unauthorized in general , '' he said , but `` does not specifically address the 'anchor babies ' phenomenon , because most likely mothers would deliver babies during their periods of authorized stay . ''
It 's also possible that trying to crack down on the birthright phenomenon simply means tightening existing laws and enforcement . Krikorian says that would have been a smarter answer to the birthright question for Bush and Rubio .
`` A better-thought-out , more humane response would have been , when we enforce immigration laws better , in general , there will be fewer people here to give birth who are not citizens or green card holders , '' he says . But as it stands , he adds , simply calling for better enforcement against these so-called `` anchor babies '' is , to him , a non-answer .
`` It 's their way of seeming responsive without supporting a change in our citizenship practices , '' he says .
So , how many children are born to illegal immigrants every year ?
There are no exact counts on the number of U.S. children with parents who are in the U.S. illegally , but some organizations have tried to count .
The Pew Research Center found in a 2012 report that around 5.5 percent of all K-12 students were U.S.-born citizens who also had at least one parent who was not authorized to be in the U.S . Still , many of those children may have one parent who is here legally .
The center also estimated in 2008 that 340,000 of the 4.3 million children born in the U.S. — not quite 8 percent — were born to immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally .
Those are rough estimates , but they suggest that while the so-called `` anchor baby '' population is relatively small , the practice of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally having babies in the U.S. is a very real phenomenon .

immigration,The Guardian,0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/25/us-troops-mexico-border-caravan,US plans to send 800 troops to border as caravan travels through Mexico,2018-10-25,Guardian Staff,"Homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said American soldiers have “ no intention ” of shooting migrants who try to cross into the US from Mexico – at least for the time being – but they will all be apprehended , as Donald Trump moves towards a plan to close the border .
The Trump administration on Thursday announced it is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border , at the direction of a president who has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the November midterms , as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico .
The US defense secretary , Jim Mattis , is expected to sign an order sending the troops to the border , bolstering national guard forces already there .
And on Thursday evening , in an interview with Fox News while visiting the border in Arizona , Nielsen said : “ We do not have any intention right now to shoot at people , but they will be apprehended , however . ”
The government is weighing an order to deny even asylum applications at a fortified border , by asserting emergency powers that would almost certainly face challenges in the US courts , the Washington Post reported .
Nielsen added : “ But I also take my officer and agent , their own person safety , extraordinarily seriously . They do have the ability of force to defend themselves . ”
The action comes as Donald Trump has spent recent days calling attention to the caravan of Central Americans , many fleeing violence or extortion by gangs and grinding poverty , including thousands of parents with babies or older relatives , slowly making their way by foot into southern Mexico , but still more than 1,000 miles from US soil . Many are aware they are not welcome by the Trump administration but have no idea how their journey is stoking an election cycle political firestorm in the US and inspiring drastic plans from the government .
Where is the migrant caravan from – and what will happen to it at the border ? Read more
Trump , who made fear about immigrants a major theme of his 2016 election campaign , has been eager to make it a top issue heading into the 6 November midterm elections , which will determine control of Congress . The president and senior White House officials have long believed the issue is key to turning out his base of supporters .
Late on Thursday , the New York Times and Politico reported that Trump was considering an executive action – aimed at the caravan of people currently travelling through Mexico – to bar migrantsentirely .
The additional troops would provide logistical and other support to the border patrol , said the US official , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a plan that had not been finalized and formally announced .
It ’ s not unusual for the national guard to help with border security . Active duty troops , however , are rarely deployed within the US except for domestic emergencies like hurricanes or floods .
Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings that the US is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants “ pouring across the border ” , whom he has painted with a sinister brush .
He has claimed , without any apparent basis in fact , that “ Middle Easterners ” were among the group . At rallies and on Twitter , Trump has tried to portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration , even claiming , with no evidence , that Democrats organized the caravan .
He tweeted Thursday : “ Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border ” and said he was using the military to respond to what he called a “ National Emergency ” .

The Trump administration on Thursday announced it is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border, at the direction of a president who has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the November midterms, as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico.

The US defense secretary, Jim Mattis, is expected to sign an order sending the troops to the border, bolstering national guard forces already there.

And on Thursday evening, in an interview with Fox News while visiting the border in Arizona, Nielsen said: “We do not have any intention right now to shoot at people, but they will be apprehended, however.”

The government is weighing an order to deny even asylum applications at a fortified border, by asserting emergency powers that would almost certainly face challenges in the US courts, the Washington Post reported.

Nielsen added: “But I also take my officer and agent, their own person safety, extraordinarily seriously. They do have the ability of force to defend themselves.”

The action comes as Donald Trump has spent recent days calling attention to the caravan of Central Americans, many fleeing violence or extortion by gangs and grinding poverty, including thousands of parents with babies or older relatives, slowly making their way by foot into southern Mexico, but still more than 1,000 miles from US soil. Many are aware they are not welcome by the Trump administration but have no idea how their journey is stoking an election cycle political firestorm in the US and inspiring drastic plans from the government.

Where is the migrant caravan from – and what will happen to it at the border? Read more

Trump, who made fear about immigrants a major theme of his 2016 election campaign, has been eager to make it a top issue heading into the 6 November midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. The president and senior White House officials have long believed the issue is key to turning out his base of supporters.

Late on Thursday, the New York Times and Politico reported that Trump was considering an executive action – aimed at the caravan of people currently travelling through Mexico – to bar migrantsentirely.

The additional troops would provide logistical and other support to the border patrol, said the US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a plan that had not been finalized and formally announced.

It’s not unusual for the national guard to help with border security. Active duty troops, however, are rarely deployed within the US except for domestic emergencies like hurricanes or floods.

Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings that the US is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants “pouring across the border”, whom he has painted with a sinister brush.

He has claimed, without any apparent basis in fact, that “Middle Easterners” were among the group. At rallies and on Twitter, Trump has tried to portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration, even claiming, with no evidence, that Democrats organized the caravan.

He tweeted Thursday: “Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border” and said he was using the military to respond to what he called a “National Emergency”.

Most of the migrants in the group are Hondurans, seeking to escape poverty and violence, and include families with children.

The caravan swelled to about 7,000 people after crossing the Mexican border on 19 October, but sickness, fear and police harassment have whittled down its numbers.

Trump tweeted a direct message to the migrants Thursday, urging them to return home.

“To those in the Caravan, turnaround [sic],” he wrote. “We are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!”

The migrants have largely been disconnected from news reports about them. When asked about Trump’s tweets, they have generally responded that he should stop attacking them and said they would keep heading north.

Candy Guillermo, a 37-year-old migrant in the caravan, said she and the children in group would be considered a threat. “Trump should be more humanitarian,” she said. “We only want to give our kids a better future.”

Migrants who do reach the US border can claim asylum under US and international law. Those who clear an initial screening are often released until their cases are decided in immigration court, which can take several years.

So far , though , he seems to be succeeding .

It’s a thin, hard line to walk: between the Republican establishment and the base, between compassion and the rule of law, between family and politics. And Rubio is walking it on an issue no politician has cracked in nearly two decades while testing the support of the grassroots Tea Party conservatives he will need if he seeks the White House in 2016. So far, though, he seems to be succeeding. After helping to craft bipartisan reforms in the Senate, he has served as their chief spokesman on right-wing radio and Fox News, getting remarkably sympathetic hearings from Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and other talkers whose antiamnesty crusades helped kill similar efforts in the George W. Bush era. Almost all of them have praised his courage—Limbaugh called his work “admirable,” like a Pope granting absolution—and the backlash has yet to materialize. “I don’t know anyone else who could have broken through the conservative sound barrier on immigration,” says American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas, a Miami lawyer who gave Rubio his first job as an attorney. “Marco can do left brain, so you get the logic, and he can do right brain, so you feel it in your heart and soul.”

This is Rubio’s first leadership audition, his chance to show Republicans that he’s more than a compelling speaker with boyish good looks, that he’s not just geographically, demographically and ideologically correct. Immigration, he says, is tricky. Though he has evolved on the issue—flip-flopped, if you prefer—he says he’s still not sure he’s got it exactly right. The word he uses most is balance. That was his first thought after he played that voice mail from his mother on his iPhone.

“I have to balance that humanity with reality,” he says. “We have immigration laws. They have to be followed. But yeah, she reminded me that there’s a human element to this as well. As a policymaker, you have to strike a balance.” The result will shape the future of the nation and the dreams of millions of immigrants, not to mention the fate of the GOP and the ambitions of Marco Rubio.

“It’s Complicated”

In his autobiography, An American Son, Rubio says his closest boyhood friend was his cigar-smoking, Fidel Castro–hating grandfather, Pedro Víctor García, a proud Cuban exile who taught him to believe in Reagan, American exceptionalism and himself. Hobbled by childhood polio, more book-smart than business-savvy, Papa never achieved much material success. But he spent hours with his grandson reading Spanish-language newspapers, fulminating about communism and pushing the future Senator to expand his horizons beyond football. “He would scold me for performing poorly in school, but he never let me believe I was incapable of being successful,” Rubio wrote. “His dreams for us were his legacy.”

One question left unanswered by President Obama's announcement last week that he would stop deportations of some young illegal immigrants was what the policy change will mean for students.

Professors and students are wondering whether the changes Obama announced will really help them. The president's executive action defers deportations for illegal immigrants who are 30 or under and meet certain conditions, giving them the ability to apply for a work permit.

While some in the Latino community are celebrating the president's announcement, others say its effect on education is murky.

""It's talking about deferral of the process of deportation,"" says University of Georgia professor Betina Kaplan. ""It's talking about working permits. But it's not saying anything about education.""

Georgia bans illegal immigrants from attending the state's five most prestigious public colleges, including the University of Georgia. Kaplan says it's unclear whether schools will begin accepting these students again.

""I don't see any element that would put pressure on the schools in Georgia to lift the ban, but I think we have to wait and see,"" says Kaplan.

'Very Vague'

Another concern is that state and local officials will have discretion as to whether illegal immigrants who meet the criteria will get deferred status. University of Georgia professor Lorgia Garcia-Pena says she worries students could identify themselves and end up at risk.

""A student could apply for this and still get deported. There's no process of appeal. There's no guarantee that the person that applies for this ... will receive it. It's really very vague,"" Garcia-Pena says.

A University of Georgia spokesman says the school will look to the state Board of Regents for guidance on Obama's directive. The board says officials are examining the implications.

State Sen. Barry Loudermilk, a Republican, supports banning illegal immigrants from attending all public colleges in Georgia. He says even if students get deferred status as the president has suggested, that doesn't mean they are legal residents.

""I think that's something that ... we're going to have to take a close look at,"" Loudermilk says. ""And will the state stand up and say, 'We're still not going to do this'? So does it really become law? In my opinion, it does not.""

Young Immigrants See Wasted Potential

South of Atlanta in Griffin, Ga., Gustavo Madrigal is cleaning up dishes in the home his family rents. He came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 9 and is undocumented.

""I never really knew what it would mean for me in college,"" Madrigal says.

Madrigal was a good student in high school, with a 3.9 average his junior year. He found out in 12th grade, he says, that he wasn't eligible for most scholarships.

""I don't think education should be about immigration status. It should be about merit. And I mean, the University of Georgia — I could have made a huge contribution to it by going there and studying there,"" he says.

""We don't want people to end [up] working at McDonald's the rest of their lives, you know. Not that that's not respectable but, you know, there's just so much potential with our community that it would be a shame to see it go ... to waste and nothing happen with it,"" Madrigal says.

Another undocumented immigrant, Keish Kim, 20, came to the U.S. from South Korea when she was 8. She graduated from high school but is also unable to attend college here despite good grades.

""We've been delaying and putting thousands of people on a limbo state for over a decade,"" she says.

Kim sees Obama's announcement as mostly a political move.

""I definitely don't want to belittle President Obama's step, [his] courage to stand up and announce that memo, but I think we have to be cautious. I am cautious about it and very hesitant,"" Kim says.

Law enforcement is not just a way to deal with individual violators but also a way to remind society at large that there can be no civilization without legality .
What makes citizens obey the law is not always their sterling character . Instead , fear of punishment — the shame of arrest , fines , or imprisonment — more often makes us comply with laws . Law enforcement is not just a way to deal with individual violators but also a way to remind society at large that there can be no civilization without legality .

Worse still , when one law is left unenforced , then all sorts of other laws are weakened .
The result of hundreds of “ sanctuary cities ” is not just to forbid full immigration enforcement in particular jurisdictions . They also signal that U.S. immigration law , and by extension other laws , can be ignored .
The presence of an estimated 12 million or more foreign nationals unlawfully living in the U.S. without legal consequence sends a similar message . The logical result is the current caravan of thousands of Central Americans now inching its way northward to enter the U.S. illegally .
If the border were secure , immigration laws enforced , and illegal residence phased out , deterrence would be reestablished and there would likely be no caravan .
Campus protests often turn violent . Agitators shout down and sometimes try to physically intimidate speakers with whom they disagree . Most of the disrupters are upper-middle-class students . Many have invested up to $ 200,000 in their higher education , often to ensure well-paying careers upon graduation .
Protesters assume that ignoring laws about peaceful assembly poses no consequences . Usually student disrupters are right . College administrators will typically shrug at even violent protests rather than call police to make arrests .
Yet if a few bold disrupters were actually charged with misdemeanors or felonies and had arrests tarnishing their otherwise sterling résumés , there would likely be far fewer illegal and violent protests .
In the last two years , a number of celebrities have openly fantasized about doing physical harm to the president of the United States . Madonna , Kathy Griffin , Johnny Depp , Robert De Niro , Snoop Dogg , and other stars have expressed their wishes that Donald Trump might be beaten up , blown up , cut up , or shot up .
Their shared premise is that they are too famous , influential , or wealthy to expect consequences that ordinary citizens might face for making threats to the safety of the president of the United States . If the next time a Hollywood icon tweeted or voiced a threat to the president he or she was subsequently put on a no-fly list , the current assassination chic would quickly stop .
Every person assumes the freedom to eat safely in a restaurant , to walk to work without disturbance , and to relax without fear of violence . Now , that is not always the case , at least not if one is deemed politically influential and conservative .
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders , Senators Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell , and Representative Devin Nunes must worry that when they venture out in public , protesters will scream in their face , attempt to bar their passage or disrupt their meal — and do so without legal ramifications .
Trump is a polarizing president , and his critics have decided that extraordinary and sometimes extralegal measures are morally justified to stop him . Supposedly high-minded ends are seen as justifying unlawful means . Helping undocumented immigrants evade the law , stopping the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh , or otherwise thwarting Trump all warrant special immunity .
The problem with ignoring laws is that it is contagious — and can boomerang .
Sanctuary cities could in theory birth conservative sanctuary zones . Would today ’ s protesters wish for other jurisdictions to nullify federal laws and court rulings concerning abortion , gun registration and gay marriage ?
If thousands of Hondurans in a caravan are deemed above the law , then why not exempt future mass arrivals of Chinese or South African immigrants ?
If Cruz and other Republican politicos can ’ t eat in peace , will Barack Obama , Dianne Feinstein , and Nancy Pelosi soon face the same disruptions — the illegality justified by higher moral concerns ?
If students can block a right-wing speaker or storm a diner , will they also object when anti-abortion protesters bar the passage of a pro-choice campus guest ?
German philosopher Immanuel Kant noted that “ anarchy is law and freedom without force . ”
Translated to our current context , Kant might say that all our high-minded talk about the Bill of Rights means absolutely nothing without the cop on the beat and the local district attorney .","Members of a migrant caravan walk past police on the highway to Sao Pedro Tapanatepec, Mexico, October 27, 2018.

Or, as 17th-century British statesman George Savile famously put it: “Men are not hanged for stealing horses, but that horses may not be stolen.”

In the modern world, we call such prompt, uniform, and guaranteed law enforcement “deterrence,” from the Latin verb meaning “to frighten away.” One protester who disrupts a speech is not the problem. But if unpunished, he green-lights hundreds more like him.

Worse still, when one law is left unenforced, then all sorts of other laws are weakened.

The result of hundreds of “sanctuary cities” is not just to forbid full immigration enforcement in particular jurisdictions. They also signal that U.S. immigration law, and by extension other laws, can be ignored.

The presence of an estimated 12 million or more foreign nationals unlawfully living in the U.S. without legal consequence sends a similar message. The logical result is the current caravan of thousands of Central Americans now inching its way northward to enter the U.S. illegally.

If the border were secure, immigration laws enforced, and illegal residence phased out, deterrence would be reestablished and there would likely be no caravan.

Campus protests often turn violent. Agitators shout down and sometimes try to physically intimidate speakers with whom they disagree. Most of the disrupters are upper-middle-class students. Many have invested up to $200,000 in their higher education, often to ensure well-paying careers upon graduation.

Protesters assume that ignoring laws about peaceful assembly poses no consequences. Usually student disrupters are right. College administrators will typically shrug at even violent protests rather than call police to make arrests.

Yet if a few bold disrupters were actually charged with misdemeanors or felonies and had arrests tarnishing their otherwise sterling résumés, there would likely be far fewer illegal and violent protests.

In the last two years, a number of celebrities have openly fantasized about doing physical harm to the president of the United States. Madonna, Kathy Griffin, Johnny Depp, Robert De Niro, Snoop Dogg, and other stars have expressed their wishes that Donald Trump might be beaten up, blown up, cut up, or shot up.

Their shared premise is that they are too famous, influential, or wealthy to expect consequences that ordinary citizens might face for making threats to the safety of the president of the United States. If the next time a Hollywood icon tweeted or voiced a threat to the president he or she was subsequently put on a no-fly list, the current assassination chic would quickly stop.

Every person assumes the freedom to eat safely in a restaurant, to walk to work without disturbance, and to relax without fear of violence. Now, that is not always the case, at least not if one is deemed politically influential and conservative.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Senators Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell, and Representative Devin Nunes must worry that when they venture out in public, protesters will scream in their face, attempt to bar their passage or disrupt their meal — and do so without legal ramifications.

There are many causes of the current legal laxity.

Trump is a polarizing president, and his critics have decided that extraordinary and sometimes extralegal measures are morally justified to stop him. Supposedly high-minded ends are seen as justifying unlawful means. Helping undocumented immigrants evade the law, stopping the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, or otherwise thwarting Trump all warrant special immunity.

The problem with ignoring laws is that it is contagious — and can boomerang.

Sanctuary cities could in theory birth conservative sanctuary zones. Would today’s protesters wish for other jurisdictions to nullify federal laws and court rulings concerning abortion, gun registration and gay marriage?

If thousands of Hondurans in a caravan are deemed above the law, then why not exempt future mass arrivals of Chinese or South African immigrants?

If Cruz and other Republican politicos can’t eat in peace, will Barack Obama, Dianne Feinstein, and Nancy Pelosi soon face the same disruptions — the illegality justified by higher moral concerns?

If students can block a right-wing speaker or storm a diner, will they also object when anti-abortion protesters bar the passage of a pro-choice campus guest?

German philosopher Immanuel Kant noted that “anarchy is law and freedom without force.”

Translated to our current context, Kant might say that all our high-minded talk about the Bill of Rights means absolutely nothing without the cop on the beat and the local district attorney.

The strategy for passing immigration reform through the Senate isn’t just about striking a deal on border security.

It also means assuring Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) that fish processors in his home state will be protected, meeting a request from Sen. Dean Heller (R -Nev.) that Nevada will be added to a border commission and guaranteeing Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) that resources won’t be diverted from the northern border.

As border security dominates headlines a week before the final vote is expected, a quieter campaign is under way to address the targeted, sometimes parochial, interests of senators who are likely to support the bill but need to show that they fought for some immigration-related concession in return.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) fields the requests during private chats on the Senate floor and drop-ins to his office just outside the chamber. The asks may not be make or break for these senators — and the horse trading isn’t as intense as in past legislative fights — but attempting to meet the demands is still viewed as critical to Democratic leaders and members of the Gang of Eight who must piece together a filibuster-proof majority.

The challenge right now is the glacial pace of voting. The Senate has agreed to hold only a dozen votes in more than a week of debate on the Gang of Eight’s immigration overhaul. And bill proponents will need action to accelerate soon if they hope to have enough time to tackle the list of proposed changes that could lock in the support of moderate Democrats and a dozen Republicans that could put the bill over the finish line.

Even Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who led talks on a bipartisan border security agreement, was lobbied by individual senators to insert a must-have amendment in any emerging deal.

“You have got a number of members from our caucus who are looking at this, and they’re saying there isn’t any one piece that gets us there but a number of pieces could get us there,” Hoeven said.

Some of the individual demands are well known by now.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) wants to stiffen the restrictions on immigrant access to government benefits. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) says the language on requiring implementation of an electronic employment verification system needs to be tightened. And a number of Republicans are insisting on more specific metrics for determining whether the border is secured as a condition of their vote.

immigration,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2019/4/2/18291584/2020-immigration-democrats-policy-castro-abolish-ice,Julián Castro wants to radically restrict immigration enforcement,2019-04-02,Dara Lind,"As President Donald Trump threatens to “ close ” the US-Mexico border , one of the Democrats seeking to run against him in 2020 is coming out with the primary ’ s first immigration proposal — one that would dramatically reduce immigration enforcement .
Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro , a former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of housing and urban development , released an immigration platform on Tuesday morning , along with a Medium post outlining what the Castro campaign calls its “ People First ” immigration policy .
So far , the many Democrats vying for the 2020 presidential nomination have stayed in pretty safe territory on immigration , promising to support bills that would provide a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants living in the US — and especially groups that are at risk of losing legal protections under the Trump administration , like immigrants protected from deportation under the DACA , Temporary Protected Status , and Deferred Enforced Departure programs .
Castro ’ s proposal promises those things , as well as reversals of signature Trump policies like the travel ban and the reduction in refugee resettlement . But it goes much further than that in dismantling immigration enforcement .
In many ways , it seeks to unravel the post-9/11 immigration enforcement system — which has made it legally riskier than ever to live in the US as an unauthorized immigrant .
Most notably , Castro proposes to repeal the provision of US law that makes “ illegal entry ” into the US a federal crime , which has been on the books since 1929 but has only been routinely enforced in the 21st century . Prosecuting illegal entry — often referred to by “ 1325 , ” the relevant section of Chapter 8 of the US Code — gave the Trump administration the power to separate thousands of families in 2018 , by referring parents for criminal prosecution .
“ The fact that over the last several years this system has been weaponized by the Trump administration to go after immigrants , and the chaos that has been created under 1325 , I believe , is the wrong direction for the country , ” Castro told ███ . And his response — “ to go the opposite way ” — is to undo the legal underpinning that made it possible .
That proposal , and others , would require Congress to pass an immigration bill — something that Castro remains optimistic there ’ s bipartisan appetite for in Congress , but has said elsewhere wouldn ’ t be his first legislative priority . Unlike other plans 2020 candidates have released on other issues , however , much of the immigration policy Castro addresses is about what to do with existing executive branch resources and authorities — it ’ s policy , in other words , that Castro or another Democrat could start to change on day one .
Castro , who is polling around 1 percent in most early primary polls , is struggling to gain a foothold in the 2020 primary ; unlike several of his competitors , he doesn ’ t have a US Senate seat from which to launch his campaign proposals as bills . But his immigration platform could help him capitalize on his status as the only Latino candidate in the field , in a party that will likely need to mobilize Latino voters to take back the presidency from Trump in 2020 . It could also serve as a marker as other candidates work to define their immigration stances — setting a goalpost far to the left of what Democrats have proposed in previous presidential cycles .
Under Castro ’ s plan , an immigrant crossing into the US without papers — whether he was seeking asylum in the US or coming for some other reason — would not be committing a federal crime . If caught by Border Patrol agents , she ’ d be detained for a brief amount of time , but if she didn ’ t raise any red flags , she ’ d be released into the US ( with a case management system to check up on her whereabouts ) pending an immigration hearing .
If she didn ’ t qualify for some form of legal status like asylum , she ’ d still ultimately be ordered deported from the US . Being in the US without papers would still be a civil offense — the federal equivalent of a traffic ticket — and deportation would still be the penalty . That ’ s what Castro points out distinguishes his plan from “ open borders ” ; he ’ s not actually suggesting that everyone who comes into the US be allowed to stay .
But he is saying that none of them should be charged with a crime , immediately deported , or detained for more time than strictly necessary for crossing the border .
In one respect , this is undoing 90 years of US law . Illegal entry has been a federal misdemeanor since 1929 . ( This distinguishes unauthorized immigrants who crossed the border without papers , and thus committed a misdemeanor , from those who overstayed their visas and committed only the civil violation . ) In another respect , though , it ’ s a return to the immigration system of the 20th century , when illegal entry was rarely prosecuted and border crossers were simply informally returned after being caught .
The difference is that in the 20th century , this was just a matter of discretion — presidents chose not to pour resources into enforcing this particular misdemeanor . When priorities changed , under the Bush administration , widespread illegal entry prosecutions became common — swamping federal courts along the border . More recently , the Trump administration ’ s attempts at “ zero tolerance ” prosecution of illegal entry were the legal basis for its widespread separation of families in 2018 : Children were separated because their parents were being transferred to criminal custody for prosecution .
Proposing that “ illegal entry ” no longer be a federal crime is the policy equivalent of the “ no human is illegal ” slogan — a way to combat hawkish attitudes toward the “ rule of law ” by challenging the idea that migration ought to be a matter of crime and punishment to begin with . But it ’ s also a key justification for reversing the past few decades of border crackdown , by unpinning immigration enforcement — at least when it comes to unauthorized immigrants themselves — from crime .
Dismantling — or at least restructuring — the post 9/11 immigration-enforcement system
Castro ’ s plan isn ’ t just focused on the border . It essentially calls for the government to get out of the business of routine immigration enforcement .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement would retain its investigations unit , but Enforcement and Removal Operations — which is responsible for routine arrests and detention and deportation of unauthorized immigrants — would see its functions split over different agencies under DHS and the Department of Justice . As a result , the Castro campaign told ███ , immigration enforcement “ would prioritize individuals with serious criminal convictions , threats to national security , and multiple reentries with a criminal history . ”

As a result , the Castro campaign told ███ , immigration enforcement “ would prioritize individuals with serious criminal convictions , threats to national security , and multiple reentries with a criminal history. ” Customs and Border Protection would be steered away from routine immigration enforcement within the United States ( where it has broad latitude to operate within 100 miles of a US border ) .
DHS would stop signing agreements with local law enforcement agencies ( known as 287 ( g ) agreements ) to help enforce immigration law — undoing one of the key tools that 21st-century presidents have used as a “ force multiplier . ”

— and since the plan promises to end the use of private prisons , which account for the overwhelming majority of immigration detention facilities , it wouldn ’ t really have much flexibility as to what those cases were . Immigration courts would be removed from the attorney general ’ s authority . Right now , immigration courts are at best quasi-independent ; they ’ re under the Department of Justice , and the attorney general has power to set court precedent and regulate caseload . ( Under Jeff Sessions and his successors , the Trump DOJ has used these powers aggressively . ) The Castro proposal , echoing a call that ’ s been gaining steam among immigration lawyers and advocates , would turn immigration courts into “ Article I ” courts — like tax court — with more independence .
Some of these proposals would require Congress to pass them — namely , the ones reorganizing parts of federal agencies . Others wouldn ’ t . But it ’ s important to think of the two of them together because of the structure of immigration enforcement as it exists right now , where a lot of power is delegated to the executive branch but in practice , policy is often made by the agents on the ground .
Castro is making a statement about what his immigration priorities would be as president — similar to those of the past two years of the Obama administration , if not even more lenient . While pretty much all of the other proposals 2020 candidates have released on various issues have been proposals for bills that Congress could take up ( not surprising , since many of them are currently senators ) , all the candidates admit that they can ’ t get an infinite number of bills through Congress . This proposal actually explains what one candidate for president would do with the powers he ’ d ( theoretically ) have on day one .
At the same time , though — as the Obama administration learned during its first six years — setting immigration priorities at the top doesn ’ t necessarily work if the agents themselves are unwilling to go along with them . The restructuring Castro is proposing would take an act of Congress to pass , but if it did pass , it would make it easier for future immigration-dove presidents to exert tighter control over enforcement line agents — while making it harder for future immigration-hawk presidents to exert similar control over immigration judges .
Castro ’ s proposal is better fleshed out in some areas than others — as you might expect for the first full proposal on immigration from a 2020 candidate , or for any proposal being released 10 months before the Iowa caucuses .
For example , reflecting the fact that the Democratic base is currently a lot more riled up about immigration enforcement than legal immigration changes , the only proposals addressing future legal immigration are either ways to address demands of people already in the United States ( for example , getting rid of the three- and 10-year bars on the spouse of a US citizen getting his green card for years if he ’ s lived in the US as an unauthorized immigrant ) or responses to particular Trump outrages ( a commitment to expanding refugee resettlement again ) .
But the biggest question mark in Castro ’ s proposal — and one that the Democratic field is likely to struggle with as a whole — is the immediate crisis facing the US right now : the influx of up to 100,000 unauthorized immigrants , many of them families , children , or asylum seekers , into the US a month , and the challenges of caring for them .
Castro does have plenty of suggestions for this population . His plan calls for expanding ports of entry to make it easier for people to seek asylum without crossing illegally , supporting shelters and humane care for immigrant families , and expanding access to counsel for asylum seekers . And an entire section of his plan , borrowing Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ’ s call for a 21st-century “ Marshall Plan ” for Central America , suggests various ways the US can become a more productive leader in the region — “ to create safety and opportunity so that people can stay there and find what they need in their home country , ” Castro told ███ .
“ In Latin America , we have a checkered past , and one that has bred a lot of resentment , ” Castro said . “ I ’ m not naive , I don ’ t think it can happen overnight , but I do believe we can go in a different direction . ”
But , of course , that isn ’ t going to bear fruit immediately in terms of reducing immigration to the US . ( In fact , research shows that economic development can even lead to more migration in the short term . ) People will continue to come — perhaps even in unprecedentedly high numbers . Even the short-term proposals to deal with migrants who are already here will take time to build up .
And there ’ s nothing in this proposal to directly address the large number of people who won ’ t ultimately qualify for asylum under US law — even if they have attorneys , and even if the Trump administration efforts to restrict asylum for , say , victims of gang and domestic violence are reversed . Not everyone fleeing their home country out of legitimate need qualifies for asylum as US law defines it , and many of the people currently coming will not .
To many migration experts — not just immigration hawks — the “ mixed flow ” into the US is a problem . They believe it is important to reduce the number of people coming to the US without legitimate asylum claims , both because it frees up resources to address the remaining asylum seekers and because it reduces the possibility of deliberate malfeasance or fraud .
It ’ s possible that Castro and other Democrats genuinely don ’ t see that as a problem — that they ’ re willing to do whatever it takes to treat 100,000 immigrants a month as humanely as possible for as long as their cases take , even if fewer than half of them ( at the most generous accounting ) ultimately qualify for legal status in the US . Alternatively , it ’ s possible they believe that most of those 100,000 people a month really ought to qualify for humanitarian protections here , and US law needs to be expanded to accommodate that .
But that hasn ’ t been something they ’ ve articulated yet , much less been asked to justify by people who might not agree .
It might not be the turf Democrats want to fight on in 2020 . They would probably rather focus on the Trump administration ’ s biggest political overreaches on immigration : the attempt to rescind DACA , family separation , the travel ban . But depending on what happens at the border between now and then , they may not have a choice .","As President Donald Trump threatens to “close” the US-Mexico border, one of the Democrats seeking to run against him in 2020 is coming out with the primary’s first immigration proposal — one that would dramatically reduce immigration enforcement.

And an entire section of his plan, borrowing Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s call for a 21st-century “Marshall Plan” for Central America, suggests various ways the US can become a more productive leader in the region — “to create safety and opportunity so that people can stay there and find what they need in their home country,” Castro told Vox.

“In Latin America, we have a checkered past, and one that has bred a lot of resentment,” Castro said. “I’m not naive, I don’t think it can happen overnight, but I do believe we can go in a different direction.”

But, of course, that isn’t going to bear fruit immediately in terms of reducing immigration to the US. (In fact, research shows that economic development can even lead to more migration in the short term.) People will continue to come — perhaps even in unprecedentedly high numbers. Even the short-term proposals to deal with migrants who are already here will take time to build up.

And there’s nothing in this proposal to directly address the large number of people who won’t ultimately qualify for asylum under US law — even if they have attorneys, and even if the Trump administration efforts to restrict asylum for, say, victims of gang and domestic violence are reversed. Not everyone fleeing their home country out of legitimate need qualifies for asylum as US law defines it, and many of the people currently coming will not.

To many migration experts — not just immigration hawks — the “mixed flow” into the US is a problem. They believe it is important to reduce the number of people coming to the US without legitimate asylum claims, both because it frees up resources to address the remaining asylum seekers and because it reduces the possibility of deliberate malfeasance or fraud.

It’s possible that Castro and other Democrats genuinely don’t see that as a problem — that they’re willing to do whatever it takes to treat 100,000 immigrants a month as humanely as possible for as long as their cases take, even if fewer than half of them (at the most generous accounting) ultimately qualify for legal status in the US. Alternatively, it’s possible they believe that most of those 100,000 people a month really ought to qualify for humanitarian protections here, and US law needs to be expanded to accommodate that.

But that hasn’t been something they’ve articulated yet, much less been asked to justify by people who might not agree.

It might not be the turf Democrats want to fight on in 2020. They would probably rather focus on the Trump administration’s biggest political overreaches on immigration: the attempt to rescind DACA, family separation, the travel ban. But depending on what happens at the border between now and then, they may not have a choice.",www.vox.com,left,T0DIP3QT4qwcxcnm

Mccarthy, Zachary Evans, Jordan Sillars, Jay Nordlinger, Kevin D. Williamson, Tobias Hoonhout, John Mccormack","The hysterical rhetoric about President Trump ’ s executive order on refugees is out of control . Let ’ s slow down and take a look at the facts .
To read the online commentary , one would think that President Trump just fundamentally corrupted the American character . You would think that the executive order on refugees he signed yesterday betrayed America ’ s Founding ideals . You might even think he banned people from an entire faith from American shores .

Pelosi blasts Trump 's 'extreme vetting ' Exec . Order : `` This Administration has mistaken cruelty for strength and prejudice for strategy . '' pic.twitter.com/LNBnDTNvGe — Kyle Griffin ( @ kylegriffin1 ) January 28 , 2017
CNN , doing its best Huffington Post impersonation , ran a headline declaring “ Trump bans 134,000,000 from the U.S. ” The Huffington Post , outdoing itself , just put the Statue of Liberty upside down on its front page .
So , what did Trump do ? Did he implement his promised Muslim ban ? No , far from it . He backed down dramatically from his campaign promises and instead signed an executive order dominated mainly by moderate refugee restrictions and temporary provisions aimed directly at limiting immigration from jihadist conflict zones .
Let ’ s analyze the key provisions , separate the fact from the hysteria , and introduce just a bit of historical perspective .
First , the order temporarily halts refugee admissions for 120 days to improve the vetting process , then caps refugee admissions at 50,000 per year . Outrageous , right ? Not so fast . Before 2016 , when Obama dramatically ramped up refugee admissions , Trump ’ s 50,000 stands roughly in between a typical year of refugee admissions in George W. Bush ’ s two terms and a typical year in Obama ’ s two terms . The chart below , from the Migration Policy Institute , is instructive :
In 2002 , the United States admitted only 27,131 refugees . It admitted fewer than 50,000 in 2003 , 2006 , and 2007 . As for President Obama , he was slightly more generous than President Bush , but his refugee cap from 2013 to 2015 was a mere 70,000 , and in 2011 and 2012 he admitted barely more than 50,000 refugees himself .
The bottom line is that Trump is improving security screening and intends to admit refugees at close to the average rate of the 15 years before Obama ’ s dramatic expansion in 2016 . Obama ’ s expansion was a departure from recent norms , not Trump ’ s contraction .
Second , the order imposes a temporary , 90-day ban on people entering the U.S. from Iraq , Syria , Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , and Yemen . These are countries either torn apart by jihadist violence or under the control of hostile , jihadist governments .
The ban is in place while the Department of Homeland Security determines the “ information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa , admission , or other benefit under the INA ( adjudications ) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat. ” It could , however , be extended or expanded depending on whether countries are capable of providing the requested information .
The ban , however , contains an important exception : “ Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may , on a case-by-case basis , and when in the national interest , issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked. ” In other words , the secretaries can make exceptions — a provision that would , one hopes , fully allow interpreters and other proven allies to enter the U.S. during the 90-day period .
To the extent this ban applies to new immigrant and non-immigrant entry , this temporary halt ( with exceptions ) is wise . We know that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the ranks of refugees and other visitors . We know that immigrants from Somalia , for example , have launched jihadist attacks here at home and have sought to leave the U.S. to join ISIS .
Indeed , given the terrible recent track record of completed and attempted terror attacks by Muslim immigrants , it ’ s clear that our current approach is inadequate to control the threat . Unless we want to simply accept Muslim immigrant terror as a fact of American life , a short-term ban on entry from problematic countries combined with a systematic review of our security procedures is both reasonable and prudent .
However , there are reports that the ban is being applied even to green-card holders . This is madness . The plain language of the order doesn ’ t apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S. , and green-card holders have been through round after round of vetting and security checks . The administration should intervene , immediately , to stop misapplication . If , however , the Trump administration continues to apply the order to legal permanent residents , it should indeed be condemned .
Third , Trump ’ s order also puts an indefinite hold on admission of Syrian refugees to the United States “ until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest. ” This is perhaps the least consequential aspect of his order — and is largely a return to the Obama administration ’ s practices from 2011 to 2014 . For all the Democrats ’ wailing and gnashing of teeth , until 2016 the Obama administration had already largely slammed the door on Syrian-refugee admissions .
The Syrian Civil War touched off in 2011 . Here are the Syrian-refugee admissions to the U.S. until Obama decided to admit more than 13,000 in 2016 :
To recap : While the Syrian Civil War was raging , ISIS was rising , and refugees were swamping Syria ’ s neighbors and surging into Europe , the Obama administration let in less than a trickle of refugees . Only in the closing days of his administration did President Obama reverse course — in numbers insufficient to make a dent in the overall crisis , by the way — and now the Democrats have the audacity to tweet out pictures of bleeding Syrian children ?
It ’ s particularly gross to see this display when the Obama administration ’ s deliberate decision to leave a yawning power vacuum — in part through its Iraq withdrawal and in part through its dithering throughout the Syrian Civil War — exacerbated the refugee crisis in the first place . There was a genocide on Obama ’ s watch , and his tiny trickle of Syrian refugees hardly makes up for the grotesque negligence of abandoning Iraq and his years-long mishandling of the emerging Syrian crisis .
When we know our enemy is seeking to strike America and its allies through the refugee population , when we know they ’ ve succeeded in Europe , and when the administration has doubts about our ability to adequately vet the refugees we admit into this nation , a pause is again not just prudent but arguably necessary . It is important that we provide sufficient aid and protection to keep refugees safe and healthy in place , but it is not necessary to bring Syrians to the United States to fulfill our vital moral obligations .
Fourth , there is a puzzling amount of outrage over Trump ’ s directive to “ prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution , provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual ’ s country of nationality. ” In other words , once refugee admissions resume , members of minority religions may well go to the front of the line . In some countries , this means Christians and Yazidis . In others , it can well mean Muslims .
Sadly , during the Obama administration it seems that Christians and other minorities may well have ended up in the back of the line . For example , when Obama dramatically expanded Syrian refugee admissions in 2016 , few Christians made the cut :
The Obama administration has resettled 13,210 Syrian refugees into the United States since the beginning of 2016 — an increase of 675 percent over the same 10-month period in 2015 . Of those , 13,100 ( 99.1 percent ) are Muslims — 12,966 Sunnis , 24 Shi ’ a , and 110 other Muslims — and 77 ( 0.5 percent ) are Christians . Another 24 ( 0.18 percent ) are Yazidis .
As a point of reference , in 2015 Christians represented roughly 10 percent of Syria ’ s population . Perhaps there ’ s an innocent explanation for the disparity . Perhaps not . But one thing is clear — federal asylum and refugee law already require a religious test . As my colleague Andy McCarthy has repeatedly pointed out , an alien seeking asylum “ must establish that . . . religion [ among other things ] . . . was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant . ”
Similarly , the term “ refugee ” means “ ( A ) any person who is outside any country of such person ’ s nationality . . . and who is unable or unwilling to return to . . . that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of . . . religion [ among other things ] . . . [ . ] ”
But don ’ t tell CNN ’ s chief national security correspondent , who last night tweeted this :
There is no basis to the claim Muslim refugees were prioritized over Christians . Fact is , refugee policy not based in religion , until now . — Jim Sciutto ( @ jimsciutto ) January 28 , 2017
False . False . False . Religious considerations are by law part of refugee policy . And it is entirely reasonable to give preference ( though not exclusivity ) to members of minority religions .
Finally , you can read the entire executive order from start to finish , reread it , then read it again , and you will not find a Muslim ban . It ’ s not there . Nowhere . At its most draconian , it temporarily halts entry from jihadist regions . In other words , Trump ’ s executive order is a dramatic climb-down from his worst campaign rhetoric .
You can read the entire executive order from start to finish , reread it , then read it again , and you will not find a Muslim ban . It ’ s not there . Nowhere .
To be sure , however , the ban is deeply problematic as applied to legal residents of the U.S. and to interpreters and other allies seeking refuge in the United States after demonstrated ( and courageous ) service to the United States . Twitter timelines are coming alive with stories of Iraqi interpreters who ’ ve saved American lives . Few have bled more in alliance with America than Iraq ’ s Kurds , but the order itself provides for the necessary case-by-case exemptions to the temporary blanket bans . It is vital that General John Kelly , the newly confirmed secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , move expeditiously to protect those who ’ ve laid down their lives in the war against ISIS , al-Qaeda , and the Taliban . Given his own wartime experience , I believe and hope that he will .
Trump ’ s order was not signed in a vacuum . Look at the Heritage Foundation ’ s interactive timeline of Islamist terror plots since 9/11 . Note the dramatic increase in planned and executed attacks since 2015 . Now is not the time for complacency . Now is the time to take a fresh look at our border-control and immigration policies . Trump ’ s order isn ’ t a betrayal of American values . Applied correctly and competently , it can represent a promising fresh start and a prelude to new policies that protect our nation while still maintaining American compassion and preserving American friendships .","President Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office, January 23, 2017.

The Syrian Civil War touched off in 2011. Here are the Syrian-refugee admissions to the U.S. until Obama decided to admit more than 13,000 in 2016:

Fiscal Year 2011: 29

Fiscal Year 2012: 31

Fiscal Year 2013: 36

Fiscal Year 2014: 105

Fiscal Year 2015: 1,682

To recap: While the Syrian Civil War was raging, ISIS was rising, and refugees were swamping Syria’s neighbors and surging into Europe, the Obama administration let in less than a trickle of refugees. Only in the closing days of his administration did President Obama reverse course — in numbers insufficient to make a dent in the overall crisis, by the way — and now the Democrats have the audacity to tweet out pictures of bleeding Syrian children?

It’s particularly gross to see this display when the Obama administration’s deliberate decision to leave a yawning power vacuum — in part through its Iraq withdrawal and in part through its dithering throughout the Syrian Civil War — exacerbated the refugee crisis in the first place. There was a genocide on Obama’s watch, and his tiny trickle of Syrian refugees hardly makes up for the grotesque negligence of abandoning Iraq and his years-long mishandling of the emerging Syrian crisis.

When we know our enemy is seeking to strike America and its allies through the refugee population, when we know they’ve succeeded in Europe, and when the administration has doubts about our ability to adequately vet the refugees we admit into this nation, a pause is again not just prudent but arguably necessary. It is important that we provide sufficient aid and protection to keep refugees safe and healthy in place, but it is not necessary to bring Syrians to the United States to fulfill our vital moral obligations.

Fourth, there is a puzzling amount of outrage over Trump’s directive to “prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.” In other words, once refugee admissions resume, members of minority religions may well go to the front of the line. In some countries, this means Christians and Yazidis. In others, it can well mean Muslims.

Sadly, during the Obama administration it seems that Christians and other minorities may well have ended up in the back of the line. For example, when Obama dramatically expanded Syrian refugee admissions in 2016, few Christians made the cut:

The Obama administration has resettled 13,210 Syrian refugees into the United States since the beginning of 2016 — an increase of 675 percent over the same 10-month period in 2015. Of those, 13,100 (99.1 percent) are Muslims — 12,966 Sunnis, 24 Shi’a, and 110 other Muslims — and 77 (0.5 percent) are Christians. Another 24 (0.18 percent) are Yazidis.

As a point of reference, in 2015 Christians represented roughly 10 percent of Syria’s population. Perhaps there’s an innocent explanation for the disparity. Perhaps not. But one thing is clear — federal asylum and refugee law already require a religious test. As my colleague Andy McCarthy has repeatedly pointed out, an alien seeking asylum “must establish that . . . religion [among other things] . . . was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.”

Similarly, the term “refugee” means “(A) any person who is outside any country of such person’s nationality . . . and who is unable or unwilling to return to . . . that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of . . . religion [among other things] . . . [.]”

But don’t tell CNN’s chief national security correspondent, who last night tweeted this:

There is no basis to the claim Muslim refugees were prioritized over Christians. Fact is, refugee policy not based in religion, until now. — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) January 28, 2017

False. False. False. Religious considerations are by law part of refugee policy. And it is entirely reasonable to give preference (though not exclusivity) to members of minority religions.

Finally, you can read the entire executive order from start to finish, reread it, then read it again, and you will not find a Muslim ban. It’s not there. Nowhere. At its most draconian, it temporarily halts entry from jihadist regions. In other words, Trump’s executive order is a dramatic climb-down from his worst campaign rhetoric.

You can read the entire executive order from start to finish, reread it, then read it again, and you will not find a Muslim ban. It’s not there. Nowhere.

To be sure, however, the ban is deeply problematic as applied to legal residents of the U.S. and to interpreters and other allies seeking refuge in the United States after demonstrated (and courageous) service to the United States. Twitter timelines are coming alive with stories of Iraqi interpreters who’ve saved American lives. Few have bled more in alliance with America than Iraq’s Kurds, but the order itself provides for the necessary case-by-case exemptions to the temporary blanket bans. It is vital that General John Kelly, the newly confirmed secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, move expeditiously to protect those who’ve laid down their lives in the war against ISIS, al-Qaeda, and the Taliban. Given his own wartime experience, I believe and hope that he will.

Trump’s order was not signed in a vacuum. Look at the Heritage Foundation’s interactive timeline of Islamist terror plots since 9/11. Note the dramatic increase in planned and executed attacks since 2015. Now is not the time for complacency. Now is the time to take a fresh look at our border-control and immigration policies. Trump’s order isn’t a betrayal of American values. Applied correctly and competently, it can represent a promising fresh start and a prelude to new policies that protect our nation while still maintaining American compassion and preserving American friendships.",www.nationalreview.com,right,t7FL6cjWyhZMSTFX

Proposal calls for more security funding and status checks

Illegal immigrants would apply for ""Lawful Prospective Immigrant"" visa

WASHINGTON — A draft of a White House immigration proposal obtained by USA TODAY would allow illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents within eight years.

The plan also would provide for more security funding and require business owners to check the immigration status of new hires within four years. In addition, the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants could apply for a newly created ""Lawful Prospective Immigrant"" visa, under the draft bill being written by the White House.

If approved, they could then apply for the same provisional legal status for their spouse or children living outside the country, according to the draft.

The bill is being developed as members in both chambers of Congress are drafting their own immigration bills. In the House, a bipartisan group of representatives has been negotiating an immigration proposal for years and are writing their own bill. Last month, four Republican senators joined with four Democratic senators to announce their agreement on the general outlines of an immigration plan.

One of those senators, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Obama's bill repeats the failures of past legislation and would be ""dead on arrival"" in Congress.

US President Donald Trump first introduced a travel ban in 2017. It currently closes US borders to citizens from seven countries, most of them with Muslim majorities.

In 2018 the US issued more than 8,000 immigration visas to citizens of Nigeria. That same year, just over 2,000 were issued to Sudanese nationals, 290 to Tanzanians, and just 31 to Eritreans.

The US had previously announced a ban on certain types of visas for Eritreans in 2017.

What are the new rules?

The US said it would suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, and Myanmar.

Sudanese and Tanzanian nationals will no longer be allowed to apply for ""diversity visas"", which are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.

Mr Wolf said non-immigrant visas given to people for temporary stays - including visitors, those doing business or people seeking medical treatment - would not be impacted by the new rules.

Of the new nationalities facing visa restrictions, Nigerians account for the most immigration to the US.

Kyrgyzstan and Sudan have large Muslim majorities, while around 50% of people in Nigeria and Eritrea are Muslim. Tanzania also has a sizable Muslim community.

What is the travel ban?

Mr Trump signed a controversial travel ban just seven days after taking office in January 2017, arguing it was vital to protect Americans.

The ban initially excluded people from seven majority-Muslim countries but the list was modified following a series of court challenges.

It now restricts citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea.

immigration,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/16/7226621/obama-executive-action-immigration-deportations-amnesty,9 facts that explain why Obama is about to help millions of immigrants,2014-11-16,"Dara Lind, Jen Kirby, Peter Kafka, Matthew Yglesias, Sean Collins, German Lopez, Alex Abad-Santos","President Obama is expected to announce major changes to immigration policy before the end of 2014 — and possibly as soon as this week . On one level , this is the end of a process that started in March , when the administration first announced it was reviewing deportation policy to see how it could be made more humane . On another level , though , this is another phase in the development of an immigration system that 's been transformed over the last 20 years .
To understand how we got to this point , it 's necessary to understand why immigration policy looks so different now than it did back then . Massive relief to millions of unauthorized immigrants would be an unprecedented move on Obama 's part — but it is also a reaction against trends in immigration enforcement that are themselves unprecedented .
1 ) Executive action is the culmination of a process that began in March
The Obama administration did n't spontaneously decide to take action on immigration after Democrats got defeated in the 2014 midterm elections . Instead , the actions Obama is expected to announce soon are the culmination of a process that started in March 2014 , when the administration announced it would be conducting a review of deportation policy to see if anything could be done to make it more humane .
That review got put on hold at the end of May , to give House Republicans one last chance to vote on a comprehensive immigration reform bill ( the Senate passed a bipartisan bill with 68 votes back in 2013 ) . They did not . Once Speaker of the House John Boehner made it clear that immigration reform was dead for the year in Congress , President Obama announced that he was restarting the policy review — and was expanding it to anything the administration could do to fix the immigration system . That was widely understood to include expanded protections from deportation to millions of unauthorized immigrants .
For most of the 20th century , any given unauthorized immigrant was n't at much risk of deportation . The federal government simply was n't putting a ton of energy into enforcing immigration laws against people living in the United States ( or , for that matter , patrolling the US/Mexico border ) . That began to change in the late 1990s , but it was n't until after 9/11 that a separate agency was created for the purpose of immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States . As ICE was established , and kept getting more money from Congress , deportations rose steadily through the Bush administration , and into the first term of the Obama administration — when the government was deporting roughly 400,000 immigrants a year , every year .
3 ) The drivers of deportation policy are n't the law — they 're the budget , and bureaucratic priorities
The deportation surge was n't the result of a change in the law . Being in the United States without papers has always been a civil offense . The rise in deportations was partly the product of Congress continuing to give ever-more money to Immigration and Customs Enforcement , and partly the product of ICE ( and higher-ups at the Department of Homeland Security and the White House ) deciding how to spend that money .
This is typical among law-enforcement agencies , at any level . Law enforcement officials and prosecutors get resources from the legislature , but the legislature does n't micro-manage how those resources get spent . But the resources a law enforcement agency has are limited , so they have to decide what kinds of enforcement efforts are worth their time .
4 ) In 2006 , the Bush administration started going after unauthorized immigrants aggressively
After the failure of a comprehensive immigration reform plan in 2006 , the Bush administration made an effort to crack down on unauthorized immigrants living in the United States . And they made sure they were doing it in high-profile ways . Instead of simply engaging in paper audits of employers to make sure they had documentation for all their workers , ICE conducted several high-profile workplace raids that resulted in the arrest and deportation of hundreds of immigrant workers .
The most famous of these raids , on a meatpacking plant in Postville , Iowa , resulted in 300 workers being convicted of document fraud over a few days of trials ; the owner of the plant and his family were n't convicted on any charges involving employing unauthorized workers or violating labor law in how those workers were treated .
president obama entered office in 2009 to find an expanding and aggressive immigration-enforcement agency
Simultaneously , ICE expanded programs that deputized local police in enforcing federal immigration law — bringing the threat of deportation much closer to home for any unauthorized immigrant who might come into contact with local law enforcement , even as a victim or witness of a crime .
That 's the situation President Obama found as he came into office in 2009 : an expanding immigration-enforcement agency that , for the last few years , had been aggressively increasing its focus on deportations . Administration officials decided that in order to pass legislative immigration reform , they needed to demonstrate that a Democratic president could be trusted to enforce the law — so they needed to keep the total number of deportations rising . But they thought that they could target immigration enforcement so that immigrant families living in the United States did n't need to feel under constant threat of deportation . Essentially , they wanted to keep large-scale deportations , while assuaging the fear in immigrant communities that those numbers produced .
If the federal government does n't want to spend its resources deporting someone , it basically has two options . One is , simply , not to deport them . When few resources were dedicated to deportations , that was an easy option — few unauthorized migrants came onto the government 's radar in the first place . Now that ICE does have a lot of resources , deciding not to deport someone requires a deliberate action : deciding at the outset that certain classes of immigrants are n't an enforcement priority , and then sticking with that decision .
the government has two options : to simply avoid deporting someone , or to proactively grant them protection
The decision simply not to deport someone can be easily reversed — or simply ignored — by someone else in the bureaucracy . So to target resources systematically , the government has another option : to proactively grant someone protection from deportation .
Several tools exist to do this . Deferred action is one of them . It 's been used for decades , in individual cases ( often when someone 's already been put in court for deportation , but the government 's decided not to go through with it ) or with small groups of people . It 's not permanent , and it does n't make it any easier for someone to get actual legal status ( which is very difficult for unauthorized immigrants , even if they 'd qualify through a spouse or relative ) . But it 's a little more certain than simply not getting deported .
During Obama 's first term , the administration tried to go the defensive route : telling federal immigration agents to go after some unauthorized immigrants ( like criminals ) and not others ( like teenagers , or parents of US citizen children ) . But it did n't work terribly well . As a result , through 2011 , the president was in the awkward position of claiming that his administration was n't `` rounding up students , '' then being confronted with a student holding her order of deportation . ( I 've written in detail about the Obama administration 's struggles with the Secure Communities program , which was intended to target criminals , and the erosion of trust between the administration and the Latino and immigrant-advocacy communities during Obama 's first term . )
There 's evidence that during Obama 's second term , the administration has been more successful in targeting immigration enforcement so that otherwise law abiding unauthorized workers without criminal records are n't at significant risk of deportation . But by that point , immigrants simply did n't trust the administration to be honest with them . As I wrote in September :
Politicians ca n't successfully explain anything to the public if the public is already convinced it knows what 's going on . And that 's been the case on immigration for some time . Progressives and immigration advocates do n't believe that the administration has enough control over federal agents that it can tell them which immigrants not to deport .
Throughout 2011 , Obama claimed that by trying to target enforcement resources passively , he was doing all he legally could to protect immigrant families from deportation . He said he did n't have a `` magic wand '' that could guarantee protection . In 2012 , he changed his mind . He rolled out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which allowed young unauthorized immigrants who 'd come to the US as children or teenagers , and who met other requirements , to apply for deferred action and work permits .
After creating the DACA program , the Obama administration returned to claiming that now they 'd really done everything they could legally do . ( Legal experts agree that by any standard by which DACA is legal , larger-scale deferred action would also be legal . ) But in March 2014 , the administration announced that they 'd be reviewing deportation policies to see what could be done to make them more `` humane . '' This was an acknowledgment that maybe they had n't done everything they could do — implying that they were now open to the possibility of expanding deferred action to more unauthorized immigrants .
8 ) Enforcement advocates believe that `` random deportations '' are an important deterrent
Advocates for tougher immigration enforcement think it 's important not to remove the threat of deportation . When pro-enforcement groups met with the White House this spring , during its initial deportation review , one attendee said they `` pushed very hard that there has to be a percentage of the resources [ that ] have to be for random deportations . '' They believe that while law enforcement agencies typically do set priorities about who to go after , they typically do a certain amount of random enforcement of the laws . Most big city police departments do n't devote meaningful resources to investigating non-violent thefts , but they are n't going to issue a formal written directive telling cops not to arrest non-violent thieves either .
`` there has to be a percentage of resources for random deportations ''
So pro-enforcement groups certainly oppose any affirmative guarantee against deportation , like deferred action . But they also oppose any passive policy that actually works in preventing certain people from getting deported . Another group opposed to those policies is the union representing ICE agents , which has argued for years that policies that tell them not to deport people are keeping them from doing their jobs .
The difference between active and passive protections may matter less to proponents of strict enforcement , but it matters tremendously to immigrant-rights advocates — and immigrants themselves .
Earlier iterations of prosecutorial discretion failed to make immigrants feel safe from deportation . By contrast , the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has been a smashing success at improving the lives of its beneficiaries . ( For an in-depth look at how DACA has changed the lives of the people who 've received protection through it , check out my feature from August . ) DACA beneficiaries say they 're no longer afraid to excel in school or become leaders in their communities , because they 're no longer worried that getting noticed will lead to getting deported .
Advocates see the success of the DACA program as evidence that the administration has the ability to remove the threat of deportation from larger numbers of people if it really wants to . That 's why they 've continued to push for affirmative relief , rather than being willing to rely on administration promises about passive protection of immigrants .
Unless the rumors about what Obama 's about to do are wildly wrong , it looks like the advocates ' argument has been persuasive . The White House has been convinced that if it really wants to remove the fear of deportation from unauthorized immigrant residents , it 's going to need to let them apply for relief themselves .","President Obama is expected to announce major changes to immigration policy before the end of 2014 — and possibly as soon as this week. On one level, this is the end of a process that started in March, when the administration first announced it was reviewing deportation policy to see how it could be made more humane. On another level, though, this is another phase in the development of an immigration system that's been transformed over the last 20 years.

To understand how we got to this point, it's necessary to understand why immigration policy looks so different now than it did back then. Massive relief to millions of unauthorized immigrants would be an unprecedented move on Obama's part — but it is also a reaction against trends in immigration enforcement that are themselves unprecedented.

1) Executive action is the culmination of a process that began in March

The Obama administration didn't spontaneously decide to take action on immigration after Democrats got defeated in the 2014 midterm elections. Instead, the actions Obama is expected to announce soon are the culmination of a process that started in March 2014, when the administration announced it would be conducting a review of deportation policy to see if anything could be done to make it more humane.

That review got put on hold at the end of May, to give House Republicans one last chance to vote on a comprehensive immigration reform bill (the Senate passed a bipartisan bill with 68 votes back in 2013). They did not. Once Speaker of the House John Boehner made it clear that immigration reform was dead for the year in Congress, President Obama announced that he was restarting the policy review — and was expanding it to anything the administration could do to fix the immigration system. That was widely understood to include expanded protections from deportation to millions of unauthorized immigrants.

2) Large-scale deportation is a recent development

For most of the 20th century, any given unauthorized immigrant wasn't at much risk of deportation. The federal government simply wasn't putting a ton of energy into enforcing immigration laws against people living in the United States (or, for that matter, patrolling the US/Mexico border). That began to change in the late 1990s, but it wasn't until after 9/11 that a separate agency was created for the purpose of immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States. As ICE was established, and kept getting more money from Congress, deportations rose steadily through the Bush administration, and into the first term of the Obama administration — when the government was deporting roughly 400,000 immigrants a year, every year.

3) The drivers of deportation policy aren't the law — they're the budget, and bureaucratic priorities

The deportation surge wasn't the result of a change in the law. Being in the United States without papers has always been a civil offense. The rise in deportations was partly the product of Congress continuing to give ever-more money to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and partly the product of ICE (and higher-ups at the Department of Homeland Security and the White House) deciding how to spend that money.

This is typical among law-enforcement agencies, at any level. Law enforcement officials and prosecutors get resources from the legislature, but the legislature doesn't micro-manage how those resources get spent. But the resources a law enforcement agency has are limited, so they have to decide what kinds of enforcement efforts are worth their time.

4) In 2006, the Bush administration started going after unauthorized immigrants aggressively

After the failure of a comprehensive immigration reform plan in 2006, the Bush administration made an effort to crack down on unauthorized immigrants living in the United States. And they made sure they were doing it in high-profile ways.

The most famous of these raids, on a meatpacking plant in Postville, Iowa, resulted in 300 workers being convicted of document fraud over a few days of trials; the owner of the plant and his family weren't convicted on any charges involving employing unauthorized workers or violating labor law in how those workers were treated.

Essentially, they wanted to keep large-scale deportations, while assuaging the fear in immigrant communities that those numbers produced.

5) There are passive and active deportation protections

If the federal government doesn't want to spend its resources deporting someone, it basically has two options. One is, simply, not to deport them. When few resources were dedicated to deportations, that was an easy option — few unauthorized migrants came onto the government's radar in the first place. Now that ICE does have a lot of resources, deciding not to deport someone requires a deliberate action: deciding at the outset that certain classes of immigrants aren't an enforcement priority, and then sticking with that decision.

the government has two options: to simply avoid deporting someone, or to proactively grant them protection

The decision simply not to deport someone can be easily reversed — or simply ignored — by someone else in the bureaucracy. So to target resources systematically, the government has another option: to proactively grant someone protection from deportation.

Several tools exist to do this. Deferred action is one of them. It's been used for decades, in individual cases (often when someone's already been put in court for deportation, but the government's decided not to go through with it) or with small groups of people. It's not permanent, and it doesn't make it any easier for someone to get actual legal status (which is very difficult for unauthorized immigrants, even if they'd qualify through a spouse or relative). But it's a little more certain than simply not getting deported.

6) Passive measures haven't won immigrants' trust

During Obama's first term, the administration tried to go the defensive route: telling federal immigration agents to go after some unauthorized immigrants (like criminals) and not others (like teenagers, or parents of US citizen children). But it didn't work terribly well. As a result, through 2011, the president was in the awkward position of claiming that his administration wasn't ""rounding up students,"" then being confronted with a student holding her order of deportation. (I've written in detail about the Obama administration's struggles with the Secure Communities program, which was intended to target criminals, and the erosion of trust between the administration and the Latino and immigrant-advocacy communities during Obama's first term.)

There's evidence that during Obama's second term, the administration has been more successful in targeting immigration enforcement so that otherwise law abiding unauthorized workers without criminal records aren't at significant risk of deportation. But by that point, immigrants simply didn't trust the administration to be honest with them. As I wrote in September:

Progressives and immigration advocates don't believe that the administration has enough control over federal agents that it can tell them which immigrants not to deport.

7) Obama's flip-flopped on the legality of broad relief

Throughout 2011, Obama claimed that by trying to target enforcement resources passively, he was doing all he legally could to protect immigrant families from deportation. He said he didn't have a ""magic wand"" that could guarantee protection. In 2012, he changed his mind. He rolled out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed young unauthorized immigrants who'd come to the US as children or teenagers, and who met other requirements, to apply for deferred action and work permits.

(Legal experts agree that by any standard by which DACA is legal, larger-scale deferred action would also be legal.) But in March 2014, the administration announced that they'd be reviewing deportation policies to see what could be done to make them more ""humane."" This was an acknowledgment that maybe they hadn't done everything they could do — implying that they were now open to the possibility of expanding deferred action to more unauthorized immigrants.

Most big city police departments don't devote meaningful resources to investigating non-violent thefts, but they aren't going to issue a formal written directive telling cops not to arrest non-violent thieves either.

""there has to be a percentage of resources for random deportations""

So pro-enforcement groups certainly oppose any affirmative guarantee against deportation, like deferred action. But they also oppose any passive policy that actually works in preventing certain people from getting deported. Another group opposed to those policies is the union representing ICE agents, which has argued for years that policies that tell them not to deport people are keeping them from doing their jobs.

9) Not feeling under threat matters tremendously to immigrants

Earlier iterations of prosecutorial discretion failed to make immigrants feel safe from deportation. By contrast, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has been a smashing success at improving the lives of its beneficiaries.

Well, it’s still more than a month until the new Congress is sworn in, but it’s already looking like we can put that debate to rest.

immigration,The Hill,1,http://thehill.com/latino/345946-daca-deadline-looms-over-trump-administration,'Dreamers' deadline looms for Trump,2017-08-13,,"The Trump administration is stuck between a rock and a hard place as a deadline approaches for Texas and nine other states to file suit against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program .
Neither the White House nor the Justice Department have said whether they ’ ll defend the Obama-era program that ’ s set to be challenged in court unless the administration rescinds it by Sept. 5 .
That puts the administration in difficult territory , particularly given President Trump ’ s vow to protect recipients of the program , known as Dreamers .
Under DACA , nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children were given a work permit and protected from deportation .
An extension of DACA and a similar program , Deferred Action for Parents of Americans ( DAPA ) , were blocked by United States District Judge Andrew Hanen in 2015 , in a case that ultimately ended in a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court that effectively ended both programs .
The DACA extension would have made the program available to a larger group of people , and DAPA would have provided similar benefits to an estimated 3.6 million undocumented immigrants with American-born children .
The suit centered on the ability of states to provide driver 's licenses to program beneficiaries , arguing it would be too burdensome for states .
A separate case against the original DACA was thrown out in 2015 , when a 5th Circuit appeals court dismissed similar arguments by the state of Mississippi and a union of federal immigration agents as not `` sufficiently concrete . ''
The new lawsuit , led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ( R ) , is expected to seek out Hanen 's court , which is widely seen as favorable to the challenge .
Trump campaigned against DACA , but he has gone on record saying he would treat Dreamers with “ heart . ”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson ( Jeff ) Beauregard SessionsLewandowski says he 's open to role defending Trump against impeachment Trump reignites court fight with Ninth Circuit pick Democrats press Nadler to hold Lewandowski in contempt MORE and White House adviser Stephen Miller are seen as internal opponents of extending benefits to any class of undocumented immigrants .
While several officials , starting with Trump and White House chief of staff John Kelly , have voiced sympathy for Dreamers , the administration 's view of the program 's legal standing is suspect .
In a press conference on a separate immigration bill last week , Miller wouldn ’ t say whether the White House would defend DACA .
“ Well , we are not going to make an announcement on that today because there is ongoing litigation , and DOJ and DHS are reviewing that , ” Miller said in response to a question from ███ .
While Trump has voiced support for Dreamers , it 's unclear to what extent he supports the program .
The president has described DACA and DAPA as “ President Obama ’ s two illegal executive amnesties . ”
Still , Trump renewed DACA in June in the same memo in which he formally terminated DAPA and a DACA extension . Both DAPA and the extension had previously been blocked by courts , so their official termination had no real-world effects on individual immigrants .
But in a one-line statement within that memo , Trump allowed DACA to continue as an official policy , maintaining benefits for the nearly 800,000 beneficiaries of the program and allowing new qualifying applicants to join .
“ It 's a decision that I make and it 's a decision that 's very , very hard to make . I really understand the situation now , ” Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One last month .
“ I understand the situation very well . What I 'd like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan . But our country and political forces are not ready yet . ”
Kelly repeatedly asked Congress , while he was secretary of Homeland Security , for a legislative vehicle to permanently regularize DACA recipients ’ status .
The White House batted down one such proposal , the DREAM Act , presented by Sens . Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamIntel community watchdog appears to push back on Trump allegations of changes to whistleblower rules Democrats demand Barr , senior officials testify on Ukraine ███ 's 12:30 Report : Trump steps up attacks on whistleblower , Schiff MORE ( R-S.C. ) and Dick Durbin Richard ( Dick ) Joseph DurbinHillicon Valley : Democrats seize on whistleblower complaint to push for election security | Google taps GOP Senate aide to lead lobbying | Warren calls for congressional tech office Democrats seize on whistleblower report to push for election security Second GOP senator to oppose Trump judicial pick MORE ( D-Ill. ) last month . At that presentation , Durbin said the two senators were in communication with White House officials on the matter , but declined to name them .
Kelly has publicly voiced doubts about whether the program could sustain a legal challenge .
Meanwhile , opponents of the program are pressuring Trump not only to avoid a defense , but also to cancel it outright .
“ If the administration chooses not to defend DACA in court , then the program may simply die a quiet legal death , ” Steven Camarota , director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies ( CIS ) , a think tank that advocates for reduced immigration , wrote for the National Review .
“ But there is no need to wait ; the president should take this opportunity and honor his campaign pledge to end the program , ” he added .
The legal challenge faces a number of obstacles , which could serve as a reason for Trump to punt on any action .
“ There 's no guarantee that the state of Texas will be allowed by Judge Hanen to convert a challenge of DAPA to a challenge of DACA , ” said Thomas A. Saenz , president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund ( MALDEF ) .
“ If I were the Trump administration , I would not respond by Sept. 5 . ”
The fact that it has been in effect for five years will make it harder for Paxton to prove that DACA could cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs , a necessary burden for a preliminary injunction , Saenz said .
If Hanen refuses to grant an injunction , the case would have to be settled on its merits , a process that could be time-consuming and complex .
Still , many on both sides of the issue believe the court challenge — whether through its merits or because of the venue — presents a real threat .
That 's in part because many observers expect the case to follow the same path as the 2015 case that ended DAPA and the DACA expansion .

Neither the White House nor the Justice Department have said whether they’ll defend the Obama-era program that’s set to be challenged in court unless the administration rescinds it by Sept. 5.

That puts the administration in difficult territory, particularly given President Trump’s vow to protect recipients of the program, known as Dreamers.

Under DACA, nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children were given a work permit and protected from deportation.

An extension of DACA and a similar program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), were blocked by United States District Judge Andrew Hanen in 2015, in a case that ultimately ended in a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court that effectively ended both programs.

The DACA extension would have made the program available to a larger group of people, and DAPA would have provided similar benefits to an estimated 3.6 million undocumented immigrants with American-born children.

The suit centered on the ability of states to provide driver's licenses to program beneficiaries, arguing it would be too burdensome for states.

A separate case against the original DACA was thrown out in 2015, when a 5th Circuit appeals court dismissed similar arguments by the state of Mississippi and a union of federal immigration agents as not ""sufficiently concrete.""

The new lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), is expected to seek out Hanen's court, which is widely seen as favorable to the challenge.

Trump campaigned against DACA, but he has gone on record saying he would treat Dreamers with “heart.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsLewandowski says he's open to role defending Trump against impeachment Trump reignites court fight with Ninth Circuit pick Democrats press Nadler to hold Lewandowski in contempt MORE and White House adviser Stephen Miller are seen as internal opponents of extending benefits to any class of undocumented immigrants.

While several officials, starting with Trump and White House chief of staff John Kelly, have voiced sympathy for Dreamers, the administration's view of the program's legal standing is suspect.

In a press conference on a separate immigration bill last week, Miller wouldn’t say whether the White House would defend DACA.

“Well, we are not going to make an announcement on that today because there is ongoing litigation, and DOJ and DHS are reviewing that,” Miller said in response to a question from The Hill.

While Trump has voiced support for Dreamers, it's unclear to what extent he supports the program.

The president has described DACA and DAPA as “President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties.”

Still, Trump renewed DACA in June in the same memo in which he formally terminated DAPA and a DACA extension. Both DAPA and the extension had previously been blocked by courts, so their official termination had no real-world effects on individual immigrants.

But in a one-line statement within that memo, Trump allowed DACA to continue as an official policy, maintaining benefits for the nearly 800,000 beneficiaries of the program and allowing new qualifying applicants to join.

“It's a decision that I make and it's a decision that's very, very hard to make. I really understand the situation now,” Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One last month.

“I understand the situation very well. What I'd like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan. But our country and political forces are not ready yet.”

Kelly repeatedly asked Congress, while he was secretary of Homeland Security, for a legislative vehicle to permanently regularize DACA recipients’ status.

The White House batted down one such proposal, the DREAM Act, presented by Sens. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamIntel community watchdog appears to push back on Trump allegations of changes to whistleblower rules Democrats demand Barr, senior officials testify on Ukraine The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump steps up attacks on whistleblower, Schiff MORE (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin Richard (Dick) Joseph DurbinHillicon Valley: Democrats seize on whistleblower complaint to push for election security | Google taps GOP Senate aide to lead lobbying | Warren calls for congressional tech office Democrats seize on whistleblower report to push for election security Second GOP senator to oppose Trump judicial pick MORE (D-Ill.) last month. At that presentation, Durbin said the two senators were in communication with White House officials on the matter, but declined to name them.

Kelly has publicly voiced doubts about whether the program could sustain a legal challenge.

Meanwhile, opponents of the program are pressuring Trump not only to avoid a defense, but also to cancel it outright.

“If the administration chooses not to defend DACA in court, then the program may simply die a quiet legal death,” Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a think tank that advocates for reduced immigration, wrote for the National Review.

“But there is no need to wait; the president should take this opportunity and honor his campaign pledge to end the program,” he added.

The legal challenge faces a number of obstacles, which could serve as a reason for Trump to punt on any action.

“There's no guarantee that the state of Texas will be allowed by Judge Hanen to convert a challenge of DAPA to a challenge of DACA,” said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund (MALDEF).

“If I were the Trump administration, I would not respond by Sept. 5.”

The fact that it has been in effect for five years will make it harder for Paxton to prove that DACA could cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, a necessary burden for a preliminary injunction, Saenz said.

If Hanen refuses to grant an injunction, the case would have to be settled on its merits, a process that could be time-consuming and complex.

Still, many on both sides of the issue believe the court challenge — whether through its merits or because of the venue — presents a real threat.

That's in part because many observers expect the case to follow the same path as the 2015 case that ended DAPA and the DACA expansion. Many of the program's supporters believe the judicial deck is unfairly stacked against DACA, with unsympathetic courts and plaintiffs, and a reluctant defense — if any defense is mounted — with Sessions at the helm.

The program's opponents see the program as an exemplary case of executive overreach.

“By unilaterally issuing work permits and deportation relief to a large class of illegal immigrants, President Obama effectively rewrote immigration law,” Camarota wrote.

But the impending court challenge has fewer supporters than the 2015 case, suggesting some attorneys general see a closer parallel with the case that originally upheld DACA. Of the 26 states that signed on against DAPA, only 10 are supporting Paxton's suit.

And administration officials’ reluctance to speak out against the program has emboldened its supporters, who believe they can make their case with so-far-silent allies within the Trump administration.

Hillary was initially enthusiastic about the exchange , but as the DREAMers pressed on , she got impatient ; finally , she cut the conversation short by saying `` We need to elect more Democrats '' and walking away .
Immigration advocates are n't at all pleased with Clinton 's answer . That 's not surprising — in fact , it was possibly the most tone-deaf thing she could have said .
Advocates are still recovering from the announcement of Obama 's delay , which they saw as a crushing disappointment — and the latest in a long line of broken promises from Democratic officials . From my article last week :
Even several days after the announcement , the prevailing mood among immigration advocates was that they felt devastated , and betrayed . `` When your supposed friends break multiple promises , it feels really shitty . That 's just a basic human reaction , '' says Frank Sharry , the executive director of immigration-advocacy group America 's Voice . [ ... ] Advocates are taking the delay so personally that they 're struggling to focus on how to respond . `` It 's obvious that all of us in the community , and working on the issue of immigration reform , need time to lick our wounds before moving forward , '' says Ben Monterroso , the director of voter-mobilization group Mi Familia Vota . Sharry adds that `` a lot of community groups are really pissed and have n't figured out what to do about it . ''
Advocates feel they 've tried `` electing more Democrats '' — for nothing
Immigration advocates point out that Democrats from President Obama on down have promised Latinos that putting a Democrat in the White House would result in relief for millions of immigrant families . So advocates feel they , and Latino voters , have spent the last several electoral cycles fighting to keep Democrats in office — working for Obama 's election in 2008 and 2012 , and helping save the Senate for the Democrats in 2010 — to make sure that promise comes true . And in return , they feel , the President has broken promises he 's made to their community , from 2008 to today , and lectured them hat the time is n't right for Democrats to take broad action against deportation .
So the question facing immigration reformers right now is n't how to get the right people in office so that immigration reform will become possible . They feel they 've done that already , and it apparently has n't been enough .
The DREAMers — like the ones who confronted Clinton over the weekend — feel that Democrats have squandered the trust of their community . Now , they believe it 's their job to force politicians to care about them and their families . As I wrote last week :
Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez describes United We Dream as `` fiercely nonpartisan . '' When asked about the administration 's latest promise to announce executive action by the end of 2014 , he responds , `` We do n't trust them .

The reason DREAMers were in Iowa last weekend to begin with was because they did n't feel that Hillary Clinton would take the needs of their community seriously if they were n't there to raise the question to her . They were there because they feel `` elect more Democrats '' is the wrong answer .
To understand where the DREAMers are coming from , it 's important to understand that they do n't see `` hold politicians accountable '' and `` elect more Democrats '' as opposites .

So what gives?

If this week's string of vague and contradictory statements by Trump and his team is revealing anything, it's that his immigration policy is still evolving. Just days ago Trump reshuffled his campaign staff as part of an effort to recalibrate his message for the general election, in which his tough stance on immigration may be more of a liability than it was in the Republican primary.

This week, Trump's campaign postponed a major immigration speech scheduled for this week, but announced he'd hold two events highlighting border security needs and crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

A look at what Trump has proposed, compared to Clinton's policies and Obama's record in office:

Deportations

Trump: From the start, the brash billionaire's campaign has been rooted in the promise of a dramatically different approach to immigration. He presented a detailed deportation plan for 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, complete with estimated timeframes and references to a ""deportation force."" Trump argued all would have to return to their country of origin but that the ""good people"" could come back through legal processes.

His tune seems to have changed. On Monday, Trump said his first focus would be to get rid of ""the bad ones."" Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump wanted to deport immigrants with criminal records, not all 11 million. What about that deportation force? ""He has not said that for a while,"" Conway said.

Clinton: The Democratic nominee has said overhauling immigration laws will be a top priority, but in the meantime, she says current laws should be enforced ""humanely."" Her campaign says deportations would focus on immigrants ""who pose a violent threat to public safety."" Clinton wants to shut down privately run detention centers.

Obama: Immigration advocates have railed against Obama for deporting huge numbers – more than 2.5 million in all – and dubbed him the ""deporter in chief."" In 2012, Immigration and Customs Enforcement set a record of removing 409,000 immigrants. Since then, though, the numbers have declined to just 235,413 in the 2016 budget year.

Children and families

Trump: He's offered conflicting takes on how he'd deal with immigrants brought here illegally as children, and their parents. He praised the Supreme Court's move in June that halted Obama's second wave of executive actions on that issue, actions Trump decried as ""executive amnesty."" His campaign says he'd reverse Obama's remaining actions.

On the other hand, Trump has said he wouldn't split up families, though he hasn't explained how he'd reconcile those policies. He also supports eliminating birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who came here illegally.

Clinton: She wants to preserve Obama's executive actions – both those affecting children and those affecting their parents. Clinton also wants to expand those actions to immigrants who have contributed to their communities or faced ""extreme labor violations.""

Obama: Obama's position, like Trump's recent comments, is rooted in the notion that limited law enforcement resources should be focused on law-breaking immigrants, not kids and families.

The president's first set of executive actions has shielded more than 800,000 young immigrants from deportation since 2012. After Republicans won the Senate in 2014 and the prospect of an immigration overhaul grew dimmer, Obama acted again to protect up to 4 million parents of U.S. citizens or permanent residents and let them work legally. The courts have put the more recent actions on hold.

Border security

Trump: He says the border isn't adequately protected. Trump has called for tripling the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, who handle deportations.

And then, of course, there's the wall. Trump is standing firm behind his plans to build a ""real wall"" on the Mexican border and to force Mexico to fund it. He says until Mexico pays up, the U.S. will increase visa and border crossing fees, ""impound all remittance payments"" from immigrants here illegally, and possibly increase tariffs or cut foreign aid.

Clinton: She's called for securing U.S. borders, but has also said the U.S. is already doing ""a really good job."" In March, Clinton said increased border security staffing, new fencing and lower immigration rates have lessened the problem.

She opposes Trump's wall.

Obama: In the 2008 budget year, before Obama took office, the U.S. had about 17,000 Border Patrol agents, reflecting an increase under President George W. Bush from the 9,212 the U.S. had in 2000.

immigration,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/immigration-reform-deal-house-89499.html?hp=f2,House group nears immigration deal,2013-04-01,Jake Sherman,"Historically , the House has stuck to small-bore immigration fixes . | JAY WESTCOTT/███ House group nears immigration deal
A small , bipartisan House group is nearly finished with its immigration reform plan , which it hopes to announce the week of April 8 when Congress returns from recess .
But lawmakers and leadership are carefully eying several significant lingering technical issues to bring it across the finish line .
The key issues causing concern are fears about the price tag of immigration reform , the pathway to citizenship for the nation ’ s 11 million illegal immigrants and the process by which a slow-moving House Republican Conference might introduce and vote on a bill that would overhaul the system .
These items — described by several sources involved in the secret talks — are under active consideration by the group and the senior members of the Republican leadership as the House group readies for its roll-out when Congress returns from a two-week long break .
That the House is this far along is significant because of the deep partisanship that has slowed legislative action on the issue over the last three years . Historically , the House has stuck to small-bore immigration fixes , like securing the border , instead of comprehensive reform . Talks have progressed to the level that both Democratic and Republican leadership are being kept in the loop .
The elements of the plan , which were described by multiple sources , are very fluid and subject to change .
Sources describe the House plan as not differing to starkly from a compromise being drafted by the Senate ’ s Gang of Eight , a bipartisan group that is also nearing the finish line . Business and labor interests reached a deal Saturday on a long-thorny issue regarding visas for low-skilled workers , which significantly increases the chances of an overall deal in the Senate .
But the GOP-controlled House has always been seen as a less hospitable place for full-scale immigration reform . Nonetheless , the recent progress made by the House group is promising . Among Republicans , Reps. Raul Labrador of Idaho and Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida are seen as key .
One is cost — the price of securing the border is steep . People involved in the talks are hopeful that the cost can be offset with increased visa fees . But Republicans are more concerned about the burden undocumented workers could put on the nation ’ s entitlement structure — that is , the massive cost that are absorbed officially into the nation ’ s newly implemented health care system . The GOP is considering demanding that language be inserted into any bill to make it clear that 11 million new immigrants can not get plopped onto the nation ’ s social safety net .
Sources describe the House GOP plan for a pathway to citizenship as more of an obstacle course — people involved in the negotiations prefer to call it a “ pathway to status. ” The plan does eventually lead to citizenship , according to sources familiar with it , but such a step could take roughly two decades .
Under the House plan , it would take more than 10 years to get a green card , and will require paying back taxes , a hefty penalty , sources say .

A small, bipartisan House group is nearly finished with its immigration reform plan, which it hopes to announce the week of April 8 when Congress returns from recess.

But lawmakers and leadership are carefully eying several significant lingering technical issues to bring it across the finish line.

Story Continued Below

The key issues causing concern are fears about the price tag of immigration reform, the pathway to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million illegal immigrants and the process by which a slow-moving House Republican Conference might introduce and vote on a bill that would overhaul the system.

( PHOTOS: 20 quotes on immigration reform)

These items — described by several sources involved in the secret talks — are under active consideration by the group and the senior members of the Republican leadership as the House group readies for its roll-out when Congress returns from a two-week long break.

That the House is this far along is significant because of the deep partisanship that has slowed legislative action on the issue over the last three years. Historically, the House has stuck to small-bore immigration fixes, like securing the border, instead of comprehensive reform. Talks have progressed to the level that both Democratic and Republican leadership are being kept in the loop.

The elements of the plan, which were described by multiple sources, are very fluid and subject to change.

Sources describe the House plan as not differing to starkly from a compromise being drafted by the Senate’s Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group that is also nearing the finish line. Business and labor interests reached a deal Saturday on a long-thorny issue regarding visas for low-skilled workers, which significantly increases the chances of an overall deal in the Senate.

But the GOP-controlled House has always been seen as a less hospitable place for full-scale immigration reform. Nonetheless, the recent progress made by the House group is promising. Among Republicans, Reps. Raul Labrador of Idaho and Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida are seen as key.

There are still issues to work out.

One is cost — the price of securing the border is steep. People involved in the talks are hopeful that the cost can be offset with increased visa fees. But Republicans are more concerned about the burden undocumented workers could put on the nation’s entitlement structure — that is, the massive cost that are absorbed officially into the nation’s newly implemented health care system. The GOP is considering demanding that language be inserted into any bill to make it clear that 11 million new immigrants cannot get plopped onto the nation’s social safety net.

Sources describe the House GOP plan for a pathway to citizenship as more of an obstacle course — people involved in the negotiations prefer to call it a “pathway to status.” The plan does eventually lead to citizenship, according to sources familiar with it, but such a step could take roughly two decades.

Under the House plan, it would take more than 10 years to get a green card, and will require paying back taxes, a hefty penalty, sources say. Undocumented immigrants would have to gain proficiency in English and make some sort of admission that the law was broken. Some negotiators have floated the idea of having an undocumented immigrant “plead guilty” to breaking immigration laws, according to sources involved,. The lengthy time it would take for undocumented immigrants to get a green card and citizenship will also help lower the cost of the bill, since the Congressional Budget Office assesses budgetary impact in a 10-year period, the sources said.",www.politico.com,left,Px6qhkjeg015KPzN

If that is Trump 's aim , the focus of his travel ban is rather puzzling . The executive order covers six countries ( down from seven in the original version ) : Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria , and Yemen . Since 1975 no one in the United States has died in an attack by a terrorist from any of those countries , although there have been less serious incidents , including two nonfatal knife attacks last year by people with Somali backgrounds , both of whom were killed in the midst of their assaults . From 1975 through 2015 , according to a count by Cato Institute immigration analyst Alex Nowrasteh , six Iranians , six Sudanese , two Somalis , and one Yemini were `` convicted of attempting or carrying out terrorist attacks on U.S . soil . ''
Continuing the administration 's pattern of ignoring relevant evidence , Trump 's order mentions just one of those cases , involving `` a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen . '' As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit noted when it upheld the injunction against the travel ban , the order `` does not include any examples of individuals from Iran , Libya , Sudan , Syria , or Yemen committing terrorism-related offenses in the United States . '' But according to Nowrasteh , there are at least 13 such cases involving people from Iran , Sudan , and Yemen .
Even if Trump had included all the relevant examples , the case for targeting these six countries would be weak , since citizens of other countries account for a much larger share of terrorist plots , attacks , and casualties in the United States . From 1975 through 2015 , Nowrasteh found , 19 foreign-born terrorists came from Saudi Arabia , 14 came from Pakistan , 11 came from Egypt , and 11 more came from Cuba . Their combined death toll was 2,537 . During the same period , six foreign-born terrorists came from Iran , six from Sudan , two from Somalia , and one from Yemen . Zero came from Libya or Syria . The combined death toll for terrorists from those six countries was zero .
Nor is it clear how Trump 's plan , which calls for the development of improved vetting procedures during the three months when citizens of the six countries would be forbidden to enter the United States , can reasonably be expected to catch the tiny percentage prone to terrorism . As an internal Department of Homeland Security report prepared last March notes , `` most foreign-born , US-based violent extremists likely radicalized several years after their entry to the United States , limiting the ability of screening and vetting officials to prevent their entry because of national security concerns . '' In the one relevant case cited by Trump 's executive order , for instance , better vetting would have made no difference , since the offender entered the country as a child .
In a declaration cited by the 4th Circuit , 10 former national security , foreign policy , and intelligence officials ( mostly from Democratic administrations ) said `` there is no national security purpose for a total bar on entry for aliens '' from the seven countries named in the original travel ban ( the current six plus Iraq ) . `` Since September 11 , 2001 , '' they said , `` not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order .

After years spent trying to rule immigration restriction out of bounds, the Left is doubling down on ruling immigration restriction out of bounds.

It can’t be that the only reason for protecting the border, rejecting bogus asylum-seekers, reorienting the legal immigration system toward skills rather than family unification, and reducing overall numbers is rank hatred bordering on homicidal malice.

It can’t be that the only choice is between extremely latitudinarian policies that allow asylum-seekers into the country, often never to be seen again, or mass murder.

It can’t be that the only respectable position on immigration, safe for the general public, is whatever the Democrats’ center of gravity on the issue is at any given time (always in flux and always moving left).

First, let’s stipulate that Trump’s words on immigration often are crude and inflammatory. Yet nothing he’s ever said could possibly justify indiscriminately shooting people. Trump is not a terrorist, a supporter of terrorism, or an enabler of terrorism.

The El Paso shooter’s apparent manifesto overlaps with some of Trump’s rhetoric, but what defines the document is its apocalyptic argument that slaughter is the way “to reclaim” the country.

The gulf between that view and Trump’s — that Congress should build a wall and change some highly technical asylum rules — is vast. It is the difference between justifying criminality and advocating legislation, between quitting on America and calling for policies to solve one of its problems.

Much is made of Trump’s use of the word “invasion,” which also features in the manifesto. This is a loaded term best avoided. It speaks to a hostile intent among immigrants who, by and large, come here to improve their lives.

But, again, the impulse to gun down these supposed invaders shopping at Walmart and the impulse to exclude them from entry, or quickly and safely return them home once here, don’t exist in the same moral universe.

For all that the language police profess to care deeply about words, they aren’t very careful about rendering Trump’s. No one notes that in his Florida rally where a rallygoer notoriously yelled “shoot them” and Trump shook his head, smiled, and said “only in the Panhandle,” the president was in the midst of saying of border agents, “Don’t forget, we don’t let them, and we can’t let them, use weapons.”

The discrediting of views that show up in the manifesto only works one way. The shooter expresses a fear of automation and support for the universal basic income. Should we hold that against Andrew Yang? The shooter fears we’re on the verge of an environmental disaster. Should Jay Inslee tone it down?

When a member of Antifa was shot dead by police while attacking an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Washington state, Democrats weren’t made to answer for their harsh attacks on immigration enforcement.

It’s even a count against Trump that the shooter, too, says that Democrats favor “open borders.” If it’s going to be unacceptable to use the term “open borders” of a party that is getting closer and closer to embracing a policy of open borders, we might as well shut down the immigration debate now.

Which is, of course, part of the point. What much of the Left won’t acknowledge is that restrictionists have a sincere belief that secure borders and a reformed legal immigration system would be better for our laws, our economy, and our cultural cohesion.

If Trump is a flawed tribune for this point of view, he’s not culpable of murder, either. The charge that he somehow is is yet another symptom of our rapidly degrading public debate rather than a call to elevate it.

Navarrette: Focus was supposed to be on deporting aliens who are involved in crime

The Obama administration calls its policy on illegal immigrants ""prosecutorial discretion."" In reality, we're finding out, it amounts to business as usual, deporting huge numbers of hard-working immigrants.

The objective of the new ""policy"" announced last year was to fool immigration reform advocates into thinking that the administration had grown a conscience and stopped running up its deportation figures by deporting people who represent no threat to public safety.

If you're an illegal immigrant with no criminal record, longstanding ties to the community, or U.S.-born children, or if you're a young person who would have been eligible for a pathway to legal status under the Dream Act, you are supposed to get a break so that the administration can focus its limited resources on going after criminal aliens.

When the policy was announced last year, the media should have asked President Barack Obama, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton or Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Munoz this question: ""If resources are indeed so limited, and since it is more labor intensive to pursue criminals than college students, why shouldn't we expect you to continue to take the easy road and remove noncriminals no matter what you're promising?""

Ruben Navarrette Jr.

That is pretty much what happened. By all accounts, hardly anything has changed at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since November 2011, Department of Homeland Security officials have reviewed more than 400,000 cases; according to a recent report , less than 2 percent of those cases were closed.

This revelation has to be a little embarrassing for those right-wing commentators who, when the policy was announced, got carried away and called it a ""backdoor amnesty.""

Really? It turns out the door is still shut.

And, even in those cases where the individuals were removed from deportation proceedings, they weren't given a pathway to earned legal status or a work visa, perhaps in the hope that, with limited options to make a living and provide for their families, they would, as presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney likes to say, ""self-deport.""

Which reminds me, what's the difference between the two major presidential candidates when it comes to immigration? There isn't much of one.

In fact, I've interviewed immigration lawyers who say that the ICE agents they deal with at the local level openly refer to the promise of prosecutorial discretion as a ""joke.""

Immigration reform advocates aren't laughing. Neither are Latinos, many of whom take the immigration issue personally because many of them know people who have been deported and because they feel affected by the racism driving the debate.

Both groups are upset that the administration's much-hyped policy of applying ""prosecutorial discretion"" to hundreds of thousands of deportation cases still in the pipeline has turned out to be little more than smoke and mirrors.

Here's how they do it,2019-02-21,Alan Gomez,"CLOSE Amid public outcry over the thousands of migrant children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border , President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep families together . Here ’ s a wrap-up of everything that led to this moment . Just the FAQs
The Trump administration has been blocked from systematically breaking up migrant families , but hundreds of children crossing the border continue to be separated from their parents in a process requiring none of the oversight used to remove children in the United States from their homes , according to a ███ review of the system .
Separating a child from a family in most communities requires a child welfare specialist and involvement of the judicial system , often with a judge scrutinizing the case for months or even years .
At the border , the decision is made solely by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in the field . No child welfare specialist is required , and no judge is involved in a decision that can not be appealed .
Rebekah Fletcher , a supervising attorney at Kids in Need of Defense , a group that provides lawyers to migrant children in U.S. courts , says the removal of a child from a family in the U.S. is , by design , a difficult , multi-layered process involving people from multiple branches of government . But not so for children at the border .
“ To put those similar types of determinations solely in CBP ’ s hands … the room for error and the room for misinterpretation is dangerously high , ” she said .
Even the border protection agency characterizes its family separation process as `` brief and expeditious in nature , '' according to a statement provided to ███ .
President Donald Trump and U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw both ordered the Department of Homeland Security to stop separating migrant families as a systemic practice in June .
There is an exception , however : When a parent presents a danger to a child .
What constitutes a `` danger '' is not clearly defined , but it can include obvious cases of abuse , where the child is covered in bruises , and harder-to-detect cases , where immigration agents believe a child is in peril .
In the seven months after Trump and Sabraw issued their orders , Homeland Security separated at least 245 children from their parents in part by using the danger exception , according to a Department of Justice estimate filed in court on Wednesday . Immigration attorneys believe the number is far higher , with the Texas Civil Rights Project releasing a report on Thursday that found 272 separations in that time period in the McAllen , Texas , area alone .
Immigration attorneys and family law experts say the process used to separate children , most commonly carried out by Customs and Border Protection agents , has been shrouded in mystery , provides no due process for the parents and is vulnerable to abuse or mistakes .
The agency defended its family separation process as one that balances the desire to `` maintain family unity to the greatest extent operationally feasible '' with strong protections for children who may be in danger .
`` When handling children it is a practice to always err on the side of caution and to act in the best interest of the child , '' a statement from the agency said . `` The moment of suspicion that a threat to a child exists , it becomes an inquiry and potentially an investigation into the welfare of that child . ''

More : Watchdog : Thousands more migrant children may have been separated at border than previously reported
Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike expressed shock over the process during a committee hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Committee this month . The separation process will be further scrutinized in a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday .
The ACLU briefly raised the question in federal court on Thursday , when lawyers appeared before Sabraw as he continues to monitor the reunification of more than 2,800 children separated under the Trump administration 's `` zero tolerance '' policy . But lawyers spent the majority of that hearing debating whether the government should be required to identify potentially thousands of other families that were separated before the `` zero tolerance '' policy was officially announced .
Sabraw has allowed the government to continue separating more families under the exception to ensure that migrant children are not being trafficked or abused .
ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said the most recent separation cases have shown that the government may be abusing that exception .
`` The government appears to be doing an end run around the court order by unilaterally declaring parents a danger and failing to give parents the ability to rebut that charge , '' Gelernt said .
When a migrant family crosses the border , either legally at a port of entry or illegally between ports , an immigration agent processes the case . That includes taking down basic information – names , birth dates , country of origin , whether families are applying for asylum or other forms of protection .
The family members are given a medical check and entered into various databases to determine if they have immigration violations or criminal backgrounds , Customs and Border Protection said . The immigration agent also tries to verify the parent-child relationship to ensure the child is n't being trafficked by a smuggler posing as a parent .
All the while , the agent observes the family to gauge whether the parent poses a danger to the child . But no clear-cut definition of such danger exists to guide Border Patrol agents when making that determination . Complicating the decision are language barriers or children too young to offer information .
Agency officials said their decisions are based on multiple U.S. laws and regulations that govern the treatment of migrant children in government custody . None of those lays out a process for separating a migrant parent from his or her child .
The separation process , which is being challenged in court , was explained to ███ by a senior Border Patrol official who was authorized to speak only if his name was withheld .
The official said his agents can generally determine if a child has been abused based on the agents ' experience as law enforcement officers and history of interviewing suspects . Agents do n't receive any training on identifying child trauma . `` We 're not trained behavioral scientists , '' the official said .
But the Border Patrol official said agents ' experience as a father or mother can help them make the determination . The official said agents can orderan additional medical examination of the child to identify signs of injuries and can interview the parent and child separately to ensure that their stories line up .
`` You size up people with their demeanor and you can tell if they 're angry , if they 're upset , if they had an altercation , '' he said . `` There 's a lot of non-verbals that stand out . ''
Throughout the U.S. , that kind of analysis is usually done by child welfare experts who studied the field and are working for state or local child welfare agencies .
Vivek Sankaran , a clinical professor of law and director of the Child Advocacy Law Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School , said identifying child trauma , and the cause of it , requires years of education and training .
`` It is universal among mental health professionals that the idea of removing a child from a parent is one of the most traumatic things we as a society can do to the child , '' he said . `` So you want somebody who has been very well-trained to make sure that we need to inflict ( a separation ) on the child . ''
Even a former Customs and Border Protection commissioner questioned whether agents should be conducting the child welfare investigations alone .
Gil Kerlikowske , who headed the agency in the Obama administration , said in an interview that migrants are being screened at one of the most stressful moments of their lives , having just completed an exhausting journey across Mexico during which they are frequently victims of robberies , kidnappings and sexual assaults .
Kerlikowske said agents are operating without information that is available in normal child abuse investigations , including a list of official visits to the home and interviews with neighbors and relatives .
`` How do you determine whether the child is afraid of the parent , or afraid of the Border Patrol agent in the green uniform ? '' he asked .
Another factor contributing to the evaluation is a parent 's criminal history , either in the U.S. or in their home country . The U.S. government shares criminal databases with Central American countries and can identify whether there are warrants out for their arrest .
But the border protection agency did not specify what kinds of crimes it 's researching .
Michelle Brané , director of the Migrant Rights and Justice Program at the Women ’ s Refugee Commission , said she has seen cases where a parent is found to be a danger over immigration violations or minor criminal convictions that do not indicate whether the parent may abuse the child .
`` There 's a lot of people ( in the U.S. ) with all sorts of convictions and it does n't even trigger a child protective services investigation , '' Brané said . `` If you have a shoplifting conviction , or did n't pay child support , or you stole a car , does that really put the child at risk ? ''
The border agency says officers are allowed to get assistance from child welfare specialists from local and state agencies , but that is not a requirement , and the agency does not track how often such requests are made .
The final decision to separate a family is made by the front-line officer with approval from a supervisor . The decision is final and can not be reviewed by a judge .
Once the decision to separate is made , the child is sent to the Department of Health and Human Services ' Office of Refugee Resettlement , which takes custody of the child and starts searching for a suitable sponsor in the U.S .
Customs and Border Protection says its agents are required to flag the separation in each case file and provide a reason for the separation , but HHS officials and immigration attorneys say agents regularly fail to so do so .
HHS spokesman Mark Weber said caseworkers ask all incoming children about their parents to make sure separated children are properly identified .
Fletcher , supervising attorney for Kids in Need of Defense , said the group gets the full picture of a child 's separation only after filing a federal Freedom of Information Act request , which can take weeks or months to come back .
CLOSE During a press conference in the Rose Garden , President Trump admitted that he did n't need to declare a national emergency to fund his border wall , but that he did it so he could `` get it done faster . '' ███
Though it has been difficult for any kind of immigration bill to pass Congress in recent years , Democrats and Republicans alike are starting to look into ways to improve the family separation process .
In the congressional hearing this month , Rep. Diana DeGette , D-Colo. , said that there need to be clear guidelines to separate a family and that child welfare professionals need to be involved . Rep. Susan Brooks , R-Ind. , agreed .
`` We do n't have a terrific system , we do n't have standards , we do n't have procedures , '' Brooks said . `` What should we be doing ? ''
Suggestions are plentiful . Cristina Muñiz de la Peña , a mental health expert who testified before the committee , said the guidelines and practices that should be imposed on Homeland Security already exist in child welfare agencies around the country .
`` We could adapt those guidelines in the immigration context and bring those professionals to really counsel the people on the ground , '' she said .
Kerlikowske , the former border protection commissioner , said the agency could hire a dozen child welfare experts in the four border states who could be on call and required to step in to evaluate any migrant parent suspected of abusing a child .
Sankaran , the University of Michigan Law School professor , suggested taking things a step further : Place all migrant families where abuse is suspected directly into the state juvenile court system .
Anything short of that , Sankaram said , would only tinker with a Homeland Security process that is fatally flawed and prolong the anguish of family separations that should have been put to rest last summer .

Bipartisan support for improving the process

Though it has been difficult for any kind of immigration bill to pass Congress in recent years, Democrats and Republicans alike are starting to look into ways to improve the family separation process.

In some cases , the cities and counties are defying Mr. Trump and state leaders who want to support the president . Other times it ’ s the states that are defying Mr. Trump , and cities and counties that are rallying to support him .
The president lent his support to those officials Wednesday , holding a powwow with California officials who are resisting their state ’ s ultra-strict sanctuary law .
“ It ’ s becoming quite popular what you ’ re doing — [ fighting ] a law that forces the release of illegal immigrant criminals , drug dealers , gang members and violent predators into your communities , ” Mr. Trump told the officials .
While Mr. Trump praised the California rebels , elsewhere the local resistance is decidedly against him .
In Indiana , the cities of Gary and East Chicago are battling against lawsuits saying they are breaking a statewide anti-sanctuary policy .
And in Texas a number of cities fought — and lost — a battle against Gov . Greg Abbott ’ s ambitious sanctuary crackdown , which even includes penalties against local officials who try to become sanctuaries .
A Federation for American Immigration Reform report last week found the number of sanctuaries has soared under Mr. Trump , with about half of the country now covered by some noncompliance policy .

Sanctuary defenders say they ’ re not pro-illegal immigration or pro-criminal , but say their job is to enforce local laws , not federal immigration matters .
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra , who is defending his state ’ s policies in court , said Mr. Trump ’ s Wednesday roundtable with sanctuary opponents amounted to “ scapegoating and fear-mongering . ”
“ While President Trump seems to think our local law enforcement agencies should do the job of the federal government , we ’ re in the business of public safety , not deportation , ” he said .
SB 54 , California ’ s main sanctuary law , prohibits state and local police from asking about immigration status , holding people for pickup by immigration authorities , or notifying deportation officers when an illegal immigrant is about to be released from state or local custody . Other state sanctuary laws give immigrants in California custody the right to refuse to talk to federal deportation officers , and limit private businesses in how they are able to cooperate with immigration officers .
Mr. Becerra said the state ’ s law “ works in concert ” with federal laws .
Los Alamitos , a small city in Orange County about 20 miles south of Los Angeles , passed a measure in March exempting itself from the state ’ s SB 54 law , which prohibits local police from offering substantive cooperation to federal immigration authorities .
Huntington Beach , a seaside city of about 200,000 people in Orange County , sued California in state court , hoping to sideline SB 54 .
In yet a third form of resistance , Orange County and a number of other jurisdictions have signed onto a federal lawsuit filed by the Trump administration asking U.S. courts to rule SB 54 is unconstitutional because it tramples on the federal government ’ s power to control immigration .
“ This is your Republican resistance right here , ” Melissa Melendez , a member of the California Assembly , told Mr. Trump at Wednesday ’ s meeting .
Michael Gates , the city attorney in Huntington Beach , said he was “ a little surprised ” the White House didn ’ t invite officials from his city to the meeting with Mr. Trump .
“ What we ’ ve advanced against the state , what we ’ ve filed in court is much much stronger than anything else the other cities have done , ” he told The ███ .
He was confident the sanctuary state law “ on its face ” was unconstitutional .
Mr. Capps , at the Migration Policy Institute , said the big legal question is what level of government is going to win among the localities , the states and the feds .
He said there ’ s a convincing argument that states will prevail , which could leave in force both pro-sanctuary laws , like California ’ s , and anti-sanctuary laws , like Texas ’ s , on the books .
But James Bopp Jr. , an Indiana lawyer representing residents who are challenging the sanctuary policies in Gary and East Chicago , said the order of primacy is clearly on the federal side .
“ States are obligated to follow , and local governments are obligated to follow federal law , and federal law is supreme under the Constitution , ” he said . “ It ’ s not up to individual public officials to decide what laws they ’ re going to follow and what laws they ’ re not going to follow . ”
“ We fought a civil war over the question , ” he added . “ The nullification side lost . Now interestingly , of course , at that time the Democrats were in favor of nullification to protect slavery . Now they ’ re in favor of nullification to protect illegal immigrants . So there is a consistency there . ”
He said the Gary and East Chicago sanctuary policies even order police to avoid arresting illegal immigrants if there ’ s any other alternative . While it ’ s unclear what alternatives there would be in a given case , he said the effect of that policy is to make every officer fear second-guessing by supervisors .

Donald Trump has energized millions of Republican voters this primary season with his tough talk of building a wall along the Mexico border and deporting people who entered the country illegally.

But, that same language could have an unintentional side effect in a general election and energize legal immigrants to become citizens before November so they can vote against Trump.

Jose Lovos moved to the U.S. legally 20 years ago from the war-torn country of El Salvador. These days, he lives in Virginia with his wife and three kids.

Lovos was eligible to become a citizen years ago, but he said he never got around to filling out the paperwork.

So on Christmas Day, he and his wife decided it was time to become citizens.

And, in the months after Trump announced his bid for president, citizenship applications were up 14.5 percent compared to the year before, according to data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Of course, applications tend to spike in election years.

And, from year-to-year applications also fluctuate because of other factors: possible fee increases or organized citizenship drives.

This year, there's also been an intense push by immigrant groups because of Trump. A coalition called ""Stand Up To Hate"" has held held more than 300 workshops across the country in recent months.

The flawed rollout of the Affordable Care Act has endangered another of President Barack Obama ’ s top agenda items : Immigration reform .
It ’ s forcing the White House and its allies to confront a basic , but politically potent , criticism . If the government can ’ t build a website , how can it be trusted to correctly process millions of undocumented immigrants and require every employer to verify the status of their workers ?
The Obamacare struggles and the government shutdown sidetracked White House plans for a fall immigration campaign . And House Republicans have been able to avoid a major political hit for sitting on the Senate-passed bill in part due to their ability to draw attention to Obama ’ s broken promises on health care .
Coming into 2013 , immigration reform looked promising — Obama and Democrats were pushing ahead , and Republicans wanted to move on after losing the Hispanic vote . But the legislation remains stalled in the House , where Speaker John Boehner has claimed immigration reform is “ absolutely not ” dead but has yet to say when it would come to the floor .

The flawed rollout of the Affordable Care Act has endangered another of President Barack Obama’s top agenda items: Immigration reform.

It’s forcing the White House and its allies to confront a basic, but politically potent, criticism. If the government can’t build a website, how can it be trusted to correctly process millions of undocumented immigrants and require every employer to verify the status of their workers?

Story Continued Below

The Obamacare struggles and the government shutdown sidetracked White House plans for a fall immigration campaign. And House Republicans have been able to avoid a major political hit for sitting on the Senate-passed bill in part due to their ability to draw attention to Obama’s broken promises on health care.

Coming into 2013, immigration reform looked promising — Obama and Democrats were pushing ahead, and Republicans wanted to move on after losing the Hispanic vote. But the legislation remains stalled in the House, where Speaker John Boehner has claimed immigration reform is “absolutely not” dead but has yet to say when it would come to the floor.

That the public may be more skeptical of the federal government’s capacity to run big programs effectively and efficiently is something conservatives will surely hold up as a reason not to expand the government’s footprint well into the future — setting up another hurdle for reform advocates to clear.

“There’s a loss of confidence in the government’s ability,” former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat who backs the immigration bill, said at an event sponsored by the public relations firm Edelman this month. “Clearly, the last few months, our experience with Affordable Care Act does not help when you look at other big things like immigration reform.”

The Senate bill would beef up border enforcement, expand the nation’s temporary worker program, and create legalization pathways for the estimated 11 million people who are in the country illegally. That may be now too much for Congress to handle, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), both a lead co-sponsor of the Senate bill and leading Obamacare critic.

“It’s going to make it harder to sell big deals,” Graham said. “People are now saying, ‘So you’re gonna do immigration. You’re gonna let the same people manage the immigration system that’s managed Obamacare?’”

Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said the rocky Obamacare rollout “validated our warnings against jamming one massive bill that few have read and even fewer fully comprehend.”

“If the Obamacare train wreck has any lesson,” Buck said, “it’s that big policy challenges should be addressed deliberatively and one step at a time.”

Still, President Barack Obama and his allies have yet to adjust their strategy to fit a new reality that politicians on both the right and the left say has taken hold in the debate.

“If people are looking for an excuse not to do the right thing on immigration reform, they can always find an excuse — we’ve run out of time, or this is hard, or the list goes on and on,” Obama said at a news conference last month. “But my working assumption is people should want to do the right thing.”

His press secretary, Jay Carney, said the real comparison is in the public benefit of Obamacare and immigration.

“These are different systems,” Carney said Monday. “I would point to the extraordinary effort that’s gone into fixing the problems on HealthCare.gov, acknowledging the shortcomings — the serious, significant shortcomings, taking ownership and responsibility for them and acting to fix the problem. Because in the end — and this would be true of immigration reform as it is of HealthCare.gov or the ACA — the issue isn’t in the end how the process is; the process is performed in service of the legislation and the goal. And in this case, in immigration reform, it’s in service of a bill that would provide, when implemented, the benefits that we’ve described and that outside analysts have described.”

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said his private conversations with Republicans, as well as Boehner’s strike against tea party groups last week over the budget, make him believe that prospects for passage are brightening.

Jennifer Rankin in Brussels has more on Tusk’s concerns about Trump.

One of the EU’s top leaders has criticised Donald Trump for his “worrying declarations” and said the new administration in Washington is contributing to the dangers facing Europe.

Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, said the “worrying declarations by the new American administration... make our future highly unpredictable”.

In a letter to EU leaders [pdf], he included the new man in the White House with a threatening geopolitical outlook that also includes an “assertive China”, “aggressive Russia”, radical Islam and “wars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and Africa”.

The former Polish president said Europe had never faced such threats since six countries embarked on the integration project sixty years ago, by signing a declaration in the Italian capital. “The challenges currently facing the European Union are more dangerous than ever before in the time since the signature of the Treaty of Rome.”

Two-thirds say granting undocumented workers legal status would drain government services
More than 8 in 10 Americans endorse views on both sides of the argument
WASHINGTON — As the immigration debate heads into a crucial period on Capitol Hill , Americans have been convinced .
In a new ███/Pew Research Center Poll , three of four people agree with big arguments made by proponents of legislation that would allow millions of undocumented workers to stay in the United States legally : that deporting them is n't realistic , that granting them legal status would boost the U.S. economy , that most are hardworking and deserve an opportunity to stay .
At the same time , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed also agree with big arguments made by opponents : that granting undocumented workers legal status would drain government services and that doing so would encourage more foreigners to come to the U.S. illegally .
Just about everybody — more than eight in 10 Americans — endorse views on both sides of the argument . That could make the politics harder when it comes to striking a final deal this year , a time widely seen as the best chance in a generation to overhaul the nation 's immigration system .
`` I 'm a Democrat , and I understand the importance of it , especially to the children of immigrants , '' Linda Kosinski , 56 , a small-business owner from Andover , Mass. , said in a follow-up interview after being polled . `` But I 'm one of those 'the rules are the rules ' people . Fundamentally I guess I worry about — if we keep doing this , why would anybody go through the means of becoming a citizen legally ? ''
`` Believe it or not , I 'm a registered Republican , but I put it to you this way : People who have been here for years and years , I say legalize them , '' says Aaron Movtady , 44 , a loan officer for a mortgage bank from Bayside , Queens . `` Lot of them , they 're guys just trying to make an honest living , trying to live the American dream . ''
The findings illustrate `` the level of internal conflict people feel over this policy realm , '' says Michael Dimmock , director of the Pew Research Center . `` Both arguments have been made pretty persuasively at this point . ''
The poll of 1,512 adults , taken June 12-16 by land line and cellphone , has a margin of error of +/–2.9 percentage points .
The crosscurrents in public opinion could complicate the make-or-break period just ahead in Congress .
In some ways , it could help negotiations to reach a compromise . `` When people see both sides of an argument , then the proponents of each side understand the other side is going to be taken into consideration , '' offers Haley Barbour , a former Mississippi governor and Republican national chairman .
In other ways , it 's likely to make it harder . For one thing , it will be difficult to satisfy the sometimes-conflicting priorities that most Americans now endorse , from the demand to tighten the borders ( backed by 77 % ) to the desire to provide legal standing for undocumented immigrants ( backed by 71 % ) . For another , negotiators could be emboldened to draw a harder line against giving ground because both sides can argue that Americans are behind them .
In the past few days , there has been progress toward a deal in the Senate but warning signs of the course ahead in the House .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , says he wants the Senate to vote on an immigration overhaul drafted by the bipartisan `` Gang of Eight '' before the Fourth of July recess . An agreement reached Thursday to bolster the border-security provisions in the measure has helped win over additional Republican senators . However , House Speaker John Boehner last week declared that the legislation brought to the floor there will have to be backed by a `` majority of the majority '' — that is , by a majority of Republican representatives .
That guarantees the House version , assuming one passes , will be significantly more conservative than the Senate bill . Boehner has signaled it wo n't include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers , even though Democrats describe that as essential , and it 's likely to include provisions on border security that the other side already has ruled out as unacceptable . The Senate amendment has n't quelled his concerns .
`` Immigration reform must — I mean must — be grounded in real border security , '' Boehner said Thursday . `` That 's what the American people believe . ''
The most divisive issue in the immigration debate comes down to a question of timing : Half of those surveyed , 49 % , say undocumented immigrants should be able to apply for legal status while border-security improvements are being made . Close to half , 43 % , say the move to legal status should be delayed until after stricter border security is in place .
`` The most important thing is that our citizens along the border between Mexico and the U.S. are in danger , '' says James Purvis , 28 , of Rochester , N.Y. , who works in information security and was called in the poll . `` My brother lives in Arizona , and it 's very much part of his life that he has to worry about being injured or harassed by people at the border . ''
The issue divides each party into three camps , albeit in different ways .
Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents , nearly four in 10 say immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally should n't be able to remain in the country at all . The remaining Republicans are divided between those who say the immigrants should n't be allowed to apply for legal status until borders are under better control and those who say they should be allowed to do so while border security is being improved .
Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents , four in 10 say undocumented workers should be able to apply for legal status while border security is being tightened . The remaining Democrats are divided between those who say the legalization process should n't begin until the borders have been made more secure and those who say border security should n't even be part of the new immigration law .
`` They talk so much about it , but they need to do something , '' says Ramona McEwen , 52 , a home health aide from Muskegon , Mich. `` It 's time . The ones that are already here , already established their families , their jobs , they should be able to stay here instead of go back . I think that 's only fair . ''
Precisely half of those surveyed say it is extremely or very important to them that the president and Congress enact significant immigration legislation this year . Another one in three say it is `` somewhat '' important to them . Just two in 10 say it is n't important .
The level of interest in and support for a bill is significantly higher than it was almost precisely six years ago , in June 2007 , the last time the Senate was headed to a vote on a major immigration bill . At that time , a ███/Gallup Poll found that 58 % of those surveyed did n't know enough about the measure to have an opinion . Those who did have a view opposed it by nearly 3-1 , and opponents were much more likely to feel strongly about it than supporters .
Now , there 's modest confidence now that Congress will pass a bill that President Obama will sign . Fourteen percent of those surveyed by the Pew Research Center say it 's very likely legislation will be signed this year ; 39 % call it somewhat likely . Forty-four percent say it 's not likely to happen .
`` I do want them to pass the bill , but I have reservations about whether they will , '' says Michael Scruggs , 49 , a financial analyst who lives near Phoenix . `` Immigration is like drug enforcement , OK ? Like the war on drugs and the war on terror . It 's all sound bites . ''
Many of the policy issues today are the same as those debated the last time around , but there has been at least one big change —and that has given an immigration bill brighter prospects than it had six years ago .
`` What is very different is the focus on Latino voters that came out of the 2012 election , '' says Matt Barreto , a political scientist at the University of Washington , Seattle , who studies Latino voting behavior . `` The 2012 election showed the number of Latino voters continuing to increase and in key states . ... Finally the Republican Party is getting the message : This is a monumental issue for Latino voters , and it 's one in which they will evaluate the Republican Party . ''
In 2012 , Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney received just 27 % of the Latino vote , according to surveys of voters as they left polling places .
`` The Republican Party really in this last election did n't do anything for the Latino vote , and when they tried to do some ad campaigns it became a laughingstock , '' recalls Stephanie Stenner , 23 , a coffee shop barista from Santa Cruz , Calif. , who is Hispanic . `` A lot of Latinos are very conservative , and the Republican Party could have such a huge opening for what they stand for with Latinos . But this immigration issue is really hurting them . ''
Those who are n't Latino are skeptical that passing an immigration bill will do the GOP much good politically . About two-thirds of non-Hispanics say it wo n't make much difference or might even hurt Republicans .
Among Hispanics , however , 55 % say passing an immigration bill would help Republicans in national elections . Seven of 10 Latinos say it 's extremely or very important to them that immigration legislation pass this year . Nine of 10 say there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States legally , if certain requirements are met .
So do seven in 10 Americans overall . Asked about what those requirements might be :
• 76 % say they should be required to speak and understand English before applying for legal status .
• 55 % say there should be a 10-year waiting period before they could become permanent residents .
`` The U.S. needs more people , and we need them to be legal so they can pay taxes , '' says Alfredo Mesa Moreno , 29 , a field scientist in Tampa who legally immigrated from Spain and hopes to become a U.S. citizen next year . `` But with this law — it can be like a call for immigrants to come here illegally , '' he worries , then adds : `` I guess it 's complicated .

The poll of 1,512 adults, taken June 12-16 by land line and cellphone, has a margin of error of +/–2.9 percentage points.

The crosscurrents in public opinion could complicate the make-or-break period just ahead in Congress.

In some ways, it could help negotiations to reach a compromise. ""When people see both sides of an argument, then the proponents of each side understand the other side is going to be taken into consideration,"" offers Haley Barbour, a former Mississippi governor and Republican national chairman.

In other ways, it's likely to make it harder. For one thing, it will be difficult to satisfy the sometimes-conflicting priorities that most Americans now endorse, from the demand to tighten the borders (backed by 77%) to the desire to provide legal standing for undocumented immigrants (backed by 71%). For another, negotiators could be emboldened to draw a harder line against giving ground because both sides can argue that Americans are behind them.

In the past few days, there has been progress toward a deal in the Senate but warning signs of the course ahead in the House.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., says he wants the Senate to vote on an immigration overhaul drafted by the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" before the Fourth of July recess. An agreement reached Thursday to bolster the border-security provisions in the measure has helped win over additional Republican senators. However, House Speaker John Boehner last week declared that the legislation brought to the floor there will have to be backed by a ""majority of the majority"" — that is, by a majority of Republican representatives.

That guarantees the House version, assuming one passes, will be significantly more conservative than the Senate bill. Boehner has signaled it won't include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers, even though Democrats describe that as essential, and it's likely to include provisions on border security that the other side already has ruled out as unacceptable. The Senate amendment hasn't quelled his concerns.

""Immigration reform must — I mean must — be grounded in real border security,"" Boehner said Thursday. ""That's what the American people believe.""

THE MOST DIVISIVE QUESTION

The most divisive issue in the immigration debate comes down to a question of timing: Half of those surveyed, 49%, say undocumented immigrants should be able to apply for legal status while border-security improvements are being made. Close to half, 43%, say the move to legal status should be delayed until after stricter border security is in place.

""The most important thing is that our citizens along the border between Mexico and the U.S. are in danger,"" says James Purvis, 28, of Rochester, N.Y., who works in information security and was called in the poll. ""My brother lives in Arizona, and it's very much part of his life that he has to worry about being injured or harassed by people at the border.""

The issue divides each party into three camps, albeit in different ways.

Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, nearly four in 10 say immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally shouldn't be able to remain in the country at all. The remaining Republicans are divided between those who say the immigrants shouldn't be allowed to apply for legal status until borders are under better control and those who say they should be allowed to do so while border security is being improved.

Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, four in 10 say undocumented workers should be able to apply for legal status while border security is being tightened. The remaining Democrats are divided between those who say the legalization process shouldn't begin until the borders have been made more secure and those who say border security shouldn't even be part of the new immigration law.

""They talk so much about it, but they need to do something,"" says Ramona McEwen, 52, a home health aide from Muskegon, Mich. ""It's time. The ones that are already here, already established their families, their jobs, they should be able to stay here instead of go back. I think that's only fair.""

Precisely half of those surveyed say it is extremely or very important to them that the president and Congress enact significant immigration legislation this year. Another one in three say it is ""somewhat"" important to them. Just two in 10 say it isn't important.

The level of interest in and support for a bill is significantly higher than it was almost precisely six years ago, in June 2007, the last time the Senate was headed to a vote on a major immigration bill. At that time, a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll found that 58% of those surveyed didn't know enough about the measure to have an opinion. Those who did have a view opposed it by nearly 3-1, and opponents were much more likely to feel strongly about it than supporters.

Then, the bill failed in the Senate.

Now, there's modest confidence now that Congress will pass a bill that President Obama will sign. Fourteen percent of those surveyed by the Pew Research Center say it's very likely legislation will be signed this year; 39% call it somewhat likely. Forty-four percent say it's not likely to happen.

""I do want them to pass the bill, but I have reservations about whether they will,"" says Michael Scruggs, 49, a financial analyst who lives near Phoenix. ""Immigration is like drug enforcement, OK? Like the war on drugs and the war on terror. It's all sound bites.""

'GETTING THE MESSAGE'

Many of the policy issues today are the same as those debated the last time around, but there has been at least one big change —and that has given an immigration bill brighter prospects than it had six years ago.

""What is very different is the focus on Latino voters that came out of the 2012 election,"" says Matt Barreto, a political scientist at the University of Washington, Seattle, who studies Latino voting behavior. ""The 2012 election showed the number of Latino voters continuing to increase and in key states. ... Finally the Republican Party is getting the message: This is a monumental issue for Latino voters, and it's one in which they will evaluate the Republican Party.""

In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney received just 27% of the Latino vote, according to surveys of voters as they left polling places.

""The Republican Party really in this last election didn't do anything for the Latino vote, and when they tried to do some ad campaigns it became a laughingstock,"" recalls Stephanie Stenner, 23, a coffee shop barista from Santa Cruz, Calif., who is Hispanic. ""A lot of Latinos are very conservative, and the Republican Party could have such a huge opening for what they stand for with Latinos. But this immigration issue is really hurting them.""

Those who aren't Latino are skeptical that passing an immigration bill will do the GOP much good politically. About two-thirds of non-Hispanics say it won't make much difference or might even hurt Republicans.

Among Hispanics, however, 55% say passing an immigration bill would help Republicans in national elections. Seven of 10 Latinos say it's extremely or very important to them that immigration legislation pass this year. Nine of 10 say there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States legally, if certain requirements are met.

So do seven in 10 Americans overall. Asked about what those requirements might be:

• 76% say they should be required to speak and understand English before applying for legal status.

• 56% say they should have to pay fines.

• 55% say there should be a 10-year waiting period before they could become permanent residents.

""The U.S. needs more people, and we need them to be legal so they can pay taxes,"" says Alfredo Mesa Moreno, 29, a field scientist in Tampa who legally immigrated from Spain and hopes to become a U.S. citizen next year. ""But with this law — it can be like a call for immigrants to come here illegally,"" he worries, then adds: ""I guess it's complicated.""

Mr. Trump said he would take a serious look at the legislation , which includes far less money for barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border than he has demanded , but gave no assurance he would sign it . He said he doesn ’ t want to see another government shutdown , while also indicating he continued to seek ways to find more funding for the wall beyond what Congress is allocating .
“ We have got a lot of funds for a lot of other things , ” Mr. Trump said , without providing details . “ With a wall , they want to be stingy . We have options that most people don ’ t really understand. ” In the past , Mr. Trump has floated declaring a national emergency to redirect funds to the wall , bypassing Congress .
Democrats are expected to challenge any efforts to move money around without congressional approval .
The text of the bill was released late Wednesday after lawmakers sorted out some last-minute complications . The biggest snag focused on whether to include back pay for federal contractors to make up for lost compensation during the record-long partial government shutdown that ended last month . Democratic lawmakers supported the back pay , but the White House balked at it .
Lawmakers also debated an extension of the Violence Against Women Act , which provides funding for programs to prevent domestic violence and bolster prosecutions . House Democrats pushed instead to reintroduce later a new version of the bill that would prevent people under protective orders from possessing firearms and would bar evictions of victims of domestic violence based on the actions of abusers .
When negotiations had wrapped up Wednesday night , lawmakers had decided not to include a reauthorization of VAWA or back pay for contractors in the bill , according to a senior Democratic aide .
The Senate and House were expected to vote Thursday on the spending package . It is expected to pass both chambers , though it will face opposition from lawmakers on both the left and right ends of the political spectrum .
The people familiar with Mr. Trump ’ s plans said that unless something unexpected emerged that made the bill less palatable , they expected him to back it . “ We ’ ll be looking for land mines because you could have that , ” the Republican president said Wednesday , referring to the legislation .
Administration officials cautioned that no final decision has been made , and that the White House was still reviewing the deal .
The deal , backed by congressional leaders in both parties , would fund the Department of Homeland Security , which oversees the border , and a group of other federal agencies through September . It would allocate $ 1.38 billion for 55 miles of physical barriers—including bollard fencing and levee walls , but not concrete walls—along the Rio Grande Valley of the U.S.-Mexico border , according to congressional aides . That marks a far lower funding level than the $ 5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had sought for a wall .
Some conservative lawmakers and commentators have bashed the deal for not having more wall funding , including Fox News host and Trump adviser Sean Hannity , who called it a “ garbage compromise. ” But an administration official cast the deal as a win for Mr. Trump ’ s border-security agenda .
“ We are a long way from Pelosi ’ s $ 1 , ” the official said , referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) joking last month that she would allot $ 1 for Mr. Trump ’ s wall .
Still , a person close to Mr. Trump expected him to make clear that he isn ’ t happy about the bill when he ultimately signs it . Mr. Trump has resigned himself to the fact that lawmakers won ’ t agree on more wall funding , the person said , but is confident that he can divert funds from elsewhere in the administration to the wall .
“ As long as he ’ s fighting for any mechanism , I would think it plays well , ” the person said . “ No one in the U.S. gives a crap how you do it.…They don ’ t read that part of the stories . ”
In an interview Wednesday with Fox News , White House press secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to some benefits that the administration sees in the deal , such as that it provides a total of $ 23 billion in funding for the budgets for Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Like Mr. Trump , she also suggested that the White House could augment the border-wall money provided by Congress through other means . Mr. Trump “ and his team have been looking at everything possible to get the funding they need in order to complete the wall , ” she said .
Liberal Democratic lawmakers raised concerns Wednesday over the number of ICE detention beds funded in the bill and ICE ’ s continued ability to transfer money to fund more beds than Congress had authorized . Democrats had hoped to place limits on the number of ICE beds .
Rep. Pramila Jayapal ( D. , Wash. ) , co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , said she leaned “ very strongly ” against the bill “ unless we have a guarantee from the administration that they ’ re actually going to listen to what Congress does and our appropriated amounts . ”
A bipartisan group of 17 lawmakers has been trying to cut a deal since the end of the five-week shutdown . Mr. Trump has pressed for a spending bill that includes funding for a border wall , which Democrats have opposed , instead backing other forms of barriers .
The bill provides far less funding for border barriers than deals that Mr. Trump had previously rejected . In January 2018 , Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York , the Democratic leader , offered Mr. Trump $ 25 billion over an unspecified period to be used for a border wall , paired with a path to citizenship for young immigrants .
Funding for many government agencies is set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Saturday unless Congress passes spending legislation and Mr. Trump signs it into law . A lapse in funding would force hundreds of thousands of federal workers again to go on unpaid furlough or to work without pay .
A sticking point in the final stretch of negotiations has been providing back pay for federal contractors . While Congress has provided back pay to federal employees who worked without pay or were furloughed during the shutdown , many contractors have so far not been compensated for the weeks they couldn ’ t work .
Democratic lawmakers had pushed to include a back-pay provision for federal contractors in the funding deal , but the White House has resisted the move . A Trump administration official familiar with the legislation said that providing back pay to the private employees would be costly and complicated to administer .
“ They just won ’ t accept it , ” Mrs. Pelosi said of Republicans blocking efforts to get federal contractors back pay . “ It ’ s hard , but we ’ re still pushing . We have to keep trying , because it ’ s totally unfair . ”","WASHINGTON—President Trump is likely to sign the border-security legislation finalized Wednesday that would keep the government from closing this weekend, people familiar with his plans said, but he continues to look for ways to supplement the modest funding it contains for barriers.

We have options that most people don’t really understand.” In the past, Mr. Trump has floated declaring a national emergency to redirect funds to the wall, bypassing Congress.

Democrats are expected to challenge any efforts to move money around without congressional approval.

The text of the bill was released late Wednesday after lawmakers sorted out some last-minute complications. The biggest snag focused on whether to include back pay for federal contractors to make up for lost compensation during the record-long partial government shutdown that ended last month. Democratic lawmakers supported the back pay, but the White House balked at it.

Lawmakers also debated an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which provides funding for programs to prevent domestic violence and bolster prosecutions. House Democrats pushed instead to reintroduce later a new version of the bill that would prevent people under protective orders from possessing firearms and would bar evictions of victims of domestic violence based on the actions of abusers.

When negotiations had wrapped up Wednesday night, lawmakers had decided not to include a reauthorization of VAWA or back pay for contractors in the bill, according to a senior Democratic aide.

The Senate and House were expected to vote Thursday on the spending package. It is expected to pass both chambers, though it will face opposition from lawmakers on both the left and right ends of the political spectrum.

The people familiar with Mr. Trump’s plans said that unless something unexpected emerged that made the bill less palatable, they expected him to back it. “We’ll be looking for land mines because you could have that,” the Republican president said Wednesday, referring to the legislation.

Administration officials cautioned that no final decision has been made, and that the White House was still reviewing the deal.

The deal, backed by congressional leaders in both parties, would fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the border, and a group of other federal agencies through September. It would allocate $1.38 billion for 55 miles of physical barriers—including bollard fencing and levee walls, but not concrete walls—along the Rio Grande Valley of the U.S.-Mexico border, according to congressional aides. That marks a far lower funding level than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had sought for a wall.

Some conservative lawmakers and commentators have bashed the deal for not having more wall funding, including Fox News host and Trump adviser Sean Hannity, who called it a “garbage compromise.” But an administration official cast the deal as a win for Mr. Trump’s border-security agenda.

“We are a long way from Pelosi’s $1,” the official said, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) joking last month that she would allot $1 for Mr. Trump’s wall.

Still, a person close to Mr. Trump expected him to make clear that he isn’t happy about the bill when he ultimately signs it. Mr. Trump has resigned himself to the fact that lawmakers won’t agree on more wall funding, the person said, but is confident that he can divert funds from elsewhere in the administration to the wall.

“As long as he’s fighting for any mechanism, I would think it plays well,” the person said. “No one in the U.S. gives a crap how you do it.…They don’t read that part of the stories.”

In an interview Wednesday with Fox News, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to some benefits that the administration sees in the deal, such as that it provides a total of $23 billion in funding for the budgets for Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Like Mr. Trump, she also suggested that the White House could augment the border-wall money provided by Congress through other means. Mr. Trump “and his team have been looking at everything possible to get the funding they need in order to complete the wall,” she said.

Liberal Democratic lawmakers raised concerns Wednesday over the number of ICE detention beds funded in the bill and ICE’s continued ability to transfer money to fund more beds than Congress had authorized. Democrats had hoped to place limits on the number of ICE beds.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said she leaned “very strongly” against the bill “unless we have a guarantee from the administration that they’re actually going to listen to what Congress does and our appropriated amounts.”

A bipartisan group of 17 lawmakers has been trying to cut a deal since the end of the five-week shutdown. Mr. Trump has pressed for a spending bill that includes funding for a border wall, which Democrats have opposed, instead backing other forms of barriers.

The bill provides far less funding for border barriers than deals that Mr. Trump had previously rejected. In January 2018, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, offered Mr. Trump $25 billion over an unspecified period to be used for a border wall, paired with a path to citizenship for young immigrants.

Funding for many government agencies is set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Saturday unless Congress passes spending legislation and Mr. Trump signs it into law. A lapse in funding would force hundreds of thousands of federal workers again to go on unpaid furlough or to work without pay.

A sticking point in the final stretch of negotiations has been providing back pay for federal contractors. While Congress has provided back pay to federal employees who worked without pay or were furloughed during the shutdown, many contractors have so far not been compensated for the weeks they couldn’t work.

Democratic lawmakers had pushed to include a back-pay provision for federal contractors in the funding deal, but the White House has resisted the move. A Trump administration official familiar with the legislation said that providing back pay to the private employees would be costly and complicated to administer.

“They just won’t accept it,” Mrs. Pelosi said of Republicans blocking efforts to get federal contractors back pay. “It’s hard, but we’re still pushing. We have to keep trying, because it’s totally unfair.”

Behind the Curtain is a reported column, Web show and online conversation about the behind-the-scenes intrigue that shapes politics and policy. It will unfold every Tuesday (and beyond, when news dictates). See previous editions of Behind the Curtain here.



Think Republicans feel in a jam about raising taxes? Wait until President Barack Obama springs comprehensive immigration reform on them early next year.

Story Continued Below

With Obama making plain his plans to push immigration soon, leading establishment Republicans — fresh off Mitt Romney getting his clocked cleaned by 44 percentage points among Hispanics last month — insist they are now very much open to a comprehensive package, including eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants.

But while top Republicans think they need to make a big move on the issue and actually want a bipartisan deal with Obama, the rank and file remain skeptical. And it is this tension that is defining the behind-the-scenes machinations as both parties plan for 2013.

“There’s a growing sense that this is an opportunity that should be taken,” said Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman and top adviser to Romney’s presidential campaign. “There’s no instinct like a survival instinct.”

Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, told us that Republicans should strike first and offer “a conservative immigration proposal that is comprehensive” before Obama’s State of the Union address. “My personal belief is that President Obama views this issue from a cynical political perspective not an economic one,” the former governor said by email. “After all, when he promised four years ago to do something and he had vast majorities in the Congress, he did nothing.”

Abbott ’ s comments came during an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas immediately following his signing of the historic bill that effectively outlaws sanctuary jurisdictions in the Lone Star State .

In an article published April 29 in the Dallas Morning News , State Representative Rafael Anchia ( D-Dallas ) said SB4 is unconstitutional because states are pre-empted by federal law in the area of immigration and are not permitted to conduct their own investigation . “ The Supreme Court struck down most of the provisions of the Arizona immigration law on this basis . ”
Abbott told Breitbart Texas this article “ directly misstated what the legal status of this law was out of the U.S. Supreme Court – in the Arizona decision . ”

Abbott reassured American citizens living in Texas this bill does nothing to change their daily lives . “ For American citizens , this bill has no impact on them whatsoever , and they have absolutely nothing to be concerned about , ” Abbott reassured . “ There ’ s only one group of people that is targeted by this legislation and that is people who are in this country illegally , who have committed violent crimes , and are subject to an ICE detainer request . ”
“ No one has to do anything different from the way they ’ ve been operating their lives before this law was signed , ” he said referring to a situation where someone is stopped for a traffic violation , ” because it poses no danger , no challenge , no difficulty , for any American citizen . ”

He said this bill doesn ’ t change anything in this regard and citizens and legal residents do not need “ carry papers ” to prove they are here legally .
The new law does pose a threat to law enforcement officials who choose to ignore detainer requests on illegal immigrants in their jails from immigration officials .
“ All law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law , ” the governor stated . “ If they refuse to follow this law , or if they adopt sanctuary city policies , they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in America for adopting sanctuary city policies – which includes jail time where sheriffs could wind up in the same jail they may be releasing inmates from who are the subject of ICE detainer requests . ”
“ But these officials also are subject to a removal action , ” he advised , “ and the counties or cities in which they operate are subject to very stiff fines. ” The governor said these fines can go up to $ 25,000 per day . The law makes ignoring an immigration detainer a Class A misdemeanor , Breitbart Texas reported .
Referring to Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez and Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez , who have either ignored or threatened to ignore immigration detainers , Abbott said they must come into compliance with the law . “ If they don ’ t change their policies , if they continue to handle detainers on a case-by-case basis that means they will be in violation of this law and subject to its penalties , ” he said firmly .
Governor Abbott explained that he believes this law will make Texas a safer place and help avoid tragedies like what happened in the sanctuary city of San Francisco with the murder of Kate Steinle by a previously deported illegal alien released from the local jail .

The most important step is to keep illegal immigrants from having gainful employment, whichever route they took to be here illegally. We must make it possible and mandatory for employers to verify that their new hires are present in the United States legally. After all, it’s the prospect of economic advance, rather than crime or political chaos, that drives almost all illegal immigration. To get control of it — and not just at the border — we have to take away the economic incentive. The knowledge that it will be much more difficult to make money in the U.S. will serve as a humane deterrent against future illegal immigration. Moreover, mandatory verification for new hires will make it harder for existing illegal immigrants to switch jobs, so some of them will leave. In addition, the mandatory implementation of E-Verify would make it easier to prosecute employers who exploit illegal workers and depress wages for lower-income Americans.

The Trump administration has been hesitant to put E-Verify front and center — it’s not as emotive as the president’s signature lines about immigration, and the business wing of the party is opposed. But, as we’ve seen over the last few weeks at the border, once illegal immigrants are in the country, even if they have just arrived, it’s a significant challenge to remove them. E-Verify would serve as a deterrent and diminish the illegal population without the government having to directly remove anyone (although, obviously, deportation is a completely legitimate tool of enforcement).

Once we have stanched the flow of illegal immigration in a durable way, we can consider granting amnesty to those illegal immigrants who have put down roots and avoided trouble. At that point, we will have greater confidence that we have ended the familiar cycle in which one amnesty, by inviting more illegal immigration, begets another.

The House is scheduled to vote on immigration this week. A bill sponsored by the House leadership attempts to split the difference between immigration hawks and moderate Republicans. Even if it passes the House, is not likely to survive a filibuster in the Senate, so the main purpose of the vote is to put legislators on record about what they want in immigration policy, and to exert an influence on the ultimate political settlement of this issue.

The current version of the bill contains several laudable provisions. Granting amnesty for people who came here illegally as minors and who have been law-abiding otherwise; re-orienting legal immigration from the reunification of extended families to the recruitment of skilled workers; reductions in legal immigration; allowing children to be held with their parents while their asylum claims are processed: We have endorsed all of these ideas and favor them still (provided, of course, that the amnesty is coupled with serious enforcement measures).

But the bill does not mandate the use of E-Verify for new hires. Conservatives should insist that it does.

At a training session Tuesday in Queens , a little more than two dozen people sat in a room listening to Yaritza Mendez , an outreach coordinator at the pro-immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New York .

Even people in the country illegally have constitutional rights , Mendez said , such as not being subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures , not answering questions and not signing any documents without speaking with an attorney .

A lady sitting at the back had a question . If immigration officials knocked on her door , what if she opened it a crack but kept the chain on ?
No , Mendez said . Not even a crack . That 's guidance that closely mirrors something criminal defense attorneys have long been telling clients . Letting a law enforcement agent peek inside could give them the probable cause they need to enter without a warrant .
Other advice dispensed during the session : Make sure any warrants presented have the right name and addresses and are signed by a judge . Do not volunteer information . Do not show the agents any fake documents , since doing so is a crime that could land them in much deeper trouble .

immigration,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/11/17340502/kirsten-gillibrand-immigration-border-stop-bill,Kirsten Gillibrand introduces a bill to crack down on immigration agents,2018-05-11,"Alexia Fernández Campbell, Matthew Yglesias, Sean Collins, German Lopez, Alex Abad-Santos, Alex Ward, Aaron Rupar","New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D ) introduced a bill Thursday to place more scrutiny on Border Patrol agents when they stop and question passengers on buses and trains .
The Department of Homeland Security Accountability and Transparency Act would require border patrol and immigration enforcement agents to document every instance when they stop , search , or interrogate people . The bill is co-sponsored by Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) , Tom Udall ( D-NM ) and Jeff Merkley ( D-OR ) . The law applies to all stops by agents who work for US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) .
Under current law , agents from both departments have broad authority to stop and question people about their immigration status . In the 100-mile border zone — the area of the US that ’ s within 100 miles of a land or water border — agents can pull over cars and board vehicles to ask passengers about their citizenship if they suspect a person is not in the country legally . ( In the rest of the country , ICE agents can ’ t enter private property without a warrant or pull over vehicles without probable cause of an immigration violation . ) But the law doesn ’ t require agents keep track of whom they stop or why , unless the agents detain someone or end up using force .
The practice of stopping people and asking them their citizenship status happens all over the border zone — in immigrant neighborhoods , on Greyhound buses or Amtrak trains , outside grocery stores .
In recent months , videos of Border Patrol agents boarding buses in New York and Florida have gone viral on social media , alarming civil rights groups and raising questions about the potential violation of a person ’ s constitutional rights .
Agents have vast powers to question people about their citizenship status , but there are some limits to that power . It ’ s illegal for agents to stop someone solely because of their race , or for no reason whatsoever . But because CBP and ICE do not keep track of their stops and searches , oversight can be a challenge .
Gillibrand ’ s bill seeks to bring more accountability to the process . It would require the agencies to start collecting data every time officers question someone about their immigration status when they are not at an airport or border crossing . They would need to report the time , date , and place of each stop , and the basis for questioning someone and the duration of the stop , among other details . The agents would also need to report information about permanent and temporary immigration checkpoints set up in the border zone . The information would be reported annually to Congress and made available to the public . ( According to Gillibrand ’ s office , the bill is partly a response to this ███ article and other media reports about the Border Patrol ’ s practice of questioning bus and train passengers . )
“ Keeping our country safe can not come at a cost to basic human rights , ” Gillibrand wrote in a statement to ███ . “ When border patrol agents stop and question people in New York and in many places across the country , they aren ’ t keeping data about why they targeted a particular person or what happened during their encounter . ”
Social media brought attention to the Border Patrol ’ s immense powers
There is a good chance you saw a video like this in recent months : camera-phone footage of Border Patrol agents getting on a bus or train , then walking down the aisle asking passengers , seemingly at random , if they ’ re American citizens .
. @ CustomsBorder got on a Greyhound bus yesterday at 4:30pm in Fort Lauderdale and asked every passenger for their papers and to prove citizenship . Proof of citizenship is NOT required to ride a bus ! For more information about your rights , call our hotline 1-888-600-5762 pic.twitter.com/rWJn61o8VP — FLImmigrantCoalition ( @ FLImmigrant ) January 20 , 2018
The video , posted by the Florida Immigrant Coalition , shows CBP agents questioning a Greyhound bus passenger in Fort Lauderdale . The conversation is n't audible , but the passenger appears to hand agents some paperwork before they escort her off the bus .
A few days later , a passenger on an Amtrak train in Syracuse , New York , filmed Border Patrol agents as they asked passengers where they were born .
Both videos were viewed nearly 4 million times on Twitter , prompting thousands of angry tweets , with many blaming President Donald Trump for the hardline tactic .
These incidents have led to much confusion — and have raised a few questions about immigration and border agents ’ authority and the rights people have in these encounters .
It ’ s important to note that these stops are not a new Trump initiative to crack down on illegal immigration . Border Patrol agents have been doing this for a while , even under the Obama administration . I know this because I watched Border Patrol agents do the same thing back in 2010 . I was a crime reporter in South Florida , and I accompanied agents as they questioned passengers at a Greyhound station in the Fort Lauderdale area .
At the time , the agents said they were trying to track down undocumented immigrants heading to Florida from Mexico . But Border Patrol ’ s methods , coupled with growing anxiety about immigrant rights in the Trump era , have raised concerns about the legal basis for such a practice , and whether current law gives these agents too much power .
DHS does not publish data on how often CBP agents stop and question people in the border zone , so it 's hard to tell if it 's happening more often under Trump . Gillibrand ’ s bill targets that lack of data and transparency .
It ’ s absolutely legal for agents to ask a person about their citizenship status , with some exceptions
The videos of Border Patrol agents questioning passengers on a bus sparked outrage partly because this kind of intrusive questioning seems like a constitutional violation . The Fourth Amendment gives Americans a certain right to privacy and protection from unreasonable government intrusions and searches .
What most Americans do n't realize is that near a US border , the bar for what is considered a `` reasonable '' stop is far lower than it is in the rest of the country . Within 100 miles of a US land or coastal border , Border Patrol and ICE agents can stop vehicles and question anyone about their immigration status , as long as they have a `` reasonable suspicion '' that the person may be in the country illegally . Anywhere else , ICE agents would need a warrant or probable cause of an immigration violation to stop a vehicle or enter private property .
Here 's the thing : Most Americans live in this so-called 100-mile zone . It covers all of Florida , most of New York state , several other states entirely — including New Jersey , Delaware , and Rhode Island — the nation 's capital , and the country 's largest cities , including New York City and Los Angeles .
CBP officers are supposed to catch unauthorized immigrants who are arriving in the country , so they can only stop people at checkpoints and patrols in this zone . ICE agents are tasked with tracking down people who are working and living illegally in the United States , so they can operate anywhere . But in the border zone , they have the same freedom as CBP agents to pull over cars and board trains to look for unauthorized immigrants .
Congress created this border zone as part of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1946 . The law granted immigration agents the authority to `` board and search for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car , aircraft , conveyance , or vehicle . '' However , they could only do this `` within a reasonable distance '' from an external US boundary .
At first , that distance was just 25 miles . But in 1953 , the Department of Justice published a rule redefining a reasonable distance to `` a distance of not exceeding 100 air miles of any boundary of the United States . '' In 2013 , a group of senators tried to shrink the 100-mile zone to 25 miles along the northern border . The provision was added to a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate that year , but a similar bill never made it through the House .
Over the years , the Supreme Court has upheld Border Patrol agents ' authority to stop and search people in the border zone , while also defining some limit to their powers . For example , the Court has ruled that agents must have probable cause to believe that someone committed an immigration violation to search their car in a border zone , but they only need a reasonable suspicion ( a lower standard of proof ) to stop and question them . If they establish a roadside checkpoint within the border zone , they can stop and question anyone who drives through about their immigration status .
The Department of Homeland Security does n't publish data on how many people agents stop and question in the border zone , only how many people they detain . In 2017 , Border Patrol agents arrested 310,531 people at checkpoints and roving patrols across the country . This includes people apprehended trying to cross the border illegally .
Details of these arrests are scarce , and immigrant rights groups have repeatedly tried to get more information through Freedom of Information Act requests .
In 2012 , Families for Freedom , a legal aide group for immigrants in New York , succeeded in suing the agency for records related to immigration arrests at bus and train stations in the state .
What they discovered was alarming : At one bus station in the Rochester area , Border Patrol agents mistakenly arrested 300 people with legal status from 2006 to 2010 .
That included immigrants with green cards and visitors with tourist visas . It also included 12 American citizens , according to a 2013 report from the group :
On March 17 , 2009 a U.S. citizen born in Texas was arrested while traveling on a Greyhound bus . A USBP agent questioned the citizen about whether he was a citizen of the United States and reported that the man “ stared ” back at him . The agent repeated the question in Spanish , at which point the man responded “ yes ” and handed over a valid Georgia driver ’ s license . Despite the man ’ s assertion of his U.S. citizenship and his offer of a valid form of identification , the man ’ s interrogation did not cease . The agent later claimed that he continued the encounter because he noticed that the man was “ shaking ” and “ avoiding eye contact , ” which , according to the agent , was the “ sort of behavior ” exhibited by “ undocumented aliens illegally present in the United States. ” Again , the agent asked the man in Spanish where he was from . The man responded that he was born in Brownsville , a prominent border city in Texas . The agent proceeded to arrest the man and brought him to the station . Later , the agent was able to use the man ’ s social security number to confirm that he was , as he stated , a U.S. citizen .
Border Patrol agents eventually released everyone who had legal status , but the practice has outraged civil liberties groups .
Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have repeatedly criticized the 100-mile zone , saying that it subjects nearly two-thirds of the US population to Border Patrol 's `` so-called investigatory detention and warrantless searches . ''
Lawmakers , it seems , have been paying attention . “ Border patrol agents have a duty to protect our borders without trampling on our constitutional rights , ” said Sen. Warren in a statement announcing the new bill . “ Without critical data to track stops and searches , Congress and the public can not fully monitor and hold agents accountable when they cross the line . ”","New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) introduced a bill Thursday to place more scrutiny on Border Patrol agents when they stop and question passengers on buses and trains.

The Department of Homeland Security Accountability and Transparency Act would require border patrol and immigration enforcement agents to document every instance when they stop, search, or interrogate people. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tom Udall (D-NM) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR). The law applies to all stops by agents who work for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Under current law, agents from both departments have broad authority to stop and question people about their immigration status. In the 100-mile border zone — the area of the US that’s within 100 miles of a land or water border — agents can pull over cars and board vehicles to ask passengers about their citizenship if they suspect a person is not in the country legally. (In the rest of the country, ICE agents can’t enter private property without a warrant or pull over vehicles without probable cause of an immigration violation.) But the law doesn’t require agents keep track of whom they stop or why, unless the agents detain someone or end up using force.

The practice of stopping people and asking them their citizenship status happens all over the border zone — in immigrant neighborhoods, on Greyhound buses or Amtrak trains, outside grocery stores.

In recent months, videos of Border Patrol agents boarding buses in New York and Florida have gone viral on social media, alarming civil rights groups and raising questions about the potential violation of a person’s constitutional rights.

Agents have vast powers to question people about their citizenship status, but there are some limits to that power. It’s illegal for agents to stop someone solely because of their race, or for no reason whatsoever. But because CBP and ICE do not keep track of their stops and searches, oversight can be a challenge.

Gillibrand’s bill seeks to bring more accountability to the process. It would require the agencies to start collecting data every time officers question someone about their immigration status when they are not at an airport or border crossing. They would need to report the time, date, and place of each stop, and the basis for questioning someone and the duration of the stop, among other details. The agents would also need to report information about permanent and temporary immigration checkpoints set up in the border zone. The information would be reported annually to Congress and made available to the public. (According to Gillibrand’s office, the bill is partly a response to this Vox article and other media reports about the Border Patrol’s practice of questioning bus and train passengers.)

“Keeping our country safe cannot come at a cost to basic human rights,” Gillibrand wrote in a statement to Vox. “When border patrol agents stop and question people in New York and in many places across the country, they aren’t keeping data about why they targeted a particular person or what happened during their encounter.”

Social media brought attention to the Border Patrol’s immense powers

There is a good chance you saw a video like this in recent months: camera-phone footage of Border Patrol agents getting on a bus or train, then walking down the aisle asking passengers, seemingly at random, if they’re American citizens.

Here’s one that went viral in January:

.@CustomsBorder got on a Greyhound bus yesterday at 4:30pm in Fort Lauderdale and asked every passenger for their papers and to prove citizenship. Proof of citizenship is NOT required to ride a bus! For more information about your rights, call our hotline 1-888-600-5762 pic.twitter.com/rWJn61o8VP — FLImmigrantCoalition (@FLImmigrant) January 20, 2018

The video, posted by the Florida Immigrant Coalition, shows CBP agents questioning a Greyhound bus passenger in Fort Lauderdale. The conversation isn't audible, but the passenger appears to hand agents some paperwork before they escort her off the bus.

A few days later, a passenger on an Amtrak train in Syracuse, New York, filmed Border Patrol agents as they asked passengers where they were born.

Both videos were viewed nearly 4 million times on Twitter, prompting thousands of angry tweets, with many blaming President Donald Trump for the hardline tactic.

These incidents have led to much confusion — and have raised a few questions about immigration and border agents’ authority and the rights people have in these encounters.

It’s important to note that these stops are not a new Trump initiative to crack down on illegal immigration. Border Patrol agents have been doing this for a while, even under the Obama administration. I know this because I watched Border Patrol agents do the same thing back in 2010. I was a crime reporter in South Florida, and I accompanied agents as they questioned passengers at a Greyhound station in the Fort Lauderdale area.

At the time, the agents said they were trying to track down undocumented immigrants heading to Florida from Mexico. But Border Patrol’s methods, coupled with growing anxiety about immigrant rights in the Trump era, have raised concerns about the legal basis for such a practice, and whether current law gives these agents too much power.

DHS does not publish data on how often CBP agents stop and question people in the border zone, so it's hard to tell if it's happening more often under Trump. Gillibrand’s bill targets that lack of data and transparency.

It’s absolutely legal for agents to ask a person about their citizenship status, with some exceptions

The videos of Border Patrol agents questioning passengers on a bus sparked outrage partly because this kind of intrusive questioning seems like a constitutional violation. The Fourth Amendment gives Americans a certain right to privacy and protection from unreasonable government intrusions and searches.

What most Americans don't realize is that near a US border, the bar for what is considered a ""reasonable"" stop is far lower than it is in the rest of the country. Within 100 miles of a US land or coastal border, Border Patrol and ICE agents can stop vehicles and question anyone about their immigration status, as long as they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person may be in the country illegally. Anywhere else, ICE agents would need a warrant or probable cause of an immigration violation to stop a vehicle or enter private property.

Here's the thing: Most Americans live in this so-called 100-mile zone. It covers all of Florida, most of New York state, several other states entirely — including New Jersey, Delaware, and Rhode Island — the nation's capital, and the country's largest cities, including New York City and Los Angeles.

CBP officers are supposed to catch unauthorized immigrants who are arriving in the country, so they can only stop people at checkpoints and patrols in this zone. ICE agents are tasked with tracking down people who are working and living illegally in the United States, so they can operate anywhere. But in the border zone, they have the same freedom as CBP agents to pull over cars and board trains to look for unauthorized immigrants.

Congress created this border zone as part of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1946. The law granted immigration agents the authority to ""board and search for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car, aircraft, conveyance, or vehicle."" However, they could only do this ""within a reasonable distance"" from an external US boundary.

At first, that distance was just 25 miles. But in 1953, the Department of Justice published a rule redefining a reasonable distance to ""a distance of not exceeding 100 air miles of any boundary of the United States."" In 2013, a group of senators tried to shrink the 100-mile zone to 25 miles along the northern border. The provision was added to a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate that year, but a similar bill never made it through the House.

Over the years, the Supreme Court has upheld Border Patrol agents' authority to stop and search people in the border zone, while also defining some limit to their powers. For example, the Court has ruled that agents must have probable cause to believe that someone committed an immigration violation to search their car in a border zone, but they only need a reasonable suspicion (a lower standard of proof) to stop and question them. If they establish a roadside checkpoint within the border zone, they can stop and question anyone who drives through about their immigration status.

It’s hard to know how often these stops happen

The Department of Homeland Security doesn't publish data on how many people agents stop and question in the border zone, only how many people they detain. In 2017, Border Patrol agents arrested 310,531 people at checkpoints and roving patrols across the country. This includes people apprehended trying to cross the border illegally.

Details of these arrests are scarce, and immigrant rights groups have repeatedly tried to get more information through Freedom of Information Act requests.

In 2012, Families for Freedom, a legal aide group for immigrants in New York, succeeded in suing the agency for records related to immigration arrests at bus and train stations in the state.

What they discovered was alarming: At one bus station in the Rochester area, Border Patrol agents mistakenly arrested 300 people with legal status from 2006 to 2010.

That included immigrants with green cards and visitors with tourist visas. It also included 12 American citizens, according to a 2013 report from the group:

On March 17, 2009 a U.S. citizen born in Texas was arrested while traveling on a Greyhound bus. A USBP agent questioned the citizen about whether he was a citizen of the United States and reported that the man “stared” back at him. The agent repeated the question in Spanish, at which point the man responded “yes” and handed over a valid Georgia driver’s license. Despite the man’s assertion of his U.S. citizenship and his offer of a valid form of identification, the man’s interrogation did not cease. The agent later claimed that he continued the encounter because he noticed that the man was “shaking” and “avoiding eye contact,” which, according to the agent, was the “sort of behavior” exhibited by “undocumented aliens illegally present in the United States.” Again, the agent asked the man in Spanish where he was from. The man responded that he was born in Brownsville, a prominent border city in Texas. The agent proceeded to arrest the man and brought him to the station. Later, the agent was able to use the man’s social security number to confirm that he was, as he stated, a U.S. citizen.

Border Patrol agents eventually released everyone who had legal status, but the practice has outraged civil liberties groups.

House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and other Republicans have said the comprehensive Senate immigration bill that couples the promise of citizenship for those living here unlawfully with increased border security is a nonstarter in the House.

There is a vocal and growing contingent of House Republicans who don't like how the GOP leadership brass is handling immigration reform. They believe that Wednesday's meeting has ""pre-cooked"" a conclusion and that the House Republican leadership is ""rushing"" a bill.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they ’ re published .
Mirza had a sense of foreboding soon after she crossed into the U.S. with her two children and their father , David . A Border Patrol agent ordered the family from Honduras and the rest of their group to divide into two lines : “ Women to one side , men to the other . ”
Mirza held 19-month-old Lia and joined the women ’ s line . David took their 6-year-old son Sebastian and lined up with the men . An agent told them not to worry , everyone was going to the same place . A bus took them in two trips to a collection of tents and trailers where they would be processed .
They arrived a few hours apart , held separately in a large waiting area . Mirza grew more anxious as she spotted David and Sebastian across the room . She motioned for Sebastian to bring her a bottle of water . “ Papi says to take care of yourself , ” he told her .
The family did not come together again . And within days , an international border stood between them .

David and Sebastian were sent to Mexico to wait before being allowed to make an asylum claim in a U.S. court . Mirza was fitted with an ankle bracelet , and she and Lia were sent to San Jose , California .
In separate Border Patrol interviews , both Mirza and David said , they told agents they had come as a family of four . But they were never recorded that way in Border Patrol records . David ’ s marital status was listed as “ single ” — he and Mirza had been together for 12 years , but they had never formally married — while Mirza ’ s was listed as “ unknown . ”
Border Patrol policy is clear : Whenever possible , parents , married or not , should be kept together with their children .
David said he pleaded with agents . “ Please , find out for me in the system where my wife is . I came with my wife and you separated me from her . ”
The agents weren ’ t moved . “ You ’ re going to Juarez , ” David said one agent told him . “ Deal with it . ”
Border Patrol has long been criticized for carelessness in migrant processing . But under the Trump administration , agents have vastly expanded powers to decide migrants ’ fates .
In previous administrations , the government ’ s options for asylum-seekers were to detain them in the U.S. or release them — and Border Patrol wasn ’ t in charge of making that choice .
The Trump administration has replaced that system , which it derisively called “ catch and release. ” In September , then-Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced that “ catch and release ” had fully ended ; Mirza and Lia were among the last Central American asylum-seekers to be allowed to stay in the U.S. without being detained by ICE .
The new strategy is what happened to David and Sebastian : Asylum-seekers are sent away from the U.S. as quickly as possible . Under a series of new programs , they can be sent to wait in Mexico , rapidly deported to their home country or sent to Guatemala to seek asylum there instead .
The results are what a lawsuit filed in December against the rapid-deportation programs calls “ legal black holes , ” where Border Patrol agents have almost complete discretion to decide who goes where .
Border Patrol agents “ are not , in general , the right people to be making determinations in individual cases , ” Scott Shuchart , a former official with the Department of Homeland Security ’ s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties , told ███ . Letting agents determine who should be sent to what country “ is an awful lot of power to be given to people who aren ’ t trained in how to use it . ”
Mirza and Sebastian , left , with David and Lia , after they were reunited . The family ’ s well-being was threatened by the four-month separation across an international border . ( Carlos Chavarría , special to ███ )
Outcomes can vary wildly even for migrants in similar situations . Parents arriving on different days have found themselves sent to different countries . One Mexican mother was rapidly deported , along with her children , while the father was detained in the U.S .
Customs and Border Protection , the agency that includes the Border Patrol , did not respond to requests to comment for this story . But a spokesperson did confirm some details of David and Mirza ’ s apprehension . The spokesperson also confirmed that their records contain no flags of suspected fraud or any other concerns ; David and Mirza were simply never labeled part of the same family . ( ███ is not publishing their family names to protect relatives still in Honduras . )
In a sense , David and Mirza ’ s family is luckier than some : They were ultimately allowed to stay and seek asylum in the U.S. , a chance migrants who ’ ve entered more recently may never get . But the family ’ s well-being was threatened by their four-month split across an international border . Furthermore , the separation set off a chain of consequences that threaten their chances of ultimately winning asylum .
By the time El Paso , Texas-based lawyer Taylor Levy saw a Facebook message from a California attorney asking her to track down David and Sebastian , David ’ s family had been apart for six weeks . Photos of Sebastian back in Honduras show a chubby , smiling boy . But when Levy met with him , she was alarmed by his condition . He was “ skin and bones , ” Levy remembered . And “ he wouldn ’ t make eye contact . He was almost catatonic . ”
“ I ’ ve worked with thousands of asylum-seeking families and hundreds of separated kids , ” Levy said . “ And he completely , completely just shocked me by how badly he was doing . ”
On its face , the case of David and Mirza baffled Levy . The family crossed the border together and had fled the same violence and threats . But the more she thought about it , the clearer it became : Their predicament reflected the unaccountable , arbitrary system the Trump administration has created .
“ This wasn ’ t just a mistake , ” Levy said . “ This was gross negligence . ”
David had hoped to make a life with Mirza in Honduras .
“ I never longed to come to the United States , God knows , ” David told ███ . They had met as teenagers after David began taking farm jobs with Mirza ’ s family , and they courted on walks to church , respecting Mirza ’ s mother ’ s wishes that they not date until Mirza finished school .
Mirza ’ s phone shows texts on WhatsApp between her and David . ( Carlos Chavarría , special to ███ )
In 2011 , they moved in together . But then David faced threats from gang members . According to his sworn asylum declaration , which was confirmed by a relative to ███ , a male ex-classmate of Mirza ’ s who was involved in a local gang made sexual advances toward David that David repeatedly rejected .
David ’ s stalker ’ s first attack left a bullet lodged near his spine . The second riddled his leg with buckshot . David said he filed a police complaint , but nothing happened . ( Honduras at the time had the highest homicide rate in the world , and 96 % of murders went unsolved . The homicide rate has declined but is still among the world ’ s highest . )
The couple went into hiding while Mirza was pregnant with Sebastian . But threatening texts kept coming to Mirza ’ s phone . One especially chilling text sent shortly before they fled Honduras promised to kill the whole family , “ from the largest hen to the smallest chick . ”
When David ’ s sister and uncle were killed not far from where David and Mirza lived , the couple sought refuge in a smaller town . David did yard work , and Mirza became pregnant again and gave birth to Lia . But they were petrified . David ’ s grandmother reported a black van casing the neighborhood , and David watched a stranger on a motorcycle driving by their house .
In January 2019 , they decided they had to leave Honduras . David called his aunt Marlen in San Jose , California , whom he hadn ’ t seen in a decade , asking her to take them in . “ I ’ d like to get out of here , ” Marlen recalled her nephew saying , “ because if I stay , very shortly , they ’ re going to kill me . ”
It took months to save 5,000 Honduran dollars for travel costs .
But as the couple planned their escape , the U.S. asylum system was changing .
David said he pleaded with Border Patrol agents : “ I came with my wife and you separated me from her. ” ( Carlos Chavarría , special to ███ )
For decades , the Border Patrol ’ s role in dealing with migrant families was to quickly pass them on to Immigration and Customs Enforcement , or ICE , which handles detention . If a migrant expressed fear of returning to their home country , they were interviewed by an asylum officer who would decide if they had a credible case . Families passing the interview — as most did — would generally be released in the U.S. to await a hearing .
But the Trump administration was determined to deter border crossings . In January 2019 , it used an obscure legal provision to force Central American migrants who sought asylum to wait in Mexico before getting hearings in the U.S. That program ( which has since expanded to other Latin American migrants ) is known as the Migrant Protection Protocols , or MPP . In the fall , the administration launched two more programs for Mexican and Central American families , giving cursory review to their asylum claims so that they could be deported within 10 days . Toward year ’ s end , the administration started sending some Honduran and Salvadoran migrants to Guatemala to seek asylum there , without offering them a chance to make a U.S. claim at all .
With each initiative , the U.S. quietly rolled out a pilot program in one region , then expanded it . Gradual expansion has allowed the government to keep these programs out of the public eye , but it hasn ’ t led it to exercise more care : There ’ s increasing evidence of haphazard planning and implementation .
Days before the Trump administration started sending Honduran and Salvadoran asylum-seekers to Guatemala , basic logistics were still unclear — such as where asylum-seekers would live . Even as the administration considers expanding rapid-deportation programs , the DHS ’ Office of Inspector General has launched an investigation into whether migrants are being treated fairly .
Under MPP , the Mexican government decides how many migrants per day it will accept from the U.S. , and U.S. officials decide who gets sent to Mexico . Regional Border Patrol and port offices are responsible for making those daily selections , and leave it up to agents .
Guidance has been minimal . A January 2019 memo to CBP employees suggested that agents not send back to Mexico unaccompanied children , people with serious health conditions and other “ vulnerable populations. ” But it stressed that border agents had full discretion . In practice , pregnant women — even those about to give birth — are routinely sent to Mexico to wait . According to advocates on both sides of the border and migrants themselves , officers in El Paso often classify LGBT migrants as “ vulnerable ” and let them stay . Officers in Brownsville , Texas , do not .
An internal DHS report from November 2019 revealed that the government hadn ’ t even developed standardized forms for MPP . In its response , DHS agreed to “ reinforce ” its existing guidance to clarify who qualified for the program . But it acknowledged that it had no standard procedures to determine selections , and it refused to commit to developing them .
Advocates argue it ’ s illegal to separate biological parents and children as a rule . “ Any time you ’ re splitting up a family , the law requires you to have a compelling reason , ” said Lee Gelernt , the ACLU lawyer leading the lawsuit which ended widespread family separations in June 2018 . But rulings address only taking children away from parents entirely , not separations like David and Mirza ’ s , which split families but keep children with at least one parent .
Taylor Levy , the lawyer who took on the family ’ s case , said when she met Sebastian during the family ’ s separation he was “ almost catatonic. ” ( Carlos Chavarría , special to ███ )
The government ’ s processing guide instructs agents not to separate “ family units with juveniles ” — parents with children — but several current CBP employees told ███ that agents commonly ignore the guideline by separating men and women for transport and in detention facilities .
According to Border Patrol sources , the mistake in David and Mirza ’ s case likely occurred when Border Patrol agents failed to note their family status on intake forms . Agents should have reflected David and Mirza ’ s accounts on the forms and checked their children ’ s birth certificates to confirm parentage .
David ’ s account echoed complaints Levy had heard while working at Annunciation House , El Paso ’ s largest migrant shelter . She said she ’ s spoken to “ thousands of people just released from Border Patrol custody . And over and over again , we hear the same things — that ( agents ) don ’ t listen to them . ”
Mirza ’ s lawyer Shouan Zhoobin Riahi , a pro bono attorney with the Bay Area nonprofit SIREN , said his clients so commonly tell him they ’ ve been threatened or accused of lying that he doesn ’ t even bother to file court complaints . Neither David nor Mirza filed a formal complaint with the Border Patrol .
When David and Mirza came to the U.S. last summer , apprehensions of Central American families were at a peak . That week , 21,678 parents and children were taken in by Border Patrol . The agency faced a capacity crisis . Inattention to paperwork was common , according to multiple officials and attorneys for migrants .
Yet the paperwork mattered more than ever . Under the old system , the Border Patrol would transfer asylum-seekers to ICE , giving them a “ second chance ” to catch mistakes , said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick , a researcher with the American Immigration Council .

The volunteer arranged for a bus ticket and Mirza carried Lia onto an intercity bus . She couldn ’ t understand the bus announcements in English .

David was likely to be deported unless Riahi could get him included in Mirza ’ s claim .
The challenge was compounded by yet another government mistake . No official had ever filed Mirza ’ s case with an immigration court . This allowed Mirza to apply for asylum proactively with an asylum officer , like migrants who enter the U.S. on visas — with slightly better chances than she would have before an immigration judge . But it meant Riahi couldn ’ t simply ask a judge to combine David ’ s case with Mirza ’ s , because the cases were on different legal tracks .
The best hope was that David could be included as a dependent on Mirza ’ s application . They ’ d have to be officially married first . So Riahi set about arranging a cross-border wedding .

For two days afterward — through another unsuccessful plea with an asylum officer to get them out of Mexico , another hielera stay and another return to Juarez — the child was inconsolable .
With the marriage now official , Mirza could file her asylum application and include David as her husband .
But in the few weeks it took to submit the application , the Trump administration imposed another twist . Attorney General William Barr issued a ruling contradicting the federal court precedent Riahi had planned to rely on in Mirza ’ s asylum case .
Until a federal judge rules on Barr ’ s edict , asylum officers now have two competing precedents — and Riahi fully expected they ’ d defer to the new Barr ruling . Mirza ’ s case had gone from an easy win to a likely protracted legal fight .
Meanwhile , David and Sebastian were still stuck in Juarez . Under the shelter ’ s rules , after two court hearings they had to find another place to stay , so David found a cramped apartment he and Sebastian could share with four other Honduran parents and sons . He couldn ’ t work regularly because he couldn ’ t abandon Sebastian . They relied on Mirza ’ s earnings cleaning houses or loans from relatives to pay rent .
After money ran low , David and Sebastian squeezed into an even smaller apartment : one room crammed with 10 other people , a few bunk beds and a fridge . ( When four of them left Juarez to cross with smugglers into the US , David and Sebastian gained a little space , but their share of rent rose to the equivalent of $ 100 US a month . ) The apartment had only six plates and six spoons , so everyone ate in shifts .

“ While he was able to brighten his affect at times , particularly when recalling his mom and younger sibling , ( Sebastian ) still feels uncertain when asked about his mom , ” the evaluation said . “ He disclosed , ‘ My mom left me and I don ’ t know why . ’ ”
Mirza , too , was distraught . She joked that while Sebastian lost weight in Mexico , she was gaining it in the U.S. She cried often and slept little . Marlen took her to a psychiatrist , who diagnosed her with depression .
In El Paso , Levy prepared a court motion to move David ’ s court case to San Francisco , which would force the government to let him stay in the U.S. She gathered up the Honduran birth certificates ; the wedding certificate ; Sebastian ’ s psychological evaluation ; a copy of Mirza ’ s antidepressant prescription .
The night before a hearing on the motion , Levy appealed directly to Border Patrol lawyers . “ To the best of our knowledge , the family unit crossed the border together and were erroneously separated by Border Patrol agents , ” she wrote in an email . “ Please act expeditiously to remedy this erroneous separation . ”
Two days later , after yet another court delay , Levy got an unexpected message from the Border Patrol . “ The father and child are at El Paso Station 1 , and are being converted out of MPP at this time. ” They had beensaved from returning to Mexico . But no further explanation was provided .
“ I don ’ t know if it ’ s because of anything that we necessarily did , ” Riahi told ███ . “ Taylor kind of moved mountains out there in El Paso , but ultimately CBP decided to do it . ”

After a five-day wait in a hielera , David and Sebastian were finally released in El Paso on Oct. 7 . They stayed at the Annunciation House shelter for a week , waiting for their next court hearing there .
But when Levy , David and Sebastian arrived in court , they faced yet another mix-up : The government had already transferred the case to San Francisco — without bothering to notify either Levy or the judge .
The next morning , David and Sebastian finally boarded an airplane — their first — to reunite with Mirza and Lia at last .

Moving David ’ s case to San Francisco essentially froze his asylum timeline , making it impossible for him to get a work permit . His first hearing in front of a San Francisco judge is set for early March .
The family had to move out of Marlen ’ s house ; the garage Marlen had furnished as their bedroom wasn ’ t big enough to contain Lia ’ s boundless energy , and Marlen ’ s husband and teenage daughter had lost patience with the visitors . Mirza now worries how long they can afford their own apartment .
Some things have improved . With each passing month , Sebastian gets more comfortable in first grade — he ’ s made friends who help him with his homework now — and Lia gets more rambunctious .
But it ’ s far from clear that the family will be able to stay in the U.S. Their cases are still on two separate tracks .
Mirza ’ s asylum application remains in limbo . A December interview date was rescheduled , then postponed indefinitely . The attorney general ’ s ruling makes it more likely her claim will be denied . Their lawyers are prepared to appeal both cases if they lose , but appeals take years .
Mirza is certain they ’ ll be killed if they return to Honduras , but they intend to leave if ordered to do so . As Mirza told ███ , “ We have to follow the law . ”

Mirza had a sense of foreboding soon after she crossed into the U.S. with her two children and their father, David. A Border Patrol agent ordered the family from Honduras and the rest of their group to divide into two lines: “Women to one side, men to the other.”

Mirza held 19-month-old Lia and joined the women’s line. David took their 6-year-old son Sebastian and lined up with the men. An agent told them not to worry, everyone was going to the same place. A bus took them in two trips to a collection of tents and trailers where they would be processed.

They arrived a few hours apart, held separately in a large waiting area. Mirza grew more anxious as she spotted David and Sebastian across the room. She motioned for Sebastian to bring her a bottle of water. “Papi says to take care of yourself,” he told her.

The family did not come together again. And within days, an international border stood between them.

David and Sebastian were sent to Mexico to wait before being allowed to make an asylum claim in a U.S. court. Mirza was fitted with an ankle bracelet, and she and Lia were sent to San Jose, California.

In separate Border Patrol interviews, both Mirza and David said, they told agents they had come as a family of four. But they were never recorded that way in Border Patrol records. David’s marital status was listed as “single” — he and Mirza had been together for 12 years, but they had never formally married — while Mirza’s was listed as “unknown.”

Border Patrol policy is clear: Whenever possible, parents, married or not, should be kept together with their children.

David said he pleaded with agents. “Please, find out for me in the system where my wife is. I came with my wife and you separated me from her.”

The agents weren’t moved. “You’re going to Juarez,” David said one agent told him. “Deal with it.”

Border Patrol has long been criticized for carelessness in migrant processing. But under the Trump administration, agents have vastly expanded powers to decide migrants’ fates.

In previous administrations, the government’s options for asylum-seekers were to detain them in the U.S. or release them — and Border Patrol wasn’t in charge of making that choice.

The Trump administration has replaced that system, which it derisively called “catch and release.” In September, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced that “catch and release” had fully ended; Mirza and Lia were among the last Central American asylum-seekers to be allowed to stay in the U.S. without being detained by ICE.

The new strategy is what happened to David and Sebastian: Asylum-seekers are sent away from the U.S. as quickly as possible. Under a series of new programs, they can be sent to wait in Mexico, rapidly deported to their home country or sent to Guatemala to seek asylum there instead.

The results are what a lawsuit filed in December against the rapid-deportation programs calls “legal black holes,” where Border Patrol agents have almost complete discretion to decide who goes where.

Border Patrol agents “are not, in general, the right people to be making determinations in individual cases,” Scott Shuchart, a former official with the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told ProPublica. Letting agents determine who should be sent to what country “is an awful lot of power to be given to people who aren’t trained in how to use it.”

Outcomes can vary wildly even for migrants in similar situations. Parents arriving on different days have found themselves sent to different countries. One Mexican mother was rapidly deported, along with her children, while the father was detained in the U.S.

Customs and Border Protection, the agency that includes the Border Patrol, did not respond to requests to comment for this story. But a spokesperson did confirm some details of David and Mirza’s apprehension. The spokesperson also confirmed that their records contain no flags of suspected fraud or any other concerns; David and Mirza were simply never labeled part of the same family. (ProPublica is not publishing their family names to protect relatives still in Honduras.)

In a sense, David and Mirza’s family is luckier than some: They were ultimately allowed to stay and seek asylum in the U.S., a chance migrants who’ve entered more recently may never get. But the family’s well-being was threatened by their four-month split across an international border. Furthermore, the separation set off a chain of consequences that threaten their chances of ultimately winning asylum.

By the time El Paso, Texas-based lawyer Taylor Levy saw a Facebook message from a California attorney asking her to track down David and Sebastian, David’s family had been apart for six weeks. Photos of Sebastian back in Honduras show a chubby, smiling boy. But when Levy met with him, she was alarmed by his condition. He was “skin and bones,” Levy remembered. And “he wouldn’t make eye contact. He was almost catatonic.”

“I’ve worked with thousands of asylum-seeking families and hundreds of separated kids,” Levy said. “And he completely, completely just shocked me by how badly he was doing.”

On its face, the case of David and Mirza baffled Levy. The family crossed the border together and had fled the same violence and threats. But the more she thought about it, the clearer it became: Their predicament reflected the unaccountable, arbitrary system the Trump administration has created.

“This wasn’t just a mistake,” Levy said. “This was gross negligence.”

David had hoped to make a life with Mirza in Honduras.

“I never longed to come to the United States, God knows,” David told ProPublica. They had met as teenagers after David began taking farm jobs with Mirza’s family, and they courted on walks to church, respecting Mirza’s mother’s wishes that they not date until Mirza finished school.

Mirza’s phone shows texts on WhatsApp between her and David. (Carlos Chavarría, special to ProPublica)

In 2011, they moved in together. But then David faced threats from gang members. According to his sworn asylum declaration, which was confirmed by a relative to ProPublica, a male ex-classmate of Mirza’s who was involved in a local gang made sexual advances toward David that David repeatedly rejected.

David’s stalker’s first attack left a bullet lodged near his spine. The second riddled his leg with buckshot. David said he filed a police complaint, but nothing happened. (Honduras at the time had the highest homicide rate in the world, and 96% of murders went unsolved. The homicide rate has declined but is still among the world’s highest.)

The couple went into hiding while Mirza was pregnant with Sebastian. But threatening texts kept coming to Mirza’s phone. One especially chilling text sent shortly before they fled Honduras promised to kill the whole family, “from the largest hen to the smallest chick.”

When David’s sister and uncle were killed not far from where David and Mirza lived, the couple sought refuge in a smaller town. David did yard work, and Mirza became pregnant again and gave birth to Lia. But they were petrified. David’s grandmother reported a black van casing the neighborhood, and David watched a stranger on a motorcycle driving by their house.

In January 2019, they decided they had to leave Honduras. David called his aunt Marlen in San Jose, California, whom he hadn’t seen in a decade, asking her to take them in. “I’d like to get out of here,” Marlen recalled her nephew saying, “because if I stay, very shortly, they’re going to kill me.”

It took months to save 5,000 Honduran dollars for travel costs.

But as the couple planned their escape, the U.S. asylum system was changing.

David said he pleaded with Border Patrol agents: “I came with my wife and you separated me from her.” (Carlos Chavarría, special to ProPublica)

For decades, the Border Patrol’s role in dealing with migrant families was to quickly pass them on to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which handles detention. If a migrant expressed fear of returning to their home country, they were interviewed by an asylum officer who would decide if they had a credible case. Families passing the interview — as most did — would generally be released in the U.S. to await a hearing.

But the Trump administration was determined to deter border crossings. In January 2019, it used an obscure legal provision to force Central American migrants who sought asylum to wait in Mexico before getting hearings in the U.S. That program (which has since expanded to other Latin American migrants) is known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP. In the fall, the administration launched two more programs for Mexican and Central American families, giving cursory review to their asylum claims so that they could be deported within 10 days. Toward year’s end, the administration started sending some Honduran and Salvadoran migrants to Guatemala to seek asylum there, without offering them a chance to make a U.S. claim at all.

With each initiative, the U.S. quietly rolled out a pilot program in one region, then expanded it. Gradual expansion has allowed the government to keep these programs out of the public eye, but it hasn’t led it to exercise more care: There’s increasing evidence of haphazard planning and implementation.

Days before the Trump administration started sending Honduran and Salvadoran asylum-seekers to Guatemala, basic logistics were still unclear — such as where asylum-seekers would live. Even as the administration considers expanding rapid-deportation programs, the DHS’ Office of Inspector General has launched an investigation into whether migrants are being treated fairly.

Under MPP, the Mexican government decides how many migrants per day it will accept from the U.S., and U.S. officials decide who gets sent to Mexico. Regional Border Patrol and port offices are responsible for making those daily selections, and leave it up to agents.

Guidance has been minimal. A January 2019 memo to CBP employees suggested that agents not send back to Mexico unaccompanied children, people with serious health conditions and other “vulnerable populations.” But it stressed that border agents had full discretion. In practice, pregnant women — even those about to give birth — are routinely sent to Mexico to wait. According to advocates on both sides of the border and migrants themselves, officers in El Paso often classify LGBT migrants as “vulnerable” and let them stay. Officers in Brownsville, Texas, do not.

An internal DHS report from November 2019 revealed that the government hadn’t even developed standardized forms for MPP. In its response, DHS agreed to “reinforce” its existing guidance to clarify who qualified for the program. But it acknowledged that it had no standard procedures to determine selections, and it refused to commit to developing them.

Advocates argue it’s illegal to separate biological parents and children as a rule. “Any time you’re splitting up a family, the law requires you to have a compelling reason,” said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU lawyer leading the lawsuit which ended widespread family separations in June 2018. But rulings address only taking children away from parents entirely, not separations like David and Mirza’s, which split families but keep children with at least one parent.

Taylor Levy, the lawyer who took on the family’s case, said when she met Sebastian during the family’s separation he was “almost catatonic.” (Carlos Chavarría, special to ProPublica)

The government’s processing guide instructs agents not to separate “family units with juveniles” — parents with children — but several current CBP employees told ProPublica that agents commonly ignore the guideline by separating men and women for transport and in detention facilities.

According to Border Patrol sources, the mistake in David and Mirza’s case likely occurred when Border Patrol agents failed to note their family status on intake forms. Agents should have reflected David and Mirza’s accounts on the forms and checked their children’s birth certificates to confirm parentage.

David’s account echoed complaints Levy had heard while working at Annunciation House, El Paso’s largest migrant shelter. She said she’s spoken to “thousands of people just released from Border Patrol custody. And over and over again, we hear the same things — that (agents) don’t listen to them.”

Mirza’s lawyer Shouan Zhoobin Riahi, a pro bono attorney with the Bay Area nonprofit SIREN, said his clients so commonly tell him they’ve been threatened or accused of lying that he doesn’t even bother to file court complaints. Neither David nor Mirza filed a formal complaint with the Border Patrol.

When David and Mirza came to the U.S. last summer, apprehensions of Central American families were at a peak. That week, 21,678 parents and children were taken in by Border Patrol. The agency faced a capacity crisis. Inattention to paperwork was common, according to multiple officials and attorneys for migrants.

Yet the paperwork mattered more than ever. Under the old system, the Border Patrol would transfer asylum-seekers to ICE, giving them a “second chance” to catch mistakes, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a researcher with the American Immigration Council. Initial asylum interviews offered a third chance: Asylum officers had the power to unite families who’d been carelessly separated.

Under the new dispersal strategy — which has continued to expand even after intake numbers dropped — migrants only come into contact with one government agency: the Border Patrol.

The day after David and Sebastian were sent to Juarez, Mirza and Lia were shuffled onto a bus out of the Border Patrol facility and dropped at an El Paso shelter. A volunteer asked Mirza for a U.S. contact. She named David’s aunt Marlen, whom she had never met.

The volunteer arranged for a bus ticket and Mirza carried Lia onto an intercity bus. She couldn’t understand the bus announcements in English. When they arrived in San Jose, she worried that she’d exited at the wrong stop. Marlen was late, stopping at a store to buy a car seat for Lia. By the time she arrived, Mirza sat on a bench sobbing.

Mirza had been told to call a government hotline to learn about the status of her asylum case, but the hotline didn’t give her information. She realized she needed help. She walked into the offices of SIREN, which offered legal services, and spilled out her story to pro bono attorney Riahi.

Riahi sensed that Mirza could win asylum. The federal court that set precedent for San Francisco’s immigration judges and asylum officers had defined asylum eligibility broadly, and Mirza’s case, which would be considered there, fit well within a long-standing precedent. Meanwhile, David’s case had been assigned to a judge in Texas who rejected almost all asylum claims.

David was likely to be deported unless Riahi could get him included in Mirza’s claim.

The challenge was compounded by yet another government mistake. No official had ever filed Mirza’s case with an immigration court. This allowed Mirza to apply for asylum proactively with an asylum officer, like migrants who enter the U.S. on visas — with slightly better chances than she would have before an immigration judge. But it meant Riahi couldn’t simply ask a judge to combine David’s case with Mirza’s, because the cases were on different legal tracks.

The best hope was that David could be included as a dependent on Mirza’s application. They’d have to be officially married first. So Riahi set about arranging a cross-border wedding.

Riahi, overburdened with pro bono clients, didn’t have time to go to Juarez. So he sent Levy a Facebook message. He didn’t know the veteran Texas lawyer, although he had seen Levy’s posts about problems with the MPP program.

Levy was hesitant to take on another request from a far-flung lawyer. Riahi “was really, really worried and he really cared,” she told ProPublica. “To be honest, it gets kind of exhausting, because everyone’s really worried and everyone really cares.” She decided to at least meet David and Sebastian in Juarez.

David and Sebastian’s world had become claustrophobically small. Leaving the shelter could mean getting mugged or kidnapped. With the exception of their first court hearing in El Paso — for which they’d traversed Juarez in the dead of night to reach the international bridge by 4:30 a.m. — they’d barely ventured out.

Sebastian had contracted a throat infection just before their first court date, and it worsened when the two spent another night in the CBP hielera (the holding cells called “iceboxes” because they’re kept so cold) before returning to Juarez. But the weight loss continued even after he recovered, leading David to suspect the boy was acutely depressed. For nearly three weeks, he rejected solid food. “It was just juice, juice, juice,” David said.

Speaking to Mirza on David’s clandestine cellphone (purchased against shelter policies) didn’t help. Sebastian lashed out at her: David and Mirza both recall him saying, “You’re a bad person, Mami. You left us here in Mexico.” Sometimes, he was so angry that he would not talk to her at all.

When Levy took on his case, David felt lucky. According to one analysis, 96% of migrants waiting in Mexico for their U.S. cases have no legal representation. But Levy warned him that if he remained on his judge’s docket, deportation was almost certain.

The only clear way to get removed from the MPP program was to persuade an asylum officer that David would be persecuted in Mexico — a very high bar he had already tried and failed to meet. Levy realized this family couldn’t rely on the process to bring them together. David and Mirza — and Levy and Riahi — would have to fight for it.

Riahi had originally planned to bring Mirza to the U.S. side of the border in New Mexico, bring David to the Mexican side and have them stand in their respective countries while a pastor offered the vows. But they couldn’t get a New Mexican marriage certificate unless both spouses appeared at the county office — an impossibility for David.

Instead, Riahi and Levy planned a sort of caper: they’d turn David’s next U.S. court hearing in El Paso, on Aug. 21, into a secret wedding.

Mirza flew to El Paso, carrying a wedding dress that she’d bought at Ross with lace sleeves and a layered skirt, her ankle monitor a telling accessory.

Levy took a single picture of the bride — cameras aren’t allowed in immigration courtrooms, and they didn’t want to push their luck — then entered the courtroom with Mirza and a Texas municipal judge to sign the marriage certificate.

When Sebastian saw his mother, he cried out, “Mami, Mami.” He fell asleep in her lap while the immigration judge conducted a brief scheduling hearing.

Afterward, Levy requested five minutes to confer with her clients in a side room, where the municipal judge hurriedly performed the ceremony. Then David told Sebastian, “Your Mami has to go now.” “No, I’m going with her,” Sebastian cried.

For two days afterward — through another unsuccessful plea with an asylum officer to get them out of Mexico, another hielera stay and another return to Juarez — the child was inconsolable.

With the marriage now official, Mirza could file her asylum application and include David as her husband.

But in the few weeks it took to submit the application, the Trump administration imposed another twist. Attorney General William Barr issued a ruling contradicting the federal court precedent Riahi had planned to rely on in Mirza’s asylum case.

Until a federal judge rules on Barr’s edict, asylum officers now have two competing precedents — and Riahi fully expected they’d defer to the new Barr ruling. Mirza’s case had gone from an easy win to a likely protracted legal fight.

Meanwhile, David and Sebastian were still stuck in Juarez. Under the shelter’s rules, after two court hearings they had to find another place to stay, so David found a cramped apartment he and Sebastian could share with four other Honduran parents and sons. He couldn’t work regularly because he couldn’t abandon Sebastian. They relied on Mirza’s earnings cleaning houses or loans from relatives to pay rent.

After money ran low, David and Sebastian squeezed into an even smaller apartment: one room crammed with 10 other people, a few bunk beds and a fridge. (When four of them left Juarez to cross with smugglers into the US, David and Sebastian gained a little space, but their share of rent rose to the equivalent of $100 US a month.) The apartment had only six plates and six spoons, so everyone ate in shifts. Playing “outside” meant playing ball in a hallway littered with rubble and broken glass.

Sebastian was beginning to put on weight and gain energy, but he was still shy around other children. When spoken to, he would either stay silent or cry. In mid-September, Levy brought in a counselor to assess Sebastian.

“While he was able to brighten his affect at times, particularly when recalling his mom and younger sibling, (Sebastian) still feels uncertain when asked about his mom,” the evaluation said. “He disclosed, ‘My mom left me and I don’t know why.’”

Mirza, too, was distraught. She joked that while Sebastian lost weight in Mexico, she was gaining it in the U.S. She cried often and slept little. Marlen took her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her with depression.

In El Paso, Levy prepared a court motion to move David’s court case to San Francisco, which would force the government to let him stay in the U.S. She gathered up the Honduran birth certificates; the wedding certificate; Sebastian’s psychological evaluation; a copy of Mirza’s antidepressant prescription.

The night before a hearing on the motion, Levy appealed directly to Border Patrol lawyers. “To the best of our knowledge, the family unit crossed the border together and were erroneously separated by Border Patrol agents,” she wrote in an email. “Please act expeditiously to remedy this erroneous separation.”

Two days later, after yet another court delay, Levy got an unexpected message from the Border Patrol. “The father and child are at El Paso Station 1, and are being converted out of MPP at this time.” They had beensaved from returning to Mexico. But no further explanation was provided.

“I don’t know if it’s because of anything that we necessarily did,” Riahi told ProPublica. “Taylor kind of moved mountains out there in El Paso, but ultimately CBP decided to do it.”

David and Sebastian didn’t fit into any of the categories outlined in the vague CBP policy about who should be sent back to Mexico and who should not. Discretion simply happened to work in their favor this time.

But for families caught in the new programs — which don’t include appearances before an immigration judge — the Border Patrol’s initial determination and any errors that come with it are, as far as anyone can tell, permanent. “If a Honduran parent is separated from their child in error and then sent to Guatemala,” Levy asked, “how is anyone supposed to access that parent?”

After a five-day wait in a hielera, David and Sebastian were finally released in El Paso on Oct. 7. They stayed at the Annunciation House shelter for a week, waiting for their next court hearing there.

But when Levy, David and Sebastian arrived in court, they faced yet another mix-up: The government had already transferred the case to San Francisco — without bothering to notify either Levy or the judge.

The next morning, David and Sebastian finally boarded an airplane — their first — to reunite with Mirza and Lia at last.

Moving David’s case to San Francisco essentially froze his asylum timeline, making it impossible for him to get a work permit. His first hearing in front of a San Francisco judge is set for early March.

The family had to move out of Marlen’s house; the garage Marlen had furnished as their bedroom wasn’t big enough to contain Lia’s boundless energy, and Marlen’s husband and teenage daughter had lost patience with the visitors. Mirza now worries how long they can afford their own apartment.

Some things have improved. With each passing month, Sebastian gets more comfortable in first grade — he’s made friends who help him with his homework now — and Lia gets more rambunctious.

But it’s far from clear that the family will be able to stay in the U.S. Their cases are still on two separate tracks.

Mirza’s asylum application remains in limbo. A December interview date was rescheduled, then postponed indefinitely. The attorney general’s ruling makes it more likely her claim will be denied. Their lawyers are prepared to appeal both cases if they lose, but appeals take years.

Mirza is certain they’ll be killed if they return to Honduras, but they intend to leave if ordered to do so. As Mirza told ProPublica, “We have to follow the law.”

However uncertain the future, the family remains together. That was what they celebrated that afternoon in October, when David and Sebastian arrived at Marlen’s home from the airport, with David holding their release orders and Sebastian carrying a toy light saber he’d had to sneak past TSA.

As the boy approached Marlen’s door, Mirza stood in the doorway. He paused for a second, then ran to her. Lia sprinted into David’s arms.

They posed for family pictures, and more than once, they had to look for Sebastian, who wandered off on his own.

Once he was safely deposited on Mirza’s lap, though, he wouldn’t let go.",www.propublica.org,center,uQyUI8oYqpI8mk2c

Hundreds of Central American migrants travelling through Mexico to seek asylum in the US have reached the Mexican border city of Tijuana.

The group of 400, which includes LGBTQ migrants, broke away from the larger caravan of 5,000 people in Mexico City.

US Defence Secretary James Mattis said he would go to the US-Mexico border on Wednesday, his first visit since thousands of troops were deployed.

Larger groups are expected to arrive at the border in the coming days.

What's the latest?

The 5,000 migrants, who say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, have largely been making their journey on foot.

They joined a smaller group of about 80 migrants who reached the border city on Sunday.

Many of the smaller group are LGBTQ, media reported, who say they parted ways with the main caravan after weeks of what they call discriminatory treatment by local residents and fellow travellers.

Undeterred by a harder US stance against them, the migrants have said they will continue the journey so that they can claim asylum.

The journey began from the city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras on 13 October - about 4,350km (2,700 miles) away from Tijuana.

Because the route poses a host of dangers, such as attack by criminal gangs, many of the migrants say they feel safer travelling in numbers.

Most previous migrant caravans have numbered a few hundred people, but after a former politician shared news of the planned caravan on Facebook, news of it quickly spread.

More than 1,000 Hondurans were the first to leave, and thousands more people have joined them from neighbouring Guatemala and then Mexico.

What is the US doing about it?

President Donald Trump, who has taken a firm stance against the caravan he calls an ""invasion"", has order the deployment of up to 9,000 troops to the border.

US authorities closed down several lanes of traffic at two border crossings from Tijuana to California on Tuesday so that soldiers can install barbed wire fencing and barricades to reinforce security.

Eight more had serious criminal records , including murder and kidnapping charges , that made them unfit to take back their own children , the government said Tuesday .
Those were among the tougher cases the government has had to sort through as it rushed to make a judge ’ s deadline for reuniting the youngest of the children separated in the aftermath of President Trump ’ s zero-tolerance border policy .
Federal officials signaled Tuesday that they were scrapping the policy for dozens of families , preparing to release them rather than detain them , as the president had promised .
Yet even with that retreat , the government was still struggling to meet the deadline imposed by Judge Dana Sabraw .
Just 38 of the original 102 separated children under age 5 were guaranteed to be reunited by Tuesday , officials said . Another 16 were on the bubble for reunification , the government said , saying it depended on whether they were able to finish out a series of checks to make sure the children weren ’ t heading to unsafe conditions .
Judge Sabraw told them to speed it up , saying they could cut corners on their usual process in order to get the kids back with people who claimed to be their parents .
“ These are firm deadlines . They ’ re not aspirational goals , ” the judge said during a hearing Tuesday to get an update on progress .
Judge Sabraw ruled last month that separating families violated illegal immigrant parents ’ rights .

Sixteen children were awaiting final DNA tests on people who ’ d cleared background checks but still needed to have their relationship confirmed , while one other parent had a criminal background check that was still being resolved .
Another 12 children belonged to parents who ’ d already been deported , and the government was unsure how to handle those — other than to try to reach them in their home countries . And eight parents had been released into the U.S. , and needed full safety checks , the government said .
In the final 27 cases , officials say , they ’ ve ruled out reunification , at least for now .
Ten parents are serving time in federal or state jails or prisons and can ’ t be reunited until their sentences are done . One child ’ s parent has been missing for more than a year — and it ’ s possible both the child and parent are American citizens .
Eight parents had major criminal records that made them unsuitable candidates to take custody of their children , one parent was deemed a danger for child abuse , one parent lived in a home where another occupant had a child sex-abuse charge pending , and another parent has a communicable disease that must be cleared up .
Then there are five of the 102 cases where adults had claimed to be parents , but those claims were disproved once the government started to investigate by DNA tests .
Officials said those cases are evidence for why the government needs to do extensive vetting before turning children over .
“ Our process may not be as quick as some would like but there is no question it is protecting children , ” said Chris Meekins , a high-ranking official at the Health and Human Services Department .
In some of the toughest cases , Mr. Meekins said , they have found two instances of men who assert parentage but DNA tests come back negative .
He said it ’ s possible the men don ’ t know they aren ’ t the biological fathers . In those cases , if the adults are proved to be parents through other means such as birth certificates , they ’ ll bury the DNA results , saying it ’ s not their role to interfere in whatever the family situation is .
Judge Sabraw , though , was not impressed with the government ’ s lengthy checks .
He ordered a “ streamlined approach ” for vetting parents , saying DNA tests should only be used if there ’ s a specific reason to suspect fraud .
“ The court could not have been clearer that business as usual is not acceptable , ” said Lee Gelernt , a lawyer handling the case for the families on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union . “ The Trump administration must get these children and parents reunited . ”
In pushing to meet the deadlines the government signaled it ’ s ended the zero tolerance policy of holding illegal immigrants until they can be deported , at least in these cases .

It was delayed further after a conference meeting Thursday evening, when leadership said it would be postponed to the following week.



House Majority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseScalise defends Trump Ukraine call: 'I'm glad President Trump continues to look into [Russian] interference' Sunday shows lineup: Trump impeachment dominates the talk circuit Trump lashes out at 'Do Nothing Democrat Savages' MORE said he remains confident that Trump would sign the bill if it makes it through both chambers. The Louisiana Republican said he believes Trump is committed to fixing the issue, but that the president is frustrated with the lack of Democratic support on Republican-backed measures.



""We want to solve this problem and President Trump wants to solve this problem,"" Scalise said. ""I think what he's doing in these tweets is expressing his frustration that Democrats are unwilling to work with anybody to actually vote for a legislative solution.""



Scalise's comments come a day after a conservative-backed immigration bill failed in a 193-231 vote.



Democrats say Republican leaders haven't made an effort to bring up bipartisan legislation that could potentially make it to the president's desk, while McCarthy said Democrats were only open to supporting the discharge petition introduced by moderate Republicans, which would have forced votes on four immigration proposals.

""Not everybody gets what they want, because in that bill there won't be everything that I want,"" McCarthy said Friday on the House floor. ""Not one person in this room will get everything they want. Will America be safer? Will America be better in the future? And will we have a system that works? The answer will be yes.""",www.thehill.com,center,XssDNRiCrnhutjoq

Marco Rubio has been the junior senator from Florida for barely two years, but he's already considered a likely 2016 presidential contender.

The 41-year-old Republican's political star rose still higher this week when he joined a bipartisan group of senators offering a path to citizenship to millions of unauthorized immigrants.

It's the latest in a series of shifts on immigration by Rubio, the Miami-born son of Cuban exiles who ran for Senate in 2010 as a Tea Party-backed conservative, rejecting a so-called earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which at the time he called ""code for amnesty.""

But Rubio is no longer calling it amnesty.

""This allows people the access to make their status at this moment legal, if they meet certain benchmarks.

WASHINGTON — House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte has a message for advocates who calculate that rolling up a big margin of victory in the Senate will provide momentum to push an immigration overhaul through the House.

Arizona county Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his attorney Larry Klayman argued before U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington , D.C. , in the first courtroom hearing for a case against the immigration actions .
`` We have serious issues of constitutionality involved , '' attorney Larry Klayman told reporters , after the hearing .
Howell , during the hearing , seemed skeptical of the lawsuit brought by Arpaio , the Maricopa County sheriff known for his tough approach to illegal immigration .
Howell repeatedly questioned whether Arpaio has legal standing to challenge Obama 's action . She told Klayman that Congress is in a better position to question the president 's authority rather than a federal court .
A lawyer for the Obama administration called Arpaio 's case a `` political dispute '' that should be dismissed . Howell , an Obama nominee , said she would issue a ruling soon .

Their case is separate from one filed by two-dozen states against Obama 's immigration actions -- and separate from one in which a federal judge last week declared Obama 's immigration plans `` unconstitutional . '' The latter opinion , though , stemmed from an unrelated immigration case ; Monday 's hearing is the first to consider a direct challenge to Obama 's orders .
Klayman and Arpaio say the president violated the Constitution by doing an end-run around Congress and say drastic changes in immigration programs should be stopped .
`` President Obama and others recite that the immigration system of the United States is broken , '' Klayman wrote in a court filing . `` It is unmistakable that the only thing that is broken about the nation 's immigration laws is that the defendants are determined to break those laws . ''
Klayman is a conservative who has previously targeted the president , alleging that Obama falsely claimed U.S. citizenship . In October , Klayman petitioned the Homeland Security Department to start deportation proceedings against Obama .
Under the immigration program , the Homeland Security Department would prioritize the removal of immigrants who present threats to national security , public safety or border security .
DHS officials could deport someone if an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director determined that removing the person would serve an important federal interest .
In the lawsuit , Klayman and Arpaio portray the administration 's policy change as a way for more people to enter the country illegally and commit crimes , adding to the burden of law enforcement .
`` This theory is speculative and unsubstantiated , '' the Justice Department argued in its own court filing . Obama 's program places greater emphasis on removing criminal aliens and recent border crossers , the government countered .
Among the evidence in the case is a set of Arpaio press releases and letters to Homeland Security officials that say more than 35 percent of immigrants living in Maricopa County illegally who wound up in Arpaio 's jails in 2014 were repeat offenders , signifying in the sheriff 's view that DHS has done a poor job of deporting criminals .

Marco Rubio dismissed arguments Sunday that the Senate immigration bill offers amnesty for illegal immigrants and said border security is not the only key issue -- amid scrutiny from some fellow conservatives and the union that represents immigration enforcement agents .
Rubio told “ ███ Sunday ” that anybody living illegally in the United States and attempting to get a visa would face a long list of qualifications , which includes paying taxes , a fine and an application fee as well as having a job and waiting for at least 10 years .
“ That is not amnesty , ” said Rubio , a Cuban-American considered a key member of the so-called bipartisan Gang of Eight . “ Amnesty is the forgiveness of something . ”
The Senate group has been working on comprehensive immigration reform since January and is expected to release the legislation Tuesday , ahead of a hearing later this week in the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Rubio also argued Sunday that achieving citizenship through the new plan would be harder than under the existing plan .
“ It will be cheaper , faster and easier for people to go back home and wait 10 years than it will be to go through this process that I 've outlined , ” Rubio told Fox .
The Rubio-backed plan faces increasing scrutiny from such fellow Republican senators as Ted Cruz , of Texas , and Alabama 's Jeff Sessions , as well as the National ICE Council , the union representing thousands of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees .
“ I know Sen. Rubio 's heart is exactly right , '' Sessions told ABC ’ s “ This Week. ” `` And I really respect the work of the Gang of Eight . But they have produced legislation ... that will give amnesty now , legalize everyone that 's here effectively today . And then there 's a promise of enforcement in the future . ''
Union President Chris Crane said Friday an outline of the legislation shows legalization before border enforcement , which means Rubio has not followed through on his “ commitment to the American people ” and that he should leave the bipartisan group .
Rubio also said Sunday that tracking illegal immigrants in and out of the U.S. and improving the employee-verification system , known as E-Verify , are equally important .
“ All three work together , ” he told Fox . “ All three have to happen . ”
Though Rubio made clear that securing the border is only part of the plan , he said a 90 percent border-apprehension rate within the next five years is a “ trigger ” for permanent residence .
“ The Department of Homeland Security will have five years to meet that goal , ” said Rubio , who appeared on all five major Sunday talk shows to garner support for the legislation .
He was also booked on the Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision
If the agency fails to meet apprehension and surveillance goals , a commission , which includes officials from states along the U.S.-Mexico border , would intervene .
There are roughly 11 million illegal immigrants now living in the U.S .
The proposal is available only for those who arrived in the U.S. before Dec. 31 , 2011 . Anyone who came after that date would be subject to deportation .
As a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate , Rubio will be careful not to appear weak on border security or create political problems among the conservatives who have great sway in picking the party nominee .
Other lawmakers helping to write the legislation acknowledged the political challenges of the issue .
`` A lot of my conservative colleagues have significant questions , and they 're legitimate , '' Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz , said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` This is the start of a process . ”
Sessions and others are also concerned about the legislation ’ s long-term impact on taxpayers once illegal immigrants become eligible for major entitlements and low-income assistance programs .
“ Please list all federal benefits and aid programs former illegal immigrants become eligible for once granted green cards or permanent residency , ” Sessions , along with fellow Republican Sens . Pat Roberts and Chuck Grassley , said in an April 10 letter to the eight senators .
The measure to put millions on a path to citizenship also would allow tens of thousands of new high- and low-skilled workers into the country with new visa programs .
The legislation also is expected to include a new emphasis on merit-based immigration over family ties .
`` This is a very balanced bill , '' New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer told ABC . “ The American people have told us to do two things : one , prevent future flows of illegal immigration .

Mr. Trump took to Twitter late Saturday to say part of the reason he offered to protect 1.8 million Dreamers — nearly three times the number protected from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals amnesty — was to try to make Democrats feel the heat .
“ I have offered DACA a wonderful deal , including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship , for two reasons : ( 1 ) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem . ( 2 ) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA , only use it ! ” Mr. Trump said .
“ Democrats are not interested in Border Safety & Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military . They are only interested in Obstruction ! ” he added .
His plan would couple the amnesty for Dreamers with a $ 25 billion request for wall funding , limiting family sponsorship of migration to spouses and minor children , eliminating the Diversity Visa Lottery that gives away immigration passes based on chance , and a number of policy changes to stop abuse of the asylum system and speed deportations of illegal immigrants .
Republicans said that plan could be the basis of talks but they are eager to entice Democrats to deal .
“ I think whatever we do is not going to pass with one party or the other , ” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , California Republican , said on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press. ” “ If you want to solve this and not be at this in another five or 10 years , you want to do it correctly and I think that bill has a lot of merit to solving the problem . ”
Sen. Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican who proposed a plan this month that would have protected 3 million illegal immigrants , said Mr. Trump ’ s proposal for 1.8 million Dreamers is a “ credible offer . ”
But he said the president was asking for too much on the chain migration side .
“ We ’ re going to get there . We ’ re going to give a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers who have been well-vetted . We ’ re going to do something substantial on the border . We ’ re not going to cut legal immigration in half , ” he said on ABC ’ s “ This Week ” program . “ We ’ ll deal with chain migration in two phases , beginning in phase one . ”
He also urged Democrats to “ calm down ” after several days of over-the-top vitriol that included accusations of racism and xenophobia lobbed at the president .
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , has said the proposal is part of Mr. Trump ’ s plan to “ make America white again , ” and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , said Mr. Trump was using the Dreamers as a tool to fulfill a wish list for immigration hard-liners .
Sen. Bernard Sanders , Vermont independent , said Sunday that he has serious concerns about some parts of the president ’ s proposal and that the focus should be on ensuring legal status and a path to citizenship for Dreamers .
“ Where the bad part comes is the idea of a wall , which I thought was a great idea in the 15th century when China built the Great Wall . Not so smart today when we have technology that is much more effective , ” Mr. Sanders said on CBS ’ s “ Face the Nation . ”
“ I think you ’ re going to see a lot of debate about how much money we should spend on border security , ” he said .
Rep. Will Hurd , Texas Republican , and Rep. Pete Aguilar , California Democrat , said Mr. Trump was too ambitious and that the better solution is a narrow bill that protects Dreamers but doesn ’ t do nearly as much on immigration policy or border security .
They have offered a bill that would couple an amnesty with calls for more studies of border security and a promise for action three years from now .
“ This is the only bill that would have 218 votes on the House floor . We feel very confident about that , ” Mr. Hurd said on CBS .
In the Senate , meanwhile , Sen. Joe Manchin III , West Virginia Democrat , said hopes for a solution might lie in the two-dozen-member Common Sense Coalition of moderate senators who recently worked to end the three-day partial shutdown of the federal government .

Adler, Mike Riggs, Charles Oliver, Peter Bagge, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Shikha Dalmia","The Trump administration recently adopted a `` zero tolerance '' policy under which undocumented immigrants apprehended by federal officials are forcibly separated from their children . In April and May alone , almost 2000 children were torn from their parents and detained separately , often under cruel conditions likely to cause trauma and inflict longterm developmental damage . Attorney General Jeff Sessions claims that separation of families is justified by the need to enforce the law , and even asserts that the administration 's policy is supported by the Bible . I will leave the Biblical issues to theologians and cardinals , who have addressed them far better than I could . But Sessions ' secular argument is no better than his religious one .

The Trump administration claims that their policy is required by the 1997 Flores court settlement . But that settlement in no way mandates family separation and detention of children away from their parents . To the contrary , it instructs federal officials to `` place each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate '' and to release them to the custody of family or guardians `` without unnecessary delay . '' The settlement also mandates that federal immigration officials must `` treat all minors in its custody with dignity , respect and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors .

Even if the law did clearly direct criminal prosecution combined with automatic family separation in pretrial detention , it does not follow that the administration had a legal duty to adopt a `` zero tolerance '' policy that prioritizes prosecution of this particular type of offense .

First-time illegal entry into the United States is a mere misdemeanor carrying a penalty ( up to 6 months imprisonment or a small fine ) lower than the penalty for possession of small amounts of marijuana ( 1 year ) . The relative penalties suggest that federal law considers the latter a more serious offense than the former . Yet not even hard-core drug warriors like Sessions urge the federal government to adopt a `` zero tolerance '' policy under which we routinely prosecute all small-time marijuana users . In practice , the feds only target a tiny fraction of them . And when they do , they do n't separate their children from them , and detain the children under harsh conditions .
The administration 's zero tolerance policy , therefore , is not mandated by law . They could easily exercise the discretion to avoid prosecution and family separation , as previous administrations have , and as the Trump administration itself does in the case of nearly all small-time marijuana users . Prioritizing this offense over nearly all others is a policy choice , not a legal requirement . It 's a choice the president made , and one he could reverse at any time .
If enforcing the law really were the main concern of Trump and Sessions , they could easily address the issue by supporting legislation banning family separation at the border , except in cases of child abuse or similar exigency .

Much the same is true of many of our immigration laws . Most of the undocumented migrants entering the United States with their minor children are fleeing violence , abuse , oppression , dire poverty , or other terrible conditions . The laws that bar their entry are largely based on immutable conditions similar to race : who their parents were , or where they were born . The US may not be responsible for the awful conditions these people are fleeing . But if we forcibly deport them back to places where they are likely to face oppression , privation , and often even death , we become complicit in the wrongs they suffer . As philosopher Michael Huemer explains , the situation is akin to one where we use force to prevent starving people from buying food they need to survive .
Most Americans routinely violate laws far less oppressive than segregation laws . For example , the vast majority violate speeding laws , and some 52 % admit to using marijuana at some point in their lives . The point is not just many Americans violate these types of laws , but that they believe ( rightly ) that they commit no wrong in doing so , long as the speeding or marijuana use did not endanger innocent third parties . The same reasoning applies to undocumented migrant families fleeing oppression , except that their illegal actions are motivated by far greater need , and pose much less risk to third parties than speeding does .
Jeff Sessions contends that migrants fleeing horrible conditions should `` apply lawfully [ and ] wait your turn . '' This admonition might have some validity if they actually had a realistic chance of gaining legal entry in the near future . In reality , the wait time for most potential immigrants who do not have very close relatives in the US is likely to be decades or even centuries . If they apply for asylum , they face a system that refuses to grant it even for many who are victims of horrific violence and oppression , and features Kafkaesque rules such as classifying performing slave labor for guerrillas as providing `` material support '' to terrorists ( thereby making the escaped slave ineligible for asylum ) . Moreover , Sessions and his political allies have for years resisted all efforts to make legal entry into the United States easier . They have themselves to blame for creating the conditions under which many undocumented immigrants have no plausible moral obligation to obey the law .
Even in the case of otherwise just laws , there must be moral limits to the means used to enforce them . The child-separation policy crosses any reasonable line . It inflicts harm grossly disproportionate to any offense . And most of that harm is suffered by children—people themselves innocent of wrongdoing . Even if their parents acted wrongly in trying to enter the United States , the children had little choice in the matter .
Some try to justify the administration policy by pointing out that people convicted of crimes are often imprisoned in ways that keep them apart from their children . But , in such cases , the children are left in the custody of relatives or guardians chosen by the family , not housed in harsh detention facilities . In addition , it is extremely rare for first-time offenders charged with misdemeanors to be subjected to prolonged detention at all , or even to get prison sentences after conviction ( as opposed to fines or probation ) . If the government started rounding up small-time marijuana users or violators of speeding laws , putting them into pretrial detention , and separating them from minor children who are then placed in confinement under cruel conditions , there would be an outcry . Few , if any , would seriously claim that the policy is justified because it strengthens enforcement of drug and traffic laws . Even most who believe that our marijuana laws and traffic laws are just would condemn such a cruel policy . The same logic applies to Trump 's family separation policy at the border .

But the similarity of the justification, that notion that more immigration must be deterred at all costs, reveals something important about what Trump is currently doing. These harsh measures are an inevitable outgrowth of the way that Trump and other right-wing populists like Orbán position migrants as a dire threat to the societies they’re trying to join.

Cruelty isn’t ancillary to the Trump approach to immigration. It’s at the heart of it.

The vicious logic of family separation

Trump and Orbán are perhaps the two most important leaders in the global anti-immigration movement today. They eschew the kind of politeness heads of state are supposed to use when talking about immigrants, instead attacking them as people. Both men frequently describe immigrants as risks to the safety of their respective nations — and, sometimes, even their very survival.

The exact nature of the threat varies by context. Orbán, dealing with large numbers of Muslim migrants, plays up fears of terrorism and the demise of “Christian” culture. “Every single migrant poses a public security and terror risk,” as he put it in a 2016 press conference.

Trump used the same arguments about terrorism to justify his travel ban. But when dealing with largely Mexican and Central American migrants rather than Muslims, he plays up the threat of crime. The most famous example, of course, is the speech he gave at the opening of his campaign way back in 2015:

The US has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems. ... When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

Like Orbán, Trump has described the stakes here as being existential: that preventing mass migration, particularly undocumented migration, is a matter of life and death for the United States. “If you don’t have Borders, you don’t have a Country!” he tweeted on Tuesday (capitalization his).

The default assumption here isn’t that immigrants are normal people who might unintentionally harm native-born citizens by working for lower wages. It’s that the bulk of them are dangerous, distinct from native-born citizens in character and in kind.

The migrants at issue in the current American and Hungarian debates don’t resemble this caricature in the slightest. It’s actually somewhat the opposite: Many of these people are destitute and desperate, fleeing poverty, gang violence, or war.

Now, intentionally inflicting horrors like family separation on people might seem impossibly cruel. But if you believe the stakes of the immigration fight are so high, that the very identity of the immigrants is so threatening that the country might not survive their influx, then extreme cruelty becomes not only justified but required.

Orbán has been explicit on this point, as has (more or less) Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In a Monday speech, he defended the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy as a “terrible choice” justified only by the “lawlessness” on America’s southern border. Were there fewer immigrants trying to enter, Sessions said, there wouldn’t be any need to break up families.

“We cannot and will not encourage people to bring children by giving them blanket immunity from our laws,” he said. “If we build the wall, if we pass legislation to end the lawlessness, we won’t face these terrible choices.”

You can find similar language — that migrants are a dire threat who must be met with extreme measures — in countries across Europe. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister and the leader of its far-right party, has blamed immigrants for “drug dealing, thefts, rapes and violence,” and proudly labeled Italy “the racist country.” French far-right politician Marine Le Pen, warning that French “civilization” was at stake, called last year for a suspension of all immigration to France. Orbán has explicitly cast himself as part of a pan-Western alliance of anti-immigrant politicians, one that could work together to slam Europe’s doors shut.

Under President Obama, the United States was seen as an enemy of this so-called “nationalist international” and an ally of politicians like German Chancellor Angela Merkel trying to hold the pro-migration line.

immigration,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/15/us-releases-illegals-who-are-sex-offenders/,U.S. releases illegal immigrants who are sex offenders,2013-09-15,Stephen Dinan,"The news last week that federal authorities had to release 2,837 convicted sex offenders back onto the streets has renewed focus on a Supreme Court case that requires the government to release immigrants whose home countries won ’ t take them back .
A report released last week by the Government Accountability Office said the nearly 3,000 sex offenders are part of the 59,347 immigrants who the courts have ruled can not be held , whom the U.S. has been unable to send home , and who instead were released under some sort of supervision as of September 2012 .
The GAO took a sample of the sex offender cases and concluded that about 5 percent of the time U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn ’ t ensure that the immigrants released were properly registered with local authorities as sex offenders .
“ I ’ m surprised that only 5 percent of them are not properly registered , ” said Jessica Vaughan , director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies .
She said ICE isn ’ t particularly rigorous about monitoring many of those it releases .
Following on news this year that ICE released a number of immigrants from custody and blamed automatic budget cuts , the latest report again highlights a thorny part of the immigration system .
SEE ALSO : Immigrant-rights groups call for October rally in D.C .
In this case , the sex offenders and other immigrants — legal and illegal — who have been released are thanks to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling in what is known as the Zadvydas case . The court ruled 5-4 that detention for immigration purposes can ’ t be punitive ; therefore , if there isn ’ t a likelihood someone can be deported , they generally have to be released .
That matters because many countries delay documents to make it more difficult for U.S. deportation . The worst is Qatar , which takes an average of 800 days to issue the necessary deportation documents , according to ICE numbers that Ms. Vaughan obtained . That is followed by Cambodia at 522 days and Vietnam at 368 days .
Judy Rabinovitz , deputy director at the American Civil Liberties Union ’ s Immigrants ’ Rights Project , said the GAO report highlights how the system is supposed to work : Once illegal immigrants are released , they are supposed to be under supervision , and ICE is supposed to make sure the sex offenders register with authorities according to state and local laws .
“ The GAO report is focusing on the more important thing , which is that it ’ s the criminal justice system that ’ s responsible for these people and ICE should be cooperating with the criminal justice system , ” Ms. Rabinovitz said .
ICE regularly faces criticism from both sides of the immigration issue .
Advocates for strict enforcement want the agency to do more to detain dangerous immigrants it is trying to deport , and to do a better job of tracking those it doesn ’ t detain to make sure they don ’ t disappear into the country . But immigrant rights advocates said too many people are being detained and often are held in poor conditions , far from their families .

All we ’ re saying is provide them with a bond hearing . ”","The news last week that federal authorities had to release 2,837 convicted sex offenders back onto the streets has renewed focus on a Supreme Court case that requires the government to release immigrants whose home countries won’t take them back.

A report released last week by the Government Accountability Office said the nearly 3,000 sex offenders are part of the 59,347 immigrants who the courts have ruled cannot be held, whom the U.S. has been unable to send home, and who instead were released under some sort of supervision as of September 2012.

The GAO took a sample of the sex offender cases and concluded that about 5 percent of the time U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t ensure that the immigrants released were properly registered with local authorities as sex offenders.

“I’m surprised that only 5 percent of them are not properly registered,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies.

She said ICE isn’t particularly rigorous about monitoring many of those it releases.

Following on news this year that ICE released a number of immigrants from custody and blamed automatic budget cuts, the latest report again highlights a thorny part of the immigration system.

In this case, the sex offenders and other immigrants — legal and illegal — who have been released are thanks to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling in what is known as the Zadvydas case. The court ruled 5-4 that detention for immigration purposes can’t be punitive; therefore, if there isn’t a likelihood someone can be deported, they generally have to be released.

That matters because many countries delay documents to make it more difficult for U.S. deportation. The worst is Qatar, which takes an average of 800 days to issue the necessary deportation documents, according to ICE numbers that Ms. Vaughan obtained. That is followed by Cambodia at 522 days and Vietnam at 368 days.

Judy Rabinovitz, deputy director at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said the GAO report highlights how the system is supposed to work: Once illegal immigrants are released, they are supposed to be under supervision, and ICE is supposed to make sure the sex offenders register with authorities according to state and local laws.

“The GAO report is focusing on the more important thing, which is that it’s the criminal justice system that’s responsible for these people and ICE should be cooperating with the criminal justice system,” Ms. Rabinovitz said.

ICE regularly faces criticism from both sides of the immigration issue.

Advocates for strict enforcement want the agency to do more to detain dangerous immigrants it is trying to deport, and to do a better job of tracking those it doesn’t detain to make sure they don’t disappear into the country. But immigrant rights advocates said too many people are being detained and often are held in poor conditions, far from their families.

Under existing law, once another country refuses to accept its people for repatriation, the government is supposed to begin refusing to issue travel visas for citizens of that country to visit the U.S.

Ms. Vaughan said that can be a devastatingly effective tool, but administrations of both parties had refused to use it.

“When you start denying student visas — any narrow category that you want, that hits people in the ruling elite in that other country — they start paying attention,” Ms. Vaughan said. “That is the best leverage we have with people in other countries, is visas, because they all want to come here, go to school here, go to Vegas, Disney World, whatever.”

But Ms. Vaughan said the Department of Homeland Security hasn’t been proactive in pushing the visa retaliation.

A Homeland Security spokesman didn’t return a request seeking comment.

The massive immigration bill that passed the Senate this year waters down the visa penalty law, giving wide latitude to Homeland Security and the State Department to determine whether another country is being recalcitrant.

House Republicans are looking at a more concrete solution.

One of their immigration bills, which cleared the Judiciary Committee this year, would give the Homeland Security secretary the power to indefinitely order the detention of immigrants who are deemed to be public safety threats. That bill could come to the House floor this year if Republicans move ahead with an immigration debate.

The bill mirrors an approach championed by Rep. Lamar Smith, Texas Republican, in the previous Congress.

Ms. Rabinovitz at the ACLU said giving ICE permanent detention powers could be unconstitutional and is certainly misguided. She said the agency should be trying to figure out ways to reduce the population of detainees.

“It’s just stupid,” she said. “We’re talking about a situation where we’re spending so much money on detention, we’re in a period of fiscal straits where we should be concerned about spending our money. To lock up people who aren’t a flight risk doesn’t make sense. All we’re saying is provide them with a bond hearing.”

Adler, Mike Riggs, Charles Oliver, Peter Bagge, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Shikha Dalmia","During a speech announcing his intention to seek the presidency , Donald Trump stumbled on what would become a signature issue for his campaign : Mexico . `` When Mexico sends its people , they 're not sending their best , '' he said . `` They 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with them . They 're bringing drugs . They 're bringing crime . ''
The `` great , great wall '' Trump wants to build is n't just aimed at stopping the people from crossing illegally into the United States ; it 's also supposed to stop the narcotics . But it is n't going to work .
To be blunt , the U.S. government is not likely to outspend the drug cartels at the border . Even if Trump is willing to put up the $ 21.6 billion the Department of Homeland Security estimates constructing a barrier would cost , the illegal drug trade is a $ 350 billion international business , according to the United Nations World Drug Program . A 2014 report from RAND Corp. estimated the American drug market for the four most prevalent illicit drugs—cannabis , heroin , cocaine , and methamphetamines—at $ 100 billion annually . The profit incentives to find ways over , under , around , or through any border infrastructure are high , and the cartels have more than enough money to spend on R & D .
Drug smugglers are already using a wide range of techniques to move merchandise across the border , and doing so quite successfully . On the low-tech end of the spectrum are so-called drug mules . Immigrants wishing to cross the border and their coyotes , or paid guides , must first pay tribute to the cartel that controls the plaza , or approach to the border . The payment may be in cash , but it often also includes an agreement by the migrants to carry drug loads with them as they cross . This is actually a pretty high-risk import strategy : If the mules are caught , the cartels lose the drugs . But more often than not , the smugglers are using migrants as a decoy to draw the attention of the Border Patrol while they move larger loads across elsewhere .
Current border infrastructure , such as steel mesh fencing , is easy enough to cut through with a Sawzall , and such half-moon gashes are everywhere , especially in places such as San Diego . A 2009 Government Accountability Office report said Congress would have to spend $ 6.5 billion over 20 years just to repair the existing fencing .
Another low-tech method to foil existing infrastructure involves using catapults to launch bales of drugs over the fence . One such device , discovered in February on the Arizona border , was actually attached to the Mexican side of the fence . Some barriers , such as the four-inch steel tubes cemented vertically into the ground and placed four inches apart that are used in parts of the Arizona desert , can prevent people from crossing but are easy enough pass three-inch packages of heroin through . An actual wall would stop this particular type of small-bore smuggling , but these transactions account for very little of the overall traffic .
Instead , billions of dollars and thousands of tons of drugs are smuggled through authorized ports of entry every year , hidden in compartments in cars , trucks , and railcars . Customs and Border Protection officers use sophisticated X-rays and gamma radiation detectors to find these loads and seize tons of narcotics that way each year . But the very fact that officials are still capturing large shipments—such as the 4,000 pounds of marijuana disguised as limes found last month at a Texas port of entry—on a regular basis means it must still be profitable for the smugglers to attempt it . It 's just a cost of doing business to them .
There are high-tech smuggling efforts as well . The preferred method for water-based trafficking has moved from fast boats in the style made famous by Miami Vice in the 1980s , to pangas , or open-outboard boats running up the Pacific coast , after that , to homemade submarines in the last decade , including semi-submersibles that hover just under the surface to keep a low profile . The latter are piloted by one to four very brave souls , since they very often sink before reaching land . Newer efforts involve fully submersible submarines and drug `` torpedoes '' that are towed beneath a surface vessel far under the water . These can carry as much as 12 tons of narcotics .
And then there are the tunnels . Hundreds have been found running under the U.S.-Mexico border in the last decade . For a million dollars , a cartel can bore a passage complete with ventilation , lighting , and cart rails , and make that money back with just one successful load of heroin or cocaine . Infamous drug lord El Chapo 's Sinaloa cartel has been the most effective in history at tunneling .
The cartels have also used manned ultralight aircraft to carry bundles over the border fences . In 2012 , the National Geographic series Border Wars captured dramatic footage of an ultralight dumping bundles of marijuana into the United States . Drones can transport high-profit , low-weight drugs such as heroin , as evidenced by a 2015 bust in which two men were arrested retrieving 28 pounds of product after an unmanned device carried it across the border and dropped it along the side of Route 98 in Imperial , California . Although the use of sophisticated aerial surveillance , such as `` tethered aerostat '' blimps , has decreased these incursions , they do continue .

And if that does n't work , they can take that same million dollars and use it to bribe a corrupt border official ; this strategy could become more common if under Trump the border becomes more fortified .
In short , as long as the demand for drugs remains high , the chances that the U.S. government spending between $ 12 billion and $ 20 billion dollars on a wall will significantly diminish the cartels ' ability to get their wares into the United States is anything but `` yuge .

A federal appeals court has unanimously rejected a Trump administration request to allow its travel ban to take effect.

The three-judge appeals panel declined to overturn a lower court's order suspending the president's ban against entry into the United States by refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations.

The travel ban was put on hold by federal district Judge James L. Robart of Seattle, who issued a nationwide restraining order on Feb. 3. Robart said that the two states challenging the ban, Washington and Minnesota, had shown that their residents and universities were harmed by Trump's action. The administration then asked the appeals court for an emergency stay of Robart's restraining order.

But the judges dismissed the administration's request, saying that it had to show that it is likely to succeed in the trial court on the merits of its appeal.

""[We] hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,"" wrote the panel.

President Trump tweeted his reply, indicating he will appeal.

Trump also spoke briefly with reporters outside his press secretary's office after the ruling was announced and, as reported by Reuters, called the decision political and predicted the administration would ultimately win.

The result is a rebuke to the White House. In oral arguments heard on Tuesday, the panel vigorously quizzed attorneys both for the administration and for the state of Washington, the lead plaintiff, which originally filed the suit challenging the travel ban.

The solicitor general for the state of Washington, Noah Purcell, argued that the travel ban is discriminatory and violates both federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution. He told the court that the judiciary's role is to step in and check the abuses of the executive branch.

But August Flentje, special counsel to the assistant attorney general, argued that the president has the ultimate authority to protect the national security and that his action in that regard — namely, the travel ban — was unreviewable by the courts.

In their ruling, the judges were unequivocal. ""There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our democracy,"" the court wrote.

The judges also said that the administration had also failed to show it would suffer ""irreparable injury"" if its travel ban were not allowed to go back into effect. Acknowledging the government's interest in combating terrorism, the judges nonetheless wrote, ""The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review the decision at all.""

The states challenging the president's travel ban won on virtually every issue, says Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.

""The order was unanimous. The panel found that the states had standing, that the executive order was reviewable by the court, that the U.S. was not likely to succeed on the merits and that it had not shown that a stay was necessary to avoid irreparable injury,"" said Tobias.

In a news conference, Purcell declared victory. ""What we argued is it's the role of the courts to say what the law is, and to serve as a check on the executive branch, and that's what the court has done in this opinion, in this excellent opinion, with this well-reasoned, careful, thoughtful opinion that seriously considered all the government's arguments and rejected them,"" he said.",www.npr.org,center,4Yis2tEPmThk6efh

WASHINGTON – Pro-immigration groups nationwide are girding for a major battle to stop or alter a Trump administration proposal unveiled over the weekend – weeks before November's midterm elections – that would strictly enforce rules for millions of immigrants applying for green cards or visas by scrutinizing their use of food stamps, welfare, housing vouchers or Medicaid.

Three times a day, a Chevy van full of Milwaukeeans pulls out of a church parking lot and makes an hour-long drive to Sheboygan County, Wis., where they go to work. In Milwaukee, one says, he’d be washing dishes for $8 an hour, maybe $9, and the hours would be sparse. In Sheboygan, he’s making $15 an hour at an auto parts factory. When he works overtime, which is often, he makes $22 an hour.

That van represents the difference between poverty and opportunity. It’s part of the Joseph Project. The name is from the title of a book, “The Triumphs of Joseph,” by Bob Woodson, a man who has inspired both of us to rethink how America can address poverty.

The Joseph Project is an effort of churches and businesses to connect people who need good jobs with businesses that need good employees. The churches host week-long classes that teach “soft skills,” like how to interview or dress for the office. They organize a carpool to bring them to employers. Since it started last year, with classes taught by the staff of Sen. Johnson, the project has been thriving. It has placed scores of people, 70% of whom are still at their jobs. Last month, the Sheboygan County Economic Development Corporation paid to add two more vans.

This is how you fight poverty: person to person. The Joseph Project is an example of what community leaders are doing across Wisconsin and America. They are developing homegrown solutions based on their neighbors’ unique needs — in this case, after noticing a shortage of workers in one place, a shortage of work in another. But to expand opportunity, the federal government needs to stop competing with these social entrepreneurs.

Washington treats these entrepreneurs as it treats almost any successful enterprise — as a threat. Each year, it spends nearly $800 billion on more than 90 different programs to fight poverty, with almost no coordination or any consideration of an individual’s needs. It should be no surprise that upward mobility is no better now than when we started the War on Poverty in 1964. But it should be a scandal that today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.

A one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work. What the federal government should do is direct resources to communities, let them try different ideas, then hold people accountable for results. This more organic approach will empower people, giving them dignity rather than dependence.

First, make sure it always pays to work. When it makes more sense to stay on aid instead of taking that job, it undercuts community leaders and demoralizes people trying to support themselves. It’s striking how Joseph Project participants tell us they desperately want to work but feel trapped by the system. It’s moving how they respond to opportunity: “This program is like a second birth,” one said. We must ensure our safety net never stops people from achieving the dignity of work.

Second, harness the talents of community leaders. Allow states to combine federal programs and customize benefits. This would allow them to coordinate with initiatives like the Joseph Project. Make housing benefits portable, so you can move to neighborhoods with more jobs.

Third, demand results. Washington measures success by how much money it spends. Instead, we should measure it by how many people the programs help. In exchange for giving states flexibility, we should also collect more data on their efforts to see what works.

Forty-six million Americans are in poverty today. Yet at our country’s heart is the idea that earning one’s success is crucial to human happiness.

What exactly the group will do is undetermined at this point, but ads, campaign support, public communications and grass-roots organizing are all in the mix, said someone familiar with the organization. On its website, FWD.us, the group has posted testimonials from its members.

Last week, the group’s co-founder and president, Joe Green, issued an apology after a leaked prospectus listed as members the names of executives who had not committed to the effort, such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, POLITICO reported.

Now the group is hoping to move past that misstep, which included what struck some as an Orwellian-sounding name, “Human Capital,” and an assessment that the group’s members control “massive distribution channels.” Green said he regretted some of the document’s phrases.

President Obama doesn’t care.

The reasons for acting alone are as bogus as they are cynical. There is no emergency here. In fact, there are people who the president should be allowing to vault our immigration barriers – for instance, those in Iraq and Afghanistan who aided our troops, acting as interpreters or guides, who are being hunted down and murdered by ISIS and others who hate America. These people are trapped in the immigration queue, and are paying for our creaky processes with their lives.

Why isn’t President Obama helping them?

Mr. Obama is not responding to an emergency in the Hispanic community. He’s responding to an emergency at the voting booth – for Democrats. Polling shows that Hispanic support for Democrats is slipping, and was a factor in the midterm GOP landslide. (In Georgia, for instance, David Perdue won an unexpected 42% of the Hispanic vote, helping him to trounce Michelle Nunn.)

Mr. Obama is hoping that his announced move to grant almost 5 million people temporary protection from deportation will reclaim Hispanic allegiance, much as his mini Dream Act – the DACA – did in 2012.

But, his measures solve few concerns for immigrants living in this country illegally. The president is offering those millions only temporary sanctuary from deportation – protection that can be overturned at the whim of the next occupant of the Oval Office.

Just as the response to the DACA offer fell short of expectations, presumably because those eligible feared revealing themselves for only temporary sanctuary, this measure too may receive a cool reception from the Hispanic community.

Further, Obama is denying illegals coverage under ObamaCare, ensuring their continued second-class status. Given that Hispanics rate health care one of their top concerns, how many will risk stepping out of the shadows if benefits are not available?

Instead of working with Congress to enact lasting, meaningful and satisfactory fixes, we have the prospect of more half-measures that will further muddy our enforcement waters.

Meanwhile, Obama’s justifications for issuing so-called “presidential memos” outlining his program are not credible. His righteous “impatience” with the lack of progress on immigration reform is a fable. He had two years with a Democrat majority in Congress to “fix” our immigration system. He looked the other way. He also deferred action until after the midterm elections, so as not to add to Democrat woes; wasn’t he impatient then, as well?

Mr. Obama, in his remarks to the nation, promised to beef up border security. He took credit for the fact that illegal crossings have declined, but the country understands that the downturn has stemmed from our recession, and the lack of available jobs in the U.S. The border has been, and remains porous.

Mr. Obama’s DACA resulted in the only border crisis in recent times, and also hardened the nation’s attitudes about immigration.

Similarly, the portion responding that immigration is a “good” thing, has dropped. Chances are the ruckus about this new unpopular move will cause even greater resistance to immigration.

That’s a shame.

It is clear to most that our immigration system is dysfunctional and often works against our national interest. However, we are, as President Obama said in his remarks, “a nation of laws.""

As much as the nation would like our immigration rules put right, it is also clear that most people want Mr. Obama to work with the newly-elected Republican Congress to enact legislation, as is outlined in our constitution.

Americans understand the danger of an imperial president. Democrats in particular should see the risks as well.

Imagine three years from now, if a Republican president decides not to enforce the Clean Air Act. Democrats would howl, and rightly so.

Our country has, and needs, checks and balances between the legislative branch and the White House. The president takes an oath of office, pledging to uphold the laws of the country. That is his job.

This move by President Obama is not a sign of righteous impatience; it is proof that he has failed at that most basic of tasks – working with Congress.

At this point in his presidency, Mr. Obama appears concerned with only one thing – his legacy. He does not seem concerned about his party, or the country.

He is obsessed with how history will view his time in office.

immigration,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/14/16293906/trump-immigration-deportation,Fear itself: Donald Trump's real immigration policy,2017-09-14,"Dara Lind, Matthew Yglesias, Sean Collins, German Lopez, Alex Abad-Santos, Alex Ward, Aaron Rupar","The Trump administration wants to send a message to unauthorized immigrants living in self-identified “ sanctuary cities ” : your local government can ’ t actually keep you from getting deported .
In September , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) conducted a weeklong operation in which it arrested nearly 500 immigrants . Most of them deliberately sought out by ICE for having prior criminal convictions ; some , as has happened in the other high-profile raids whose frequency has increased under Trump , just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . But all of them lived in “ sanctuary cities . ”
Some ICE officials have acknowledged ( anonymously ) for months that the Trump administration is deliberately targeting unauthorized immigrants who live in cities that are trying to protect them from the Trump administration .
Because , under Trump , reminding immigrants that they might be deported — and should be worried about deportation — is both a matter of principle and an important policy weapon . It ’ s the cornerstone of this administration ’ s immigration enforcement policy — and its foremost policy accomplishment .
“ If you ’ re in this country illegally , and you committed a crime by entering this country , you should be uncomfortable , ” acting ICE Director Tom Homan told Congress in May . “ You should look over your shoulder . ”
It ’ s a variation on the “ self-deportation ” theory immigration hawks have been putting forth for years — the idea that if you put enough pressure on unauthorized immigrants , from enough different directions , you can make them so miserable that leaving the US after years of living here looks like an appealing option . But instead of pressuring immigrants from multiple directions , Trump is hammering down , again and again , to activate their single biggest fear : that the system will catch them , arrest them , and throw them into a pitiless and grinding deportation machine .
Trump ’ s policy is marked by a little more enforcement — and a lot more vulnerability
It only took five days for the administration to make its agenda clear to unauthorized immigrants in the United States .
On January 25 , Trump signed an executive order addressing immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States . Among other things , the order officially rescinded a series of Obama administration memos that laid out which immigrants should be considered priorities for deportation — and which should not .
Under the new policy , the following types of immigrants are among those prioritized for deportation : immigrants who “ have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense ” ( which includes driving without a license in states that don ’ t give licenses to unauthorized immigrants ) ; immigrants who engage in “ fraud or willful representation in any official matter ” ( which could include paying taxes under a fake Social Security number ) ; and immigrants who , despite not having committed any act that constitutes a “ chargeable criminal offense , ” are still a “ risk to public safety or national security ” in the eyes of the ICE agent arresting them .
Under the new policy , the following types of deportable immigrants are low priorities for deportation : none .
When President Trump , then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly , and other Trump officials bragged about “ unshackling ” immigration agents , this is what they meant . Agents had more power to decide which immigrants to arrest and put into deportation proceedings , because the pool of immigrants most vulnerable to deportation had expanded by millions .
The number of immigrants actually getting arrested and put into deportation proceedings did not , of course , expand by millions .
On the ground , the Trump administration expanded enforcement mostly by going after “ low-hanging fruit ” — immigrants whose locations were already known . Sometimes that means going after “ criminals ” ( in its first few months , the administration took a much more aggressive approach than its predecessor did in asking jail officials to hold immigrants for ICE pickup ) , but it sometimes means going after people who are coming to ICE offices for check-ins , or even going to US Citizenship and Immigration Services to interview for their green cards .
But the administration has done just enough to keep any immigrant who isn ’ t already on ICE ’ s radar from feeling really safe . It ’ s conducted a few high-profile , coordinated immigration raids — in which it ’ s arrested both the people it was seeking out and anyone else who happened to be around and deportable . One ICE source said in March that the government was deliberately planning raids in “ sanctuary cities ” — an effective way to remind immigrant communities that even if their local government was trying to lower their risk of deportation , it couldn ’ t actually protect immigrants from the feds .
Trump ’ s ICE is arresting more immigrants than it did under Obama ’ s last couple of years in office . From October to December 2016 , ICE arrested an average of 9,134 immigrants a month ; from February to June 2017 , it arrested an average of 13,085 . That ’ s simultaneously a big increase — a 43 percent jump — and a drop in the bucket , compared with the expansion in the pool of immigrants made vulnerable to deportation .
Under the last two years of the Obama administration , the government ’ s official position was that immigrants would be prioritized for deportation if they were convicted of certain serious crimes , or if they were recent border crossers or had recent final deportation orders . There were 750,000 “ convicted criminal aliens ” ; it ’ s unclear how many people fell in the other two categories , but the total number of people prioritized as of January 19 , 2017 , was almost certainly less than 2 million — possibly much lower .
On January 25 , 2017 , the pool of immigrants “ prioritized ” — or at least not unprioritized — for deportation swelled to something like 10 million .
The Trump administration ’ s eyes were much bigger than its capacity .
The administration is operating on a budget and with a workforce set under its predecessor — which devoted much more effort to deporting immigrants from within the US than the government ever had before , but was still equipped for no more than 400,000 deportations per year . And due to the staggering immigration court backlog , those deportations are often of immigrants who were arrested years prior .
A government capable of deporting all 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants over two presidential terms would need four times the deportation capacity it currently has . Even modestly increasing deportation capacity would require an investment , in the Department of Justice ( which runs immigration courts ) as well as the Department of Homeland Security , that ’ s likely to sit uneasily with congressional Republicans who aren ’ t even enthusiastic about paying $ 1.5 billion for a few dozen miles of border “ wall . ”
Actually carrying out mass arrests and deportations of long-resident , law-abiding unauthorized immigrants — “ good ” immigrants — could generate a serious outcry ( fueled by photos of families being separated by ICE agents ) . Many Republicans are already concerned about the politics of Trump ’ s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which currently protects over 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allows them to work in the US legally ; the politics of deporting them , along with their parents , would be even worse .
This isn ’ t a new problem . It ’ s why intellectual immigration hawks have long preferred “ self-deportation ” ( also known as “ attrition through enforcement ” ) over mass deportation . It might not be as brutally effective — even the most optimistic accounting suggests that 5 million immigrants could eventually be pushed to “ self-deport ” over the course of several years — but it ’ s much cheaper .
What Trump is doing isn ’ t quite “ self-deportation ” either , though . The point of “ self-deportation ” is that the government is using all the tools at its disposal to make it hard to support a life and a family in the US without papers — and the centerpiece of that is making it impossible to get a job under the table , by mandating all businesses use the E-Verify system and cracking down on employers who hire unauthorized workers .
The Trump administration isn ’ t doing that . Its legislative agenda on immigration is focused on “ the wall ” and on cutting legal immigration rather than E-Verify ; it hasn ’ t stepped up workplace immigration enforcement much ( drawing ire from Laura Ingraham ’ s website , which called workplace enforcement the “ soft spot ” of Trump ’ s policy ) .
Instead of using a variety of tools , it ’ s using a combination of policy and messaging to keep the threat of deportation hanging over immigrants ’ heads . It ’ s not trying to get them to go home because they can ’ t stay here ; it ’ s making sure they don ’ t get too comfortable here because they could be taken at any minute .
It ’ s a general law enforcement principle . Here ’ s how US Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley put it : When they have enough agents on a shift to catch all of the people or drugs they expect to enter the US during that time , they use their resources to catch those people and drugs . It ’ s only when they show up and realize they ’ re way undermatched ( something they emphasize hasn ’ t happened in several years ) that they bring out the floodlights and do circuits through the streets with sirens blaring — the “ high-visibility ” tactics .
ICE , the Border Patrol ’ s sister immigration force , appears to be doing something similar — not to deter immigrants from coming , but to remind those already here that their existence in the US is not a secure one .
Fear is hard to attack because it ’ s hard to see . It doesn ’ t spark political protests . It may not even be noticed by Americans who don ’ t know any immigrants . It ’ s easy to deflect onto others for causing fear — blaming immigrant organizations , for example , for spreading rumors of ICE raids . It leaves few fingerprints . And it takes little cash .
The January executive order let exactly one Obama-era protection stand — the DACA program — despite Trump ’ s promises to end Obama ’ s “ unconstitutional executive orders ” on “ day one ” on the campaign trail .
For months , the administration publicly weighed DACA ’ s fate ( even as , behind the scenes , ICE got more active in stripping protections from DACA recipients , sometimes based on disputed claims of gang affiliation ) . Every time Trump or his government declared that the program was still in effect , a DHS spokesperson hastened to clarify that they meant “ for now . ”
Trump has already mischaracterized his DACA decision as one to keep the program for the next six months while it waits for Congress to act , and then start allowing protections and work permits issued under the program ( which last for two years ) to expire . ( Democrats have announced they ’ ve reached the broad outlines of a deal on DACA , but the exact details have yet to be worked out . )
The reality is that the program is winding down now . Immigrants who would have qualified for the program had they turned 15 in August , but instead turn 15 in October , will be locked out ; immigrants whose DACA protections are set to expire on March 4 have only until October 5 to collect their paperwork ( and $ 495 ) and apply for one last renewal .
For immigrants whose DACA protections are set to last through the next six months — who , in theory , aren ’ t supposed to be worried — there ’ s a world of difference between knowing when their work permits will expire and being able to quiet their minds until then . The expiration date isn ’ t a start date ; it ’ s an end date . President Trump says the DREAMers should be turning their hopes to Congress , but his White House ’ s talking points urge them to start making plans to leave the country when their work permits expire .
And in the meantime , the Trump administration is already tightening the reins on DACA recipients . Border Patrol has started to detain DACA recipients at internal checkpoints , “ for accuracy and verification of status , ” sometimes holding them for several hours .
The Trump administration knows that telling people they have six months before being returned to the pool of vulnerability is a warning rather than a reprieve . It ’ s used that strategy deliberately with Haitians living in the US under Temporary Protected Status , issued after the 2010 earthquake — who are currently months into a six-month extension of protections that the government has all but promised will be their last .
Temporary Protected Status is issued to people who are living in the US from a particular country , who don ’ t have a legal status that allows them to stay ( either because they ’ re here on short-term visas or because they ’ re unauthorized ) but , due to a natural disaster or other crisis in their home countries , can ’ t safely return either . The longer that people are protected in the US , however , the more they put down roots here , and the less sensible it appears to revoke their protections — especially because the alternative is returning to a country that may still be on the long road to recovery from crisis . So previous governments have tended to extend TPS protections when a country comes up for review .
DHS under Kelly , however , wanted to put the “ temporary ” back in “ Temporary Protected Status. ” When TPS for Haitians came up for review in spring , Kelly granted a six-month extension but warned , “ I believe there are indications that Haiti — if its recovery from the 2010 earthquake continues at pace — may not warrant further TPS extension past January 2018 . ”
Kelly openly acknowledged he was sending a message to Haitians — and other TPS beneficiaries . “ The message is : By definition , TPS is temporary , '' he said in a press conference in Miami in June .
And by sending that message , he wanted to get recipients to “ start thinking now about what will happen in the not-too-distant future. ” The memo extending TPS through January made that a little clearer . “ The Department of Homeland Security urges Haitian TPS recipients who do not have another immigration status to use the time before Jan. 22 , 2018 to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States — including proactively seeking travel documentation — or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible . ”
It ’ s the same language the White House talking points would use , months later , for DACA recipients .
Some Haitians have already “ prepared for and arranged ” their travel — to Canada , where they ’ re seeking asylum . But others , clinging to the fact that the Trump administration hasn ’ t officially declared that TPS will end , are resistant to make plans to leave the country that many of them have lived in for most of their lives . “ I have nothing to go back to , ” Uber driver and would-be college student Jean Jubens Jeanty told the New York Times in July . “ Why not keep me here ? ”
This isn ’ t optimism . It ’ s simply not having alternatives . “ It ’ s very unsettling , ” a Queens College senior told the Times , “ to know that you ’ re here and you don ’ t know what tomorrow is going to bring , or what is going to happen in the next couple of months . ”
Losing TPS wouldn ’ t create certainty — it would just open up a deeper anxiety , in which fear of being deportable is replaced with fear of actually getting deported .
The government ’ s official line that Haitians should prepare to leave the US isn ’ t a promise to deport them if they don ’ t , or at least not a promise the government can keep . There are 58,000 Haitian TPS recipients ; the government will have to make a decision by January about whether to keep protecting 86,000 Hondurans with TPS , and a decision by March about the fate of 263,000 Salvadorians .
Those are numbers too big to round up and arrest with the resources the government has now , or can get in the next six months . But dumping them into the pool of vulnerability , and making it clear that they could get arrested at any time with no legal recourse ? It costs much less to send a message .
The fact that anyone living in the US without papers could be caught by ICE at any time is only part of the politics of fear . The other part is making it seem that anyone caught by ICE is inevitably going to get deported , and there ’ s nothing they or their lawyers can do to stop it .
The biggest practical obstacle to mass deportation is the immigration court backlog — in practice , it takes years to deport someone who hasn ’ t already been ordered deported . The Trump administration hasn ’ t yet put much effort into moving people through immigration court faster . Instead , it ’ s tried to portray the deportation process as a one-way journey — slow , but inevitable .
“ Trump doesn ’ t deport people , ” John Kelly used to say as head of DHS . “ The law deports people . ”
Kelly has left the department for the White House , but that sentiment remains ; on a press briefing about the process of DACA rescission , one DHS official praised Trump as “ the first president who ’ s asked us to enforce the law as written , and not some executive interpretation of the law. ” ( That official , somewhat ironically , went on to assure reporters that even after losing DACA protections , DREAMers would remain “ low enforcement priorities ” — something that is neither in the text of “ the law ” nor in the text of any of the Trump administration ’ s guidance on the matter . )
Under Obama , immigrants and their lawyers could often persuade ICE that they weren ’ t high enough enforcement priorities to merit spending resources on an immigration court prosecution ; the immigration court case would be “ administratively closed , ” and the immigrant would be given a stay of deportation .
From February to June 2016 , the Obama administration administratively closed an average of 2,400 cases a month . From February to June 2017 , the Trump administration closed an average of fewer than 100 .
An immigration lawyer told Vice that the key to closing immigration cases used to be “ shaming the government ” — but “ now , the government is shameless . ”
It ’ s certainly worked to appear shameless . Immigrants whose arrests provoked widespread media alarm and protests , like Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos ( arrested in February after 22 years in the US ) , might have been spared by the Obama administration ’ s desire to avoid bad press . The Trump administration deported Rayos in the middle of the night .
But it ’ s not actually true that the government is never showing discretion or leniency . There are cases where it has , in fact , been successfully shamed .
Jeannette Vizguerra spent most of the spring in the basement of a church in Denver ; she heard about people like Rayos getting arrested when they went in for ICE check-ins , and decided not to risk it . Because she missed her check-in , she was ordered deported in absentia — meaning she could be deported without going through immigration court . But she stayed in the church for months , and ICE agents didn ’ t dare go in and get her .
And then in May , ICE granted Vizguerra ( and another Denver-area immigrant who ’ d taken church refuge ) a stay of deportation . She was able to return home in time for Mother ’ s Day ; “ I have missed my kids . The fight is for them , ” she told reporters .
Vizguerra ’ s stay was granted thanks to the involvement of local members of Congress , under a procedure that has become more stringent under Trump . In other cases , the administration has simply decided to grant extensions ( often short-term ones ) to particularly sympathetic immigrants .
In June , ICE was set to deport Florida resident Reina Gomez , a 49-year-old with a terminal cancer that she claims can ’ t be treated in her home country of Honduras — making deportation a “ death sentence. ” But after a public outcry , she was given , first , a two-week extension to consider her asylum application — then a one-year stay . The government was shamed .
Shame isn ’ t guaranteed , and a last-minute reprieve isn ’ t something anyone can count on ( not to mention the fact that a one-year stay of deportation is no more permanent than the six months for Haitians with TPS ) . The Trump administration is using discretion much less frequently than its predecessor . But it ’ s using discretion more frequently than it allows when it claims that it ’ s really “ the law ” that deports people . Because sending people the message that there is something they can do to remain in the United States would undermine the politics of fear .
Even when the administration is trying to say that immigrants are safe from a particular fear or rumor , it ’ s unwilling to say that they ’ re safe . In a highly unusual move in early September , ICE put out a statement declaring it had no planned nationwide raid operations for the coming weeks — as a denial of widespread rumors that it was planning a massive nationwide sweep called “ Operation Mega ” to arrest more than 8,000 immigrants in mid-September . But the statement explicitly pointed to hurricane relief efforts in Florida and Texas as the reason the calendar had been cleared — leaving the obvious possibility that it could simply be rescheduled at a later date .
Similarly , the administration has all but said that it won ’ t send ICE lists of all immigrants who are set to lose DACA , allowing ICE to round up and arrest them as their protections expire . But it hasn ’ t made that promise explicitly , or promised to issue new guidance to agents about when they should and should not use DACA information for enforcement .
The rumors outstrip the policies — which is exactly the point
When a community is this taut with fear , any news or sign or rumor attracts disproportionate attention . So any policy change — or any sign that a policy change is being considered — is often greeted as a signal that “ mass deportation ” is coming , or that it ’ s already here .
Some DACA recipients are incredibly worried about getting rounded up when their protections expire . Some have even voiced a fear that they ’ ll be put in camps ( an image that evokes not only the concentration camps in which Japanese Americans were put during World War II but the “ tent cities ” of Trump pardon beneficiary Joe Arpaio ) . The panic is happening behind closed doors , far from the public debate over the fate of the DREAMers ( in which DACA recipients feel the need to portray themselves as brave , optimistic heroes ) , but it ’ s happening .
Those who never had DACA have spent the past several months making the daily calculation about safety . Jeannette Vizguerra decided not to go to her ICE meeting because she had heard about what happened to those who did . Central American families have stopped showing up to immigration court proceedings because they ’ re worried they ’ ll lose their asylum cases — and their best chance to stay in the US is to hide out of ICE ’ s sight .
Soon after Trump ’ s inauguration , local law enforcement started noting that Latinos were becoming less willing to report crimes . Judges have urged ICE not to make arrests in courtrooms because they might scare away victims from showing up to court . Immigration advocates in Houston believed it was likely , when Hurricane Harvey hit , that some unauthorized immigrants might have died because they stayed in their homes rather than evacuate along a route that featured a Border Patrol checkpoint .
The Trump administration tends to react to these fears with something resembling annoyance . Immigrants “ should feel safe to go and report criminal activity , ” acting ICE Director Homan told the press in July . But barely minutes later , he criticized , at length , the idea that “ we concentrate too much on those that are not criminal ” : “ We got to stop sending the message that people that do n't commit yet another crime should be forgotten , ” he said .
The message , he said , had to be as clear as possible : “ There is no safe haven here . ”
Unauthorized immigrants themselves have gotten that message . Even without doing the heavy lifting of mass deportation , the administration has put together an enforcement regime that does just enough to remind immigrants they ’ re vulnerable — and lets fear do the rest .","The Trump administration wants to send a message to unauthorized immigrants living in self-identified “sanctuary cities”: your local government can’t actually keep you from getting deported.

In September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted a weeklong operation in which it arrested nearly 500 immigrants. Most of them deliberately sought out by ICE for having prior criminal convictions; some, as has happened in the other high-profile raids whose frequency has increased under Trump, just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But all of them lived in “sanctuary cities.”

Some ICE officials have acknowledged (anonymously) for months that the Trump administration is deliberately targeting unauthorized immigrants who live in cities that are trying to protect them from the Trump administration.

Because, under Trump, reminding immigrants that they might be deported — and should be worried about deportation — is both a matter of principle and an important policy weapon. It’s the cornerstone of this administration’s immigration enforcement policy — and its foremost policy accomplishment.

“If you’re in this country illegally, and you committed a crime by entering this country, you should be uncomfortable,” acting ICE Director Tom Homan told Congress in May. “You should look over your shoulder.”

It’s a variation on the “self-deportation” theory immigration hawks have been putting forth for years — the idea that if you put enough pressure on unauthorized immigrants, from enough different directions, you can make them so miserable that leaving the US after years of living here looks like an appealing option. But instead of pressuring immigrants from multiple directions, Trump is hammering down, again and again, to activate their single biggest fear: that the system will catch them, arrest them, and throw them into a pitiless and grinding deportation machine.

Call it the politics of fear.

Trump’s policy is marked by a little more enforcement — and a lot more vulnerability

It only took five days for the administration to make its agenda clear to unauthorized immigrants in the United States.

On January 25, Trump signed an executive order addressing immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States. Among other things, the order officially rescinded a series of Obama administration memos that laid out which immigrants should be considered priorities for deportation — and which should not.

Under the new policy, the following types of immigrants are among those prioritized for deportation: immigrants who “have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense” (which includes driving without a license in states that don’t give licenses to unauthorized immigrants); immigrants who engage in “fraud or willful representation in any official matter” (which could include paying taxes under a fake Social Security number); and immigrants who, despite not having committed any act that constitutes a “chargeable criminal offense,” are still a “risk to public safety or national security” in the eyes of the ICE agent arresting them.

Under the new policy, the following types of deportable immigrants are low priorities for deportation: none.

When President Trump, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and other Trump officials bragged about “unshackling” immigration agents, this is what they meant. Agents had more power to decide which immigrants to arrest and put into deportation proceedings, because the pool of immigrants most vulnerable to deportation had expanded by millions.

The number of immigrants actually getting arrested and put into deportation proceedings did not, of course, expand by millions.

On the ground, the Trump administration expanded enforcement mostly by going after “low-hanging fruit” — immigrants whose locations were already known. Sometimes that means going after “criminals” (in its first few months, the administration took a much more aggressive approach than its predecessor did in asking jail officials to hold immigrants for ICE pickup), but it sometimes means going after people who are coming to ICE offices for check-ins, or even going to US Citizenship and Immigration Services to interview for their green cards.

But the administration has done just enough to keep any immigrant who isn’t already on ICE’s radar from feeling really safe. It’s conducted a few high-profile, coordinated immigration raids — in which it’s arrested both the people it was seeking out and anyone else who happened to be around and deportable. One ICE source said in March that the government was deliberately planning raids in “sanctuary cities” — an effective way to remind immigrant communities that even if their local government was trying to lower their risk of deportation, it couldn’t actually protect immigrants from the feds.

Trump’s ICE is arresting more immigrants than it did under Obama’s last couple of years in office. From October to December 2016, ICE arrested an average of 9,134 immigrants a month; from February to June 2017, it arrested an average of 13,085. That’s simultaneously a big increase — a 43 percent jump — and a drop in the bucket, compared with the expansion in the pool of immigrants made vulnerable to deportation.

Under the last two years of the Obama administration, the government’s official position was that immigrants would be prioritized for deportation if they were convicted of certain serious crimes, or if they were recent border crossers or had recent final deportation orders. There were 750,000 “convicted criminal aliens”; it’s unclear how many people fell in the other two categories, but the total number of people prioritized as of January 19, 2017, was almost certainly less than 2 million — possibly much lower.

On January 25, 2017, the pool of immigrants “prioritized” — or at least not unprioritized — for deportation swelled to something like 10 million.

From mass deportation to self-deportation to mass fear

The Trump administration’s eyes were much bigger than its capacity.

The administration is operating on a budget and with a workforce set under its predecessor — which devoted much more effort to deporting immigrants from within the US than the government ever had before, but was still equipped for no more than 400,000 deportations per year. And due to the staggering immigration court backlog, those deportations are often of immigrants who were arrested years prior.

A government capable of deporting all 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants over two presidential terms would need four times the deportation capacity it currently has. Even modestly increasing deportation capacity would require an investment, in the Department of Justice (which runs immigration courts) as well as the Department of Homeland Security, that’s likely to sit uneasily with congressional Republicans who aren’t even enthusiastic about paying $1.5 billion for a few dozen miles of border “wall.”

Actually carrying out mass arrests and deportations of long-resident, law-abiding unauthorized immigrants — “good” immigrants — could generate a serious outcry (fueled by photos of families being separated by ICE agents). Many Republicans are already concerned about the politics of Trump’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which currently protects over 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allows them to work in the US legally; the politics of deporting them, along with their parents, would be even worse.

This isn’t a new problem. It’s why intellectual immigration hawks have long preferred “self-deportation” (also known as “attrition through enforcement”) over mass deportation. It might not be as brutally effective — even the most optimistic accounting suggests that 5 million immigrants could eventually be pushed to “self-deport” over the course of several years — but it’s much cheaper.

What Trump is doing isn’t quite “self-deportation” either, though. The point of “self-deportation” is that the government is using all the tools at its disposal to make it hard to support a life and a family in the US without papers — and the centerpiece of that is making it impossible to get a job under the table, by mandating all businesses use the E-Verify system and cracking down on employers who hire unauthorized workers.

The Trump administration isn’t doing that. Its legislative agenda on immigration is focused on “the wall” and on cutting legal immigration rather than E-Verify; it hasn’t stepped up workplace immigration enforcement much (drawing ire from Laura Ingraham’s website, which called workplace enforcement the “soft spot” of Trump’s policy).

Instead of using a variety of tools, it’s using a combination of policy and messaging to keep the threat of deportation hanging over immigrants’ heads. It’s not trying to get them to go home because they can’t stay here; it’s making sure they don’t get too comfortable here because they could be taken at any minute.

It’s a general law enforcement principle. Here’s how US Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley put it: When they have enough agents on a shift to catch all of the people or drugs they expect to enter the US during that time, they use their resources to catch those people and drugs. It’s only when they show up and realize they’re way undermatched (something they emphasize hasn’t happened in several years) that they bring out the floodlights and do circuits through the streets with sirens blaring — the “high-visibility” tactics.

ICE, the Border Patrol’s sister immigration force, appears to be doing something similar — not to deter immigrants from coming, but to remind those already here that their existence in the US is not a secure one.

Fear is hard to attack because it’s hard to see. It doesn’t spark political protests. It may not even be noticed by Americans who don’t know any immigrants. It’s easy to deflect onto others for causing fear — blaming immigrant organizations, for example, for spreading rumors of ICE raids. It leaves few fingerprints. And it takes little cash.

The six-month countdown clock

The January executive order let exactly one Obama-era protection stand — the DACA program — despite Trump’s promises to end Obama’s “unconstitutional executive orders” on “day one” on the campaign trail.

For months, the administration publicly weighed DACA’s fate (even as, behind the scenes, ICE got more active in stripping protections from DACA recipients, sometimes based on disputed claims of gang affiliation). Every time Trump or his government declared that the program was still in effect, a DHS spokesperson hastened to clarify that they meant “for now.”

That “for now” is over.

Trump has already mischaracterized his DACA decision as one to keep the program for the next six months while it waits for Congress to act, and then start allowing protections and work permits issued under the program (which last for two years) to expire. (Democrats have announced they’ve reached the broad outlines of a deal on DACA, but the exact details have yet to be worked out.)

The reality is that the program is winding down now. Immigrants who would have qualified for the program had they turned 15 in August, but instead turn 15 in October, will be locked out; immigrants whose DACA protections are set to expire on March 4 have only until October 5 to collect their paperwork (and $495) and apply for one last renewal.

For immigrants whose DACA protections are set to last through the next six months — who, in theory, aren’t supposed to be worried — there’s a world of difference between knowing when their work permits will expire and being able to quiet their minds until then. The expiration date isn’t a start date; it’s an end date. President Trump says the DREAMers should be turning their hopes to Congress, but his White House’s talking points urge them to start making plans to leave the country when their work permits expire.

And in the meantime, the Trump administration is already tightening the reins on DACA recipients. Border Patrol has started to detain DACA recipients at internal checkpoints, “for accuracy and verification of status,” sometimes holding them for several hours.

The Trump administration knows that telling people they have six months before being returned to the pool of vulnerability is a warning rather than a reprieve. It’s used that strategy deliberately with Haitians living in the US under Temporary Protected Status, issued after the 2010 earthquake — who are currently months into a six-month extension of protections that the government has all but promised will be their last.

Temporary Protected Status is issued to people who are living in the US from a particular country, who don’t have a legal status that allows them to stay (either because they’re here on short-term visas or because they’re unauthorized) but, due to a natural disaster or other crisis in their home countries, can’t safely return either. The longer that people are protected in the US, however, the more they put down roots here, and the less sensible it appears to revoke their protections — especially because the alternative is returning to a country that may still be on the long road to recovery from crisis. So previous governments have tended to extend TPS protections when a country comes up for review.

DHS under Kelly, however, wanted to put the “temporary” back in “Temporary Protected Status.” When TPS for Haitians came up for review in spring, Kelly granted a six-month extension but warned, “I believe there are indications that Haiti — if its recovery from the 2010 earthquake continues at pace — may not warrant further TPS extension past January 2018.”

Kelly openly acknowledged he was sending a message to Haitians — and other TPS beneficiaries. “The message is: By definition, TPS is temporary,"" he said in a press conference in Miami in June.

And by sending that message, he wanted to get recipients to “start thinking now about what will happen in the not-too-distant future.” The memo extending TPS through January made that a little clearer. “The Department of Homeland Security urges Haitian TPS recipients who do not have another immigration status to use the time before Jan. 22, 2018 to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States — including proactively seeking travel documentation — or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible.”

It’s the same language the White House talking points would use, months later, for DACA recipients.

Some Haitians have already “prepared for and arranged” their travel — to Canada, where they’re seeking asylum. But others, clinging to the fact that the Trump administration hasn’t officially declared that TPS will end, are resistant to make plans to leave the country that many of them have lived in for most of their lives. “I have nothing to go back to,” Uber driver and would-be college student Jean Jubens Jeanty told the New York Times in July. “Why not keep me here?”

This isn’t optimism. It’s simply not having alternatives. “It’s very unsettling,” a Queens College senior told the Times, “to know that you’re here and you don’t know what tomorrow is going to bring, or what is going to happen in the next couple of months.”

Losing TPS wouldn’t create certainty — it would just open up a deeper anxiety, in which fear of being deportable is replaced with fear of actually getting deported.

The government’s official line that Haitians should prepare to leave the US isn’t a promise to deport them if they don’t, or at least not a promise the government can keep. There are 58,000 Haitian TPS recipients; the government will have to make a decision by January about whether to keep protecting 86,000 Hondurans with TPS, and a decision by March about the fate of 263,000 Salvadorians.

Those are numbers too big to round up and arrest with the resources the government has now, or can get in the next six months. But dumping them into the pool of vulnerability, and making it clear that they could get arrested at any time with no legal recourse? It costs much less to send a message.

The law doesn’t deport people. People deport people.

The fact that anyone living in the US without papers could be caught by ICE at any time is only part of the politics of fear. The other part is making it seem that anyone caught by ICE is inevitably going to get deported, and there’s nothing they or their lawyers can do to stop it.

The biggest practical obstacle to mass deportation is the immigration court backlog — in practice, it takes years to deport someone who hasn’t already been ordered deported. The Trump administration hasn’t yet put much effort into moving people through immigration court faster.

This isn’t just rhetoric; it’s policy.

Under Obama, immigrants and their lawyers could often persuade ICE that they weren’t high enough enforcement priorities to merit spending resources on an immigration court prosecution; the immigration court case would be “administratively closed,” and the immigrant would be given a stay of deportation.

That practice has all but ended.

From February to June 2016, the Obama administration administratively closed an average of 2,400 cases a month. From February to June 2017, the Trump administration closed an average of fewer than 100.

An immigration lawyer told Vice that the key to closing immigration cases used to be “shaming the government” — but “now, the government is shameless.”

It’s certainly worked to appear shameless. Immigrants whose arrests provoked widespread media alarm and protests, like Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos (arrested in February after 22 years in the US), might have been spared by the Obama administration’s desire to avoid bad press. The Trump administration deported Rayos in the middle of the night.

And then in May, ICE granted Vizguerra (and another Denver-area immigrant who’d taken church refuge) a stay of deportation. She was able to return home in time for Mother’s Day; “I have missed my kids. The fight is for them,” she told reporters.

Vizguerra’s stay was granted thanks to the involvement of local members of Congress, under a procedure that has become more stringent under Trump. In other cases, the administration has simply decided to grant extensions (often short-term ones) to particularly sympathetic immigrants.

When a community is this taut with fear, any news or sign or rumor attracts disproportionate attention. So any policy change — or any sign that a policy change is being considered — is often greeted as a signal that “mass deportation” is coming, or that it’s already here.

Some DACA recipients are incredibly worried about getting rounded up when their protections expire. Some have even voiced a fear that they’ll be put in camps (an image that evokes not only the concentration camps in which Japanese Americans were put during World War II but the “tent cities” of Trump pardon beneficiary Joe Arpaio).

The Democrats aren ’ t going to get away with holding the federal government hostage to their radical open-borders agenda . Not again .
The Democrats know that they got the Republicans to cave during the previous budget impasse , which produced a bloated $ 1.3 trillion Omnibus spending bill that didn ’ t fund construction of the border wall . President Trump reluctantly signed that bill , but he did so with a vow that he would never again put his signature on such a bad piece of legislation .
“ As a matter of National Security I 've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill . I say to Congress : I will NEVER sign another bill like this again , ” the President declared in March . “ To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again , I 'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills ! ”
He made his position even more clear in July , pledging to fix the country ’ s broken immigration system even if it requires a shutdown .
“ I don ’ t care what the political ramifications are , our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades , and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown , ” he tweeted . “ Border Security is National Security , and National Security is the long-term viability of our Country . A Government Shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and Prosperous America ! ”
Prior to the last budget impasse , President Trump offered congressional Democrats a surprisingly generous deal , offering to accept legal status for nearly a million DACA recipients in exchange for funding of the border wall .

The Democrats aren’t going to get away with holding the federal government hostage to their radical open-borders agenda. Not again.

The Democrats know that they got the Republicans to cave during the previous budget impasse, which produced a bloated $1.3 trillion Omnibus spending bill that didn’t fund construction of the border wall. President Trump reluctantly signed that bill, but he did so with a vow that he would never again put his signature on such a bad piece of legislation.

“As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill. I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again,” the President declared in March. “To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills!”

He made his position even more clear in July, pledging to fix the country’s broken immigration system even if it requires a shutdown.

“I don’t care what the political ramifications are, our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades, and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown,” he tweeted. “Border Security is National Security, and National Security is the long-term viability of our Country. A Government Shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and Prosperous America!”

Prior to the last budget impasse, President Trump offered congressional Democrats a surprisingly generous deal, offering to accept legal status for nearly a million DACA recipients in exchange for funding of the border wall. True to form, though, the obstructionist Democrats rejected the President’s good-faith overture, even though the $5 billion he requested for the wall would have accounted for less than 0.004 percent of the amount Congress ended up appropriating.

Now, with a partial government shutdown looming if a deal to fund seven government agencies can’t be concluded by December 21, President Trump has a perfect opportunity to follow through on his pledge while finally getting the border wall funding he has sought since the beginning of his presidency.

Senate Democrats insist that they will not accept more than $1.6 billion for border security, and they’re threatening to punish the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), if the President doesn’t capitulate.

In order to get their way, the Democrats will do everything in their power to portray a potential partial government shutdown as a national catastrophe, but that’s just more fearmongering intended to manipulate the public and the press.

In reality, about two-thirds of the federal government is already funded through a budget deal reached earlier in the year, so a partial shutdown would not affect most federal employees, including those serving in the armed forces.

Call it ‘Trumplaw.’

A strange madness is gripping the federal judiciary. It is in the process of crafting a new standard of judicial review, one that does violence to existing precedent, good sense, and even national security for the sake of defeating Donald Trump. We’ll call this new jurisprudence “Trumplaw,” and its latest victim is once again the so-called Trump travel ban. The perpetrator is the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

This afternoon, the Fourth Circuit upheld a nationwide injunction on Trump’s temporary halt on immigration from six majority-Muslim countries — each of which is either a state sponsor of terrorism (Sudan and Iran) or overrun with terrorist violence, with entire regions under jihadist control (Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Somalia). Indeed, some of these countries no longer have a recognizably functional government.

Here is the essence of the court’s ruling: Trump’s campaign statements were so grotesque that they not only (1) hurt the feelings of a Muslim resident so much that he was granted standing to challenge an executive order that did not apply to him, but also (2) rendered an otherwise lawful executive order so damaging that the harm to the plaintiff’s feelings (and his wife’s possibly delayed entry into the United States) outweigh the government’s asserted national-security interest in pausing to reexamine foreign entry from hostile and war-torn countries.

Since Trumplaw is such a novel form of jurisprudence, it’s exceedingly hard to square with existing precedent. So, when existing precedent either doesn’t apply or cuts against the overriding demand to stop Trump, then it’s up to the court to yank that law out of context, misinterpret it, and then functionally rewrite it to reach the “right” result.

Take, for example, the Fourth Circuit’s reading of a Supreme Court case called Kleindienst v. Mandel. In Mandel, a collection of scholars demanded that the U.S. grant a non-immigrant visa to Belgian Marxist journalist. The government had denied him entry under provisions of American law excluding those who advocated or published “the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism.” Make no mistake, the First Amendment protects the right to advocate or publish Marxist doctrines every bit as much as it protects the free exercise of the Islamic faith. Yet the Supreme Court still ruled against the Belgian journalist:

We hold that, when the Executive exercises [its] power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the First Amendment interests of those who seek personal communication with the applicant.

The meaning is clear. If the order is supported by legitimate and bona fide reasons on its face, you simply don’t go beyond the document. By that standard, the executive order is easily and clearly lawful. On its face, the order asserts a legitimate and bona fide national-security justification. On its face, the order isn’t remotely a Muslim ban. On its face it doesn’t target the Muslim faith in any way, shape, or form. On its face it describes exactly why each nation is included. The Fourth Circuit, however, interpreted Mandel to argue that the Court looked only at the face of the document to determine whether its supporting reasons were legitimate, not whether they were “bona fide.” It could go “behind” the document to determine “good faith.”

Yet, as the dissent notes, this approach would have altered the outcome not only in Mandel itself, but also in other key Supreme Court cases. Indeed, in those cases the Court expressly declined to look behind notices and documents to explore the subjective motivations of relevant government officials.

All this adds up to Trumplaw, the assertion by the federal judiciary of the legal authority to stop Trump. But don’t think Trumplaw will end when Trump himself leaves office.

The White House on Sunday night also asked to limit family-based green cards to spouses and the minor children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, in addition to creating a point-based system.

And it called for boosting fees at border crossings, making it easier to deport gang members and unaccompanied children, and overhauling the asylum system.

Conway also said Monday that the White House requests are the result of collaborations with such agencies as the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.

`` It will never pass the Senate , not today , not next week , not next year . So President Trump , if you want to open the government , you must abandon the wall , plain and simple , '' Schumer said on the Senate floor .
The partial shutdown began at midnight Saturday , a few hours after the House and Senate adjourned without getting a funding agreement to the president 's desk . The shutdown was expected to last at least a few days , with sources on both sides of the aisle telling ███ that Washington could be in for a prolonged shutdown .
The Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon and was not due to meet for a scheduled session until Thursday . Early Saturday evening , the House also concluded for the day .
Vice President Mike Pence and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney arrived at the Capitol Saturday afternoon to meet with Schumer to continue negotiations for an end to the stalemate . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said that `` productive discussions are continuing . ''
`` When those negotiations produce a solution that is acceptable to all parties -- which means 60 votes in the Senate , a majority in the House , and a presidential signature -- at that point , we will take it up here on the Senate floor , '' he said .
Late Saturday afternoon , a Schumer spokesman said that `` the vice president came in for a discussion and made an offer . Unfortunately , we 're still very far apart . ''
In a letter addressed to fellow Democratic colleagues on Saturday , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , wrote that `` Last night , Republicans shut down the government . '' She added that barring any developments , making `` progress to end the Trump Shutdown in the next several days '' was not anticipated .
`` Until President Trump can publicly commit to a bipartisan resolution , there will be no agreement before January when the new House Democratic Majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government , '' Pelosi wrote , before expressing her wishes for a happy holiday .
With the standoff grinding on , the White House revealed on Saturday that the president planned to stay in the nation 's capital over the holiday .
“ Due to the shutdown , President Trump will remain in Washington , D.C. and the First Lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together , ” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement .
The main sticking point for negotiations was funding for Trump 's signature 2016 campaign promise of a wall on the southern border . Trump had demanded $ 5.7 billion for wall funding , and a bill with that funding attached passed the House on Friday . But efforts have derailed in the Senate , where 60 votes were required for passage , and therefore Democrat votes are needed in conjunction with support by the GOP .
Democrats have poured cold water on the idea that they would support anything close to that . Schumer , in his remarks Saturday , said that the wall was a `` bone to the hard right '' and that they had proposed $ 1.3 billion for `` border security . ''
`` I ’ ve heard the president and his allies in the media say that Democrats don ’ t support border security . Nothing could be further from the truth . Democrats have always been for smart and effective ways to secure our border , '' he said . `` We are pushing for technology , like drones and sensors , and inspection equipment . ''
McConnell accused Democrats of backing away from past support for border security , and said they were rejecting a `` reasonable request '' for the $ 5 billion in funding .
`` They ’ ve refused to meet President Trump halfway and provide even one-fifth of the resources for the border they were willing to provide just a few months ago , '' he said on the Senate floor .
Trump has been keen to blame Democrats for the impasse and on Friday urged McConnell to invoke the so-called “ nuclear option ” which would change Senate procedure to require only a simple majority to approve the bill -- therefore allowing Republicans to override Democratic objections .
“ Mitch , use the Nuclear Option and get it done ! Our Country is counting on you ! ” he tweeted on Friday .
IF TRUMP DOES N'T GET WALL FUNDING , IT COULD SPELL TROUBLE FOR HIS 'ELECTORAL FUTURE ' : MOLLIE HEMINGWAY
Late Friday he emphasized the need for a wall in a video he posted to Twitter , and he blamed the shutdown on the Democrats .
“ We ’ re going to have a shutdown , there ’ s nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes , ” he said . “ Call it a Democrat shutdown , call it whatever you want , but we need their help to get this approved . ”
That contrasted with remarks he made last week during an explosive Oval Office face-off with Schumer and Pelosi , in which he said he was `` proud '' to shut down the government for border security .
`` I will take the mantle . I will be the one to shut it down . I ’ m not going to blame you for it , ” he said .
On Saturday , Trump held a lunch at the White House to discuss border security with staff and top conservatives including Reps. Mark Meadows , R-N.C. , Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , Matt Gaetz , R-Fla. , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , and Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah . The inclusion of some of the more hardline voices on immigration could likely serve to harden Trump 's resolve against backing down on the wall .

Mr. Trump announced a winding down of DACA in September 2017, triggering a legal fight that is still ongoing. He has talked about resolving the issue in favor of the undocumented immigrants but had refused to consider it as part of a deal to end the shutdown because of the litigation.

“If the Supreme Court overrules that wrong executive order, we’ll have a deal very quickly on DACA and other things. And the Democrats want that, and so do we,” Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 4 news conference.

The president offered legal protections, including citizenship, to young immigrants as part of immigration negotiations last year.

Mr. Trump on Saturday also offered a three-year extension of the Temporary Protected Status program that acts as a shield on deportation from unauthorized immigrants from certain countries, saying that he was open to allowing a reprieve for up to 300,000 people in it.

The Trump administration had moved to cancel the program for people from several Central American nations who had been granted the reprieve years ago after natural disasters in their home countries; critics had said the program should be as “temporary” as its name suggested.

Supporters of greater protections for participants in the TPS program, and DACA, have said that they are especially necessary because of violence and instability in those Central American countries, such as El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.

immigration,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/18/obama-immigrants-refuse-to-be-stopped-by-court-dec/,"Obama, immigrants refuse to be stopped by court decision",2015-02-18,Stephen Dinan,"Both the White House and illegal immigrants said Tuesday that they would not be swayed by a federal judge ’ s decision in Texas halting President Obama ’ s deportation amnesty as overstepping the bounds of his powers .
Within hours of the decision , immigrants had said they would still prepare to apply for the program and the White House was vowing to appeal the ruling that accused Mr. Obama of granting “ benefits and privileges ” to people that the law says should be deported .
In a ruling late Monday , Judge Andrew S. Hanen said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was “ not just rewriting the laws ; he is creating them from scratch ” when he wrote the amnesty , which could have granted tentative legal status , work permits and Social Security numbers to more than 4 million illegal immigrants . Judge Hanen issued an injunction halting the program until he can hold a full trial .
The administration was poised to start accepting amnesty applications Wednesday , but it found itself scrambling to regroup while insisting it will eventually win the court fight .
On Capitol Hill , Republicans said now that a judge has ruled the president ’ s actions are likely illegal , Democrats should stop filibustering the Homeland Security spending bill , which they have been blocking as part of their defense of Mr. Obama ’ s immigration plans .
Judge Hanen ’ s 123-page ruling doesn ’ t mean any of the illegal immigrants who would have been approved for the amnesty will be deported . The judge said Mr. Obama does have the discretion to decide whom to deport given the resources he has , and the president has said he won ’ t deport longtime illegal immigrants without serious criminal records .
But the judge said the president and Mr. Johnson went beyond those powers when they created a program proactively allowing illegal immigrants to come forward and be granted driver ’ s licenses , work permits and potentially billions of dollars in tax credits .
“ Instead of merely refusing to enforce the [ Immigration and Naturalization Act ’ s ] removal laws against an individual , the DHS has enacted a wide-reaching program that awards legal presence , to individuals Congress has deemed deportable or removable , as well as the ability to obtain Social Security numbers , work authorization permits and the ability to travel . Absent [ the program ] , these individuals would not receive these benefits , ” Judge Hanen wrote .
Immigrant rights advocates , who predicted Judge Hanen ’ s ruling , spent weeks trying to undercut him by arguing that he was biased from the start .
One immigrant rights group called Judge Hanen ’ s decision “ judicial vigilantism. ” Another called it a “ minor legal bump ” and said it ’ s “ merely a matter of time ” before illegal immigrants win legal status .
Mr. Obama , speaking to reporters in the Oval Office , said he would respect the judge ’ s ruling but predicted an eventual court victory and said the Homeland Security Department will be ready once courts approve his actions .
“ The law is on our side , and history is on our side , ” Mr. Obama said .
Mr. Obama ’ s amnesty had two parts . The first was an expansion of a 2012 policy , Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , granting tentative legal status and work permits to so-called Dreamers , or illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children , who are viewed as the most sympathetic figures in the debate . The second part , known as Deferred Action for Parental Accountability , granted similar benefits to illegal immigrants whose children are American citizens or legal permanent residents .
Judge Hanen halted both parts of the amnesty , though he left in place the original 2012 policy for Dreamers .
The administration was prepared to start accepting applications for the expanded Dreamers program Wednesday and parental accountability applications in mid-May . Mr. Johnson announced Tuesday afternoon that he was putting both plans on hold in light of Judge Hanen ’ s ruling .
“ The Department of Justice will appeal that temporary injunction ; in the meantime , we recognize we must comply with it , ” Mr. Johnson said in a statement , adding that he still believes Mr. Obama acted within the law despite the court ruling .
Immigrant rights groups told illegal immigrants to continue preparing their applications . They predicted that an appeals court would step in and stay Judge Hanen ’ s ruling . Some activists continued with rallies scheduled to coincide with the beginning of the application period , saying they want immigrants to be ready to file immediately .
“ We may be delayed , but we will not be deterred , ” said Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez , Illinois Democrat . “ I am telling immigrant communities to keep preparing to sign up millions of families for protection from deportation . ”
In the near term , the ruling further roils the debate on Capitol Hill , where House Republicans have passed a bill to fund the Homeland Security Department while halting Mr. Obama ’ s amnesties — and Senate Democrats are blocking it through a filibuster .
Both sides are blaming each other for threatening funding for Mr. Johnson ’ s department that expires Feb. 27 . Most of the department ’ s employees are deemed essential and will remain on the job even with a shutdown , though pay would be delayed for many of them .
House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said Judge Hanen ’ s ruling should break the impasse and that Democrats are holding up Homeland Security funding in order to defend an illegal action by the president .
Democrats countered that they believe courts will uphold the president ’ s amnesty and they won ’ t accept any Homeland Security bill that questions Mr. Obama ’ s actions .
“ This procedural ruling , in our opinion , is very unlikely to be upheld , but regardless of the outcome , Democrats remain united in our believe that funding for the Department of Homeland Security should not be used as a ransom by Republicans , period , ” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat .","Both the White House and illegal immigrants said Tuesday that they would not be swayed by a federal judge’s decision in Texas halting President Obama’s deportation amnesty as overstepping the bounds of his powers.

Within hours of the decision, immigrants had said they would still prepare to apply for the program and the White House was vowing to appeal the ruling that accused Mr. Obama of granting “benefits and privileges” to people that the law says should be deported.

In a ruling late Monday, Judge Andrew S. Hanen said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was “not just rewriting the laws; he is creating them from scratch” when he wrote the amnesty, which could have granted tentative legal status, work permits and Social Security numbers to more than 4 million illegal immigrants. Judge Hanen issued an injunction halting the program until he can hold a full trial.

The administration was poised to start accepting amnesty applications Wednesday, but it found itself scrambling to regroup while insisting it will eventually win the court fight.

On Capitol Hill, Republicans said now that a judge has ruled the president’s actions are likely illegal, Democrats should stop filibustering the Homeland Security spending bill, which they have been blocking as part of their defense of Mr. Obama’s immigration plans.

Judge Hanen’s 123-page ruling doesn’t mean any of the illegal immigrants who would have been approved for the amnesty will be deported. The judge said Mr. Obama does have the discretion to decide whom to deport given the resources he has, and the president has said he won’t deport longtime illegal immigrants without serious criminal records.

But the judge said the president and Mr. Johnson went beyond those powers when they created a program proactively allowing illegal immigrants to come forward and be granted driver’s licenses, work permits and potentially billions of dollars in tax credits.

“Instead of merely refusing to enforce the [Immigration and Naturalization Act’s] removal laws against an individual, the DHS has enacted a wide-reaching program that awards legal presence, to individuals Congress has deemed deportable or removable, as well as the ability to obtain Social Security numbers, work authorization permits and the ability to travel. Absent [the program], these individuals would not receive these benefits,” Judge Hanen wrote.

Immigrant rights advocates, who predicted Judge Hanen’s ruling, spent weeks trying to undercut him by arguing that he was biased from the start.

One immigrant rights group called Judge Hanen’s decision “judicial vigilantism.” Another called it a “minor legal bump” and said it’s “merely a matter of time” before illegal immigrants win legal status.

Mr. Obama, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, said he would respect the judge’s ruling but predicted an eventual court victory and said the Homeland Security Department will be ready once courts approve his actions.

“The law is on our side, and history is on our side,” Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama’s amnesty had two parts. The first was an expansion of a 2012 policy, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, granting tentative legal status and work permits to so-called Dreamers, or illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, who are viewed as the most sympathetic figures in the debate. The second part, known as Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, granted similar benefits to illegal immigrants whose children are American citizens or legal permanent residents.

Judge Hanen halted both parts of the amnesty, though he left in place the original 2012 policy for Dreamers.

The administration was prepared to start accepting applications for the expanded Dreamers program Wednesday and parental accountability applications in mid-May. Mr. Johnson announced Tuesday afternoon that he was putting both plans on hold in light of Judge Hanen’s ruling.

“The Department of Justice will appeal that temporary injunction; in the meantime, we recognize we must comply with it,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement, adding that he still believes Mr. Obama acted within the law despite the court ruling.

Immigrant rights groups told illegal immigrants to continue preparing their applications. They predicted that an appeals court would step in and stay Judge Hanen’s ruling. Some activists continued with rallies scheduled to coincide with the beginning of the application period, saying they want immigrants to be ready to file immediately.

“We may be delayed, but we will not be deterred,” said Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, Illinois Democrat. “I am telling immigrant communities to keep preparing to sign up millions of families for protection from deportation.”

In the near term, the ruling further roils the debate on Capitol Hill, where House Republicans have passed a bill to fund the Homeland Security Department while halting Mr. Obama’s amnesties — and Senate Democrats are blocking it through a filibuster.

Both sides are blaming each other for threatening funding for Mr. Johnson’s department that expires Feb. 27. Most of the department’s employees are deemed essential and will remain on the job even with a shutdown, though pay would be delayed for many of them.

House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said Judge Hanen’s ruling should break the impasse and that Democrats are holding up Homeland Security funding in order to defend an illegal action by the president.

Democrats countered that they believe courts will uphold the president’s amnesty and they won’t accept any Homeland Security bill that questions Mr. Obama’s actions.

“This procedural ruling, in our opinion, is very unlikely to be upheld, but regardless of the outcome, Democrats remain united in our believe that funding for the Department of Homeland Security should not be used as a ransom by Republicans, period,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.

immigration,CBS News,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-moves-to-end-protections-for-central-american-asylum-seekers/,Trump administration moves to end protections for Central American asylum seekers,,,"The Trump administration on Monday moved to end asylum protections for most Central American migrants in a major escalation of the president 's battle to tamp down the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border .
According to a new rule published in the Federal Register , asylum seekers who pass through another country first will be ineligible for asylum at the U.S. southern border . The rule , expected to go into effect on Tuesday , also applies to children who have crossed the border alone . The new rule will affect asylum seekers coming through Mexico from countries like Guatemala and El Salvador .
There are some exceptions : If someone has been trafficked , if the country the migrant passed through did not sign one of the major international treaties that govern how refugees are managed ( though most Western countries have signed them ) or if an asylum-seeker sought protection in a country but was denied , then a migrant could still apply for U.S. asylum .
But the move by President Trump 's administration was meant to essentially end asylum protections as they now are on the southern border . Mr. Trump has long vented his frustrations with the U.S. asylum system , insisting Democrats need to change the laws .
The policy is almost certain to face a legal challenge , and shortly after the new rule was announced , the American Civil Liberties Union said it intends to sue .
`` The Trump administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country 's legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger . This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue swiftly , '' said Lee Gelernt , deputy director of the ACLU 's Immigrants ' Rights Project .
U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive at the U.S. regardless of how they did so , but there is an exception for those who have come through a country considered to be `` safe . '' But the Immigration and Nationality Act , which governs asylum law , is vague on how a country is determined `` safe '' ; it says `` pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement . ''
`` While the recent supplemental funding was absolutely vital to helping confront the crisis , the truth is that it will not be enough without targeted changes to the legal framework of our immigration system , '' Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in a statement . `` Until Congress can act , this interim rule will help reduce a major 'pull ' factor driving irregular migration to the United States and enable DHS and DOJ to more quickly and efficiently process cases originating from the southern border , leading to fewer individuals transiting through Mexico on a dangerous journey . ''
The Mexican government says Mexican policy remains unchanged , and Mexico will not send people back to countries where they fear prosecution .
Attorney General William Barr insisted the new rule will `` decrease forum shopping by economic migrants and those who seek to exploit our asylum system to obtain entry to the United States—while ensuring that no one is removed from the United States who is more likely than not to be tortured or persecuted on account of a protected ground . ''
Right now , the U.S. has such an agreement , known as a `` safe third country , '' only with Canada . Under a recent agreement with Mexico , Central American countries were considering a regional compact on the issue , but nothing has been decided . Guatemalan officials were expected in Washington on Monday , but apparently a meeting between Mr. Trump and Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales was canceled amid a court challenge in Guatemala over whether the country could agree to a safe third with the U.S .
The new rule also will apply to the initial asylum screening , known as a `` credible fear '' interview , at which migrants must prove they have credible fears of returning to their home country . It applies to migrants who are arriving to the U.S. , not those who are already in the country .
Trump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win . But immigrant rights groups , religious leaders and humanitarian groups have said the Republican administration 's policies amount to a cruel and calloused effort to keep immigrants out of the country . Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador are poor countries suffering from violence .
Along with the administration 's recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border , Mr. Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum , and Attorney General William Barr recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out .
Nearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts .
Immigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases , meaning many people wo n't have their asylum claims heard for years , despite the fact that more judges are being hired .
People are generally eligible for asylum in the U.S. if they fear return to their home country because they have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear that they will be persecuted on the basis of race , religion , nationality or membership in a particular social group .
During the budget year for 2009 , there were 35,811 asylum claims , and 8,384 were granted . During 2018 budget year , there were 162,060 claims filed , and 13,168 were granted .","The Trump administration on Monday moved to end asylum protections for most Central American migrants in a major escalation of the president's battle to tamp down the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""The Trump administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country's legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger. This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue swiftly,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project.

U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive at the U.S. regardless of how they did so, but there is an exception for those who have come through a country considered to be ""safe."" But the Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs asylum law, is vague on how a country is determined ""safe""; it says ""pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement.""

""While the recent supplemental funding was absolutely vital to helping confront the crisis, the truth is that it will not be enough without targeted changes to the legal framework of our immigration system,"" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in a statement. ""Until Congress can act, this interim rule will help reduce a major 'pull' factor driving irregular migration to the United States and enable DHS and DOJ to more quickly and efficiently process cases originating from the southern border, leading to fewer individuals transiting through Mexico on a dangerous journey.""

The Mexican government says Mexican policy remains unchanged, and Mexico will not send people back to countries where they fear prosecution.

Attorney General William Barr insisted the new rule will ""decrease forum shopping by economic migrants and those who seek to exploit our asylum system to obtain entry to the United States—while ensuring that no one is removed from the United States who is more likely than not to be tortured or persecuted on account of a protected ground.""

Right now, the U.S. has such an agreement, known as a ""safe third country,"" only with Canada. Under a recent agreement with Mexico, Central American countries were considering a regional compact on the issue, but nothing has been decided. Guatemalan officials were expected in Washington on Monday, but apparently a meeting between Mr. Trump and Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales was canceled amid a court challenge in Guatemala over whether the country could agree to a safe third with the U.S.

The new rule also will apply to the initial asylum screening, known as a ""credible fear"" interview, at which migrants must prove they have credible fears of returning to their home country. It applies to migrants who are arriving to the U.S., not those who are already in the country.

Trump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. But immigrant rights groups, religious leaders and humanitarian groups have said the Republican administration's policies amount to a cruel and calloused effort to keep immigrants out of the country. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are poor countries suffering from violence.

Along with the administration's recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border, Mr. Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum, and Attorney General William Barr recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out.

Nearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts.

Immigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases, meaning many people won't have their asylum claims heard for years, despite the fact that more judges are being hired.

People are generally eligible for asylum in the U.S. if they fear return to their home country because they have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear that they will be persecuted on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group.

During the budget year for 2009, there were 35,811 asylum claims, and 8,384 were granted. During 2018 budget year, there were 162,060 claims filed, and 13,168 were granted.",www.cbsnews.com,left,GZyUw9NsnAKmSEEj

Senate negotiators cleared the last major hurdle to reaching a bipartisan immigration reform deal Saturday as labor and business groups signed off on a visa program for future low-skilled workers, according to sources familiar with the talks.

The agreement marks a major breakthrough and significantly improves the odds of passing a larger immigration bill because it brings two powerful Washington interests on board on an issue that contributed to the defeat of past reform efforts.

The visa program, which allows businesses to bring in up to 200,000 low-skilled workers annually depending on economic conditions, would be among the most controversial elements of the overhaul package. But the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are expected to play a key role in helping blunt attacks by conservatives activists and liberals.

“This issue has always been the dealbreaker on immigration reform, but not this time,” Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leader of the Senate’s Gang of Eight, said in a statement Saturday night.

The Gang of Eight remains in negotiations on the broader bill. The senators have reached tentative agreement on many of the major issues, including the path to citizenship and border security, but they have yet to review the legislative language and caution that they don’t have a deal until they agree on everything.

The reform bill is so complex that none of the senators is willing to say they have an agreement until they can look at it on paper. The group is preparing to spend the next week finalizing the legislation, with an announcement likely to come when they return from the Easter recess on April 8 — although it will mark the start of a long and difficult road to passage.

There has been a remarkable level of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans in the Gang of Eight, but their alliance will be tested once the details of their agreement become known. The bill is expected to include a 10-year path to legal permanent status for the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants, billions of dollars for new border security measures, and reforms to the legal immigration program.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the Gang of Eight, sent a letter Saturday to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) urging against “excessive haste” when considering the expected bill. Rubio asked that Leahy hold “meaningful hearings,” with a particular focus on border security and the benchmarks that must be met before undocumented immigrants can obtain legal permanent residence status.

“My strong belief that the success of any major legislation depends on the acceptance and support of the American people,” Rubio wrote in the letter. “That support can only be earned through full and careful consideration of legislative language and an open process of amendments.”

The deal between the AFL-CIO and the Chamber, two fierce rivals, is yet another sign of how dramatically the politics of immigration reform have shifted since the 2012 election — and the last major attempt to pass a bill in 2007.

After months of difficult negotiations—which nearly derailed an immigration deal—the business community and labor unions hashed out a new work-visa program to allow up to 200,000 low-skill workers to come to the U.S . Adding extra visas for meat , poultry and fish cutters was n't part of that deal . Including it was the work of Mr. Graham , said people familiar with the negotiations .
The final bill sets aside up to 20,000 additional visas for meat cutters and trimmers . The industry employed 158,480 Americans nationwide in May 2012 , according to the Labor Department .
In Mr. Graham 's state , broilers—chickens raised for meat—are the number one commodity . The industry generated $ 698 million in South Carolina in 2011 , nearly 27 % of all agricultural cash in the state , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Turkeys were the second-largest commodity in the state .
The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union is n't pleased about the visas to bring in more foreign workers , saying there is no labor shortage in the industry .
`` The way we view this is it 's an earmark for meat and poultry and we strongly , strongly oppose it , '' said Tim Schlittner , a spokesman for the labor union . `` It appears to have been dropped in the bill at the 11th hour.Quite frankly , we 're taken back by its inclusion . ''
Mr. Schlittner said the UFCW supports comprehensive immigration reform , but will fight the meat-visa provision . `` We do n't want this provision to poison what is otherwise a giant step forward towards comprehensive reform , '' he said .
As for inserting the provision , `` Sen. Graham appreciates the credit , but he 'd like to share it with his other seven colleagues , '' Kevin Bishop , Mr. Graham 's spokesman , said in an email .
Meantime , Mr. Bennet , working with an association that represents most of Colorado 's ski resorts , crafted a provision to make it easier for them to hire foreign ski instructors . Instead of using a visa program for temporary , low-skilled workers , ski instructors would be eligible to come to the U.S. under the same program that professional athletes use . Current law allows those athletes to stay in the U.S. for up to a decade .
Ski areas are hiring fewer foreign workers for jobs such as housekeeping and lift-operating since the recession because more Americans have been eager to take those jobs , said Melanie Mills , president of Colorado Ski Country USA , which represents 21 of Colorado 's 25 ski areas . But finding certified ski instructors , especially ones who speak other languages and can communicate with foreign tourists , has been a problem .
`` The perfect example of this is a certified ski instructor that speaks Portuguese , '' said Ms. Mills , noting it is a safety hazard if instructors ca n't communicate with their students . `` We can advertise anywhere , and we just ca n't find somebody who meets those qualifications . ''
An aide to Mr. Bennet said tourism is an important industry for Colorado—and therefore an important priority for Mr. Bennet—and that the provision would benefit ski resorts nationwide .
For Mr. Schumer , the immigration bill was an opportunity to weave in an extra 10,500 visas for Irish people with at least a high-school degree . An aide to Mr. Schumer said the provision would right a 1965 change to immigration law that was supposed to end bias against Latin American , Asian and African immigrants but `` inadvertently made it difficult for Irish immigrants to obtain visas , despite their strong cultural ties to the U.S .

Immigrant rights advocates argue that while Hispanics may not be single-issue voters, immigration has become a “threshold issue” and they tune out candidates they see as anti-immigrant.

The last time the Tucson resident got behind the wheel , his pregnant daughter was in pain , and he was driving her to an urgent care clinic at 2 a.m . He was pulled over by a police officer . When the unauthorized immigrant was unable to produce a valid driver ’ s license , the officer called immigration and an agent took Mr. Victorino to a detention center .
Victorino had worked as a mechanic in an auto repair shop for 16 years . By the time he was released from the detention center two months later , he had lost his job .
The native of Ciudad Juárez in Mexico , who came to the United States 18 years ago with his wife , says he is n't sure why he was n't deported but thinks it was because of his clean record . In cases such as Victorino ’ s , the government often exercises prosecutorial discretion to allow detainees with no criminal background to avoid deportation . He gave up driving because he doesn ’ t want to do anything else that might jeopardize his and his wife ’ s lives in America .
Whether Victorino picks up his car keys again may depend on the US Supreme Court , which is scheduled to hear a case Monday that will determine whether two of President Obama ’ s executive actions , designed to give relief to an estimated 4 million unauthorized immigrants , are allowed to take effect .
For the administration , the immigration reforms would allow millions of people who have spent more than a decade in the country to fully contribute to the society in which they live . For opponents , one of the Constitution ’ s most hallowed principles – the separation of powers – is at stake , not to mention the rule of law .
But the impact is most intimate and immediate for millions of families like Victorino ’ s . Faced with more legal uncertainty , and now the added alarm of rhetoric from Republican presidential candidates on illegal immigration , they say they have never been more unsure about whether to stay in the shadows or come out into the light .
“ The skepticism and anxiety in this population is quite evident , ” says Muzaffar Chashti , head of Migration Policy Institute ’ s New York office. “ They have been salivating for comprehensive immigration reform for 10 years now , and they ’ ve had their hopes dashed every time . ”
A Supreme Court tie would force Victorino and his wife , Norma Rodriguez , to retreat into their home and file away the purple folder filled with family birth certificates , school records , and old utility bills they are collecting as proof of their lives here . Victorino says he would occasionally earn some cash fixing friends ’ broken cars and Rodriguez would care for children at home , halting plans to get trained as a certified senior care provider .
The couple would then turn to one of their four daughters , who became a lawful resident after marrying a citizen , to help them gain legal status . But before Nancy Alvarez can sponsor her parents , she would have to become a citizen herself and prove that she has enough assets to support them , as well as her own family .
“ We can only wait and hope for a favorable outcome at the Supreme Court , ” Victorino says .
The two actions were both announced by Mr. Obama in 2014 . The first would broaden the eligibility requirements for the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program , which offered people who entered the US before they turned 16 and before June 2007 a renewable work permit and exemption from deportation . The second would lower the priority for removing undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US since 2010 and have children who are citizens or permanent residents . The program , called the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents ( DAPA ) , also provides a three-year , renewable work permit .
A month after Obama announced both programs , 26 states sued the administration . Andrew Hanen , a federal judge in southern Texas , issued a preliminary injunction blocking the expanded DACA and DAPA programs . The administration appealed but the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction . The Supreme Court – reduced to eight justices after the death of Antonin Scalia in February – will now hear the case , US v. Texas , on Monday , with a decision expected in June . In the event of a tie , the Fifth Circuit ’ s decision will stand .
The administration argues that with federal resources already stretched thin , authorities have to prioritize whom they target for deportation . Obama ’ s executive actions sought to focus efforts on those with criminal records , while providing temporary relief to otherwise law-abiding immigrants , including children and adults who , like Victorino , have children who are citizens or permanent residents .
These kinds of “ mixed-status ” families are becoming increasingly common , experts say . At least 9 million people live in such families , according to a 2011 Pew report . Research has shown that growing up with parents in the country illegally puts children at a disadvantage . A recent report from the Migration Policy Institute found that those children were more at risk for health problems , developmental delays , and low school achievement . The poverty rate for DAPA families is 36 percent , compared with 14 percent for families with US-born parents , according to MPI . Providing work authorization for unauthorized parents in these families could raise their income by 10 percent .
But others say the law can not make exceptions and remain the law .
“ We can ’ t make a public policy that says you get to ignore immigration laws if you have a child here , ” says Jon Feere , “ otherwise the result is people coming here illegally in the ninth month of pregnancy . ”
Mr. Feere , who is a legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies , is also critical of the administration ’ s prioritization rationale .
“ That ’ s not how immigration laws are supposed to operate , ” he says . “ If you ’ re here illegally you ’ re required to leave . Violence shouldn ’ t be a prerequisite for immigration enforcement . ”
Texas and its co-respondents have also argued that , were Obama ’ s executive actions to be upheld , it would open the door for sweeping executive powers that could allow future presidents to circumvent the legislature and judiciary on a range of issues .
For undocumented immigrants across the country , the protracted legal battle – and the extreme political climate that has emerged around it – has exacerbated years of uncertainty and anxiety over their future in the country .
“ The people eligible for DAPA have been here a while , so they ’ ve been living with that stress for years , ” says Shane Ellison , deputy executive director of the Nebraska chapter of Justice For Our Neighbors , a national immigrant advocacy group , who authored an amicus brief supporting the administration . “ Some folks might decide it ’ s not worth it , that they can ’ t bear it anymore and that they have to go back to whatever difficult situation in the first place made them come here . ”
Merced Cruz hasn ’ t seen her family in Mexico in 18 years – even for funerals .
Ms. Cruz and her husband came to America on temporary visas to work in 2003 , but stayed after her husband was diagnosed with cancer in order for him to have better medical care . Their children were both born in the US , but have grown up “ in the shadows ” with their parents .
Like many “ mixed-status ” families , where some family members have legal status and others do not , the Des Moines family struggles to make ends meet .
“ You can go anywhere and have a problem , ” she says . “ You have to go to work or take your children to school , you have to go to your job , but always with that fear . ”
For Cruz , who would be eligible for DAPA , the program would give her more economic security and freedom of movement . She works two part-time jobs , while her husband ’ s illness means he can only work for a few hours each day . He ’ s run out of medication several times because they couldn ’ t afford a refill , she says . One bright spot for the family : Her daughter will be going to college this fall on a full scholarship .
“ Otherwise it would be impossible , ” she says . “ I don ’ t make enough money to do that ; I make just enough to pay the bills . ”
Cruz remembers growing up in Mexico City surrounded by family , having parties with her cousins and going to family reunions . When she talks about how her two teenage children haven ’ t been able to do that , she begins to choke up .
“ They didn ’ t have the opportunity to have uncles or aunts or cousins , like how I grew up , ” she says . “ It ’ s hard because we have a lot of family – but not here . ”","Lorenzo Victorino hasn’t driven a car in more than two years.

And so far nearly 2,440 have died trying.

In an ongoing series called Seeking Refuge, the Monitor has searched for themes and lessons learned in the midst of one of the European Union's greatest modern tests.

1. Migrants will keep coming

When a boat capsized in April off of Libya, killing nearly 800 migrants on board, the argument that the EU should scale back patrols to deter migration – as they were doing at the time of the tragedy – was flipped on its head.

Rescue patrols and walls factor into a migrant’s choices to attempt the trip, but it doesn’t deter his or her decision to leave war or poverty. Life is still better in Europe.

That has been put in sharp focus in Greece. We kicked off the series on the island of Kos, where migrants were steadily streaming in amid an economic crisis that sapped the Greek state's capacity – or appetite – to house and care for thousands of newcomers. Since then tens of thousands have arrived anyway, with 21,000 showing up in one week in August alone.

2. Much of Europe see the migrants as 'the other guy's' problem

Greece and Italy face the physical crush of arrivals, while Germany, Sweden, and Britain are where most migrants want to go. Germany announced this week that it expects 750,000 asylum claims this year, four times more than last year.

Yet in between are nearly two dozen countries that do not see migration as their problem. An EU plan to relocate and resettle some 60,000 migrants has sent much of Europe into an emotional tailspin. One of the countries feeling the brunt of criticism for not doing its part is Britain.

Central and Eastern Europe, meanwhile, which have almost no experience with this type of migration, condemned Brussels for placing a burden on their shoulders where they say it doesn’t belong – even though emigration has long been that region's only escape valve. In the end, a broad, mandatory relocation plan was torpedoed in favor of a smaller, voluntary one – which nonetheless continues to rile.

""There is no incentive for central European countries to accept relocation. They don’t see it as their problem,” said Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe in Brussels.

3. Europe's migration system is not working

For all of the anger directed at Brussels, critics make a valid point too. Europe's system for accepting migrants doesn’t work. The policy that’s been most tested is the Dublin Regulation, the European treaty that stipulates that refugees must have their asylum applications processed by the EU country they first set foot in. Though the convention is meant to be mandatory, overloaded periphery countries are turning a blind eye to the migrants who wish to move on, as virtually all do.

Now many of those same migrants who crossed the Italian-French border are amassing in Calais, at France’s northern edge. This time they face a harder task moving onto their final destination, Britain, both because of geography and because Britain is not part of Schengen. Thousands have stormed the Eurotunnel this summer, leaving at least nine dead.

4. Some Europeans have been magnanimous

This migration crisis has given a high-profile platform to xenophobia. It has led Hungary, where numbers of migrants entering has dramatically spiked, to start building a wall. The Slovakian government said it would accept refugees from Syria but only Christian ones, not Muslims.

And yet, there are European citizens who are trying to rise above the fear. As the newest flashpoint has appeared in the Balkans, at Greece’s border with Macedonia, authorities have tried to keep them back with batons. Meanwhile, one group waits for their arrival – with supplies.

“I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Gabriela Andreevska, a young Macedonian who spends most nights at the border, helping the migrants trying to reach the EU. “So many people sleeping on concrete. They’re there, and you can’t turn a blind eye.”

5. The 'migrant crisis' is a human crisis

In the heated discussion about Europe’s migration crisis, which can bleed into the wider debate over security and terrorism, it’s easy to forget the most important lesson of all. Each migrant is a person, with families back home and a lifetime of aspiration and regret behind him or her.

immigration,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/trump-poised-to-rescind-dreamer-program-pressure-congress-to-fix-idUSKCN1BG0H2,"Trump poised to rescind Dreamer program, pressure Congress to fix",2017-09-06,Steve Holland,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday scrapped an Obama-era program that protects from deportation immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children , delaying implementation until March and giving a gridlocked Congress six months to decide the fate of almost 800,000 young people .
As the so-called Dreamers who have benefited from the five-year-old program were plunged into uncertainty , business and religious leaders , mayors , governors , Democratic lawmakers , unions , civil liberties advocates and former Democratic President Barack Obama all condemned Trump ’ s move .
The action was announced not by Trump but by Jeff Sessions , his attorney general , who called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program an unconstitutional overreach by Obama . There will be an “ orderly , lawful wind-down , ” Sessions said .
Trump later issued a written statement saying that “ I do not favor punishing children , most of whom are now adults , for the actions of their parents . But we must also recognize that we are ( a ) nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws . ”
He denounced Obama ’ s program as an “ amnesty-first approach ” toward illegal immigrants and pressed his nationalist “ America First ” message , saying that despite concerns voiced by his critics about the fate of the Dreamers , “ Above all else , we must remember that young Americans have dreams too . ”
On Tuesday evening , the Republican president tweeted that lawmakers now had six months to “ legalize DACA ” and that if they did not , he would “ revisit this issue ! ”
Obama issued his own statement calling Trump ’ s action a political decision , defending DACA ’ s legality and urging Congress to protect Dreamers .
“ This is about young people who grew up in America - kids who study in our schools , young adults who are starting careers , patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag . These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts , in their minds , in every single way but one : on paper , ” Obama said .
The Trump administration said nobody covered by the program , which provided work permits in addition to deportation protection and primarily benefits Hispanics , would be affected before March 5 . Most people covered by DACA are in their 20s .
Trump shifted responsibility to a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans and said it was now up to lawmakers to pass immigration legislation that could address the fate of those protected by DACA who would be in danger of deportation .
Trump and Sessions offered no details of the type of legislation they would want to see , and Trump ’ s spokeswoman offered only a broad outline .
“ I have a love for these people ( DACA recipients ) , and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly , ” Trump later told reporters at the White House , adding : “ I think it ’ s going to work out very well . ”
Since Trump took office in January , Congress has been unable to pass any major legislation , most notably failing on a healthcare overhaul , and lawmakers have been bitterly divided over immigration in the past .
“ President Trump ’ s decision to end DACA is a deeply shameful act of political cowardice and a despicable assault on innocent young people in communities across America , ” said Nancy Pelosi , the top Democrat in the House of Representatives .
The Democratic attorney general of Massachusetts , Maura Healey , said a coalition of states planned to file suit in the coming days to defend DACA , and one advocacy group announced its own legal action .
“ This is a sad day for our country , ” added Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) founder Mark Zuckerberg . “ The decision to end DACA is not just wrong . It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream , encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government , and then punish them for it . ”
Brad Smith , president of Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) , urged Congress to “ put the humanitarian needs of these 800,000 people on the legislative calendar ” before tax-cut legislation sought by Trump .
Nearly 800,000 people stepped forward , admitted their illegal immigrant status and provided personal information to the government to apply for the DACA program . They now face the prospect of being deported starting in March . Dreamers are a fraction of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States .

As the so-called Dreamers who have benefited from the five-year-old program were plunged into uncertainty, business and religious leaders, mayors, governors, Democratic lawmakers, unions, civil liberties advocates and former Democratic President Barack Obama all condemned Trump’s move.

The action was announced not by Trump but by Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, who called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program an unconstitutional overreach by Obama. There will be an “orderly, lawful wind-down,” Sessions said.

Trump later issued a written statement saying that “I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are (a) nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.”

He denounced Obama’s program as an “amnesty-first approach” toward illegal immigrants and pressed his nationalist “America First” message, saying that despite concerns voiced by his critics about the fate of the Dreamers, “Above all else, we must remember that young Americans have dreams too.”

On Tuesday evening, the Republican president tweeted that lawmakers now had six months to “legalize DACA” and that if they did not, he would “revisit this issue!”

Obama issued his own statement calling Trump’s action a political decision, defending DACA’s legality and urging Congress to protect Dreamers.

“This is about young people who grew up in America - kids who study in our schools, young adults who are starting careers, patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag. These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper,” Obama said.

The Trump administration said nobody covered by the program, which provided work permits in addition to deportation protection and primarily benefits Hispanics, would be affected before March 5. Most people covered by DACA are in their 20s.

Trump shifted responsibility to a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans and said it was now up to lawmakers to pass immigration legislation that could address the fate of those protected by DACA who would be in danger of deportation.

Trump and Sessions offered no details of the type of legislation they would want to see, and Trump’s spokeswoman offered only a broad outline.

“I have a love for these people (DACA recipients), and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,” Trump later told reporters at the White House, adding: “I think it’s going to work out very well.”

Since Trump took office in January, Congress has been unable to pass any major legislation, most notably failing on a healthcare overhaul, and lawmakers have been bitterly divided over immigration in the past.

“President Trump’s decision to end DACA is a deeply shameful act of political cowardice and a despicable assault on innocent young people in communities across America,” said Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives.

The Democratic attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, said a coalition of states planned to file suit in the coming days to defend DACA, and one advocacy group announced its own legal action.

“This is a sad day for our country,” added Facebook Inc (FB.O) founder Mark Zuckerberg. “The decision to end DACA is not just wrong. It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it.”

Brad Smith, president of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), urged Congress to “put the humanitarian needs of these 800,000 people on the legislative calendar” before tax-cut legislation sought by Trump.

Nearly 800,000 people stepped forward, admitted their illegal immigrant status and provided personal information to the government to apply for the DACA program. They now face the prospect of being deported starting in March. Dreamers are a fraction of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.

“The cancellation of the DACA program is reprehensible,” the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a statement.

But White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: “It’s not cold hearted for the president to uphold the law.”

Trump said DACA recipients would not be deportation priorities unless they were criminals or gang members.

Ending DACA was the latest action by Trump sure to alienate Hispanic Americans, a growing segment of the U.S. population and an increasingly important voting bloc. Most of the immigrants protected by DACA came from Mexico and other Latin American countries.

The Mexican government said it “profoundly laments” Trump’s decision to end DACA and pledged to strengthen efforts to guarantee consular protections for affected Mexican citizens.

THREAT OF LAWSUITS

The Homeland Security Department will provide a limited window - until Oct. 5 - for some DACA recipients whose work permits expire before March 5 to apply to renew those permits. In addition, the department will adjudicate any new DACA requests, or renewal requests, accepted as of Tuesday. That would mean that some beneficiaries of DACA could work legally in the country through 2019.

The administration said the president’s decision was prompted in part by a threat from several Republican state attorneys general, led by Texas, to file legal challenges in federal court if Trump did not act to end DACA. Late on Tuesday, Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton said he withdrew the 10-state suit after Trump’s decision.

House Speaker Paul Ryan called on lawmakers to find a long-term solution for the young people affected by the reversal of the program. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress “will continue working on securing our border and ensuring a lawful system of immigration that works.”

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said there could be a winning formula by coupling legislation to provide legal status for Dreamers with additional border security measures, although he said support was lacking in Congress for Trump’s proposed border wall.

Here's what I propose,,Geraldo Rivera,"Back in June in Sandusky , Ohio , about 65 miles west of my home here in Cleveland , there was a huge federal raid involving about 200 agents on Corso ’ s Flower and Garden Center . The combined ICE-led operation rounded up 114 undocumented immigrants workers ; some of whom had been here on and off for decades .
The raid lay bare the essential dilemma facing those attempting to enforce our immigration policy . It took a gigantic federal operation to round up and hold for deportation people who were working hard and attempting to do the right thing . No matter how you slice it , our massive , legitimate , law-enforcement operation punished good people trying to work and provide for their families .
Bear the Corso raid in mind when you try to wrap your mind around the current crisis involving the Caravan of Migrants doggedly heading our way from Guatemala and Honduras , trudging through Mexico and causing great consternation and angry condemnation in Washington , D.C .
It would be easy to support the deployment of the U.S. military and other draconian “ solutions ” to the migrant crisis generally , and the caravan specifically , if the marchers were gang bangers or ISIS recruits . Manifestly most are not , ( unless ISIS or MS-13 is recruiting crying , hungry three-year olds ) . Even the most hardened anti-immigrant pundit can not justify actions taken to stop the caravan by saying it is mostly about national security . It is not .
It is , in my opinion , fear of our nation being over-run by poor , hungry , brown people in sufficient numbers to change our basic national character , which motivates most critics of this caravan and , more broadly , illegal immigration .
What would the Army do against a caravan of civilians , many of them women and children , anyway ? Shoot them ?
The president senses that most Americans are responding very negatively to the caravan , and even see it as an existential threat to the nation . He has even stated that he will , if necessary , use our military to stop the caravan from crossing over the southern border . In doing so he ignores the principle known as Posse Comitatus , which by law , prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws .

This crisis calls for reason , patience , compassion and an immediate parlay among the affected nations in Central America , Mexico and the United States . In exchange for leniency and a path to citizenship for long-time undocumented residents already in this country -- who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents -- pro-immigration advocates , like me , should announce our support for President Trump ’ s border wall . It will help restore order along the southern border , and mitigate the hysteria currently gripping the national immigration debate and tainting the mid-term elections .
But neither building the president ’ s border wall , nor compassion for the DREAMERS already here , will fully solve the crisis of immigration . We are the world ’ s richest country .

Miller","Community outrage forced the federal government to nix its plans to house illegal immigrant children at a defunct college in rural Virginia , but the school fought back this month with discrimination complaints accusing both the Obama administration and its own neighbors of bigotry .
St. Paul ’ s College and nonprofit Housing Opportunities Made Equal ( HOME ) of Virginia say local officials in Lawrenceville , Virginia , and surrounding Brunswick County stirred up racial animosity against the children . In a separate complaint , they accused the federal Health and Human Services Department of caving to pressure and canceling a lease , also violating anti-discrimination rules .
“ No one should block someone ’ s housing opportunity based on race or national origin , ” said Helen O ’ Beirne Hardiman , the fair housing director for HOME . “ It ’ s unfair , and it ’ s completely illegal for government officials to step in to a private deal and say we don ’ t want Central American children coming to this community . ”
She and St. Paul ’ s lodged a complaint with the Housing and Urban Development Department , targeting the local officials , and filed another discrimination complaint with HHS ’ s own Office for Civil Rights , arguing the department broke the law by canceling the deal .
Local officials bristled at the notion they did anything wrong , saying they merely asked for a community meeting so HHS and the college could explain their plans . More than 1,000 people showed up , and sentiment ran strongly against housing the children .
“ I don ’ t have anything to hide or run from . I don ’ t think I did anything wrong , ” said Brunswick County Sheriff B.K . Roberts , whom the complaints accused of stirring opposition . “ I think the U.S. Constitution clearly says that I have the opportunity for freedom of speech . I spoke to oppose . That ’ s what I did . I still oppose it . ”
He said that his opposition to the plan was based on the federal government ’ s “ mishandling ” of the situation .
“ There were too many questions left unanswered . There were too many inconsistencies , ” said Sheriff Roberts . “ It was just poorly handled by the federal government . The result was that we had a public forum and the general sentiment there was opposition . ”
The surge of children — more than 66,000 have crossed the border and been detained by the Homeland Security Department from Oct. 1 , 2013 , through Aug. 31 — has strained federal budgets and tested local governments in all sorts of ways , including having to face community backlash .
Some of the antipathy stems from reports of communicable diseases within the illegal immigrant population , but much of the backlash is a reaction to the broader illegal immigration debate , according to those on both sides of that fight .
The public forum Sheriff Roberts and other local community leaders called saw more than 1,000 people show up , with sentiment overwhelmingly opposed .
“ No way do I want to be living anywhere with armed guards and a security fence , ” said Donna Lewis , who said she moved with her grandchildren from Washington , D.C. , to Lawrenceville seeking a quiet life .
HHS had planned to send about 500 children , most of them males age 15 to 17 , to the campus , where they would benefit from St. Paul ’ s dormitories , cafeteria , classrooms , gymnasium and athletic fields .
College President Millard “ Pete ” Stith thought it was a win-win — the feds needed the space , the college needed the money , and the community needed jobs . He alerted both town and county officials , whom he said didn ’ t give him any pushback .
“ This is like manna from heaven , ” he said . “ I ’ m walking around with my chest sticking out , because I ’ m saying me and my partners in the county and town are going to be benefitting from this project . Silly me . ”
In the complaints , filed with both HUD and HHS , Mr. Stith and the HOME group point to a chain of events that they said show the local officials reacted to discriminatory impulses from the community , which were captured in some of the more pointed comments at the June 19 town meeting about potential diseases or gang affiliations .
“ They shouted down people who got up and even came close to saying this is a good deal , ” Mr. Stith said . “ It was horrible . I know that if I were an official from these communities , I would not have wanted the world to see how my folks reacted to other people coming in who were different from me . ”
In their official complaint with HUD , Mr. Stith and the HOME group said some of the statements made by residents were “ facially discriminatory ” while others were “ thinly veiled coded language ” showing antipathy based on national origin .
The local officials had also fired off a letter to Rep. Robert Hurt , the congressman who represents the area . Mr. Hurt then wrote to HHS on June 16 asking them to suspend the lease and provide any information the local officials wanted .
A day after the town hall meeting , on June 20 , HHS said it was canceling the lease .
Canceling the contract put St. Paul ’ s out the $ 160,000 a month it had been promised and put the school back in the financial straits that had caused it to shut its doors to college students in 2013 .
Mr. Hurt ’ s office declined to comment . He is not the subject of either of the complaints , which focus on the local officials and HHS , which is charged under federal law with caring for the children .
Ms. Hardiman , the official from HOME , said documents that the nonprofit group has obtained under the Freedom of Information Act indicate to them that the local officials instigated the backlash through what she called “ unofficial actions behind the scenes . ”
“ The causation , if you look at the time line , it ’ s so clear they were behind the backlash , and so our position is they were responsible for that discrimination , ” she said .
She said the local officials never should have had any say in the decisions , since St. Paul ’ s was already zoned to be able to handle the children .
Lawrenceville Mayor William H. “ Bill ” Herrington said he would reserve comment until the town receives an official notice of the complaint . However , he said that he didn ’ t think conducting a community meeting for residents to learn about the federal government plan was inappropriate .
Mr. Herrington was mayor-elect when the community meeting was held in June and helped conduct the meeting . He said the community meeting was advertised as an a forum for residents to get information from federal officials about the plans to shelter the children .
Mr. Herrington also insisted that the town and the college remain on good terms .
“ Our relationship with the college is great . It ’ s my alma mater , ” he said . “ We ’ ve been asked by the college recently to work out something , really to forgive the water bill , ” he said . “ So we ’ re working with them .

Canceling the contract put St. Paul’s out the $160,000 a month it had been promised and put the school back in the financial straits that had caused it to shut its doors to college students in 2013.

Mr. Hurt’s office declined to comment. He is not the subject of either of the complaints, which focus on the local officials and HHS, which is charged under federal law with caring for the children.

HHS didn’t respond to a request for comment Friday.

Ms. Hardiman, the official from HOME, said documents that the nonprofit group has obtained under the Freedom of Information Act indicate to them that the local officials instigated the backlash through what she called “unofficial actions behind the scenes.”

“The causation, if you look at the time line, it’s so clear they were behind the backlash, and so our position is they were responsible for that discrimination,” she said.

She said the local officials never should have had any say in the decisions, since St. Paul’s was already zoned to be able to handle the children.

Lawrenceville Mayor William H. “Bill” Herrington said he would reserve comment until the town receives an official notice of the complaint. However, he said that he didn’t think conducting a community meeting for residents to learn about the federal government plan was inappropriate.

“We do live in America,” he said.

Mr. Herrington was mayor-elect when the community meeting was held in June and helped conduct the meeting. He said the community meeting was advertised as an a forum for residents to get information from federal officials about the plans to shelter the children.

Mr. Herrington also insisted that the town and the college remain on good terms.

“Our relationship with the college is great. It’s my alma mater,” he said. “We’ve been asked by the college recently to work out something, really to forgive the water bill,” he said. “So we’re working with them. They are trying to get that resolved.”

“People were sleeping on floors – they had nowhere to put them,” said one source, a long-time border agent and supervisor. “This shouldn’t be happening. Unless there is an immediate and well-publicized policy change, this situation will become another debacle.”

At a hotel near San Diego -- which Fox News agreed not to identify for security reasons -- ICE vans arrived several times over the weekend with immigrant families. They were escorted to the second floor by two armed, uniformed agents. Two border agents secured the entrance and side door.

Documents obtained by Fox News show that recently on a single day, dozens of illegal immigrants were being transferred to an area hotel where rooms cost $99 a night. Others were released to addresses in Texas, Florida and even Brooklyn, N.Y.

ICE sources say the addresses are almost always bogus. When they don’t show up for court, they are removed by an immigration judge in absentia.

Most of the immigrants came from Mexico, but others listed their native country as Haiti, Romania, Guatemala and Iraq. Some were over age 50, others were under a year old. Thirty were transported to a hotel. Seventy were released around the country.

It is during this time – during removal proceedings – when illegal immigrants are released. Many don't show up, as 91 percent of asylum claims from Mexico are denied.

On Thursday , the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Maryland upheld a federal district judge ’ s ruling that barred the Trump administration from banning residents of six majority-Muslim countries from entering the US for 90 days .
The Fourth Circuit case didn ’ t address Trump ’ s attempt to temporarily ban refugees , or to overhaul the screening process for future arrivals to the US ; those parts of the administration ’ s March executive order are on hold thanks to a separate case , being considered in the West Coast Ninth Circuit . The Ninth Circuit has heard oral arguments in that case but hasn ’ t issued its opinion yet .
But the Fourth Circuit was the Trump administration ’ s best hope at a favorable ruling before reaching the Supreme Court .
Instead , it suffered the latest — and , arguably , harshest — in what ’ s becoming an unbroken string of judicial smackdowns over the travel ban .
“ When the government chooses sides on religious issues , the ‘ inevitable result ’ is ‘ hatred , disrespect and even contempt ’ towards those who fall on the wrong side of the line , ” wrote Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory . “ Improper government involvement with religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion [ , ] encourage persecution of religious minorities and nonbelievers , and foster hostility and division in our pluralistic society . The risk of these harms is particularly acute here , where from the highest elected office in the nation has come an Executive Order steeped in animus and directed at a single religious group . ”
Technically , the Fourth Circuit didn ’ t fully uphold the lower court ’ s order . It made it clear that President Trump himself couldn ’ t be constrained by the courts , legally speaking ( it was already pretty obvious in all other senses ) .
But the rest of the Trump administration — including the Departments of State and Homeland Security , which would be implementing the travel ban — is still prohibited , under this order , from enforcing the proposed 90-day ban on entries from residents of Iran , Libya , Somalia , Syria , Sudan , and Yemen . In other words , the only nominal victory the Trump administration has gotten in the lawsuits over this travel ban is a victory that practically means nothing at all .
And it ’ s now guaranteed that the Supreme Court , if it agrees to consider the ban at all , will be considering a policy that ’ s never been put into effect .
Ever since Trump ’ s first attempt at a travel ban — rushed into effect on January 27 — was put on hold by a Washington judge a week later , the Trump administration has tried to disassociate the policy from Trump ’ s call during the presidential campaign for a “ total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country ’ s representatives can figure out what is going on . ”
First , they made a show of withdrawing and reconsidering the travel ban , asking several government agencies for input ( only to be undermined when some of them said there was no reason for a ban at all ) . Then they issued a new executive order in March that avoided the biggest legal problems with the first ban ( such as its apparent ban on green card holders from the blacklisted countries returning to the US from abroad ) and gave the government more time to plan for its implementation .
But the rulings in Maryland and Hawaii put the new ban on hold the night before it was supposed to go into effect . In both cases , judges ruled that even if the ban didn ’ t explicitly target Muslims , it was impossible to disentangle it from Trump ’ s discriminatory campaign promise .
The Trump administration made a valiant effort in oral arguments before the Fourth Circuit to argue that a promise Trump made in 2015 , before a single presidential primary , shouldn ’ t outweigh everything the administration has said or done since then to argue the travel ban isn ’ t a Muslim ban . But Chief Judge Gregory , who wrote the court ’ s opinion , was , to say the least , unpersuaded :
These statements , taken together , provide direct , specific evidence of what motivated both EO-1 and EO-2 : President Trump ’ s desire to exclude Muslims from the United States . The statements also reveal President Trump ’ s intended means of effectuating the ban : by targeting majority-Muslim nations instead of Muslims explicitly . And after courts enjoined EO-1 , the statements show how President Trump attempted to preserve its core mission : by issuing EO-2—a “ watered down ” version with “ the same basic policy outcomes. ” J.A . 339 . These statements are the exact type of “ readily discoverable fact [ s ] ” that we use in determining a government action ’ s primary purpose . McCreary , 545 U.S. at 862 . They are explicit statements of purpose and are attributable either to President Trump directly or to his advisors . We need not probe anyone ’ s heart of hearts to discover the purpose of EO-2 , for President Trump and his aides have explained it on numerous occasions and in no uncertain terms .
The Supreme Court might not even have to take up the travel ban now
It ’ s unlikely that the “ very liberal Ninth Circuit ” ( as Trump and his administration usually refer to it ) is going to be more deferential to the president . The Fourth Circuit was clearly the administration ’ s best hope at a win , and it hasn ’ t gotten one .

The fiscal 2021 spending bill introduced by the House Appropriations Committee would claw back the $ 1.4 billion Congress agreed to this year and would ban any new construction .
Democrats said the measure also would eliminate detention of families by the end of the year , forcing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release them into the community .
Homeland Security would be ordered to expand access to lawyers for people facing deportation , and watchdogs would receive new funding to police ICE ’ s operations .
Top Democrats made no bones about their goal of handcuffing Mr. Trump , particularly when it comes to wall construction , which one called a “ racist … boondoggle . ”
“ Our bill fights for a more humane immigration approach , including the more restricted use of civil detention , expanded alternatives to detention , and the phase-out of family detention this year , ” said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard , chairwoman of the subcommittee that oversees Homeland Security funding .
The bill is national Democrats ‘ first law enforcement ante amid Black Lives Matters ’ “ defund the police ” crusade . Still to come later this week is Democrats ‘ proposal for funding for the Justice Department .
ICE became a flashpoint in the immigration debate over the last decade , though it has become particularly intense under Mr. Trump and his battle with sanctuary cities .
Calls to abolish the agency picked up steam in 2018 , during the government ’ s zero-tolerance border policy , which led to criminal charges against parents who jumped the border with children — and led to separation of those families , without adequate measures in place to reunite them .
Democrats , who took control of the House in 2019 , didn ’ t have much luck cutting the agency in their first year , but the new bill signals they aren ’ t discouraged .
The measure would slash $ 1.1 billion from ICE ’ s deportation and detention division , cutting it to $ 3.3 billion . That ’ s $ 2.4 billion less than Mr. Trump asked for .
At this point last year , ICE had more than 50,000 people in detention , and as of late last month still had 22,805 people in detention , even after coronavirus releases . The bill would cut that to just 10,000 during the pandemic , and just 22,000 in normal times . Instead , it pumps money into ankle bracelets and phone check-in programs .
Cesar Vargas , an immigrant-rights activist and advocate for abolishing ICE , called that “ a right step to diminish the power of a rogue agency that has a bloated budget and doesn ’ t keep our country safe . ”
“ The main goal , however , is to completely abolish this agency and allocate these millions of dollars to USCIS to help immigrants become tax paying citizens and help their adjustment in the U.S. better , ” said Mr. Vargas , who became one of the first “ Dreamers ” to practice law .
Other groups that have called for abolishing ICE , though , were silent on the new bill .
Those who want to see stricter enforcement said the legislation was an attempt to “ dismantle immigration enforcement . ”
“ Making catch and release the law of the land will ensure the next border surge , ” said Rosemary Jenks , vice president at NumbersUSA .
The bill also imposes a general 20-day limit on detention — far shorter than most deportations take — and sets an even higher standard for detaining transgender migrants , limiting them to five days in detention .
Ms. Roybal-Allard has slated the bill for action in her subcommittee Tuesday .
Overall , Mr. Trump had asked for $ 15.8 billion for Customs and Border Protection . The bill allocates $ 14.6 billion . He wanted $ 10 billion for ICE , while the legislation gives him just $ 7.4 billion . Last year the agency received more than $ 8 billion .
Mr. Trump asked for $ 2 billion for border wall construction this year , less than the $ 5 billion he sought for 2020 — but still more than the $ 1.375 billion Congress allocated for 2020 .
Angered by Congress ‘ decision , Mr. Trump claimed emergency powers and shifted billions from Pentagon accounts to go to his wall .
That transfer of money is under litigation , with opponents arguing he is violating Congress ’ s power of the purse by directing money to places lawmakers didn ’ t intend . The administration counters that Congress never specifically banned the transfer of money , and it was legal under both Defense Department spending law and the National Emergencies Act .
Democrats ‘ new bill seeks to remove all doubt , explicitly barring any new wall construction and rescinding even the $ 1.375 billion included in the 2020 bill .
The bill does include $ 75 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service to mitigate effects of past wall construction .","It’s not “abolish ICE,” but House Democrats took their best shot Monday, announcing a bill to slash the Department of Homeland Security’s deportation operations by 25%, blocking new hiring of Border Patrol agents and trying to erase dozens of miles of President Trump’s border wall.

The bill would cut that to just 10,000 during the pandemic, and just 22,000 in normal times. Instead, it pumps money into ankle bracelets and phone check-in programs.

Cesar Vargas, an immigrant-rights activist and advocate for abolishing ICE, called that “a right step to diminish the power of a rogue agency that has a bloated budget and doesn’t keep our country safe.”

“The main goal, however, is to completely abolish this agency and allocate these millions of dollars to USCIS to help immigrants become tax paying citizens and help their adjustment in the U.S. better,” said Mr. Vargas, who became one of the first “Dreamers” to practice law.

Other groups that have called for abolishing ICE, though, were silent on the new bill.

Those who want to see stricter enforcement said the legislation was an attempt to “dismantle immigration enforcement.”

“Making catch and release the law of the land will ensure the next border surge,” said Rosemary Jenks, vice president at NumbersUSA.

The bill also imposes a general 20-day limit on detention — far shorter than most deportations take — and sets an even higher standard for detaining transgender migrants, limiting them to five days in detention.

Ms. Roybal-Allard has slated the bill for action in her subcommittee Tuesday.

Overall, Mr. Trump had asked for $15.8 billion for Customs and Border Protection. The bill allocates $14.6 billion. He wanted $10 billion for ICE, while the legislation gives him just $7.4 billion. Last year the agency received more than $8 billion.

Mr. Trump asked for $2 billion for border wall construction this year, less than the $5 billion he sought for 2020 — but still more than the $1.375 billion Congress allocated for 2020.

Angered by Congress‘ decision, Mr. Trump claimed emergency powers and shifted billions from Pentagon accounts to go to his wall.

That transfer of money is under litigation, with opponents arguing he is violating Congress’s power of the purse by directing money to places lawmakers didn’t intend. The administration counters that Congress never specifically banned the transfer of money, and it was legal under both Defense Department spending law and the National Emergencies Act.

Democrats‘ new bill seeks to remove all doubt, explicitly barring any new wall construction and rescinding even the $1.375 billion included in the 2020 bill.

The bill does include $75 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service to mitigate effects of past wall construction.

Immigration reform advocates have a new enemy: the congressional calendar.

Fall’s fiscal fights have lined up in a way that could delay immigration reform until 2014, multiple senior House Republican leadership aides tell POLITICO, imperiling the effort’s prospects before the midterm elections.

Story Continued Below

The mid-October debt ceiling deadline — an earlier-than-expected target laid out Monday by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew — is changing the House GOP leadership’s plans to pass immigration bills that month.

“If we have to deal with the debt limit earlier, it doesn’t change the overall dynamics of the debate, but — just in terms of timing — it might make it harder to find time for immigration bills in October,” one House Republican leadership aide said.

That’s not the only scheduling challenge. There are fewer than 40 congressional working days until the end of 2013 — the unofficial deadline for passing immigration reform — and they’ll present some of the most politically challenging votes for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. It will be difficult to add immigration reform to the list, senior aides say.

Government funding runs dry on Sept. 30. The nine days the House is in session that month will be crowded with the debate over the continuing resolution to keep the government operating. The GOP leadership will have to reconcile the screams from conservatives who want to use the bill to defund Obamacare with their own desire to avoid a government shutdown. Of course, anything the House approves would need to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, which will ignore attempts to weaken the law.

Immigration reform isn’t certain to die if it slips into 2014, some in GOP leadership say. But major progress must be made in 2013 as it would be too difficult for the House to chart a course in 2014, an election year.

At a fundraiser in Idaho on Monday, Speaker John Boehner predicted a “whale of a fight” over the debt ceiling. That skirmish will surface in October. The House is in session for 14 days during that month, but there is certain to be a good deal of debate over passing a bill that would extend the nation’s borrowing authority.

GOP leadership is mulling its initial negotiating position, which is sure to include some changes to entitlements, energy policy and the health care law. Boehner’s leadership team also seems open to discussing ways to soften the blow of the sequester in October, which would add yet another explosive issue to the mix.

“If parents are still being prosecuted as criminals and put in prisons, they will be separated from their children,” said Jaimes Perèz. Family detention centres are already over capacity, despite plans to build more. “What happens in the meantime?”

A bittersweet side effect to the widespread outrage has been a surge in donations and volunteers, particularly to one organisation, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (Raices), which has raised nearly $15m in just a few days through a Facebook fundraising campaign.

The not-for-profit will use these funds to expand its legal and social services for immigrants. Part of this is the launch of the “Families Together” project that aims, through a coalition of like-minded groups, to centralise data management and help organisations locate and reunite family members.

Raices will also use some of the money for its bond fund to get family members released from detention.",www.theguardian.com,left,l0WCcvuYRs1LJWsx

When the merit system takes effect , five years after the bill is passed , at least 120,000 foreign-born people each year would be able to gain green cards by accumulating points based on their skills and education , as well as their family ties and the time they have lived in the United States .
Over a decade , the balance in the immigration system would gradually shift away from the 75 percent of visas that now go to family members of immigrants already here . As a result of the merit program , closer to 50 percent of visas annually would go to immigrants based on their family ties , while about half would be based on job skills .
As part of the border security triggers , the bill would require all employers , within five years , to verify the legal status of new hires using a federal photo-matching system . It would also require the federal government to create an electronic system within 10 years for checking foreigners as they leave the country through airports and seaports .
The bill also would also create two new guest-worker programs , one for farmworkers and another for low-wage laborers .
It would give employers in technology and science fields tens of thousands of new temporary and permanent resident visas annually , which they have been urgently seeking for computer engineers and foreign graduates with advanced degrees from American universities . It raises current annual caps on temporary high-skilled visas , known as H-1B , to 110,000 from 65,000 , while adding 5,000 more of those visas for the foreign graduates . The cap would gradually rise to 180,000 .
And the bill would allow young illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children , known as Dreamers , to become citizens after only five years .
The senators are gambling that the bill would repair enough longstanding problems to attract support from a broad array of groups that would benefit , including Latinos , religious groups and labor unions ; big technology companies like Microsoft and Facebook , which have been clamoring for more visas ; agricultural growers and other employers in labor-intensive businesses ; and immigrant families who stand to be united more quickly with family members coming here legally .","For the first time, the legislation would create a merit-based program to award the visa for legal permanent residents, known as a green card, based on a point system.

This brings to the fore a subject on which I fear I’m becoming a broken record, but I’ll hit it again anyway. Since 9/11, we’ve lost the distinction between national-security challenges and crime problems. Illegal immigration is a crime problem. Yes, it has some important national-security aspects (as do other crime problems), but the percentage of illegal aliens who threaten national security (as opposed to who are recidivist criminals) is negligible.

The distinction is important. We must always have as a goal eradicating national-security challenges – even if the goal is unrealistic, a single terrorist attack can be so catastrophic, we must take extra measures to prevent it. To the contrary, it is not our goal to eradicate crime problems – it would neither be possible nor desirable (in terms of the costs to liberty) to do that.

The enforcement procedures , outlined in a pair of Department of Homeland Security memos , implement President Trump 's Jan. 25 immigration executive orders , putting most of the nation 's 11 million undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation .
The memos , among other things , give local police the ability to help with immigration enforcement , call for the hiring of thousands more immigration agents and increase the number of immigrants who could be deported under `` expedited removal , '' a process that generally denies individuals a chance to speak with an immigration judge .
Federal officials `` are doing everything in their power to ensure the immigrant community is under attack — not only people who are undocumented but also people with asylum , '' said founder Reyna Montoya of Aliento , an organization that uses art to comfort youth affected by the immigration and detention systems .

PHOENIX — As supporters of stricter immigration policies cheered the sweeping set of federal immigration-enforcement guidelines issued Tuesday, panic and confusion intensified among undocumented immigrants in Arizona, with many calling the protocols an ""attack"" and a threat to human rights.

The enforcement procedures, outlined in a pair of Department of Homeland Security memos, implement President Trump's Jan. 25 immigration executive orders, putting most of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation.

The memos, among other things, give local police the ability to help with immigration enforcement, call for the hiring of thousands more immigration agents and increase the number of immigrants who could be deported under ""expedited removal,"" a process that generally denies individuals a chance to speak with an immigration judge.

Federal officials ""are doing everything in their power to ensure the immigrant community is under attack — not only people who are undocumented but also people with asylum,"" said founder Reyna Montoya of Aliento, an organization that uses art to comfort youth affected by the immigration and detention systems.

""I think the general feeling right now is that they want to terrorize our communities,"" Montoya said. ""People think these (guidelines) are going to make America safe again, when really it's going to push undocumented people who are victims of crimes not to report them.""

Student activist Randy Perez works with refugees and recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, known as ""dreamers,"" at Arizona State University. He said the guidelines sparked flashbacks to the arrival of Senate Bill 1070, Arizona's controversial 2010 immigration law.

Conservative justices questioned Obama 's authority to use executive actions to shield some 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation . Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito seemed particularly concerned with language in the administration 's guidance that said the program 's recipients would be `` lawfully present , '' which they suggested would contradict immigration law .
`` How is it possible to lawfully work in the United States without lawfully being in the United States ? '' Alito asked .
Roberts added : `` I mean , they 're lawfully present , and yet , they 're present in violation of the law ? ''
Liberals on the bench seemed sympathetic to the administration 's arguments . Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted at one point that there are 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country and Congress has provided funds for removing about 4 million . `` So inevitably , priorities have to be set , '' she said .
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said there are not enough resources to deport everyone . `` They are here whether we want them or not , '' she said .
Obama announced the moves to great fanfare in late 2014 , as a response to congressional inaction on immigration reform . But a federal court blocked them after Texas and 25 other states sued .
Busloads of immigrants ' rights activists -- some of them undocumented -- appeared on the court 's plaza to support the policies . The moves are meant to shield them from deportation and allow them work permits .
Nancy Garcia , a U.S. citizen from Milwaukee , who was protesting with the Wisconsin group Voces de la Frontera ( Voices from the Border ) , said she became active on the issue after Wisconsin lawmakers tried to crack down on undocumented immigrants .
`` We 're not drug lords . We 're not rapists . We 're good people , '' Garcia said .
Tea Party Patriots member Gregg Cummings said he arrived at 6 a.m. to find a spot in front of the court to protest the executive actions . Cummings , from Lamoni , Iowa , said he is concerned about the prospect of Obama 's Supreme Court nominee , Judge Merrick Garland , changing the ideological balance of the court .
`` Our number one purpose of being here is supporting the senators better standing strong on no votes on the new Supreme Court justice , '' he said .
Critics of Obama 's moves say they are part of a pattern of the White House looking to go around the Republican Congress .
`` Basically the President has stepped in and taken over what normally would be associated with Congress , '' Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in an interview . `` Congress makes the laws . ''
Roberts also seemed concerned with the scope of the government 's argument defending Obama 's moves . `` Under your argument , could the President grant deferred removal to every unlawful -- unlawfully present alien in the United States right now ? '' he asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli .
At one point , Justice Anthony Kennedy suggested that the president might have strayed into Congress ' territory . `` It 's as if -- that the President is setting the policy and Congress is executing it , '' he said . `` That 's just upside down . ''
The GOP Congress was involved at oral arguments as well . The House of Representatives , in an unusual move , intervened in the case against the administration , and had 15 minutes before the eight justices .
That only eight justices are hearing the case -- due to the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia -- could impact the final result . A split court between the four Democratic-appointed justices and four GOP-appointed justices would mean the programs remain blocked and the case is sent back to the district court in Texas that blocked them in the first place .
For the administration , a key argument before the court is to say that the states do not have the legal right to bring the case in the first place . If it can convince a majority of justices on that issue , the court may not even get to the merits of the immigration debate .
All eyes were on Roberts , who has in past cases sometimes limited who can bring challenges to court . On Monday , he asked some critical questions of the government 's position , but it was unclear how interested he might be in dismissing the case on standing .
`` The question is : Does Texas have the right to bring this case ? '' said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin . `` Texas says if you give legal status to these people , then we 'll have to give them drivers licenses . The federal government says there 's nothing in this law about drivers licenses . This law is directed entirely at the immigrants themselves , it does not impose any obligations on the states . So the states should not have the right to challenge it . That 's the standing argument . I think the Obama administration thinks they have a better chance at winning over one of the conservatives on standing than they do on the merits of the case . ''
Elizabeth Wydra , President of the Constitutional Accountability Center , who filed a brief in support of the government says she would n't write off the chief justice on the merits of the case or on the issue of standing .
`` On the merits , Chief Justice Roberts ' concerns seemed to be alleviated when the Solicitor General clarified that undocumented immigrants—given relief under the programs -- are simply afforded deferred action but none the less are subject to removal proceedings at any time the executive changes its enforcement priorities , '' she said .
Should it win on that count , the injunction would be lifted , and the programs would be able to go into effect during the final months of the Obama presidency .
However , because the actions can be changed or reversed by the next President , immigrants would have to decide whether to come forward for the remaining months of the Obama administration or risk doing so with the possibility of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz in the White House .
`` There 's no question that the ultimate fate of the deferred action policy hangs in the balance of the upcoming election , '' said Stephen I. Vladeck , a professor of law at American University and CNN Legal Analyst .
`` Like any other executive order , it can be modified , rescinded , or expanded by the next President , and codified or overruled by the next Congress , '' Vladeck added . `` But the fact that the Supreme Court expedited its consideration of the Obama administration 's appeal so that it could resolve the dispute by June suggests that , even short-handed , the justices want to have their own say first . ''
The White House announced the programs in November 2014 , issuing a five-page guidance memo enabling qualifying undocumented workers to receive temporary relief from the threat of deportation and to apply for programs that could qualify them for work authorization and associated benefits .
The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents ( DAPA ) targets the nearly 4.3 million undocumented parents of citizens and lawful residents , and the second rule expands Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) , initiative aimed at non citizens who came to the country as children .
`` We 'll bring more undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so they can play by the rules , pay their full share of taxes , pass a criminal background check and get right with the law , '' Obama told an audience in Nevada after the programs were announced .
The programs remain frozen nationwide . They were first blocked by a federal judge in Texas and a divided federal appeals court later upheld the preliminary injunction .
Obama 's lawyers argue in court papers that the lower court rulings threatened great harm , `` not only to the proper role of federal courts and to federal immigration law , but also to millions of parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents , aliens who are the lowest priorities for removal yet now work off the books to support their families . ''
As a threshold issue , Verrilli says that the states do n't have the legal right to be in court , because the Constitution `` assigns the formation of immigration policy exclusively to the National Government precisely because immigration is an inherently national matter . ''
He stressed that the guidance from the government does not provide any kind of lawful status under immigration law as the aliens remain removable at any time .
`` Immigrant communities fought for these programs , '' said Marielena Hincapié , the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center . She says that her groups have been informing people about the risks of the rules being changed by the next president and she believes many will come forward should the Obama administration win .
Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller argues that the states have standing to bring the challenge in part because DAPA would create a new class of recipients for state subsidized driver 's licenses in Texas . He says that Texas would stand to lose millions of dollars if even a small fraction of DAPA eligible aliens applied .
`` DAPA is an extraordinary assertion of executive power , '' Keller wrote in court papers . `` The Executive has unilaterally crafted an enormous program -- one of the largest changes ever to our Nation 's approach to immigration , '' he said . `` In doing so , the Executive dispensed with immigration statutes by declaring unlawful conduct to be lawful . ''
He points to the guidance and says that the eligible undocumented immigrations would be permitted to be `` lawfully present in the United States , '' which would make them eligible for work authorization and some types of Social Security and Medicare benefits .
Texas is supported by the GOP-led House of Representatives , who say that the programs went forward after the President failed in his attempts to persuade Congress to revise immigration laws .
Erin E. Murphy , a lawyer for the House , called the administration 's position , `` the most aggressive of executive power claims . ''
Andrew Pincus , a lawyer who supports the administration 's position , says that allowing Texas to bring the case would have broad implications .
`` If a state can sue every time the federal government does something to increase the state 's costs , states could sue to challenge almost anything the federal government does , '' he said .
Pincus points out that Texas is not objecting to the administration 's use of prosecutorial discretion , it just does n't want the undocumented workers to be able to work legally .
`` You are saying to these people , you can stay here , but we are keeping you in a bubble , '' he said .","Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court appeared closely divided along ideological lines during oral arguments Monday in a case that could determine President Barack Obama's legacy on immigration.

""On the merits, Chief Justice Roberts' concerns seemed to be alleviated when the Solicitor General clarified that undocumented immigrants—given relief under the programs -- are simply afforded deferred action but none the less are subject to removal proceedings at any time the executive changes its enforcement priorities,"" she said.

Should it win on that count, the injunction would be lifted, and the programs would be able to go into effect during the final months of the Obama presidency.

However, because the actions can be changed or reversed by the next President, immigrants would have to decide whether to come forward for the remaining months of the Obama administration or risk doing so with the possibility of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz in the White House.

""There's no question that the ultimate fate of the deferred action policy hangs in the balance of the upcoming election,"" said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor of law at American University and CNN Legal Analyst.

""Like any other executive order, it can be modified, rescinded, or expanded by the next President, and codified or overruled by the next Congress,"" Vladeck added. ""But the fact that the Supreme Court expedited its consideration of the Obama administration's appeal so that it could resolve the dispute by June suggests that, even short-handed, the justices want to have their own say first.""

Legacy issue for Obama

The White House announced the programs in November 2014, issuing a five-page guidance memo enabling qualifying undocumented workers to receive temporary relief from the threat of deportation and to apply for programs that could qualify them for work authorization and associated benefits.

The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) targets the nearly 4.3 million undocumented parents of citizens and lawful residents, and the second rule expands Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), initiative aimed at non citizens who came to the country as children.

""We'll bring more undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so they can play by the rules, pay their full share of taxes, pass a criminal background check and get right with the law,"" Obama told an audience in Nevada after the programs were announced.

The programs remain frozen nationwide. They were first blocked by a federal judge in Texas and a divided federal appeals court later upheld the preliminary injunction.

Obama's lawyers argue in court papers that the lower court rulings threatened great harm, ""not only to the proper role of federal courts and to federal immigration law, but also to millions of parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, aliens who are the lowest priorities for removal yet now work off the books to support their families.""

As a threshold issue, Verrilli says that the states don't have the legal right to be in court, because the Constitution ""assigns the formation of immigration policy exclusively to the National Government precisely because immigration is an inherently national matter.""

He stressed that the guidance from the government does not provide any kind of lawful status under immigration law as the aliens remain removable at any time.

""Immigrant communities fought for these programs,"" said Marielena Hincapié, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. She says that her groups have been informing people about the risks of the rules being changed by the next president and she believes many will come forward should the Obama administration win.

Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller argues that the states have standing to bring the challenge in part because DAPA would create a new class of recipients for state subsidized driver's licenses in Texas. He says that Texas would stand to lose millions of dollars if even a small fraction of DAPA eligible aliens applied.

""DAPA is an extraordinary assertion of executive power,"" Keller wrote in court papers. ""The Executive has unilaterally crafted an enormous program -- one of the largest changes ever to our Nation's approach to immigration,"" he said. ""In doing so, the Executive dispensed with immigration statutes by declaring unlawful conduct to be lawful.""

He points to the guidance and says that the eligible undocumented immigrations would be permitted to be ""lawfully present in the United States,"" which would make them eligible for work authorization and some types of Social Security and Medicare benefits.

Texas is supported by the GOP-led House of Representatives, who say that the programs went forward after the President failed in his attempts to persuade Congress to revise immigration laws.

Erin E. Murphy, a lawyer for the House, called the administration's position, ""the most aggressive of executive power claims.""

Andrew Pincus, a lawyer who supports the administration's position, says that allowing Texas to bring the case would have broad implications.

""If a state can sue every time the federal government does something to increase the state's costs, states could sue to challenge almost anything the federal government does,"" he said.

Pincus points out that Texas is not objecting to the administration's use of prosecutorial discretion, it just doesn't want the undocumented workers to be able to work legally.

""You are saying to these people, you can stay here, but we are keeping you in a bubble,"" he said.",www.cnn.com,left,01uTV2haK8JSt2sw

WASHINGTON – In a major rebuke to President Donald Trump on his signature domestic policy issue, the Republican-controlled Senate voted Thursday to block the national emergency the president declared to free up money for his border wall.

A dozen Republicans joined all Democrats backing a resolution to rescind Trump’s effort to tap into more than $6 billion that Congress set aside for other programs, most of them at the Pentagon.

Trump vowed to use his veto power for the first time to kill the resolution, which passed the House last month. There’s probably not enough opposition to override that veto, but the Senate vote was nevertheless a significant political setback for Trump.

The president, who had lobbied hard in recent days to keep Republicans in line, responded with a single-word tweet after the vote.

""VETO!"" was all he wrote.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., noted that the National Emergencies Act allows Democrats to bring the resolution back to the floor every six months, forcing Republicans to repeatedly revisit the tough vote – ""and certainly we intend to do that.""

""Let's hope these votes are green shoots,"" Schumer said, ""that Republicans are learning that total embrace of President Trump is counterproductive and unsustainable.""

Republican senators such as Utah’s Mitt Romney and Tennessee’s Lamar Alexander said they supported Trump’s desire to build the wall, but they did not want to set a precedent of a president going around Congress for funding lawmakers rejected.

""I, for one, am going to work on that and hopefully gain consensus on a bipartisan basis after the temperatures have cooled,"" said Tillis, who faces re-election next year.

Here are the senators who broke with Trump:

Mitt Romney

Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, has had a complicated relationship with Trump, whom he publicly criticized during the 2016 election. Trump endorsed Romney's bid for Senate last year to fill the seat left open by Orrin Hatch's retirement.

""I agree that a physical barrier is urgently needed,"" Romney said. ""I am seriously concerned that overreach by the executive branch is an invitation to further expansion and abuse by future presidents.""

Lamar Alexander

Alexander urged Trump for weeks to find a way to access unspent money without taking the step of declaring an emergency. Though he appeared to be leaning against Trump on the issue, he did not announce his position until just before the vote.

""I support the president on border security,"" Alexander said. But, he said, the emergency ""is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution that I swore an oath to support.""

Roy Blunt

Of the dozen Republican ""yes"" votes, six serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee, the panel tasked with deciding how taxpayer money is spent. Members on the committee, many of whom have a reputation for bipartisan deal making, arguably had the most to lose from relinquishing spending authority to the president.

Sen. Blunt, R-Mo., was among the appropriators who opposed Trump.

“I think it sets a dangerous precedent and I hope he doesn’t do it,” Blunt told reporters this year.

Rand Paul

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., had voiced objections to the emergency declaration earlier this month. Paul said that approving the declaration would be tantamount to giving ""extra-Constitutional powers to the president"" – something he said he’s unwilling to do.

Mike Lee

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, made a last-ditch effort to ease some GOP concerns about presidential emergencies. Lee's proposal would have terminated some presidential emergencies after 30 days unless Congress affirmatively voted to reauthorize them, a measure that might have given cover to some Republicans concerned about the precedent set by Trump's declaration.

But talks over that idea collapsed after the White House rejected it.

Rob Portman

Portman announced his position in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, arguing a future president could use another national emergency to tear down Trump's wall if it is built. Administration officials had lobbied hard for Portman's vote. The senator told reporters in late February that he attended a meeting with Pence and Justice Department officials to discuss the president's emergency.

""It doesn't mean the president can ignore Congress and substitute his will for the will of the people,"" Portman said.

Lisa Murkowski

Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was one of the relatively early opponents of the emergency declaration. Murkowski does not face re-election until 2022, giving her some cover to oppose a president who remains popular within the GOP.

""My concern is really about the institution of the Congress,"" Murkowski said recently. ""The power of the purse rests with the Congress.""

Susan Collins

Among the Senate's most outspoken centrist Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine was an early opponent of Trump's use of an emergency to free up funding for the wall. She was also not swayed by efforts made by some of her GOP colleagues, including Lee, to limit the president's future emergency powers.

That effort, she said, did ""not address the current problem that we have, where the president, in my judgment, is usurping Congressional authority to appropriate funds.”

Jerry Moran

Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., took the unusual step of announcing his decision to oppose Trump by tweeting a photograph of a handwritten statement, including with edit marks.

""The president can advance the building of a wall with the funding just approved by Congress,"" Moran wrote on a legal pad, referring to the recently passed legislation that reopened federal agencies after the historic 35-day government shutdown. ""The declaration of an emergency is not necessary.""

Marco Rubio

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had expressed reservations about Trump's use of an emergency declaration as far back as last month. The onetime presidential candidate and Trump foe has been an on-again, off-again supporter of Trump's policies.

“We have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution,” the state's senior senator said last month. ""A future president may use this exact same tactic to impose the Green New Deal.""

Pat Toomey

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., had voiced concern about Trump’s emergency declaration, but didn’t announce he would vote to block it until Thursday.

Toomey, who kept a careful distance from Trump when he ran for re-election in 2016, told Pennsylvania reporters that he supported the president’s underlying goal. But he said he also feared Trump’s declaration would pave the way for a future Democratic president issuing a national emergency to combat climate change.

Roger Wicker

Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., was among more than a dozen Republican senators who tried to gain support for a bill that would limit presidential emergency declarations. Wicker, who was re-elected to a third term last year, had urged Trump not to declare an emergency, arguing the administration could have pulled money from elsewhere.

“I think there are reprogramming opportunities for him outside of [an] emergency,” said Wicker, known as a defender of Senate traditions.

To deal with a surge of migrants crossing into the United States , the White House is asking Congress for billions of dollars in emergency funds . But House Democrats are in no mood to simply hand over the cash after condemning Trump ’ s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies over the past two years .
They also don ’ t want to ignore a mounting humanitarian crisis .
“ So you create chaos , and then ask for more money ? ” Rep. Katherine Clark ( D-Mass . ) , vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus , said of the White House ’ s approach .
Still , Democrats are struggling with exactly how to confront the deteriorating situation at the southern border — particularly without legitimizing Trump ’ s harsh immigration stances or bolstering his argument for a massive border wall , which they ’ re trying to block in court .
Progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) are taking a hard line against Trump ’ s request , saying in an interview that “ this administration has not proven itself worthy of one more dollar ” until all families have been reunited . More moderate Democrats argue some funding is needed to assist the thousands of Central American migrants seeking asylum .

Donald Trump has Democrats in a nearly impossible position on the border.

To deal with a surge of migrants crossing into the United States, the White House is asking Congress for billions of dollars in emergency funds. But House Democrats are in no mood to simply hand over the cash after condemning Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies over the past two years.

They also don’t want to ignore a mounting humanitarian crisis.

“So you create chaos, and then ask for more money?” Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said of the White House’s approach.

Still, Democrats are struggling with exactly how to confront the deteriorating situation at the southern border — particularly without legitimizing Trump’s harsh immigration stances or bolstering his argument for a massive border wall, which they’re trying to block in court.

Progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are taking a hard line against Trump’s request, saying in an interview that “this administration has not proven itself worthy of one more dollar” until all families have been reunited. More moderate Democrats argue some funding is needed to assist the thousands of Central American migrants seeking asylum.

The result is likely to be a weeks-long battle within the Democratic Caucus that will expose deep splits on immigration and complicate Washington’s next big funding fight. And with Trump gearing up for his reelection campaign, the issue is only going to get hotter.

He was there to escort a group of vulnerable migrants as they petitioned for asylum at the port of entry , something that has become increasingly more difficult in recent months .
The Migrant Protection Protocols policy , also known as “ Remain in Mexico , ” forces migrants who ask for asylum at the border back to Mexico—often for months—to wait on their day in immigration court . The policy started out in the San Diego area at the beginning of the year and has since expanded along the border to South Texas , forcing tens of thousands of migrants to wait in dangerous Mexican border towns—including Matamoros , which sits across the Rio Grande from Brownsville , Texas , and has been given a level 4 “ do not travel ” warning by the US State Department .
In a tweet sent Monday morning , Castro didn ’ t mince words about Trump : “ Make no mistake : his agenda is killing people—and it ’ s on purpose . ”

It was the first time Castro visited one of these camps in Mexico , and he urged others to do the same “ because it truly drives home how much we ’ re failing these people and unnecessarily harming their lives . ”
I spoke to the former secretary of housing and urban development on the phone as he was driving back to San Antonio . Our conversation has been edited for content and clarity .
I went to Matamoros today to spotlight the suffering of people there who are living in squalor , drinking dirty water , not eating enough food , and being subjected to crime , all because of this administration ’ s backwards policy to keep them out of the US while they seek asylum . Today I took 12 people [ to the port of entry ] —eight of them were from the LBTQ community , and one family with a person who is disabled—to appeal their placement in the [ Migrant Protection Protocols ] program . I did this because under the terms of the MPP program , people who have a mental health or physical disability are not supposed to be forced to remain in Mexico . Members of the LGBTQ community who have been persecuted , who have been threatened and suffered beatings , often have PTSD , and that should qualify as a mental health issue . The person who is deaf obviously shouldn ’ t have been placed in the MPP program in the first place .
What did you say when you walked up to the port of entry ?
I presented myself to the border agents there , asked for a supervisor , and said we were presenting these people who should not have been in the Remain in Mexico program to begin with . At that point they were taken in , and they were given an opportunity to make their case . Most of the LGBTQ migrants were from Cuba , and the rest from Central America .
Did you get any pushback from the agents at the port of entry ?
“ There are many children who are sick , who are not getting any kind of education , and who are desperate . ”
The saddest thing that I saw today was a mother with her young child on her lap and the child looked thin , probably from lack of eating much . He seemed weak and very fatigued , probably because of the heat , or perhaps because they don ’ t have clean drinking water . There are many children who are sick , who are not getting any kind of education , and who are desperate .
You ’ ve been speaking against the MPP/Remain in Mexico policy for most of the year , and you and I spoke about this back in May , but was there anything that surprised you today seeing it firsthand—especially having crossed into Matamoros ?
The scale of the squalor . They ’ re up to more than 1,000 people there in tents right on the other side of the border . Plus , Matamoros is the newest site ; you have more than 3,000 people in Nuevo Laredo and many more in Tijuana . The scale of the desperation is growing quickly as the policy expands . This is a humanitarian disaster that should be ended immediately .
Are you concerned with what the asylum-seeking process in the United States has turned into under this administration ?
“ We should stop playing games with people at the border . ”
Absolutely ! It ’ s become a sham ! First of all , we don ’ t have an immigration court system that is properly equipped to deal with the asylum claims , and it should be independent from the Department of Justice . We also should recognize people who are victims of domestic violence and gang violence in asylum claims . We should stop playing games with people at the border .
What was the outcome for the 12 people you took to the port of entry ?
We ’ re waiting to get the news , they are going to go through an interview their appeal of getting put through the MPP process , and we should find out at some point today what happened to them . We ’ re going to follow up with the Texas Civil Rights Project ; they have attorneys who are in contact with each of them .
Now , this was just a handful of people on one day , at one port of entry . We know that tens of thousands are being forced to wait in dangerous Mexican border towns for many months . Knowing the scale of this , what are you feeling right now as you drive away from the border ?
“ Desperate people are knocking on our door , and instead of allowing them safety as their asylum claim is determined , we push them to unsafe places along the border . ”
This is a betrayal of our values and who we should be as a country , because desperate people are knocking on our door , and instead of allowing them safety as their asylum claim is determined , we push them to unsafe places along the border and have made their lives much worse . Like a lot of people , I ’ m frustrated by this administration ’ s cruelty , and I feel more determined than ever to end this policy . There ’ s also , of course , a sadness , especially for the children who are going through all of this .
You ’ ve said that if elected president , you would quickly sign an executive order to end this policy . What else needs to happen , both short-term and long-term , to properly address asylum claims at the border ?
We need an independent immigration judiciary with enough judges and support staff to hear all of these claims in a timely manner . We also need to put more resources into getting people connected with family members who are already in the United States so they can find a loving home instead of placing them in the detention facilities . It would be more cost-effective than building more detention facilities . In addition to that , Mexico has a role , as well , in doing what it can to ensure that people have basic living conditions and that they ’ re safe .
Is there an image from your trip this morning that you ’ d like people to know about ?
Yeah , we went and laid flowers along the banks of the [ Rio Grande ] river where there were crosses to commemorate the death of a number of migrants , including Oscar and his daughter Valeria . And in that same river just feet away from those crosses little children were playing and bathing themselves . The river is heavily polluted , and that ’ s the water that people are bathing in .

Why did you travel to Matamoros?

No, they were professionals.

immigration,Reason,2,https://reason.com/archives/2016/11/25/two-immigrants-debate-immigrat,Two Immigrants Debate Immigration,2016-11-25,"Shikha Dalmia, George Borjas, Peter Suderman, Noah Shepardson, Jonathan H. Adler, Mike Riggs, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Eugene Volokh","Even as the mighty Statue of Liberty beckons the world 's `` poor and huddled masses '' to America 's shores , Americans themselves have been ambivalent , to put it mildly , about how many newcomers ought to be welcomed and from where . To the extent that a pro-immigration consensus has existed , it was always an uneasy one . But Donald Trump 's meteoric political rise after embracing an extreme restrictionist agenda has shattered that fragile status quo , dividing pundits and public , academics and analysts throughout the 2016 election season . There 's an absence of good polling data to shine a light on how immigrants themselves feel about this issue , but it 's clear that even they do n't all agree .
George J. Borjas is a celebrated Harvard University economist who emigrated from Cuba to the United States with his mother at the age of 12 , three years after Fidel Castro 's regime took over the country and confiscated his father 's garment factory . He has made vital contributions to many fields of economics , especially immigration , and has a new book , We Wanted Workers : Unraveling the Immigration Narrative , out this month . In it , he challenges the notion that immigration is `` universally beneficial . ''
Shikha Dalmia is a ███ Foundation analyst and a native of New Delhi , India , who came to America 31 years ago as an idealistic student looking to escape the corruption of a socialistic mixed economy . She writes extensively about immigration and firmly believes America shuts the door on outsiders at its economic and spiritual peril .
What follows is a spirited exchange between the two on the empirical claims and proposed policy prescriptions in We Wanted Workers .
Let me congratulate you on a book that is a model of clarity . We Wanted Workers systematically walks readers through the immigration literature . Along the way , it offers a sense of the immensely knotty methodological problems that bedevil the dismal science . Also , I agree completely that the `` overreliance on economic modeling and statistical findings '' on this subject is a regrettable development that fosters the notion that `` purely technocratic determinations of public policy '' are possible . In fact , the scientific hubris underlying such efforts prevents a full airing of the normative and ideological commitments that ultimately do—and perhaps should—guide policy .
That said , the more I read , the more despondent I got . The publisher 's teaser promises that the book `` takes a fresh and thought-provoking new look '' that parses the claims on the `` two extreme poles '' of those calling for `` tougher laws…in a racially tinged discourse '' on one end and those pushing for `` more open policies '' on the other . But the book focused almost exclusively on the second target while largely ignoring the first , even when its own facts warranted a smackdown .
You point out that the pro-immigration camp 's claims that America is a magnet for the `` best and brightest '' are overblown because which foreigners—high-skilled or low-skilled—make a beeline for America depends on how well their skills are rewarded in their own country . Highly egalitarian countries such as Denmark lose their highly skilled workers because , relative to less-skilled counterparts , their labor is rewarded less well , whereas the reverse is the case in highly inegalitarian countries such as Mexico . That 's an interesting thesis , but it does n't explain India , my native country , which has extreme inequality and is among the biggest `` donors '' of high-skilled talent . It was odd that you shoehorned India into the same category as Canada and Australia as a country with `` less inequality . ''
But America 's genius is not that it draws the best people but that it draws out the best from people , which is why even the world 's `` wretched '' manage to make something of themselves here . Indeed , the essential thing for `` success '' is not a college degree but drive , which those with the cojones to uproot themselves and make the difficult schlep to a foreign land have in spades . This process of self-selection has served America—and immigrants—so well that even the restrictionist lobby has n't questioned it . But you devote a whole chapter to lamenting the forces of `` self-selection '' that thwart Uncle Sam 's efforts to ensure that immigrants who come to America are `` exactly the types the country is looking for . '' Putting more faith in government over markets to properly regulate labor flows is n't very American !
But even if one accepts that the `` best and brightest '' trope is oversimplified , it 's at least partly true . Not so with the poisonous myths of the restrictionist right about anchor babies and chain migration . These things occur , but are hardly widespread phenomena . Consider chain migration . Restrictionists allege that letting immigrants sponsor non-nuclear family members sets off a chain reaction as immigrants sponsor their relatives to come to America who sponsor more relatives…until entire Third World villages are emptied into America ! But the only `` non-nuclear '' relatives that citizens or permanent residents are allowed to sponsor are siblings . What 's more , there is a strict annual national quota on the number that can be admitted from each country . This produces long wait times that currently touch 23 years for siblings of Filipino immigrants , making widespread chain migration a virtual impossibility . You acknowledge all these facts but never connect the dots to say as much . There are many such omissions .
We Wanted Workers confirms the hardline restrictionist narrative that low-skilled immigrants do n't assimilate economically , meaning that their wages lag behind other groups . I appreciate that you blame this not on their ethnicity , as is the wont of the racist restrictionists , but on their entering skill levels , which track the nations they come from . Comparing German and Mexican immigrants , you note that the 30 percent wage gap that existed between them in 1920 had narrowed to 10 percent in 2000 , lamenting that the melting pot worked but took close to 100 years . My initial reaction to this was `` So what—so long as these groups are making progress relative to their own aspirations ? '' But to truly know how well the melting pot is melting , we need to compare not various immigrant groups to each other , but immigrant groups relative to natives in the same socio-economic strata . In other words , how do the children and grandchildren of Mexican drywall hangers compare with those of Americans doing similar jobs ? If Mexican grandchildren own mid-sized construction companies and American ones remain drywall hangers , surely that would better indicate how rapidly immigrants assimilate .
You question not just the impact of low skilled immigrants on American wages and jobs but also , astonishingly , the high-skilled immigrants that most accept as positive . You say that your fellow economists exaggerate that economic migrants are complements to—rather than substitutes for—American workers and therefore underestimate the downward pressure on native employment and wages . Moreover , you believe that low-skilled immigrants have negative productivity spillover effects—meaning that their habits depress the productivity of the overall economy , not enhance it—while high-skilled immigrants have positive productivity effects , but they are too small to offset their other negative economic impacts on natives .
I will let the experts parse the controversial methodology underlying these claims and simply take them at face value for now . With respect to low-skilled immigrants , the very worst long-term consequence you identify is a 3.1 percent reduction in the wages of native high school dropouts , a vanishing subset of the population . So even if you are right that immigration enthusiasts overstate their claims , is n't this a pretty small downside ? No policy has zero losers , after all . The question is whether the wins outweigh the losses .
But it was your discussion about high-skilled immigration that was truly eye-popping . You insist that high-skilled natives are vulnerable to `` supply shocks '' just like their low-skilled counterparts and explain how an influx of Russian math Ph.D.s drove American math Ph.D.s to pursue different careers . But it is not clear why pushing natives into areas where they can better compete is a bad thing . This may be acceptable , you claim , if these immigrants triggered big productivity gains and , stunningly , offer the example of Albert Einstein to show that 's not the case . His dismissal , along with other Jewish physicists from Nazi Germany , you say , did not lower the publication rate of their German departments `` at all '' —and , presumably , by corollary did n't boost the rate of their new American departments .
But if this example reveals anything it is the glaring inadequacy of your `` publication '' metric that could n't capture the contributions of an incandescent genius who changed the trajectory of human history , making America the formidable giant in theoretical science . ( Same with his Princeton colleague , the math genius Kurt Gödel , an Austrian immigrant . ) Surely , if we are going to question anything , it is your instrument rather than the contributions of such immigrants ? You say that the cardinal mistake of the pro-immigration camp is that it treats immigrants like widgets rather than people whose personal baggage negatively affects the institutions of their adopted country . But certainly such petty bean counting so devoid of qualitative dimensions is also guilty of this mistake ?
Your most scathing observation is that immigration , not counting the fiscal costs on schools , welfare , and other government programs , produces a $ 50 billion economic surplus , but that this essentially benefits employers , the users of immigrants—not American workers , the competitors of immigrants . In essence , you state , this implies a `` redistribution of half-a-trillion dollars from workers to firms .

That question had a surprising answer : It depends on whether the U.S. offers higher rewards for skills than the sending countries . If we do , we attract the best and the brightest . If we do n't , we wo n't .
Pretty obvious , right ? But my question had nothing to do with ideology . And this is one way in which you and I differ . You seem to interpret models and results through an ideological filter . Each `` factoid '' in the book is judged according to how it fits a preconceived notion of how the world should work . I read the same factoids and I think about the underlying economic question : What is driving the market to reach such an outcome ?

You note that I avoided talking about `` the poisonous myths of the restrictionist right about anchor babies and chain migration . No doubt these alleged problems occur , but they are hardly widespread phenomena . ''
There is a very simple ███ for why only some issues ended up in the book . Those are the questions that have preoccupied economists over the past few decades . There have been remarkably few studies—and no single study that someone who is not an immigration specialist would find worth reading—of anchor babies and chain migration .
It is not that these other issues are not important . But they may not be sufficiently attractive to an economist wishing to write a paper that can propel a career forward , or they can not be framed in a simple way , or the data are really bad . Economists are rational human beings too . They will pursue topics that offer the greatest opportunity for professional gains . A fair portrayal of the topics that ended up in the book is that they cover those issues that were of major concern to economists and that led to major advances in our understanding .
Let me now address the wage impact of immigration . This is not the place to go into the many technical details that confound consumers of this very technical literature . But you say something that resonates ( and not in a good way ) : `` The very worst long-term consequence of immigration that you identify is a 3.1 percent reduction in the wages of high school dropouts…Even if you are right that immigration enthusiasts have overstated their claims that immigration generates no losers at all , is n't this a pretty small downside ? ''
You are referring to my conclusion that the earnings of high school dropouts fell by 3 to 6 percent because of immigration . I specifically address the issue you raise in the book : `` The economic , social , and political consequences of pursuing policies that harm the most disadvantaged Americans are ignored at our peril . '' Just look at our current political landscape . I think it is extremely shortsighted to dismiss the impact on low-skill workers by arguing that few workers are affected in this fashion or that the effect is small . The typical male high school dropout earns $ 29,000 annually . A policy-mandated pay cut of $ 900 to $ 1,700 is not trivial , and it suggests that the policy makers perhaps have their priorities all wrong .
You raise an important point about the small $ 50 billion immigration surplus that the textbook economic model produces , and the huge $ 500 billion redistribution that goes alongside it , asking whether perhaps my `` quarrel is n't with immigration , but the market economy . ''
I have no `` quarrel '' with a market economy . My argument is instead that a candid appraisal should not sweep the distributional effects of immigration under the rug . And it should incorporate the insight embodied in Max Frisch 's observation about the guest workers that Germany admitted back in the 1960s : `` We wanted workers , but we got people instead . '' Immigrants are more than the robotic workers that populate the models used in the `` search for efficiency . '' And that fact generates additional wrinkles . For instance , the evidence already suggests that the $ 50 billion surplus disappears entirely if we account for the fiscal burden imposed by immigration . In other words , a fuller appraisal might have to recognize that , in the end , immigration is just another government redistribution program .
Admirably , you affirm where you are coming from when it comes to immigration restrictions : `` In my mind such draconian curbs on individual liberty are justified only when there are worse harms to be mitigated . '' You then ask me where I stand : `` What role , if any , does the need to protect individual liberty , mobility rights , and freedom of association play in your thinking on immigration policy ? ''
My answer will surely shock you , but I have never devoted much time to thinking about that . My research was never motivated or influenced by what I thought about individual liberty or the rights of people to live anywhere they want . My personal experience with Communist indoctrination when I was 10 and 11 years old left me very wary of thinking about anything in ideological terms .
Your question is more specific , however . How do these tenets of libertarianism affect my thinking about immigration policy ? And my answer , again , will shock you . They do n't enter my thinking at all . I myself would not trust my moralizing about what is right and what is wrong . As much as I wish I were a perfect human being with pure motivations and in possession of all the answers , I know I am not .
I tend to see both sides of the coin in everything . Would n't it be wonderful if we inhabited a world where everybody could move to where they wanted and lead happy and productive lives ? But if a billion immigrants from the developing world were to enter Europe and North America , the developed world would surely change . And anyone with any common sense knows that some of those changes would not be to the good .
Immigration creates winners and losers , Shikha , and the net gain may not be as large as some had hoped . I hope that We Wanted Workers has at least given you some food for thought regarding that possibility . So any discussion of immigration policy has to contrast the gains accruing to the winners with the losses suffered by the losers . Who are you rooting for ?
And if your answer is that you stand firmly behind the lofty axioms of mobility rights and freedom of association , then do not act surprised when the losers in that New World Order wake up , realize that the narrative is a crock , and revolt .
Thank you for your clear and candid response—and let me return the favor by being equally clear and candid . You say you strove to debunk both sides . But you did n't fully succeed , in my view . And perhaps that 's because even a pre-eminent and empirically driven economist such as yourself ultimately is n't free from normative assumptions . `` Preconceived notions of how the world works '' inevitably seep into one 's work . You can choose them consciously , or you can absorb them subconsciously from the broader zeitgeist . If you had no moral assumptions , how would you know whom to `` root for '' ?
You acknowledge that you stayed away from addressing poisonous restrictionist myths , noting that there is n't enough of a professional upside to addressing them . I certainly understand the need for beginning scholars to focus on professionally sexy research topics . But you are an established figure who published a `` popular '' book with a commercial press , in the middle of an election cycle in which one presidential candidate is trying to ride such myths to the White House . Surely , you could afford to direct some of your considerable professional status and firepower to straightening that side of the ledger too ?
Both you and I are wary of economic models . Despite my pro-immigration proclivities , you could persuade me that models showing that John Lennon 's utopia , where a borderless world would lead to a $ 40 trillion increase in the global gross domestic product , is overstated . One ███ , as you note , is that they ignore all the transaction , transportation , psychic , and other costs of emigrating and assume that all workers who could boost their wages by moving would do so . That 's not the case . You point out that America has no border restrictions with Puerto Rico , whose construction workers alone could double their wages by buying a `` one-way plane ticket that costs a fraction of a week 's salary . '' Yet `` two-thirds of Puerto Ricans have chosen not to move '' ( your emphasis ) . This same fact can be used to undercut restrictionist claims that looser borders would instantly flood America . Yet you not just fail to note this but repeat it in your response .
`` Preconceived notions '' influence not just the conclusions you draw but also the questions you ask . You posit the existing distribution of wealth as the desirable state of affairs and brand a policy that disrupts it as `` redistribution '' —hardly a morally neutral term . Furthermore , you play up the long-term harm that immigration causes high-school dropouts . But that is the least persuasive part of your analysis precisely because it treats these workers like non-volitional `` widgets , '' incapable of changing their behavior to minimize the direct harm from immigration ( by acquiring new skills ) or taking advantage of the new opportunities ( by exploiting their linguistic edge ) it opens up . But even if you were right about the harm immigration causes them , arguably they may suffer more harm if businesses that ca n't import workers choose to export or automate away more jobs in order to remain globally competitive .
Lastly , when I asked you what role liberty plays in your thinking , I was referring to your policy prescriptions , not your research . That 's because one 's conclusions do n't flow automatically from one 's findings . Even if your findings about the economic harms of immigration were indisputable , which they are not , they may not add up to a case for restrictionism any more than the harms from free speech would add up to a case for scrapping the First Amendment . The draconian government policies that restrictionism entails—and you endorse—might be even more harmful than immigration for a nation with a bedrock commitment to individual rights and limited government . That liberty was no part of the color mix of your normative palette was n't shocking , but it did leave me thinking that your immigration picture was too dark and distorted .
I have truly enjoyed having this exchange . It is invigorating to discuss what it all means with someone from your ideological perspective who is able to extract and enunciate the core issues in such a clear and striking fashion . Let me clarify some relatively minor points before I conclude with the big picture .
One perhaps not-so-minor point is your claim that : `` You acknowledge that you stayed away from addressing poisonous restrictionist myths , noting that there is n't enough of a professional upside to addressing them . '' I acknowledged no such thing . Perhaps my phrasing was n't sufficiently clear , so let me be as clear as I can be now . We Wanted Workers focuses on issues that attracted professional interest ( my own , as well as that of others ) in the past three decades . Perhaps those select issues tend to fall on one side of the ideological divide rather than the other , but the ideological implications of any particular issue had nothing to do with whether they are discussed and `` unraveled '' in the book .
If you contrast the topics I cover with the topics covered in two National Academy reports ( the one published in 1997 , and the one to be published in September 2016 ) , you will find an awful lot of overlap . And that is because it is hard to thoroughly survey topics—regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum—that have not been thought through carefully by many researchers before . What I do concede is that I stayed away from many topics throughout my career , including the chain migration issue that started this particular discussion . But the ███ I stayed away from all those topics had nothing to do with ideology . There are only so many hours in a day and I wanted to have a family life . More often than not , I was simply not smart enough to be able to frame the problem in terms of an economic model I could easily manipulate , or I could not get access to data that would enable me to conduct a serious study of the issue .
You are not surprised that `` liberty was no part of [ my ] color mix '' as I spent all these years thinking about and doing research on immigration issues . There 's a sophomoric joke among economists that `` we had our morals removed in graduate school , '' and I plead guilty . My thinking has never been guided by deep philosophical thoughts—a bit ironic , in retrospect , as John Rawls lived a couple of doors down from me for many years . You 'd think that if spillover effects really exist , something `` in the air '' would have rubbed off . But the way I 've pursued my work just reflects my own somewhat geeky interests ( I had to take two or three philosophy classes in college , and absolutely detested them ) , and not a `` dark '' desire to spin what I was trying to say one way or the other .
Which brings me to your description of the picture painted by the book as `` dark . '' This is precisely why I dislike ideological arguments . They demonize the other side in a clever and pithy way without really giving an understanding of why the picture might have turned out that way . I totally reject the notion that the book is `` dark '' in any way . I would argue instead that it is a pragmatic condensation of what we know about immigration . Reality has a way of looking very bleak to those wedded to a very narrow narrative . But facts do n't kneel to ideology .
And , finally , let me get to the elephant in the room . I ended my discussion in the first round by noting that `` immigration creates winners and losers and the net gain may not be as large as some had hoped . So any discussion of immigration policy has to contrast the gains accruing to the winners with the losses suffered by the losers . '' You did not address this very thorny issue in your response , so let me conclude by rephrasing it in even starker terms , as it isolates the problem at the core of our disagreement .
The evidence summarized in We Wanted Workers suggests that it is quite possible that the `` efficiency gains '' that receive so much emphasis in the libertarian narrative are totally offset by the costs associated with welfare expenditures or harmful productivity spillovers . As I said , it may well be that `` immigration is just another government redistribution program . '' My italicization of `` just '' was not a random click on my track pad . It was meant to drive home the point that there is a good chance that all that immigration does is redistribute wealth .
If there are no efficiency gains to be had , then espousing any specific immigration policy is nothing but a declaration that group x is preferred to group y . It is easy to avoid clarifying who you are rooting for by trying to reframe the debate in terms of amorphous philosophical ideals about mobility rights and the like . But this is where we go our separate ways . When push comes to shove , I will side with policies that improve the well-being of the American worker .","Even as the mighty Statue of Liberty beckons the world's ""poor and huddled masses"" to America's shores, Americans themselves have been ambivalent, to put it mildly, about how many newcomers ought to be welcomed and from where. To the extent that a pro-immigration consensus has existed, it was always an uneasy one. But Donald Trump's meteoric political rise after embracing an extreme restrictionist agenda has shattered that fragile status quo, dividing pundits and public, academics and analysts throughout the 2016 election season. There's an absence of good polling data to shine a light on how immigrants themselves feel about this issue, but it's clear that even they don't all agree.

George J. Borjas is a celebrated Harvard University economist who emigrated from Cuba to the United States with his mother at the age of 12, three years after Fidel Castro's regime took over the country and confiscated his father's garment factory. He has made vital contributions to many fields of economics, especially immigration, and has a new book, We Wanted Workers: Unraveling the Immigration Narrative, out this month. In it, he challenges the notion that immigration is ""universally beneficial.""

Shikha Dalmia is a Reason Foundation analyst and a native of New Delhi, India, who came to America 31 years ago as an idealistic student looking to escape the corruption of a socialistic mixed economy. She writes extensively about immigration and firmly believes America shuts the door on outsiders at its economic and spiritual peril.

What follows is a spirited exchange between the two on the empirical claims and proposed policy prescriptions in We Wanted Workers.

Dear Professor Borjas:

Let me congratulate you on a book that is a model of clarity. We Wanted Workers systematically walks readers through the immigration literature. Along the way, it offers a sense of the immensely knotty methodological problems that bedevil the dismal science. Also, I agree completely that the ""overreliance on economic modeling and statistical findings"" on this subject is a regrettable development that fosters the notion that ""purely technocratic determinations of public policy"" are possible. In fact, the scientific hubris underlying such efforts prevents a full airing of the normative and ideological commitments that ultimately do—and perhaps should—guide policy.

That said, the more I read, the more despondent I got. The publisher's teaser promises that the book ""takes a fresh and thought-provoking new look"" that parses the claims on the ""two extreme poles"" of those calling for ""tougher laws…in a racially tinged discourse"" on one end and those pushing for ""more open policies"" on the other. But the book focused almost exclusively on the second target while largely ignoring the first, even when its own facts warranted a smackdown.

You point out that the pro-immigration camp's claims that America is a magnet for the ""best and brightest"" are overblown because which foreigners—high-skilled or low-skilled—make a beeline for America depends on how well their skills are rewarded in their own country. Highly egalitarian countries such as Denmark lose their highly skilled workers because, relative to less-skilled counterparts, their labor is rewarded less well, whereas the reverse is the case in highly inegalitarian countries such as Mexico. That's an interesting thesis, but it doesn't explain India, my native country, which has extreme inequality and is among the biggest ""donors"" of high-skilled talent. It was odd that you shoehorned India into the same category as Canada and Australia as a country with ""less inequality.""

But America's genius is not that it draws the best people but that it draws out the best from people, which is why even the world's ""wretched"" manage to make something of themselves here. Indeed, the essential thing for ""success"" is not a college degree but drive, which those with the cojones to uproot themselves and make the difficult schlep to a foreign land have in spades. This process of self-selection has served America—and immigrants—so well that even the restrictionist lobby hasn't questioned it. But you devote a whole chapter to lamenting the forces of ""self-selection"" that thwart Uncle Sam's efforts to ensure that immigrants who come to America are ""exactly the types the country is looking for."" Putting more faith in government over markets to properly regulate labor flows isn't very American!

But even if one accepts that the ""best and brightest"" trope is oversimplified, it's at least partly true. Not so with the poisonous myths of the restrictionist right about anchor babies and chain migration. These things occur, but are hardly widespread phenomena. Consider chain migration. Restrictionists allege that letting immigrants sponsor non-nuclear family members sets off a chain reaction as immigrants sponsor their relatives to come to America who sponsor more relatives…until entire Third World villages are emptied into America! But the only ""non-nuclear"" relatives that citizens or permanent residents are allowed to sponsor are siblings. What's more, there is a strict annual national quota on the number that can be admitted from each country. This produces long wait times that currently touch 23 years for siblings of Filipino immigrants, making widespread chain migration a virtual impossibility. You acknowledge all these facts but never connect the dots to say as much. There are many such omissions.

We Wanted Workers confirms the hardline restrictionist narrative that low-skilled immigrants don't assimilate economically, meaning that their wages lag behind other groups. I appreciate that you blame this not on their ethnicity, as is the wont of the racist restrictionists, but on their entering skill levels, which track the nations they come from. Comparing German and Mexican immigrants, you note that the 30 percent wage gap that existed between them in 1920 had narrowed to 10 percent in 2000, lamenting that the melting pot worked but took close to 100 years. My initial reaction to this was ""So what—so long as these groups are making progress relative to their own aspirations?"" But to truly know how well the melting pot is melting, we need to compare not various immigrant groups to each other, but immigrant groups relative to natives in the same socio-economic strata. In other words, how do the children and grandchildren of Mexican drywall hangers compare with those of Americans doing similar jobs? If Mexican grandchildren own mid-sized construction companies and American ones remain drywall hangers, surely that would better indicate how rapidly immigrants assimilate.

You question not just the impact of low skilled immigrants on American wages and jobs but also, astonishingly, the high-skilled immigrants that most accept as positive. You say that your fellow economists exaggerate that economic migrants are complements to—rather than substitutes for—American workers and therefore underestimate the downward pressure on native employment and wages. Moreover, you believe that low-skilled immigrants have negative productivity spillover effects—meaning that their habits depress the productivity of the overall economy, not enhance it—while high-skilled immigrants have positive productivity effects, but they are too small to offset their other negative economic impacts on natives.

I will let the experts parse the controversial methodology underlying these claims and simply take them at face value for now. With respect to low-skilled immigrants, the very worst long-term consequence you identify is a 3.1 percent reduction in the wages of native high school dropouts, a vanishing subset of the population. So even if you are right that immigration enthusiasts overstate their claims, isn't this a pretty small downside? No policy has zero losers, after all. The question is whether the wins outweigh the losses.

But it was your discussion about high-skilled immigration that was truly eye-popping. You insist that high-skilled natives are vulnerable to ""supply shocks"" just like their low-skilled counterparts and explain how an influx of Russian math Ph.D.s drove American math Ph.D.s to pursue different careers. But it is not clear why pushing natives into areas where they can better compete is a bad thing. This may be acceptable, you claim, if these immigrants triggered big productivity gains and, stunningly, offer the example of Albert Einstein to show that's not the case. His dismissal, along with other Jewish physicists from Nazi Germany, you say, did not lower the publication rate of their German departments ""at all""—and, presumably, by corollary didn't boost the rate of their new American departments.

But if this example reveals anything it is the glaring inadequacy of your ""publication"" metric that couldn't capture the contributions of an incandescent genius who changed the trajectory of human history, making America the formidable giant in theoretical science. (Same with his Princeton colleague, the math genius Kurt Gödel, an Austrian immigrant.) Surely, if we are going to question anything, it is your instrument rather than the contributions of such immigrants? You say that the cardinal mistake of the pro-immigration camp is that it treats immigrants like widgets rather than people whose personal baggage negatively affects the institutions of their adopted country. But certainly such petty bean counting so devoid of qualitative dimensions is also guilty of this mistake?

Your most scathing observation is that immigration, not counting the fiscal costs on schools, welfare, and other government programs, produces a $50 billion economic surplus, but that this essentially benefits employers, the users of immigrants—not American workers, the competitors of immigrants. In essence, you state, this implies a ""redistribution of half-a-trillion dollars from workers to firms."" But if that's the case, then every search for efficiency—every groundbreaking innovation, every new trade deal, every revolutionary technology—that disrupts existing employment patterns is tantamount to the redistribution of wealth from labor to capital. If so, your quarrel isn't with immigration but with the market economy.

Based on this downbeat assessment, you endorse a sweeping restrictionist agenda that opposes legalization of the undocumented population unless we've ""regained control of the border,"" and you advocate serious penalties on employers who hire undocumented workers and an E-Verify mandate on employers. Not surprisingly, you don't entertain an end to the current regime of labor prohibitionism against low-skilled workers by reviving the Bracero guest worker program with Mexico, the only effective way of stanching the future flow of illegal immigrants. And far from expanding the visa quotas for high-skilled workers, despite industry pleading, you want to jack up the fees for H-1Bs.

To your credit, you openly acknowledge that a ""massive new government"" will be required to ""supervise a massive wealth redistribution""—and, I might add, disrupt the natural pattern of human mobility that would emerge if Americans and foreigners were left relatively unfettered to associate with each other according to their preferences.

To put my ideological commitments on the table, in my mind such draconian curbs on individual liberty are justified only when there are worse harms to be mitigated. But even if all the harms you list were correct, that won't add up to the level of those that an overweening government might cause to get the ""correct"" distribution of income. So my question to you is: What role, if any, does the need to protect individual liberty, mobility rights, and freedom of association play in your thinking on immigration policy?

Yours sincerely,

Shikha

Dear Shikha,

I am pleased you found the book valuable and accessible. Let me try to respond by addressing some of the questions you raise and raising some of my own.

You claim that I devote a disproportionate amount of time to debunking the claims of immigration enthusiasts, but much less to debunking restrictionists. I want to address this point head on, as I truly tried to expose myths regardless of their source. For instance, I thought I gave equal time to dismissing the polar claims that immigrants are the ""best and the brightest"" or ""the wretched refuse of those teeming shores."" As I write in the book: ""There has been an enduring interest in how immigrants are self-selected, and it is customary to pick one of two extremes when describing the selection…I find these types of ideologically motivated assumptions and platitudes thoroughly unconvincing.""

A little intellectual history may help. I began to think about immigrant selection in 1985, a time when immigration was far removed from the center of social policy concerns. So my interest had nothing to do with policy. It reflected my curiosity about a technical question: What does economics have to say about the self-selection of immigrants? If people move from place to place in search of higher incomes, which types of people—the ""best and brightest"" or the ""wretched refuse""—find it worthwhile to pick up and move? That question had a surprising answer: It depends on whether the U.S. offers higher rewards for skills than the sending countries. If we do, we attract the best and the brightest. If we don't, we won't.

Pretty obvious, right? But my question had nothing to do with ideology. And this is one way in which you and I differ. You seem to interpret models and results through an ideological filter. Each ""factoid"" in the book is judged according to how it fits a preconceived notion of how the world should work. I read the same factoids and I think about the underlying economic question: What is driving the market to reach such an outcome?

There may be another reason why you get the feeling that I leave the restrictionists alone. You note that I avoided talking about ""the poisonous myths of the restrictionist right about anchor babies and chain migration. No doubt these alleged problems occur, but they are hardly widespread phenomena.""

There is a very simple reason for why only some issues ended up in the book. Those are the questions that have preoccupied economists over the past few decades. There have been remarkably few studies—and no single study that someone who is not an immigration specialist would find worth reading—of anchor babies and chain migration.

It is not that these other issues are not important. But they may not be sufficiently attractive to an economist wishing to write a paper that can propel a career forward, or they cannot be framed in a simple way, or the data are really bad. Economists are rational human beings too. They will pursue topics that offer the greatest opportunity for professional gains. A fair portrayal of the topics that ended up in the book is that they cover those issues that were of major concern to economists and that led to major advances in our understanding.

Let me now address the wage impact of immigration. This is not the place to go into the many technical details that confound consumers of this very technical literature.

Dear Professor Borjas:

Thank you for your clear and candid response—and let me return the favor by being equally clear and candid. You say you strove to debunk both sides. But you didn't fully succeed, in my view. And perhaps that's because even a pre-eminent and empirically driven economist such as yourself ultimately isn't free from normative assumptions. ""Preconceived notions of how the world works"" inevitably seep into one's work. You can choose them consciously, or you can absorb them subconsciously from the broader zeitgeist. If you had no moral assumptions, how would you know whom to ""root for""?

You acknowledge that you stayed away from addressing poisonous restrictionist myths, noting that there isn't enough of a professional upside to addressing them. I certainly understand the need for beginning scholars to focus on professionally sexy research topics. But you are an established figure who published a ""popular"" book with a commercial press, in the middle of an election cycle in which one presidential candidate is trying to ride such myths to the White House. Surely, you could afford to direct some of your considerable professional status and firepower to straightening that side of the ledger too?

Both you and I are wary of economic models. Despite my pro-immigration proclivities, you could persuade me that models showing that John Lennon's utopia, where a borderless world would lead to a $40 trillion increase in the global gross domestic product, is overstated. One reason, as you note, is that they ignore all the transaction, transportation, psychic, and other costs of emigrating and assume that all workers who could boost their wages by moving would do so. That's not the case. You point out that America has no border restrictions with Puerto Rico, whose construction workers alone could double their wages by buying a ""one-way plane ticket that costs a fraction of a week's salary."" Yet ""two-thirds of Puerto Ricans have chosen not to move"" (your emphasis). This same fact can be used to undercut restrictionist claims that looser borders would instantly flood America. Yet you not just fail to note this but repeat it in your response.

""Preconceived notions"" influence not just the conclusions you draw but also the questions you ask. You posit the existing distribution of wealth as the desirable state of affairs and brand a policy that disrupts it as ""redistribution""—hardly a morally neutral term. Furthermore, you play up the long-term harm that immigration causes high-school dropouts. But that is the least persuasive part of your analysis precisely because it treats these workers like non-volitional ""widgets,"" incapable of changing their behavior to minimize the direct harm from immigration (by acquiring new skills) or taking advantage of the new opportunities (by exploiting their linguistic edge) it opens up. But even if you were right about the harm immigration causes them, arguably they may suffer more harm if businesses that can't import workers choose to export or automate away more jobs in order to remain globally competitive.

Lastly, when I asked you what role liberty plays in your thinking, I was referring to your policy prescriptions, not your research. That's because one's conclusions don't flow automatically from one's findings. Even if your findings about the economic harms of immigration were indisputable, which they are not, they may not add up to a case for restrictionism any more than the harms from free speech would add up to a case for scrapping the First Amendment. The draconian government policies that restrictionism entails—and you endorse—might be even more harmful than immigration for a nation with a bedrock commitment to individual rights and limited government. That liberty was no part of the color mix of your normative palette wasn't shocking, but it did leave me thinking that your immigration picture was too dark and distorted.

Yours sincerely,

Shikha

Dear Shikha,

I have truly enjoyed having this exchange. It is invigorating to discuss what it all means with someone from your ideological perspective who is able to extract and enunciate the core issues in such a clear and striking fashion. Let me clarify some relatively minor points before I conclude with the big picture.

One perhaps not-so-minor point is your claim that: ""You acknowledge that you stayed away from addressing poisonous restrictionist myths, noting that there isn't enough of a professional upside to addressing them."" I acknowledged no such thing. Perhaps my phrasing wasn't sufficiently clear, so let me be as clear as I can be now. We Wanted Workers focuses on issues that attracted professional interest (my own, as well as that of others) in the past three decades. Perhaps those select issues tend to fall on one side of the ideological divide rather than the other, but the ideological implications of any particular issue had nothing to do with whether they are discussed and ""unraveled"" in the book.

If you contrast the topics I cover with the topics covered in two National Academy reports (the one published in 1997, and the one to be published in September 2016), you will find an awful lot of overlap. And that is because it is hard to thoroughly survey topics—regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum—that have not been thought through carefully by many researchers before. What I do concede is that I stayed away from many topics throughout my career, including the chain migration issue that started this particular discussion. But the reason I stayed away from all those topics had nothing to do with ideology. There are only so many hours in a day and I wanted to have a family life. More often than not, I was simply not smart enough to be able to frame the problem in terms of an economic model I could easily manipulate, or I could not get access to data that would enable me to conduct a serious study of the issue.

You are not surprised that ""liberty was no part of [my] color mix"" as I spent all these years thinking about and doing research on immigration issues. There's a sophomoric joke among economists that ""we had our morals removed in graduate school,"" and I plead guilty. My thinking has never been guided by deep philosophical thoughts—a bit ironic, in retrospect, as John Rawls lived a couple of doors down from me for many years. You'd think that if spillover effects really exist, something ""in the air"" would have rubbed off. But the way I've pursued my work just reflects my own somewhat geeky interests (I had to take two or three philosophy classes in college, and absolutely detested them), and not a ""dark"" desire to spin what I was trying to say one way or the other.

Which brings me to your description of the picture painted by the book as ""dark."" This is precisely why I dislike ideological arguments. They demonize the other side in a clever and pithy way without really giving an understanding of why the picture might have turned out that way. I totally reject the notion that the book is ""dark"" in any way. I would argue instead that it is a pragmatic condensation of what we know about immigration. Reality has a way of looking very bleak to those wedded to a very narrow narrative. But facts don't kneel to ideology.

And, finally, let me get to the elephant in the room. I ended my discussion in the first round by noting that ""immigration creates winners and losers and the net gain may not be as large as some had hoped. So any discussion of immigration policy has to contrast the gains accruing to the winners with the losses suffered by the losers."" You did not address this very thorny issue in your response, so let me conclude by rephrasing it in even starker terms, as it isolates the problem at the core of our disagreement.

The evidence summarized in We Wanted Workers suggests that it is quite possible that the ""efficiency gains"" that receive so much emphasis in the libertarian narrative are totally offset by the costs associated with welfare expenditures or harmful productivity spillovers. As I said, it may well be that ""immigration is just another government redistribution program."" My italicization of ""just"" was not a random click on my track pad. It was meant to drive home the point that there is a good chance that all that immigration does is redistribute wealth.

If there are no efficiency gains to be had, then espousing any specific immigration policy is nothing but a declaration that group x is preferred to group y. It is easy to avoid clarifying who you are rooting for by trying to reframe the debate in terms of amorphous philosophical ideals about mobility rights and the like. But this is where we go our separate ways. When push comes to shove, I will side with policies that improve the well-being of the American worker.

Best regards,

The fundamental premise of the government shutdown is that the US-Mexico border is so dangerous to human life that it is worth shutting down whole swaths of the federal government , forcing 800,000 federal employees to miss paychecks , in order to address it .
And , of course , the way to solve the crisis , Trump argues ( in a primetime speech on Tuesday , and , as expected , during a trip to the border later this week ) is to give the federal government $ 5.7 billion to build about 250 more miles of physical barriers .
Most of Trump ’ s claims about the border are fever-dream fantasies that people who actually live there don ’ t recognize . But some of them have grains of truth : In one respect — the number of children and families entering the US — what we ’ re seeing is genuinely unprecedented .
Still , a shutdown-worthy crisis , much less a “ national emergency , ” is a rare and dire thing . A crisis may require immediate attention and a national debate to determine the best course of action , but it may not require that everything else grind to a halt . And not everything that is going wrong , or less than perfectly , is a crisis .
This is the most important thing to remember about the US-Mexico border and the Trump administration ’ s claims about it . Even if you believe that no one should come to the US without papers , or believe that too many asylum seekers are released into the country — or , conversely , if you believe the Trump administration ’ s treatment of children and families crossing the border is a national outrage — that isn ’ t the same as believing it ’ s a crisis in the way the Trump administration means .
To make that judgment , don ’ t start with what Trump says about the border . Start with what ’ s true .
1 ) The border panic has very little to do with what people who live on the border actually see
It ’ s certainly true that some Americans ( though probably not tens of millions ) are so worried about gang members and criminals coming over the border to kill them that they are willing to shut down the government over it . But the people who actually live on the border aren ’ t asking for any of this .
Because Trump has worked so tirelessly to reenforce the theme that Republicans will protect you from criminal immigrants while Democrats will abandon you to them , the easiest way to gauge whether border residents agree is to look at election results .
The 2018 midterm elections — when Trump , ignoring the advice of other Republicans , hammered relentlessly on border security in the last weeks of the campaign — resulted in Republicans losing two seats along the US-Mexico border , one in Arizona and one in New Mexico . In the current Congress , the only Republican representing a district along the border is Texas Rep. Will Hurd , an outspoken moderate on immigration who says his opposition to a border wall is the reason he won reelection .
In fact , as of 2017 ( according to the Pew Research Center ) , people who lived less than 350 miles from the border were the least likely to support Trump ’ s wall . In other words , the people supposedly on the front lines of what Trump calls a crisis are those least inclined to support the proposed solution to it .
People who live along the border are used to politicians — at both the local and state level — fearmongering about their hometowns . One Texas sheriff spoke out in 2014 to discourage politicians in his state government from hyping the border threat too much — they appreciated the extra money but worried it would hurt their tourism industry . “ A lot of tourists will call up to my office and say , ‘ Is it safe out there ? ’ ” the sheriff , Ronny Dodson , told Chris Hooks at the time . “ We ’ ll ask where they ’ re coming from . They ’ ll say ‘ Houston. ’ We ’ ll say , hurry up and get out of there ! It ’ s safer here than where you ’ re coming from . ”
The political rhetoric is feeding real fear — among people who live far from the border . But people who live closer to it simply don ’ t identify with that . That ’ s an important perspective to keep in mind in regards to not only Trump ’ s claims about the lawlessness of the border , but also how the American people see this as a crisis someone needs to step in to solve .
2 ) The US has more than 600 miles of border barriers — and 20-plus years of uninterrupted buildup
The US has been increasing security on its southern border since the 1990s . ( Trump ’ s attorney general nominee William Barr engaged in some of this buildup the last time he was AG , under George H.W . Bush . )
Border Patrol has expanded radically . Wave after wave of surveillance projects have been thrown at the border in the hopes of spotting every person or thing coming over . And across 650 miles of the border , even before Trump got into office , there was some form of physical barrier — from Vietnam-surplus landing mats to the steel bollards , or “ slats , ” Trump now favors for his wall as well .
Physical border barriers first came into use in urban areas , like San Diego and El Paso , where it was hard for Border Patrol agents to spot and catch people who crossed without papers . They ’ ve since expanded to other areas where large numbers of people might cross in an effort to deter easy crossings .
Some activists and progressives refer to the buildup at the border as a “ militarization , ” and there ’ s something to that — living on the border means being subject to roadside checkpoints , surveillance , and ( sometimes ) a fence through your backyard . Before Trump , both Democrats and Republicans were eager to increase border security at the drop of a hat . The effect ( along with the related phenomena of violence on the Mexican side of the border ) has been a transformation of border communities from cross-border exchanges to citadels .
When he was running for president , Trump had a ready rebuttal to this : He wasn ’ t just talking about a fence , but a real , honest-to-goodness wall . But after two years of actually being president , and having an administration that knows what ’ s feasible to construct and what Border Patrol agents actually prefer , his administration is exclusively building barriers out of steel bollards — the construction style that was the gold standard for barrier construction even before Trump .
Trump can continue to call it a “ steel wall , ” but what his administration is really proposing is updating and expanding an existing system of barriers , not creating a thing that hasn ’ t been there before .
3 ) In historical context , illegal border crossings are way down
The federal government doesn ’ t try to estimate how many people successfully cross into the US without papers , undetected . What it does — and has done for more than half a century — is use the number of migrants its agents catch trying to enter the US between ports of entry as a proxy for how many , overall , must be trying to get through .
By that measure , the security of the US-Mexico border in fiscal year 2018 ( which ended on September 30 of last year ) was comparable to the early 1970s .
Unauthorized migration to the US was already on the decline before the Great Recession — probably in part because the US government started formally deporting people instead of simply turning them back , making it harder for someone to try to enter the US several times in a single year . But the recession all but killed it .
The Trump administration doesn ’ t present things that way . It talks about patterns of the past decade ( where crossings have been roughly comparable ) or simply compares 2017 to 2018 . That makes 2018 seem like an alarming increase . But the reality is that 2017 was an abnormally slow year for border crossings — in part , researchers suspect , because the fear of a Trump presidency delayed some people from taking the trip .
Since numbers started ticking back up in early 2018 , the Trump administration has been in a near-constant state of panic over the border . It ’ s the result of a bad baseline — and unreasonable expectations .
4 ) We are seeing unprecedented numbers of families and children coming to the US without papers
Just as important as the change in how many people are crossing into the US between ports of entry is a change in who is doing it .
Over the past several years , adults traveling with children — and children traveling alone — have made up an ever-increasing share of people apprehended at the border . ( Often , “ apprehended ” means the migrants seek out a Border Patrol agent and turn themselves in to ask for asylum . )
The government has only been keeping separate statistics on apprehensions of families and children since 2012 . The numbers we ’ ve seen in the past few months are a record for that ( brief ) period — even outpacing the peak of the “ border crisis ” in June 2014 .
And while it might be hard to imagine that more families and children are coming to the US now than were in 2000 — when overall apprehensions were four times greater — experts say that ’ s exactly what ’ s happened . A 2017 report from the government ’ s Office of Immigration Statistics estimated that children and families made up less than 2 percent of border crossers during the 2003-2008 period . For the past few months , they ’ ve made up more than half of all apprehensions .
There are multiple reasons for this . The collapse of the unauthorized labor influx incentivized smugglers to find new markets . And they had some ready new markets in the people of the Northern Triangle of Central America ( El Salvador , Guatemala , and Honduras ) , who were desperate to leave gang violence and poverty . Meanwhile , adults who had already settled in the US wanted to bring the children of their family to live with them .
The result isn ’ t just that more of the people who are coming are children and families , but that , by the numbers , more children and families are coming than ever before . More than 150,000 children or family members were apprehended by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2018 . That ’ s nearly 10 percent of the overall apprehensions in 2000 — and we have no reason to believe that children and families actually made up 10 percent of what used to be a migration of single adults .
5 ) The Trump administration is tragically unequipped to deal with the families and children coming in now
The US ’ s border infrastructure isn ’ t designed to take care of families or children . But that ’ s the role it ’ s been forced into . And the results have been tragic .
Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in December that “ the infrastructure is not compatible with the reality ” of who is getting apprehended — essentially admitting that his agency was ill-equipped to take care of the people currently entering the US .
Border Patrol doesn ’ t even have the standards for detention conditions that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has — because Border Patrol isn ’ t supposed to be detaining anyone for any meaningful amount of time . The problem , of course , is that the times families are being held by Border Patrol for days on end are the times when the rest of the system is already overloaded and in crisis .
Before December 2018 , it had been a decade since any child had died in the custody of Border Patrol ( or its partner division , the Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations , which deals with ports of entry ) . In December 2018 , two children did .
The death of Jakelin Caal Maquin on December 8 has raised questions about Border Patrol ’ s responsiveness to medical needs and its capacity to deal with medical emergencies in remote areas of the border . The death of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez on Christmas Day has raised separate questions : about why a child was held in Border Patrol custody for six days before ICE was even asked to find a spot for him and his father , and about why he was shuffled between four facilities — including being taken from the hospital to a cramped highway checkpoint .
When it can no longer hold so many families in custody , the federal government has sometimes turned them out en masse without warning — as ICE did to several hundred families in El Paso before Christmas — leaving them in an unfamiliar country with a tight deadline to make it to their next immigration check-in .
At ports of entry , where it is legal to cross without papers if you wish to seek asylum in the US , some officials have told families to wait , or turned them away to come back later , in a semi-official policy known as “ metering. ” Metering has increased the incentive for families to cross between ports of entry illegally .
Democrats and progressives accuse the Trump administration of boxing itself into this resource crunch by detaining massive numbers of people ( including families ) to begin with , and argue that Border Patrol agents would be less overwhelmed if there were more capacity and willingness to process asylum seekers legally at ports . The administration , for its part , argues it ’ s doing everything it can and simply doesn ’ t have the resources it needs to provide humane care .
6 ) The “ problem ” of asylum seekers isn ’ t something that a wall can fix
It might be fair to call the current situation at the border a “ humanitarian crisis. ” But it isn ’ t why Trump shut down the government . And it isn ’ t something a wall can fix .
The point of walls is to prevent people from crossing into the US undetected . That ’ s not what most of the families and children who are crossing are doing . They ’ re turning themselves in to the nearest border agent they see on the US side .
Not all of them , but a large share , are seeking asylum — seeking to live legally in the US . That ’ s something they have a legal right to do even if they crossed illegally — and it ’ s something they could do at a port of entry even if there were a wall across the entire border .
The Trump administration ’ s specific problem with the influx of asylum seekers isn ’ t that it isn ’ t catching them — it ’ s that it can ’ t quickly deport them , and can ’ t detain them for the entire time until they are deported , because of extra legal protections for asylum seekers as well as for children and families . ( The administration calls these “ loopholes ” that create a policy of “ catch and release . ” )
To Trump and his administration , “ catch and release ” is a crisis — because it means that large numbers of people are released into the US on their own recognizance , many of whom don ’ t make it all the way through the asylum process or ultimately have their asylum claims denied .
The administration has long agitated to overhaul the law to close these “ loopholes , ” over strident objection from Democrats . Whether “ catch and release ” is a crisis is a matter of discussion . Whether a wall would address it is not .
7 ) There is no evidence of a terrorist crisis at the border
The Trump administration ’ s efforts to claim that thousands of terrorists or potential terrorists have tried to cross into the US have been roundly mocked and debunked . NBC found that a total of six known or suspected terrorists were caught trying to come to the US in the first six months of 2018 .
To a certain extent , the administration is ( either carelessly or mendaciously ) conflating “ known or suspected terrorists ” with “ special interest aliens ” — migrants who automatically get additional screening because of factors they might have in common with terrorists . One of those factors is “ travel patterns ” — in other words , being a “ special interest alien ” might just mean that one visited for , or is from , a country that the US considers friendly to terrorism . Even the Trump administration , which has banned nationals of several countries for similar reasons , isn ’ t claiming that everyone affected by the “ travel ban ” is a terrorist .
But the debunking of the administration ’ s specific numbers about terrorism at the border kind of misses a bigger point : that this whole conversation is about the typical vetting and screening process people undergo to enter the United States , and the number of people “ caught ” are the ones successfully identified .
There is no reason to assume that catching more potential “ terrorists ” means that more of them are slipping through . To the contrary , improving a vetting system should mean that ( in theory ) more people are being caught because fewer are slipping through .
On a very broad scale , it is true that perfect antiterrorism defense would require literally zero unauthorized border crossings . But that ’ s not the same as arguing that there is an imminent terrorist threat . And the way the administration talks about terrorism just isn ’ t related to the things it wants to do .
8 ) The border drug issue is about insufficient screening at ports
Similarly , Trump likes to characterize the border as a haven for drug smuggling , going on flights of fancy about drones or “ sacks of drugs ” hitting agents on the head .
It ’ s true that a lot of drugs consumed in the US come in via the border with Mexico . But the majority of them , consistently , come into the US at ports of entry — official border crossings . A wall would have no impact .
The Trump administration is actually working to address this problem , by scanning more vehicles at ports . In fact , its official offer to Congress to end the shutdown included $ 675 million for vehicle-scanning technology — though Vice President Pence said the request came from Democrats in Congress .
Building a wall probably wouldn ’ t cause more drugs to flow into the US . But that doesn ’ t mean building one is a national imperative .
9 ) Walls work — to direct people to cross somewhere else along the border
The Trump administration likes to cite statistics from areas where barriers have already been built , followed by a drop in apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants .
That ’ s how it ’ s supposed to work — because the wall was designed to get them to go somewhere else .
The purpose of physical barriers is what border agents call “ funneling ” — pushing people to cross where they can be more easily apprehended by Border Patrol .
That funneling can be helpful to ensure that Border Patrol agents catch as many people as possible , or to focus them on tracking more sophisticated criminal efforts .
But that doesn ’ t mean that you can reduce the overall number of people coming into the US by building as much wall as possible .
There is some evidence that previous border security buildups have succeeded in deterring some migrants from coming to the US over the past decade ( though some scholars argue that the Great Recession played a bigger role ) . There ’ s even more evidence that it ’ s deterred people who were caught once from trying to cross a second time .
But it ’ s not clear whether that ’ s an indication that the US could be even more effective with even more enforcement , or that the government has already picked the low-hanging fruit .
The people still coming to the US without papers are , increasingly , what are sometimes referred to as “ non-impactables ” — people who can ’ t be affected by the harshness of the typical immigration enforcement regime . Children and families from Central America are coming despite a journey that is often dangerous , and coming despite the possibility that they might not make it . It ’ s hard to deter people who are already so desperate .","President Trump wants you, and everyone else in America, to believe that the US-Mexico border isn’t just in trouble but in crisis.

The fundamental premise of the government shutdown is that the US-Mexico border is so dangerous to human life that it is worth shutting down whole swaths of the federal government, forcing 800,000 federal employees to miss paychecks, in order to address it.

And, of course, the way to solve the crisis, Trump argues (in a primetime speech on Tuesday, and, as expected, during a trip to the border later this week) is to give the federal government $5.7 billion to build about 250 more miles of physical barriers.

Most of Trump’s claims about the border are fever-dream fantasies that people who actually live there don’t recognize. But some of them have grains of truth: In one respect — the number of children and families entering the US — what we’re seeing is genuinely unprecedented.

Still, a shutdown-worthy crisis, much less a “national emergency,” is a rare and dire thing. A crisis may require immediate attention and a national debate to determine the best course of action, but it may not require that everything else grind to a halt. And not everything that is going wrong, or less than perfectly, is a crisis.

This is the most important thing to remember about the US-Mexico border and the Trump administration’s claims about it. Even if you believe that no one should come to the US without papers, or believe that too many asylum seekers are released into the country — or, conversely, if you believe the Trump administration’s treatment of children and families crossing the border is a national outrage — that isn’t the same as believing it’s a crisis in the way the Trump administration means.

The people still coming to the US without papers are, increasingly, what are sometimes referred to as “non-impactables” — people who can’t be affected by the harshness of the typical immigration enforcement regime. Children and families from Central America are coming despite a journey that is often dangerous, and coming despite the possibility that they might not make it.

Around 4 million unauthorized immigrants are stuck in legal limbo more than two weeks after a federal judge in Texas suspended President Obama's move to temporarily protect them from deportation.

Many of these parents of U.S. citizens and green-card holders are worried that the government will now force them to leave the U.S. The lack of legal clarity also means some of them are being treated inconsistently by government officials.

""I cried tears of joy to be with my son again, to be able to hug him and kiss him and play with him,"" Ayala says in Spanish. ""The whole time I was locked up I longed to be with him.""

'He's Not Safe'

Ayala's lawyer, Bryan Johnson, argued that his client was eligible for Obama's deferred action program for parents, which temporarily protected Ayala from deportation until the Texas court ruling put the program on hold. Now, Johnson says he's not sure what will happen during their next appointment with immigration officials.

""If you've been here for a long time and if you qualify, generally, then during this period, even with legal uncertainty, they should be in a good place,"" Obama told the audience in Miami.

Different Timelines

But Marty Rosenbluth, who teaches immigration law at Elon University, says that some local immigration offices have been applying the policy inconsistently and detaining parents who would have been left alone before the Texas court ruling.

""It's created a huge amount of fear, and people who were preparing to apply now don't know what to do,"" he says.

Colvin further noted that no SSNs had been granted under the Obama administration ’ s November 20 , 2014 expansion of DACA and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents ( DAPA ) due to a federal district court judge ’ s preliminary injunction on those programs .

Both the AFL-CIO and SEIU are lobbying for an easier path to citizenship
It should come as no surprise that prominent union leaders are among the first group President Barack Obama courts as he seeks support for overhauling immigration policy .
It was organized labor that helped ensure defeat of a bipartisan effort to reform the nation 's immigration laws five years ago .
At that time , the AFL-CIO and other prominent union groups came out against the initiative , fearing a proposal for a temporary guest worker program for seasonal workers would weaken union membership and bargaining clout .
That led to a handful of liberal-leaning Democrats to vote against the bill , including Sens . Sherrod Brown , Tom Harkin and Debbie Stabenow .
Mindful that a potential split in the Democratic coalition this time around could again prove fatal to the passage of an immigration bill , Obama met on Tuesday with more than a dozen labor leaders .
They included AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union , and Arturo Rodriguez of United Farm Workers .

The purpose of the hour-long , closed-door meeting was to engage in a `` dialogue '' about `` immigration reform and how it fits into his broader economic agenda , '' the White House said .
In comments to reporters following the meeting , there was evidence the president had sought to ensure that the union leaders were in his corner before he unveils an immigration proposal .

Conservatives are again pushing a temporary guest worker program

Both the AFL-CIO and SEIU are lobbying for an easier path to citizenship

It should come as no surprise that prominent union leaders are among the first group President Barack Obama courts as he seeks support for overhauling immigration policy.

It was organized labor that helped ensure defeat of a bipartisan effort to reform the nation's immigration laws five years ago.

At that time, the AFL-CIO and other prominent union groups came out against the initiative, fearing a proposal for a temporary guest worker program for seasonal workers would weaken union membership and bargaining clout.

That led to a handful of liberal-leaning Democrats to vote against the bill, including Sens. Sherrod Brown, Tom Harkin and Debbie Stabenow.

Mindful that a potential split in the Democratic coalition this time around could again prove fatal to the passage of an immigration bill, Obama met on Tuesday with more than a dozen labor leaders.

They included AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union, and Arturo Rodriguez of United Farm Workers.

The purpose of the hour-long, closed-door meeting was to engage in a ""dialogue"" about ""immigration reform and how it fits into his broader economic agenda,"" the White House said.

In comments to reporters following the meeting, there was evidence the president had sought to ensure that the union leaders were in his corner before he unveils an immigration proposal.

""It was an excellent conversation,"" Trumka said outside the White House. ""I think we are all on the same page.""

The White House has long been hopeful that the labor movement get on board.

Despite a contentious relationship at times with labor, the president's agenda has largely been supported by the major union leaders. Trumka also notably attended Obama's immigration speech last week in Las Vegas.

Nonetheless, the same sticking points that turned labor against immigration reform five years ago remain.

Conservatives, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, are again pushing a temporary guest worker program that is favored by the business community and agricultural interests that depend on seasonal employment.

But the major unions remain opposed to such a measure.

In 2009, both the AFL-CIO and the SEIU jointly released guidelines on an immigration reform package they would support.

Those guidelines called for ""improvement, not expansion"" of temporary worker programs. Obama has so far not mentioned a guest worker program in his broad outlines of an immigration reform plan.

The burden of attaining citizenship is another trip wire.

Both the AFL-CIO and SEIU are lobbying for an easier path to citizenship than was proposed by the 2007 effort.

That is in part because union membership has declined significantly over the past two decades along with contraction of U.S. manufacturing. A surge of new citizens, many of whom will seek unionized jobs, could boost their numbers.

""We were talking about trying to fix a broken system,"" Trumka said after the White House meeting. ""We were talking about commonsense reform that has an inclusive and broad path to citizenship that allows us to bring people in and take advantage of that.""

It ’ s an ironic twist for a presidential campaign that ’ s marked itself by casting aspersions on immigrants in general , and “ illegal ” immigrants in particular , for the past 17 months .
The AP ’ s revelations probably won ’ t sway Donald Trump ’ s supporters in the waning days of the campaign . And while technically under immigration law Melania ’ s citizenship could be revoked if the government found she ’ d committed visa fraud to come here , it ’ s extremely unlikely that that ’ s going to happen .
Immigration policy is extremely complicated ; the line between “ legal ” and “ illegal ” isn ’ t always visible . Melania appears to have entered the US legally and then worked illegally . If anything , that should give pause to anyone who believes her husband and other politicians who claim that unauthorized immigration can be remedied by building a wall at the border , or fixed easily at all .
Melania Trump came to the US in the mid-1990s to work as a model . But the specifics of her arrival , and the specific immigration status she had before getting a green card in 2001 , were always unclear — and have provoked a great deal of speculation about whether she was really a “ legal immigrant ” for the entire time she lived in the US .
The AP ’ s reporting doesn ’ t answer all the questions that have been raised about Melania ’ s immigration status , including how she got her green card in 2001 . But it does establish a clear timeline for how she came to the US to begin with . ( Lawyers affiliated with the Trumps dispute the AP article , saying its documents don ’ t “ reflect our records ” — but the Trumps have never released any documents related to Melania ’ s status themselves . )
According to the AP , Melania Knauss ( her maiden name ) first came to the US in August 1996 on a B1/B2 “ tourist visa. ” Tourist visas allow someone to stay in the US for six months , but they can ’ t seek employment in the US during that time .
Then on October 18 , 1996 , the AP found , she got an H-1B visa for “ skilled workers ” allowing her to work legally in the US as a model .
The problem is that the AP ’ s documentation shows that Melania was “ paid for 10 modeling assignments between September 10 and October 15 ” — while she was still on the tourist visa . In other words , she was working on a visa that didn ’ t legally permit her to work — and thus was violating the terms by which she ’ d been allowed to come to the US .
Melania could have committed visa fraud — or she could have been duped by unscrupulous employers
To be clear : Melania Knauss didn ’ t enter the US illegally . But she did , if the AP ’ s reporting is correct , violate immigration law .
Technically , she violated her tourist visa the minute she engaged in employment for pay in the US . But it ’ s possible that she didn ’ t know that .
B-visas are often issued to “ temporary business visitors ” — who are here for “ business activities ” but not allowed to work . It ’ s for people who are going to professional conferences , for example , or networking with associates — or even negotiating a contract for future employment . The US Citizenship and Immigration Services website explains that activities under a business visitor visa “ must be directly connected with and part of your work abroad . ”
Legally , working for pay for a US company is a clear violation of the terms of that visa , but it ’ s not exactly intuitive that someone coming on a business visa , especially if she ’ d been working as a model in Europe , wouldn ’ t be allowed to work .
This summer , when questions about Melania ’ s immigration status first came up , a Politico article cited a labor standards advocacy group ’ s claim that “ [ i ] t was a common practice in the 1990s in New York for less scrupulous agencies to bring in foreign models to work illegally on temporary business and tourist visas. ” If Melania Trump was on the same sort of visa as everyone else she worked with , it ’ s totally possible that she was simply being misled as to its legality .
Then again , it is also entirely possible that Melania knowingly committed visa fraud ; that , in fact , she lied to US immigration officials when entering the country in August 1996 about her intentions to work while in the US . That ’ s not just an immigration violation but an outright federal crime .
Either way , in order for Melania to have gotten a green card and then US citizenship , she would have had to attest that she hadn ’ t violated immigration law before — something that now appears to be untrue .
If the US government really wanted to , it could use the AP ’ s reporting to launch an investigation into whether Melania Trump deliberately misrepresented her immigration history when she sought US citizenship . It could even try to strip her of it .
It probably won ’ t . As the AP wrote , “ The government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases , such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes . ”
The fact of the matter is that not all violations of immigration law are equally serious . The federal government understands that , and conserves its resources accordingly . Melania Trump ’ s husband may not always understand it , but that ’ s the way the world works .
The problem isn ’ t Melania Trump — it ’ s a system that even Melania Trump can ’ t navigate
Ostensibly , the reason that Melania Trump ’ s immigration status 20 years ago is politically relevant is that it exposes her husband ’ s hypocrisy — which should , hypothetically , be a political liability for him . He says illegal immigrants should all be deported — but , according to this report , his own wife once worked illegally in the United States .
Yet Trump ’ s supporters tend to care less about an immigrant ’ s legal status than about whether she embraces US culture and values . If they liked Melania before , knowing she was an immigrant , it ’ s not obvious that they ’ ll start freaking out about her now .
What ’ s more interesting is that the scrutiny of Melania Trump actually undermines one of the core assumptions that Trump and his supporters have about the immigration system : that it ’ s perfectly clear who ’ s “ legal ” and who ’ s not , and that if you ’ re violating immigration law it must be out of malice . Neither of those things is true .
The scrutiny that Melania is facing , belatedly , is something that many immigrants and visa holders are entirely too familiar with . They ’ re used to having every detail of their pasts raked over — and having any inconsistency or mistake held up as evidence of fraud . Usually , it ’ s at the hands of the federal government .
I ’ ve seen Immigration and Customs Enforcement prosecutors accuse asylum seekers of making up their entire stories — simply because they said at one point that something happened in 1993 and at another point that it happened in 1994 . And most immigrants have fewer resources to make their case than the Trumps do .
Immigration law is incredibly hard to understand and even harder to comply with . That ’ s a very good reason not to pass laws that require government agents to be able to determine at a glance whether someone is “ legal ” or not — or deprive immigrants of a judicial hearing to sort out their status .
In other words , it ’ s a good reason not to automatically subject millions of immigrants to deportation and try to round up as many of them as possible without a chance to examine their cases — as Donald Trump has promised to do .","Would President Donald Trump have deported his own wife?

Immigration policy is extremely complicated; the line between “legal” and “illegal” isn’t always visible. Melania appears to have entered the US legally and then worked illegally. If anything, that should give pause to anyone who believes her husband and other politicians who claim that unauthorized immigration can be remedied by building a wall at the border, or fixed easily at all.

Melania Trump’s immigration history, explained

Melania Trump came to the US in the mid-1990s to work as a model. But the specifics of her arrival, and the specific immigration status she had before getting a green card in 2001, were always unclear — and have provoked a great deal of speculation about whether she was really a “legal immigrant” for the entire time she lived in the US.

The AP’s reporting doesn’t answer all the questions that have been raised about Melania’s immigration status, including how she got her green card in 2001. But it does establish a clear timeline for how she came to the US to begin with. (Lawyers affiliated with the Trumps dispute the AP article, saying its documents don’t “reflect our records” — but the Trumps have never released any documents related to Melania’s status themselves.)

According to the AP, Melania Knauss (her maiden name) first came to the US in August 1996 on a B1/B2 “tourist visa.” Tourist visas allow someone to stay in the US for six months, but they can’t seek employment in the US during that time.

Then on October 18, 1996, the AP found, she got an H-1B visa for “skilled workers” allowing her to work legally in the US as a model.

The problem is that the AP’s documentation shows that Melania was “paid for 10 modeling assignments between September 10 and October 15” — while she was still on the tourist visa. In other words, she was working on a visa that didn’t legally permit her to work — and thus was violating the terms by which she’d been allowed to come to the US.

Melania could have committed visa fraud — or she could have been duped by unscrupulous employers

To be clear: Melania Knauss didn’t enter the US illegally. But she did, if the AP’s reporting is correct, violate immigration law.

Technically, she violated her tourist visa the minute she engaged in employment for pay in the US. But it’s possible that she didn’t know that.

B-visas are often issued to “temporary business visitors” — who are here for “business activities” but not allowed to work. It’s for people who are going to professional conferences, for example, or networking with associates — or even negotiating a contract for future employment. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services website explains that activities under a business visitor visa “must be directly connected with and part of your work abroad.”

Legally, working for pay for a US company is a clear violation of the terms of that visa, but it’s not exactly intuitive that someone coming on a business visa, especially if she’d been working as a model in Europe, wouldn’t be allowed to work.

This summer, when questions about Melania’s immigration status first came up, a Politico article cited a labor standards advocacy group’s claim that “[i]t was a common practice in the 1990s in New York for less scrupulous agencies to bring in foreign models to work illegally on temporary business and tourist visas.” If Melania Trump was on the same sort of visa as everyone else she worked with, it’s totally possible that she was simply being misled as to its legality.

Then again, it is also entirely possible that Melania knowingly committed visa fraud; that, in fact, she lied to US immigration officials when entering the country in August 1996 about her intentions to work while in the US. That’s not just an immigration violation but an outright federal crime.

Either way, in order for Melania to have gotten a green card and then US citizenship, she would have had to attest that she hadn’t violated immigration law before — something that now appears to be untrue.

If the US government really wanted to, it could use the AP’s reporting to launch an investigation into whether Melania Trump deliberately misrepresented her immigration history when she sought US citizenship. It could even try to strip her of it.

It probably won’t. As the AP wrote, “The government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes.”

The fact of the matter is that not all violations of immigration law are equally serious. The federal government understands that, and conserves its resources accordingly. Melania Trump’s husband may not always understand it, but that’s the way the world works.

The problem isn’t Melania Trump — it’s a system that even Melania Trump can’t navigate

Ostensibly, the reason that Melania Trump’s immigration status 20 years ago is politically relevant is that it exposes her husband’s hypocrisy — which should, hypothetically, be a political liability for him. He says illegal immigrants should all be deported — but, according to this report, his own wife once worked illegally in the United States.

Yet Trump’s supporters tend to care less about an immigrant’s legal status than about whether she embraces US culture and values. If they liked Melania before, knowing she was an immigrant, it’s not obvious that they’ll start freaking out about her now.

What’s more interesting is that the scrutiny of Melania Trump actually undermines one of the core assumptions that Trump and his supporters have about the immigration system: that it’s perfectly clear who’s “legal” and who’s not, and that if you’re violating immigration law it must be out of malice. Neither of those things is true.

The scrutiny that Melania is facing, belatedly, is something that many immigrants and visa holders are entirely too familiar with. They’re used to having every detail of their pasts raked over — and having any inconsistency or mistake held up as evidence of fraud. Usually, it’s at the hands of the federal government.

I’ve seen Immigration and Customs Enforcement prosecutors accuse asylum seekers of making up their entire stories — simply because they said at one point that something happened in 1993 and at another point that it happened in 1994. And most immigrants have fewer resources to make their case than the Trumps do.

Immigration law is incredibly hard to understand and even harder to comply with. That’s a very good reason not to pass laws that require government agents to be able to determine at a glance whether someone is “legal” or not — or deprive immigrants of a judicial hearing to sort out their status.

In other words, it’s a good reason not to automatically subject millions of immigrants to deportation and try to round up as many of them as possible without a chance to examine their cases — as Donald Trump has promised to do.",www.vox.com,left,5Phe2AEI2KAV7eTl

Trump spent weeks ahead of the midterm elections warning that the United States was about to experience an invasion from a migrant caravan trekking north across Mexico , and sent troops to the border in what critics branded a political stunt .
He seized on unrest at the frontier on Sunday to hike pressure on Mexico and to squeeze his political opponents in Washington as he demands financing for his border wall in a looming government funding showdown .
`` Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants , many of whom are stone cold criminals , back to their countries , '' Trump tweeted early Monday morning .
`` Do it by plane , do it by bus , do it anyway you want , but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be . Congress , fund the WALL ! ''
Trump was reacting to reports that a group of migrants overwhelmed both Mexican federal and local police blockades and rushed towards the border at one of the busiest crossings between Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego . US authorities said several Border Patrol agents were hit by rocks , prompting the use of tear gas . Border crossings were closed in both directions for several hours , and it did not appear that any migrants breached the frontier .
The situation appeared to fall well short of the mass invasion by a caravan of thousands of migrants conjured up by Trump before the midterms .
Sunday 's events will further electrify political tensions in Washington as it gets to work after the Thanksgiving holiday and ahead of a month of transition and increasing vulnerability for the President .
Trump is also set to travel to another big international summit this week -- the G20 in Argentina -- that carries the habitual possibility that he could again fall out with other world leaders . The trip will also bring him face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the most contentious moment in US-China relations for decades as a trade war rages between the two powers .
Most ominously for Trump , Democrats are positioning themselves to unleash an unprecedented regime of investigation and oversight against his White House as soon as they take the reins of power in January , while special counsel Robert Mueller grinds away ever closer to the President 's inner circle
Just how miserable things could get next year for the President was revealed by incoming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday . The California Democrat vowed to bring acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker before Congress to probe whether he was appointed with the express purpose of disrupting the Mueller investigation .
He said the President was not being honest in casting doubt on the CIA 's conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi .
Schiff also said the new Democratic House would investigate whether the President 's response to this and other foreign policy questions was being influenced by a `` hidden hand '' of investments or past or business ties .
`` Is his personal financial interest driving US policy in the Gulf ? Is it driving US policy vis-a-vis the Russians ? We do n't know , but it would be irresponsible not to find out , '' Schiff said .
On NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland , who will head the House Oversight Committee , vowed proportionate investigations .
`` The American people said to us through this election , 'We want accountability . We want to check on this President of the United States . ' But they also said something else . They said , 'We want you to solve our problems , ' '' Cummings said .
The prospects of flying subpoenas and administration officials being hauled up to Capitol Hill points to crucial dynamics ahead of the 2020 elections .
How will the President react ? Will Democrats overreach and play into McConnell 's warnings of `` presidential harassment ? '' Can the President leverage Democratic opposition to court suburban voters who deserted him in the midterms ? Or will any revelations either from congressional probes or Mueller prove to be so serious that they bury his White House in scandal and put his entire presidency at risk ?
Trump could emerge from a period of retooling in his administration facing even fewer restraints from subordinates than has already been the case .
Key officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly are waiting to see if they will be retained . And Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that he 's getting irked by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over recent stock market losses .
Mnuchin is not currently thought to be threatened , but the report , and the President 's frequent tweeting about oil prices and the markets , does appear to hint at some nervousness over the future of the economy , which in its currently roaring state is the best argument for his 2020 re-election hopes .
In a glimpse into the feudal nature of life in Trump 's orbit , his former political aide Corey Lewandowski writes in his new book that enemies of the President are `` embedded '' in the White House and government agencies and trying to thwart his agenda , according to The Washington Post .
Trump has often embraced moments of converging threats and challenges to stoke an atmosphere of chaos in Washington that bolsters his standing with his political base and puts his opponents off balance .
But he now faces a test of his political strategy since his method -- for instance , using inflammatory rhetoric about immigration -- appears to have hurt Republicans in House races , even if it boosted Senate contenders .
For now , there is no sign of an adjustment : Trump broke convention in his Thanksgiving calls with troops by injecting political rhetoric about immigration and trade and boasting about his success .
His recent behavior , including a feud with Chief Justice John Roberts , either betrays an inability to rein in his relish for confrontation or a strategic decision that the wrecking ball approach is the best way to ensure his re-election .
Trump spent part of the weekend highlighting the migrant caravan .
`` If for any reason it becomes necessary , we will CLOSE our Southern Border . There is no way that the United States will , after decades of abuse , put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore ! '' Trump tweeted Saturday .
He may return to the topic on Monday in a pair of rallies for Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith , who is facing a runoff amid controversy over her past racially-tinged comments and actions .
The Washington Post reported that the incoming administration in Mexico has agreed to allow asylum seekers to remain south of the US border while their applications were processed , in what would be seen by Trump as a victory .
The new government , however , denied in a statement to CNN that a deal had been done .
A migrant is pushed back as she attempts to reach the border wall .
The politics of immigration will bear watching in the weeks ahead since they are crucial to Trump , who tends to resort to extremes , and Democrats who do not wish to come across as soft on border issues .
One Republican , Sen. Joni Ernst , who faces a potentially tricky Iowa re-election race in 2020 , hinted at the delicate nature of an issue that electrifies Trump 's base but can alienate more moderate voters on `` State of the Union . ''
She said she would prefer that Trump not follow through on his threat to close the US border , though pointed to the reports from Mexico to argue his rhetoric could be working .
`` I certainly think the President sees results any time that he does bring up an issue , and he does lay down certain reasons why he 's doing what he 's doing , '' Ernst told CNN 's Dana Bash .
Ernst also said she hoped that Trump would not honor threats to partially shutter the government if he does not get his border wall funded .
Trump said last week that if there was ever going to be a shutdown over the border wall , now would probably be the time to do it .
Congress averted a shutdown in September by passing a massive spending bill to fund a large portion of the government . The package did not , however , include money for Trump 's wall . Instead , lawmakers passed a shorter-term spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security , among other agencies , until December 7 .
It 's not clear either side really wants a shutdown . If precedent is any guide , it 's also possible the funding crunch could be put off by short-term deals that run until the end of the year or beyond .
The calculations could also influence other priorities in the mix , including disaster funding requests for fire-ravaged California , and a drive by Democrats and some Republicans to shield Mueller .
Bipartisan anger over Trump 's approach to Saudi Arabia could also complicate deal making , with both sides conscious of how actions now could play out in the new political reality next year .","(CNN) President Donald Trump is seizing on an attempt by 500 migrants to rush the southern border to use immigration as an issue to bolster his presidency at a critical political moment.

Democrats lining up investigations

Most ominously for Trump, Democrats are positioning themselves to unleash an unprecedented regime of investigation and oversight against his White House as soon as they take the reins of power in January, while special counsel Robert Mueller grinds away ever closer to the President's inner circle

Just how miserable things could get next year for the President was revealed by incoming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. The California Democrat vowed to bring acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker before Congress to probe whether he was appointed with the express purpose of disrupting the Mueller investigation.

He said the President was not being honest in casting doubt on the CIA's conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

Schiff also said the new Democratic House would investigate whether the President's response to this and other foreign policy questions was being influenced by a ""hidden hand"" of investments or past or business ties.

""Is his personal financial interest driving US policy in the Gulf? Is it driving US policy vis-a-vis the Russians? We don't know, but it would be irresponsible not to find out,"" Schiff said.

On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who will head the House Oversight Committee, vowed proportionate investigations.

""The American people said to us through this election, 'We want accountability. We want to check on this President of the United States.' But they also said something else. They said, 'We want you to solve our problems,'"" Cummings said.

A glimpse of how Washington will change

The prospects of flying subpoenas and administration officials being hauled up to Capitol Hill points to crucial dynamics ahead of the 2020 elections.

How will the President react? Will Democrats overreach and play into McConnell's warnings of ""presidential harassment?"" Can the President leverage Democratic opposition to court suburban voters who deserted him in the midterms? Or will any revelations either from congressional probes or Mueller prove to be so serious that they bury his White House in scandal and put his entire presidency at risk?

Trump could emerge from a period of retooling in his administration facing even fewer restraints from subordinates than has already been the case.

Key officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly are waiting to see if they will be retained. And Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that he's getting irked by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over recent stock market losses.

Mnuchin is not currently thought to be threatened, but the report, and the President's frequent tweeting about oil prices and the markets, does appear to hint at some nervousness over the future of the economy, which in its currently roaring state is the best argument for his 2020 re-election hopes.

In a glimpse into the feudal nature of life in Trump's orbit, his former political aide Corey Lewandowski writes in his new book that enemies of the President are ""embedded"" in the White House and government agencies and trying to thwart his agenda, according to The Washington Post.

Trump has often embraced moments of converging threats and challenges to stoke an atmosphere of chaos in Washington that bolsters his standing with his political base and puts his opponents off balance.

But he now faces a test of his political strategy since his method -- for instance, using inflammatory rhetoric about immigration -- appears to have hurt Republicans in House races, even if it boosted Senate contenders.

For now, there is no sign of an adjustment: Trump broke convention in his Thanksgiving calls with troops by injecting political rhetoric about immigration and trade and boasting about his success.

His recent behavior, including a feud with Chief Justice John Roberts, either betrays an inability to rein in his relish for confrontation or a strategic decision that the wrecking ball approach is the best way to ensure his re-election.

Back on the border

Trump spent part of the weekend highlighting the migrant caravan.

""If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore!"" Trump tweeted Saturday.

He may return to the topic on Monday in a pair of rallies for Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is facing a runoff amid controversy over her past racially-tinged comments and actions.

The Washington Post reported that the incoming administration in Mexico has agreed to allow asylum seekers to remain south of the US border while their applications were processed, in what would be seen by Trump as a victory.

The new government, however, denied in a statement to CNN that a deal had been done.

A migrant is pushed back as she attempts to reach the border wall.

The politics of immigration will bear watching in the weeks ahead since they are crucial to Trump, who tends to resort to extremes, and Democrats who do not wish to come across as soft on border issues.

One Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst, who faces a potentially tricky Iowa re-election race in 2020, hinted at the delicate nature of an issue that electrifies Trump's base but can alienate more moderate voters on ""State of the Union.""

She said she would prefer that Trump not follow through on his threat to close the US border, though pointed to the reports from Mexico to argue his rhetoric could be working.

""I certainly think the President sees results any time that he does bring up an issue, and he does lay down certain reasons why he's doing what he's doing,"" Ernst told CNN's Dana Bash.

Ernst also said she hoped that Trump would not honor threats to partially shutter the government if he does not get his border wall funded.

Trump said last week that if there was ever going to be a shutdown over the border wall, now would probably be the time to do it.

Congress averted a shutdown in September by passing a massive spending bill to fund a large portion of the government. The package did not, however, include money for Trump's wall. Instead, lawmakers passed a shorter-term spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, among other agencies, until December 7.

It's not clear either side really wants a shutdown. If precedent is any guide, it's also possible the funding crunch could be put off by short-term deals that run until the end of the year or beyond.

The calculations could also influence other priorities in the mix, including disaster funding requests for fire-ravaged California, and a drive by Democrats and some Republicans to shield Mueller.

Bipartisan anger over Trump's approach to Saudi Arabia could also complicate deal making, with both sides conscious of how actions now could play out in the new political reality next year.",www.cnn.com,left,tOVoYg5Dabproftj

As Judge Carolyn Dineen King wrote in a 53-page dissent to Monday’s decision, ""Although there are approximately 11.3 million removable aliens in this country today, for the last several years Congress has provided the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with only enough resources to remove approximately 400,000 of those aliens per year.”

If we had a Wall , they wouldn ’ t even try ! ”
House Democrats ordered Homeland Security officials this week to preserve all “ evidence ” related to the two deaths this month of Guatemalan children who jumped the U.S.-Mexico border with their parents , signaling an investigation next month .
An 8-year-old boy , Felipe Gomez Alonzo , died on Christmas Eve after six days in Border Patrol custody . He had been treated for a cold and fever at a hospital and was released , but was readmitted hours later — and died soon thereafter .
His mother in Guatemala said the boy ’ s father brought the child on the trip to the U.S. in the belief that gaining illegal entry would be easier with a child .
Earlier this month , a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died after being arrested for crossing the border illegally with her father . Border Patrol agents twice managed to revive her after she fell ill , but she later suffered a heart attack and liver and respiratory failure at a hospital .
Mr. Trump said the two children “ were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol . ”

The amnesty , dubbed Deferred Action for Parental Accountability was supposed to grant full tentative legal status — including work permits , Social Security numbers and driver ’ s licenses — to more than 4 million illegal immigrants . It has been halted by a federal appeals court , and its fate will soon rest with the Supreme Court .
But the rest of the dozen actions Mr. Obama announced on Nov. 20 , 2014 , are still advancing , including a far-reaching set of priorities that effectively orders agents not to bother deporting nearly all illegal immigrants .
“ There are 7 or 8 or 9 million people who are now safe under the current policy . That is a victory to celebrate while we wait for the Supreme Court , ” said Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez , an Illinois Democrat who was among the chief cheerleaders pushing Mr. Obama to go around Congress and take unilateral steps last year .
The actions — often mislabeled by the press as executive orders — also included changes to the legal immigration system , such as making it easier for spouses of guest workers to also find jobs ; allowing foreigners who study science and technology at U.S. universities to remain and work in the country longer ; pushing legal immigrants to apply for citizenship ; and waiving the penalty on illegal immigrant spouses or children of legal permanent residents so they no longer have to go to their home countries to await legal status .
On enforcement , Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson , called for a more coordinated approach to border security , and that paid off with a major drop in arrests of illegal immigrants in the Southwest . Apprehensions were at their lowest levels since the 1970s .
At Mr. Obama ’ s direction , Mr. Johnson announced changes that would let most rank-and-file illegal immigrants off the hook and instead focus deportation efforts on serious criminals , gang members and other security threats , and only the most recent of illegal border crossers .
“ Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doing what I told them to do — to reprioritize and focus on convicted criminals , ” Mr. Johnson said this month as he took stock of the changes . “ This is the general direction that the president and I want to go when it comes to how we enforce immigration law — focusing on threats to public safety and border security for the American public . ”
The changes are already having a major effect . Deportations , which peaked at nearly 410,000 in fiscal year 2012 , dropped to about 230,000 in fiscal year 2015 , which ended Sept. 30 . But Mr. Johnson said more of those being deported are the serious criminals and safety threats he wants his agents to worry about .
Indeed , if agents adhere strictly to his priorities , some 9.6 million of the estimated 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the country have no real danger of being deported , according to an estimate this year by the Migration Policy Institute .
“ The enforcement priorities announced last year , if strictly enforced , do protect the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants from being deported , because most immigrants have been here a long time and haven ’ t committed a serious crime , ” said Marc Rosenblum , deputy director of the institute ’ s U.S. immigration policy program .
The number could go even higher , depending on how agents follow some of Mr. Johnson ’ s other instructions . The secretary had said even some illegal immigrants with serious criminal offenses on their records should be allowed to stay if they had mitigating factors , such as deep family or community ties .
Immigrant rights activists said they are still waiting for those special circumstances to be applied more broadly .
Mr. Johnson also has been pushing , with some success , to try to get sanctuary cities to buy into limited cooperation with his deportation agents . He scrapped the Secure Communities program that trolled state and local prisons and jails for illegal immigrants and replaced it with the Priorities Enforcement Program , which targets only serious criminals .
“ It is tremendously harder now to deport even criminals , much less garden-variety illegal aliens . They have truly dismembered the immigration enforcement system , from the Border Patrol to the immigration courts , ” said Jessica Vaughan , policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies , which advocates for stricter immigration controls .
But the jewel of the executive actions was the deportation amnesty , which was delayed first by a federal district court in Texas and last week by an appeals court .
All sides in the debate agree that was a huge blow to Mr. Obama .
“ Without being able to give away a benefit , like a work permit , these changes are less permanent , and easier to undo in some ways , than would have been the case had the president been able to implement DAPA , ” Ms. Vaughan said .
Mr. Obama said he took the series of steps in response to inaction from Congress , where his push for a broad bill granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship stalled in 2013 . Frustrated by Republicans , Mr. Obama waited until after the 2014 elections , then announced his go-it-alone approach .
Homeland Security has issued proposals to carry out the leniency program for illegal immigrant spouses and children of green-card holders and to allow foreign students in science and technology to stay longer .

The offer follows weeks of determined Democratic opposition — amid determined waffling by top GOP leaders — to any funding for Trump ’ s wall during this year .
“ We have our list of priorities , ” budget director Mick Mulvaney said at a business conference on Thursday . He continued :
Won ’ t surprise anyone what some of them are . We want more money for defense . We want to build a border wall . We want more money for immigration , law enforcement . The Democrats may have some of their own priorities . I [ already ] indicated making some of these payments for the Obamacare subsidies is one of their priorities . Okay , that ’ s fine . We ’ re willing to be at that discussion if they want to have it and that ’ s what we ’ re telegraphing … we understand they have a certain amount of leverage in the Senate because we do need 60 votes [ to get funding ] . So we need some sort of bipartisan support in the Senate . They are entitled under that set of circumstances to get some of their priorities funded . It is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his priorities and Democrats some of their priorities . We think we ’ ve opened the door [ to a compromise ] . I know that we have .
Democrats may be open to that compromise . On Wednesday , the Democrats ’ Senate leader , Sen. Chuck Schumer told reporters that Democrats are trying to preserve funding for Obamacare . “ We ’ re working hard to get it in the bill . We ’ re very hopeful , negotiations seem to be going quite well … We want to make a good budget that meets our principles … so far , so good , ” he said , according to a report from BNA.com .
Democrats will pay a price for obstructing Trump ’ s priorities , Mulvaney warned .
If [ Democrats ] tell us to pound sand , I think that ’ s probably a disappointing indicator of where the next four years is going to go . If they tell us , however , that they recognize that President Trump won an election , and he should get some of his priorities funded for that reason , elections have consequences , as folks who win always like to say . ”
For months , GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have declined to champion funding Trump ’ s wall in the 2017 budget supplemental , which is due April 28 . Trump has asked for roughly $ 1 billion to install or upgrade roughly 60 miles of border walls and fences this year .
GOP leaders are reluctant to fund the wall , in part , because they don ’ t want to trade some of their budget priorities to persuade the Democrats to compromise on their full-throated opposition to Trump ’ s wall . Many Democrats fervently oppose the wall , which would literally and symbolically cement his 2016 victory and also block the migration of consumers , cheap workers , and future voters into Democratic-dominated cities .
Also , GOP leaders know their business donors oppose the wall , which would reduce the inflow of illegal-alien consumers and workers to the corporate members of the many Chambers of Commerce throughout the United States .
Democrats know the GOP leaders are not willing to champion ’ s Trump ’ s wall , so they are escalating their opposition to Trump ’ s wall and his border reforms , such as greater enforcement of current laws . For example , Democrats are threatening to block all budget funding — and so shut down many government agencies — unless they get their way .
On Wednesday , Schumer said all extra immigration funding should be held up until the next round of budget debates in the fall of 2017 . “ We think that the immigration issue should be discussed in the 2018 budget where there ’ s votes and discussion and nothing should be shoved down people ’ s throats and that would apply to the many immigration issues that are before us , not just the wall , ” Schumer said in a press call . BNA reported :
Billions of dollars for the wall and other funds that Trump wants to boost enforcement have emerged among the “ poison pill ” riders that Schumer said could threaten passage of the omnibus by the time federal money runs out at midnight April 28 . The government is operating under a stopgap continuing resolution because only one of the 12 fiscal 2017 bills was enacted last fall . Schumer suggested that Democrats have considerable leverage in the talks over the details of the omnibus , which have continued during lawmakers ’ two-week recess . “ Our Republican colleagues know they control the House , the Senate , the White House [ and ] a shutdown would fall on their shoulders and they don ’ t want it , ” Schumer said .
On multiple occasions , GOP leader Ryan has said the Trump wall will be funded in the 2018 budget starting in October , while hinting it will get little funding for construction in 2017 . This month , Officials at the Department of Homeland Security
However , officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been told by GOP budget leaders that they can reprogram some of their existing funds to pay for construction of prototype wall designs in June .
In his Wednesday call with reporters , Schumer gloated that the GOP leaders are not supporting Trump ’ s budget request . “ I think there ’ s agreement , quiet agreement in the [ GOP and Democratic budget leaders ] , that if the president doesn ’ t interfere and insist on poison pill amendments [ funding for the wall ] to be shoved down the throats of the Congress , we can come up with an agreement . ”","President Donald Trump’s budget director is threatening to withhold funding for Obamacare subsidies unless Democrats agree to help fund the border wall in the 2017 budget supplemental.

Many Democrats fervently oppose the wall, which would literally and symbolically cement his 2016 victory and also block the migration of consumers, cheap workers, and future voters into Democratic-dominated cities.

Also, GOP leaders know their business donors oppose the wall, which would reduce the inflow of illegal-alien consumers and workers to the corporate members of the many Chambers of Commerce throughout the United States.

Democrats know the GOP leaders are not willing to champion’s Trump’s wall, so they are escalating their opposition to Trump’s wall and his border reforms, such as greater enforcement of current laws. For example, Democrats are threatening to block all budget funding — and so shut down many government agencies — unless they get their way.

On Wednesday, Schumer said all extra immigration funding should be held up until the next round of budget debates in the fall of 2017. “We think that the immigration issue should be discussed in the 2018 budget where there’s votes and discussion and nothing should be shoved down people’s throats and that would apply to the many immigration issues that are before us, not just the wall,” Schumer said in a press call. BNA reported:

Billions of dollars for the wall and other funds that Trump wants to boost enforcement have emerged among the “poison pill” riders that Schumer said could threaten passage of the omnibus by the time federal money runs out at midnight April 28. The government is operating under a stopgap continuing resolution because only one of the 12 fiscal 2017 bills was enacted last fall. Schumer suggested that Democrats have considerable leverage in the talks over the details of the omnibus, which have continued during lawmakers’ two-week recess. “Our Republican colleagues know they control the House, the Senate, the White House [and] a shutdown would fall on their shoulders and they don’t want it,” Schumer said.

On multiple occasions, GOP leader Ryan has said the Trump wall will be funded in the 2018 budget starting in October, while hinting it will get little funding for construction in 2017. This month, Officials at the Department of Homeland Security

However, officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been told by GOP budget leaders that they can reprogram some of their existing funds to pay for construction of prototype wall designs in June.

In his Wednesday call with reporters, Schumer gloated that the GOP leaders are not supporting Trump’s budget request. “I think there’s agreement, quiet agreement in the [GOP and Democratic budget leaders], that if the president doesn’t interfere and insist on poison pill amendments [funding for the wall] to be shoved down the throats of the Congress, we can come up with an agreement.”

Return to 'zero tolerance'

Immigration advocacy groups were bracing Tuesday for the possibility that the Trump administration would return to the ""zero tolerance"" policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo last year requiring that all immigrants entering the country illegally would be prosecuted. But a 1997 settlement in a federal court case required the U.S. to release children immigrants after 20 days. To honor both commitments, the Trump administration separated children and adults.

Trump backed down under immense pressure, signing an order in June to end family separations. Immigration advocates pointed to reports Monday that Trump and adviser Stephen Miller want to re-start the process with Nielsen gone.

""More families will be separated while Trump and Miller disregard the law and create chaos in our immigration system,"" she said.

'Closing' the border

Trump repeatedly threatened to close the border last month before he retreated in recent days, arguing that Mexico had taken a more aggressive stance on apprehending Central American migrants in response to his words.

Closing all ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border would be a logistical and economic nightmare, experts say. Roughly $1.5 billion in trade takes place across the border every day. But past presidents – including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan – took steps to slow traffic through checkpoints to send a political message to Mexico.

Mexican auto tariffs

Trump threatened last week to impose a 25% tariff on all cars made in Mexico and shipped into the U.S. if the Mexican government stopped apprehending immigrants who cross the border illegally. If that doesn’t work, he said, then he would close the border.

The U.S., however, already has agreed not to impose tariffs on cars built in Mexico.

Given the reasonable belief that DACA was unlawful , the decision to wind down DACA in an orderly manner was rational , ” the judge wrote .

Judge Titus , though , said the administration was facing a credible legal threat from Texas , and the attorney general had doubts about mounting a defense , so the Homeland Security Department ’ s decision was not arbitrary .

Paper trail

The Washington Times reviewed the documents, which also included an ICE memo telling illegal immigrants to contact U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that will judge most of these cases, and which is not taking requests until Aug. 15.

The agency didn’t return a call seeking comment, but ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said the policy was always intended to apply immediately to illegal immigrants already in the deportation system — which are the ones ICE deals with.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will eventually put in place a more formal process for illegal immigrants to come forward and proactively head off deportation.

Ms. Christensen said ICE will end up with a relatively small share of the eventual cases, and their review is easier because the agency already had begun using broad prosecutorial discretion last year.

“ICE is only reviewing cases for deferred action of individuals that are currently in removal proceedings or who were/are part of the agency’s larger prosecutorial discretion review,” she wrote in an email.

Obama’s new orders

Last month, Mr. Obama and Ms. Napolitano said they would unilaterally halt deportations for illegal immigrants who would have qualified for the Dream Act — legislation that never passed Congress but would have granted a path to citizenship to many illegal immigrants age 30 and younger.

To avoid deportation under the new rules, illegal immigrants would had to have been brought to the U.S. by age 16; graduated high school or earned an equivalency degree; not been convicted of major crimes; and been in the U.S. for at least five years.

Those granted a stay of deportation are given permission to work in the U.S. — which could lead to hundreds of thousands of new, legal workers entering the economy.

The program has come under fire from both sides. Some immigrant-rights activists have said they’d be reluctant to recommend illegal immigrants come forward, saying the program doesn’t yet have the kinds of assurances they need.

Critics on the other side, meanwhile, say it’s drawn too broadly. They also wonder what proof ICE and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers will ask for. The ICE guidance Mr. Smith obtained doesn’t lay out any standards for those documents, and he said that’s an invitation to fraud.

He also said he has learned ICE has halted deportations for illegal immigrants the agency knows have been in the U.S. for less than five years.

“Amnesty has been granted to those who have been here for a shorter or even unknown period of time,” Mr. Smith said.

Ms. Christensen, the ICE spokeswoman, said the agency has broad authority to halt deportations on a case-by-case basis, even when illegal immigrants fall short of the new standards, especially in “humanitarian” cases in which the people in question were brought to the U.S. as children.

“As part of ICE’s overall effort to focus the immigration system on public safety threats, border security and public safety, and in keeping with the spirit of the secretary’s memorandum, deferred action has been granted on a case-by-case basis to some individuals whose cases may differ from the specific criteria set forth in the memorandum,” Ms. Christensen said.

As for documents, she said ICE officers are already trained in what documents to ask for and how to evaluate them as part of their jobs. Acceptable documents they can request include passports, visas, school or medical records, and leases, she said.

Deciding who stays

Part of Mr. Obama’s dilemma on immigration is that Ms. Napolitano has said the U.S. has the resources to deport about 400,000 illegal immigrants a year, which means it has to live up to that level.

The president has tried to focus deportation efforts on Illegal immigrants with criminal records and had made progress in his first two years in office. But the latest statistics showed backsliding this year.

In fiscal year 2012, which began Oct. 1, about 49 percent of all illegal immigrants deported didn’t have criminal records. That’s up from about 44 percent last year — and the change had immigrant-rights advocates furious.

ICE said it’s trying to focus its priorities, and said even though criminal deportations are down slightly, most of the noncriminals are still important targets for deportation.

Of the more than 143,000 noncriminal illegal immigrants removed from Oct. 1 to June 23, nearly half had repeatedly violated immigration rules, and more than 49,000 others were recent entrants who were removed at the border.

A little fewer than 5,000 illegal immigrants, or less than 2 percent of the total, were rank-and-file illegal immigrants who didn’t fall into any of the administration’s target categories.

PHOENIX — After playing at diplomacy in Mexico following two weeks of muddled messaging on his signature issue , Donald Trump shed any pretense of a softer message or general election “ pivot ” with a declaration of his fealty to the hard-line positions and inflammatory rhetoric that propelled him to the Republican nomination .
Trump ’ s surprising trip to the presidential residence in Mexico City on Wednesday afternoon , which created a moment for him to stand side by side with an elected head of state and declare sovereign nations ’ rights to protect their people , amounted to a well-executed bit of campaign stagecraft by the GOP nominee who , after a year of demonizing Mexico and its people , managed to strike a far more diplomatic tone — for him , anyway — on the international stage .
“ I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans , ” Trump said , eschewing the usual vitriol as he stood before a dark marble wall that evoked speeches by foreign leaders at the United Nations .
Having ditched his traveling press corps , Trump ’ s lie that he and President Enrique Peña Nieto didn ’ t discuss who would pay for his border wall wasn ’ t exposed until the Mexican president tweeted that they had a few hours later . And minutes after he stepped onto another stage here Wednesday night and began to speak to his raucous supporters , it was even more clear that the sojourn across the southern border , much like his campaign ’ s two weeks of gentle walkbacks , was a ruse — that Trump and his campaign had used Peña Nieto as a prop in an opening act that served only to set up an evening stemwinder . The farce was , in hindsight , clear even before Trump approached the mic , as two of his warm-up speakers , Rudy Giuliani and Jeff Sessions , donned Trump hats that read “ Make Mexico Great Again Also . ”
Time after time , the crowd of more than 5,000 people , clad in red Trump hats and waving campaign signs , erupted unprompted into chants of “ Build the wall ! ” and “ Lock her up ! ”
In the Arizona desert , hours after he spoke of his affinity for the Mexican people and the shared priorities of the two neighboring countries , Trump railed for nearly 90 minutes about the many ways undocumented immigrants are hurting the country and harming Americans . He promised not just to build a border wall , but also to empower a massive new “ deportation task force ” of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to round them up .
“ You can call it deported if you want . The press doesn ’ t like that term , ” Trump said . “ You can call it whatever the hell you want . They ’ re gone . ”
He reverted to the tough talk he was unable to muster on foreign soil just hours earlier about Mexico paying for the wall . Toward the end of his speech , he used the personal anecdotes of mothers whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants to further demonize “ illegals. ” He blamed the deaths of “ countless Americans ” on President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their immigration policies .
A senior Clinton campaign adviser acknowledged that Trump ’ s daring Mexico gambit seemed effective and thus worrisome for a few hours Wednesday — until his speech a few hours later . “ Not worried anymore , ” the adviser said . “ The Nuremberg speech put all that statesman-like stuff away . ”
Rather than issuing a statement criticizing the speech , Clinton ’ s campaign sent reporters a collection of tweets praising it — from noted white supremacists like David Duke and conservative provocateur Ann Coulter .
For weeks , Trump had dithered on the issue that has defined his candidacy from the start , suggesting that the question of what to do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country was more difficult than he ’ d heretofore suggested as he vowed to send them all home . Kellyanne Conway , his newly hired campaign manager , praised his newfound recognition of the issue ’ s complexity ; and his inner circle of advisers grappled with how to better sell Trump ’ s tough policies to a general election audience .
Ultimately , however , Trump was seemingly attempting to sell a slightly softened position on deportations to the base that voted for him in the primaries largely because of that stance . Trump ’ s revived bombast and the 10-pronged list of immigration policy ideas were actually a clumsy effort to obscure the fact that he is no longer vowing to immediately deport every undocumented immigrant in the country illegally ( just as many as possible in a more gradual manner starting with 2 million who have criminal records ) .
“ They ’ re going out fast , ” he said . “ Moving forward , we will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever , and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings , if we even have to do that .
“ We will terminate the Obama administration ’ s deadly , and it is deadly , nonenforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets , walk around , do whatever they want to do — crime all over the place . That ’ s over . That ’ s over , folks . That ’ s over . ”
But in trying so hard to present his proposals as a hardening of his position , he ’ s unlikely to accomplish the only real imperative of any policy speech delivered 69 days before an election — winning over unconverted general election voters . And Trump ’ s amped-up nativism , and his proposal to curb even legal immigration are likely to only harden the two blocs of ardently pro-Trump and never-Trump monoliths on opposite poles of this election .
The irony in Trump ’ s pre-Labor Day base play is that many of his supporters don ’ t need harsher rhetoric or unwavering policy positions to turn out for him in November . Many , in fact , don ’ t take his promises of deporting all undocumented immigrants or forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall all that literally .
“ He ’ s never going to be able to get 11 million people out of the country , ” said Steve Hagely , a Trump supporter from ucson standing near the back of the crowd inside the cavernous , concrete-floored convention center . “ It ’ s just something he says . ”
While screams and cheers answered Trump ’ s promise of a border wall , some supporters aren ’ t convinced that will actually happen either . “ How ’ s he going to really get them to pay for it ? ” said Brian Howe of Phoenix . “ I think what he ’ s saying is that America ’ s not going to get taken advantage of anymore . ”
Trump spent his speech Wednesday night addressing those already converted to his cause , forgetting how easily most of them will forgive whatever small touches of moderation might creep into an otherwise hawkish policy platform .
“ I think he ’ s just trying to win , ” said Drew Hathcock , from Surprise . “ The people who are already with him , he ’ s not going to ever lose them . He ’ s trying to get more . He needs more . The base isn ’ t big enough for him to win with just them . ”
Unfortunately , Trump 's speech appears to be narrowing his support even more , driving away some of the prominent Hispanic Americans who had willingly taken part in the GOP nominee 's recent `` roundtables '' that in hindsight seem more like hollow photo ops .
Immediately following the Arizona speech , Jacob Monty , a member of Trump ’ s newly formed National Hispanic Advisory Council , resigned , and Alfonso Aguilar , president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles , said in an interview that he is “ inclined ” to pull his support .

“I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans,” Trump said, eschewing the usual vitriol as he stood before a dark marble wall that evoked speeches by foreign leaders at the United Nations.

Having ditched his traveling press corps, Trump’s lie that he and President Enrique Peña Nieto didn’t discuss who would pay for his border wall wasn’t exposed until the Mexican president tweeted that they had a few hours later.

Time after time, the crowd of more than 5,000 people, clad in red Trump hats and waving campaign signs, erupted unprompted into chants of “Build the wall!” and “Lock her up!”

He reverted to the tough talk he was unable to muster on foreign soil just hours earlier about Mexico paying for the wall. Toward the end of his speech, he used the personal anecdotes of mothers whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants to further demonize “illegals.” He blamed the deaths of “countless Americans” on President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their immigration policies.

Immediately following the Arizona speech, Jacob Monty, a member of Trump’s newly formed National Hispanic Advisory Council, resigned, and Alfonso Aguilar, president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, said in an interview that he is “inclined” to pull his support.

Mexico does not explain why its citizens wish to leave their birth country — or why they are eager to enter a country ridiculed by the Mexican press and government .
Estimates suggest that there are eleven million to 13 million Mexican citizens currently living in the United States illegally . Millions more emigrated previously and are now U.S. citizens .
A recent poll revealed that one-third of Mexicans ( 34 percent ) would like to emigrate to the United States . With Mexico having a population of about 130 million , that amounts to some 44 million would-be immigrants .
Such massive potential emigration into the United States makes no sense .

Mexico does not explain why its citizens wish to leave their birth country — or why they are eager to enter a country ridiculed by the Mexican press and government.

Estimates suggest that there are eleven million to 13 million Mexican citizens currently living in the United States illegally. Millions more emigrated previously and are now U.S. citizens.

A recent poll revealed that one-third of Mexicans (34 percent) would like to emigrate to the United States. With Mexico having a population of about 130 million, that amounts to some 44 million would-be immigrants.

Such massive potential emigration into the United States makes no sense.

First, Mexico is a naturally rich country. It ranks 19th in the world in proven oil reserves and is currently the twelfth-largest oil producer. Mexico certainly has significantly more natural advantages than do far wealthier per capita Singapore, Taiwan, or Chile.

Mexico also is one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations and earns billions in foreign exchange from visitors. It enjoys a temperate climate, is rich in minerals, and has millions of acres of fertile farmland and a long coastline.

In addition to being strategically located as a bridge between North America and South America, Mexico has ports on both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

It is not an overcrowded country: Mexico ranks in the lower half of the world in population density. Too many people and too little land are certainly not the reasons why millions of Mexicans either emigrate or wish to emigrate to the United States.

Second, popular progressive narratives in both Mexico and the United States cite America for all sorts of pathologies, past and present. The United States is often damned for prior colonialism and imperialism, as well as current racism and xenophobia.

Why, then, would millions of people south of the border leave their own homeland and potentially risk their lives to encounter a strange culture and language, to live in such a purportedly inhospitable place, and to adopt to an antithetical system based on supposedly toxic European and Protestant traditions?

The answers to these two paradoxes are as obvious as they are politically incorrect and therefore seldom voiced. Life in Mexico is relatively poor, dangerous, and often unfree. In contrast, the United States is rich, generous, and secure.

Mexico — unlike, say, Japan or Switzerland, which are far less naturally endowed and yet far wealthier — has never fully adopted Western paradigms of free-market economics, constitutionally protected free speech, due process, gender equity, private property rights, an autonomous press, government transparency, an independent judiciary, and religious diversity and tolerance.

To the degree that Mexico can make strides toward these goals, its population will stabilize and become more affluent — and also become less likely to emigrate.

More importantly, millions of Mexican citizens recognize (at least privately) that the United States is not the bogeyman of mostly elite critiques. Instead, it is one of the world’s rare, multiracial, equal-opportunity societies. It is generous with its entitlements, even to those who cross its border illegally, and far more meritocratic than most of the world’s highly tribal societies.

Maybe that is why millions of impoverished people from Mexico have left their homes in expectation that they will be treated far better as foreign, non-English speakers in a strange land than they will at home by their own government.

Indeed, if the U.S. treated immigrants in the fashion that Mexico does, then Mexican citizens would probably never emigrate to the U.S.

In sum, illegal immigration is both logical and nonsensical.

After all, the Mexican government is quick to fault the U.S., but it is rarely introspective. It does not explain publicly why its own citizens wish to flee the country where they were born — or why they are eager to enter a country that is so often ridiculed by the Mexican press and government.

Mexico apparently does not take care of its own citizens. But once they arrive inside the U.S., Mexico suddenly becomes an advocate for their welfare. No wonder: Mexican expatriates send back an estimated $30 billion a year in remittances.

Real and would-be emigrants themselves also act ironically.

On both sides of the border, they often fault the U.S. and demand that U.S. immigration law be suspended — but only in their case.

Emigrating Mexican citizens wave Mexican flags at the border as they try to enter America, while their counterparts inside the U.S. do the same when they protest being sent back home.

The Trump administration has said it wants to start collecting the social media history of nearly everyone seeking a visa to enter the US.

The proposal, which comes from the state department, would require most visa applicants to give details of their Facebook and Twitter accounts.

They would have to disclose all social media identities used in the past five years.

About 14.7 million people a year would be affected by the proposals.

The information would be used to identify and vet those seeking both immigrant and non-immigrant visas.

Applicants would also be asked for five years of their telephone numbers, email addresses and travel history. They would be required to say if they had ever been deported from a country, or if any relatives had been involved in terrorist activity.

The proposal would not affect citizens from countries to which the US grants visa-free travel status - among them the UK, Canada, France and Germany. However, citizens from non-exempt countries like India, China and Mexico could be embroiled if they visit the US for work or a holiday.

Officials defended the proposal by saying it would help to identify potential extremists.

Social media came under scrutiny after the shootings in 2015 in San Bernadino, California, in which 14 people died. The authorities said they had missed signs of radicalisation in messages on a messaging platform sent between the attackers.

What's the current stance on requesting social media?

Under rules brought in last May, officials were told to seek people's social media handles only if they felt ""that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting"", a state department official said at the time.

The tougher proposal comes after President Trump promised to implement ""extreme vetting"" for foreigners entering the US, which he said was to combat terrorism.

""Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,"" the state department said in a statement, quoted by the New York Times.

""We already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

Who decides if it happens?

The idea is subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget.

The public will have two months to comment on the proposal before it makes a decision.

How does this affect free speech?

Civil liberties groups have condemned the policy as an invasion of privacy that could damage free speech.

""People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,"" said Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union.

""We're also concerned about how the Trump administration defines the vague and over-broad term 'terrorist activities' because it is inherently political and can be used to discriminate against immigrants who have done nothing wrong,"" she said.

Shear, Ashley Parker","The legislation , which would be the first major immigration overhaul since President Ronald Reagan backed amnesty for illegal immigrants in 1986 , was drafted over the last several months by the so-called Gang of Eight , a bipartisan group of senators . It is largely in step with the president ’ s goals of offering a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country while tightening border security and expanding legal entry into the country for families and workers .
But no one expects the bill to pass the Senate without some modifications . Mr. Obama ’ s Republican allies on the issue — in particular Senators Marco Rubio of Florida , a member of the bipartisan group , and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma — warned last week that the president could lose their support without stronger efforts to secure the border , as well as other changes .
“ I ’ m trying to get to where I can say yes , ” Mr. Coburn said as senators prepared to clear the way for what could be weeks of debate in the full chamber . “ But the only way you can say yes and sell it to the American people is to know that the border is secure , and this bill doesn ’ t do it . ”
Mr. Obama will try to set the tone for the legislative fight with a speech at the White House on Tuesday . But the battle will quickly shift to the Capitol , where the biggest struggle may be over how far to go in securing America ’ s border with Mexico against illegal crossings .
White House officials say they expect Democrats will have to make compromises on border security by accepting some amendments that tighten enforcement . But they said Democrats would resist any amendments that significantly undermine the core of the bill — a certain path to citizenship for those already in the country .
“ We are willing to toughen up border — many of our colleagues feel that ’ s important — but without forsaking our principles , ” said Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York and a member of the bipartisan group . He said border security demands must be reasonable “ so that if , God forbid , there ’ s a president in 2017 who hates immigration reform , it will still go forward . ”
Mr. Obama has stayed clear of personally directing the legislative process from the West Wing , on the theory that his participation would make it more difficult for Republicans to support it . But administration officials are working behind the scenes with allies from both parties in the Senate to provide technical support as they draft friendly amendments to the legislation . They are also helping lawmakers develop talking points and prepare side-by-side comparisons to help defeat efforts intended to undermine the bill .","The legislation, which would be the first major immigration overhaul since President Ronald Reagan backed amnesty for illegal immigrants in 1986, was drafted over the last several months by the so-called Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of senators. It is largely in step with the president’s goals of offering a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country while tightening border security and expanding legal entry into the country for families and workers.

But no one expects the bill to pass the Senate without some modifications. Mr. Obama’s Republican allies on the issue — in particular Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, a member of the bipartisan group, and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma — warned last week that the president could lose their support without stronger efforts to secure the border, as well as other changes.

“I’m trying to get to where I can say yes,” Mr. Coburn said as senators prepared to clear the way for what could be weeks of debate in the full chamber. “But the only way you can say yes and sell it to the American people is to know that the border is secure, and this bill doesn’t do it.”

Mr. Obama will try to set the tone for the legislative fight with a speech at the White House on Tuesday. But the battle will quickly shift to the Capitol, where the biggest struggle may be over how far to go in securing America’s border with Mexico against illegal crossings.

White House officials say they expect Democrats will have to make compromises on border security by accepting some amendments that tighten enforcement. But they said Democrats would resist any amendments that significantly undermine the core of the bill — a certain path to citizenship for those already in the country.

“We are willing to toughen up border — many of our colleagues feel that’s important — but without forsaking our principles,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the bipartisan group. He said border security demands must be reasonable “so that if, God forbid, there’s a president in 2017 who hates immigration reform, it will still go forward.”

Mr. Obama has stayed clear of personally directing the legislative process from the West Wing, on the theory that his participation would make it more difficult for Republicans to support it. But administration officials are working behind the scenes with allies from both parties in the Senate to provide technical support as they draft friendly amendments to the legislation. They are also helping lawmakers develop talking points and prepare side-by-side comparisons to help defeat efforts intended to undermine the bill.",www.nytimes.com,left,g1c8THBgZSsQHH7p

After months of uncertainty, President Trump will announce on Tuesday that he is ending a controversial program that protects nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation, media reports indicated late Sunday.

Politico and Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that Trump had decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA, which Trump inherited from President Barack Obama.

Shortly after their statement , the White House issued its own statement agreeing that the sit-down was productive , but the exclusion of the border wall `` was certainly not agreed to . ''

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said earlier Wednesday that Trump was “ committed to the wall . It doesn ’ t have to be tied to DACA , but it 's important and he will get it done . ”
Matt House , Schumer ’ s communications director , responded on Twitter : “ The President made clear he would continue pushing the wall , just not as part of this agreement . ”
The New York Times cited a White House official who said Trump pushed for border wall funding at the meeting .
Beside the border wall issue , the Democrats said Trump agreed to enshrine protections for the nearly 800,000 immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids who had benefited from the DACA program .

immigration,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/11/illegal-immigrant-children-border-crossings-down-5/,Illegal immigrant children border crossings down 58 percent from 2014 surge ,2015-05-11,Stephen Dinan,"The renewed flood of illegal immigration children anticipated this year hasn ’ t materialized , as children are crossing at far lower rates than last year and even lower than 2013 , according to new Border Patrol statistics that suggest some of the things the Obama administration did are helping .
Thousands of children are still being caught , but it ’ s a slower and more regular pace than 2014 ’ s wild spike , which saw 7,700 apprehended at the southwest border in April alone , and more than 10,000 each in May and June . By contrast , this April saw just 3,272 unaccompanied minors caught — a drop of 58 percent year to year .
Through the first seven months of the fiscal year , just 18,919 children were caught total , down from the 36,280 a year earlier at the same time .
Agents accused of abusing the children last year have been cleared , and the government is now even meeting its legal 72-hour deadline for processing the kids at the border and releasing them to social workers , who are quickly placing the children with their relatives or foster families here in the U.S .
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has been clear that he ’ s not declaring mission accomplished yet , but officials are hopeful the downward trend is permanent after taking myriad steps , including stiffer detention rules here at home , a public relations campaign back in Central America and leaning on the governments of Mexico , El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras to do more to stanch the flow at their ends .
“ It ’ s a combination of all the things , ” Ronald D. Vitiello , deputy chief of the Border Patrol , told The ███ .
Last year ’ s surge dominated headlines in the early summer , and the administration ’ s efforts to find places to house the children sparked protests in communities across the country , and even forced President Obama to delay his plans to expand his deportation amnesty .
The children , officially dubbed Unaccompanied Alien Children — or UAC in government-speak — came chiefly from three Central American countries : Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador . They were traveling without their parents , though often were in large groups with siblings and shepherded by “ coyotes , ” who are paid upwards of $ 6,000 per head to get them into the U.S. , where they were usually pointed toward agents .
As the surge took hold last spring , internal Border Patrol estimates guessed as many as 90,000 children would cross the border in fiscal year 2014 , and possibly 120,000 this year .
But it never materialized . By the end of last year , just 68,541 had been caught .
Mr. Johnson said they can pinpoint the exact day — June 10 , 2014 — when the spike of children peaked . The numbers fell steadily from then , bottoming out in January , with only slightly more than 2,100 unaccompanied minors caught .
This year the numbers have risen as the weather has improved , but are nowhere near their level of last year . If the current pace holds , fewer than 40,000 will be caught .
Chief Vitiello said the efforts the U.S. made to convince would-be immigrants there were no “ permisos , ” or free passes , at this end of the journey — and that they could be detained and sent back home — helped .
“ Being able to message out to the sending countries and to the individuals that would be coming to the border that there was not a free ride , that they were being exploited by the public perception and the smugglers themselves I think they all recognized that , ” the chief said .
Among the other steps the Homeland Security Department took were assigning agents to go after the smuggling networks themselves , in something dubbed Operation Coyote , and working with Central American countries so they are ready to accept their own citizens when the U.S. deports them .
Officials from Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden on down also urged Central American governments to do more to convince their citizens to stay home .
Jessica Vaughan , policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies , said the numbers are running lower , but there are other parts of the story that aren ’ t told in those numbers .
“ It could be because many more are being interdicted in Mexico and sent home ; it could be because more succeeded in getting past the Border Patrol ; it could be because the smugglers are laying low ; it could be because of more violence in some parts of northern Mexico from the drug cartel mayhem distracting or interrupting the smugglers ; it could be because people heard that the president ’ s big amnesty was blocked in the courts , ” Ms. Vaughan said . “ Without more information , it ’ s impossible to know for sure . ”
She said a better measure of the government ’ s response is how many of the children caught in last year ’ s surge have shown up for their hearings and have been deported .
A recent report by the Congressional Research Service said 62 percent of children failed to show up for cases before immigration judges from July through February .

Thousands of children are still being caught, but it’s a slower and more regular pace than 2014’s wild spike, which saw 7,700 apprehended at the southwest border in April alone, and more than 10,000 each in May and June. By contrast, this April saw just 3,272 unaccompanied minors caught — a drop of 58 percent year to year.

Through the first seven months of the fiscal year, just 18,919 children were caught total, down from the 36,280 a year earlier at the same time.

Agents accused of abusing the children last year have been cleared, and the government is now even meeting its legal 72-hour deadline for processing the kids at the border and releasing them to social workers, who are quickly placing the children with their relatives or foster families here in the U.S.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has been clear that he’s not declaring mission accomplished yet, but officials are hopeful the downward trend is permanent after taking myriad steps, including stiffer detention rules here at home, a public relations campaign back in Central America and leaning on the governments of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to do more to stanch the flow at their ends.

“It’s a combination of all the things,” Ronald D. Vitiello, deputy chief of the Border Patrol, told The Washington Times.

Last year’s surge dominated headlines in the early summer, and the administration’s efforts to find places to house the children sparked protests in communities across the country, and even forced President Obama to delay his plans to expand his deportation amnesty.

The children, officially dubbed Unaccompanied Alien Children — or UAC in government-speak — came chiefly from three Central American countries: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They were traveling without their parents, though often were in large groups with siblings and shepherded by “coyotes,” who are paid upwards of $6,000 per head to get them into the U.S., where they were usually pointed toward agents.

As the surge took hold last spring, internal Border Patrol estimates guessed as many as 90,000 children would cross the border in fiscal year 2014, and possibly 120,000 this year.

But it never materialized. By the end of last year, just 68,541 had been caught.

Mr. Johnson said they can pinpoint the exact day — June 10, 2014 — when the spike of children peaked. The numbers fell steadily from then, bottoming out in January, with only slightly more than 2,100 unaccompanied minors caught.

This year the numbers have risen as the weather has improved, but are nowhere near their level of last year. If the current pace holds, fewer than 40,000 will be caught.

Chief Vitiello said the efforts the U.S. made to convince would-be immigrants there were no “permisos,” or free passes, at this end of the journey — and that they could be detained and sent back home — helped.

“Being able to message out to the sending countries and to the individuals that would be coming to the border that there was not a free ride, that they were being exploited by the public perception and the smugglers themselves I think they all recognized that,” the chief said.

Among the other steps the Homeland Security Department took were assigning agents to go after the smuggling networks themselves, in something dubbed Operation Coyote, and working with Central American countries so they are ready to accept their own citizens when the U.S. deports them.

Officials from Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden on down also urged Central American governments to do more to convince their citizens to stay home.

Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said the numbers are running lower, but there are other parts of the story that aren’t told in those numbers.

“It could be because many more are being interdicted in Mexico and sent home; it could be because more succeeded in getting past the Border Patrol; it could be because the smugglers are laying low; it could be because of more violence in some parts of northern Mexico from the drug cartel mayhem distracting or interrupting the smugglers; it could be because people heard that the president’s big amnesty was blocked in the courts,” Ms. Vaughan said. “Without more information, it’s impossible to know for sure.”

She said a better measure of the government’s response is how many of the children caught in last year’s surge have shown up for their hearings and have been deported.

A recent report by the Congressional Research Service said 62 percent of children failed to show up for cases before immigration judges from July through February. All of them were ordered deported, but that is unlikely because deportation officers have been told to focus on other “priority” immigrants.

Ms. Vaughan also said that families crossing — a parent with at least one child — are now as big a problem as the children, and that both populations present major challenges for the communities that have to resettle them.

Because the children are not from countries that border the United States, federal law prohibits them from being immediately deported. Instead, after three days they are turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Many of the youths turn themselves in to the Border Patrol.

""They know that once they get to the station, we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the United States,"" Cabrera said.

The numbers are overwhelming American facilities, particularly in Texas.

In one declaration filed with the brief, a mother identified only by her initials E.J.O.E. said the government told her she would be reunited with her son as she applied for asylum.

But she says she was deported without her eight-year-old boy.

More than 20 separated children are at a US government tent camp in Tornillo, Texas.

CBS News, which was allowed to tour the facility, said the commander in charge described the ""zero tolerance"" policy as ""a dumb, stupid decision that should've never happened"".",www.bbc.com,center,LpqQmKSrkAuzTrhc

Navigating self-interest, ideals, and public opinion in the debate about illegal immigration

Activists portray illegal immigration solely as a human story of the desperately poor from south of the border fleeing misery to start new, productive lives in the U.S. — despite exploitation and America’s nativist immigration laws.

But the truth is always more complex — and can reveal self-interested as well as idealistic parties.

Employers have long sought to undercut the wages of the American underclass by preference for cheaper imported labor. The upper-middle classes have developed aristocratic ideas of hiring inexpensive “help” to relieve them of domestic chores.

The Mexican government keeps taxes low on its elite in part by exporting, rather than helping, its own poor. It causes little worry that some $25 billion in remittances sent from Mexican citizens working in America puts hardship on those expatriates, who are often subsidized by generous U.S. social services.

Mexico City rarely welcomes a heartfelt discussion about why its citizens flee Mexican exploitation and apparently have no wish to return home. Nor does Mexico City publicize its own stern approaches to immigration enforcement along its southern border — or its ethnocentric approach to all immigration (not wanting to impair “the equilibrium of national demographics”) that is institutionalized in Mexico’s constitution.

There is one red line to Trump immigration policies that otherwise are widely supported.

Most Americans want the border enforced. And, depending on how the question is worded, most voters likewise favor the completion of a wall on the southern border and an end to all illegal immigration.

There is little public support for sanctuary cities. They are seen as a form of neo-Confederate nullification — insurrectionary and unsustainable in a republic of laws.

Where controversy arises is over the more difficult question of the fate of at least 11 million foreign nationals currently residing illegally in the U.S.

Most Americans agree that if such immigrants are able-bodied but have no work history and are on public support, have just arrived hoping for amnesty, or have committed crimes in the U.S., they should be deported to their countries of origin. Nearly 1 million such people were already facing pre-Trump government removal orders.

Yet for those undocumented immigrants who are working, crime-free, and have established residence, the Trump administration will learn that the public supports some sort of accommodation that might lead to a fine, followed by the opportunity to apply for a green card.

Given those realities, the next immigration fault line will hinge on the definition of a “crime.”

Rural or inner-city poor American citizens would go to jail for identity theft or lying on state and federal documents.

For most Americans, identity theft, falsification of government affidavits, or trafficking in fraudulent Social Security numbers are the sort of violations that would end their own careers and unwind the very cohesiveness of government.

In 2007 , the last time the chamber took up immigration , Mr. Reid twice tried to shoehorn a bill through the chamber under tightly controlled rules that locked out most debate . He was rebuffed both times , and the measure ultimately imploded under the weight of a bipartisan filibuster .
“ I look back in retrospect and say it was a mistake not to go through the committee process last time , ” Sen. Charles E. Schumer , one of Mr. Reid ’ s top lieutenants , told reporters .
One week after a bipartisan group of eight senators announced that they had settled on a framework for an immigration bill , the issue has all but consumed Washington .
President Obama traveled to Las Vegas to give a speech blessing the framework and , most notably , did not draw any lines in the sand , which gives lawmakers some room to negotiate . Instead , Mr. Obama is putting his effort into one of his strengths by giving interviews to Spanish-language networks to try to drum up support .
On Capitol Hill , though , the first cracks have started to show in the gang over issues such as how to handle gay partners in the legal-immigration system , and how to decide when the border is secure enough to give illegal immigrants green cards , which is the key step on the path to citizenship .
Mr. Reid said that is part of the reason he will send the bill through the regular legislative order of committee work and full floor amendments .
In 2007 , Mr. Reid kept a much tighter leash on the debate . Each time , he was met with a bipartisan filibuster from senators angered at the legislation itself and at the process being used .
This time , the Nevada Democrat wants to eliminate that procedural excuse .
“ Once it gets to the floor , I have made a commitment — and I ’ m telling everyone here — we ’ re going to have an amendment process . I don ’ t know how long it will take , but we ’ ll take a lot of time , because there will be a lot of important issues brought up , ” Mr. Reid told reporters . “ We may have to have a number of votes on different amendments in a different number of procedural ways , but we ’ re going to have legislation done in the Senate the way that it ’ s supposed to be done . ”
An open process was welcomed by those who have been waiting for a bill to pass .
“ It ’ s a good sign , and it hardly ever happens these days , ” said Frank Sharry , executive director at America ’ s Voice , an advocacy group . “ This is going to be wild and wide open legislating . Bring your six-shooter and a lot of bullets , because this thing is going to be crazy . ”
More than any other bill in recent years , the immigration debate will be colored by the previous fight in 2007 .
Back then , the bill was another grand bargain struck by what Sen. Jeff Sessions , Alabama Republican and ardent opponent , called “ the Masters of the Universe . ”
Led by Sen. Jon Kyl , Arizona Republican , and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , Massachusetts Democrat , they tried to fend off all amendments to preserve the core agreement of stiffer border security and a new legal-immigration system in exchange for legalization of illegal immigrants .
Mr. Kyl retired last year , and Kennedy passed away , leaving matters to Sens . John McCain , Marco Rubio , Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake ( who won Mr. Kyl ’ s seat ) from the GOP , and Mr. Schumer , joined by Sens . Richard J. Durbin , Robert Menendez and Michael F. Bennet on the Democratic side .

Creating consensus

On Capitol Hill, though, the first cracks have started to show in the gang over issues such as how to handle gay partners in the legal-immigration system, and how to decide when the border is secure enough to give illegal immigrants green cards, which is the key step on the path to citizenship.

Mr. Reid said that is part of the reason he will send the bill through the regular legislative order of committee work and full floor amendments.

Backing the move

An open process was welcomed by those who have been waiting for a bill to pass.

“It’s a good sign, and it hardly ever happens these days,” said Frank Sharry, executive director at America’s Voice, an advocacy group. “This is going to be wild and wide open legislating. Bring your six-shooter and a lot of bullets, because this thing is going to be crazy.”

History’s lessons

The 2007 bill had just enough for everyone to dislike, which helped prompt the bipartisan filibuster that blocked it.

It’s unclear what this year’s bill will look like because the “Gang of Eight” has produced only a five-page framework.

One key question is whether the Gang of Eight will feel obliged to stand together in defending its grand bargain against all amendments, or whether the lawmakers instead will be free to vote their consciences.

Fast forward to 2013, and the Sierra Club, BlueGreen Alliance and Greenpeace are among those out publicly in support of the kinds of comprehensive immigration reform measures pursued by President Barack Obama and the Senate’s Gang of Eight.

Atop their list of reasons why: the prospect of 11 million new green-minded voters.

Just like Republicans who see political gain in courting a new generation of Latino voters, greens count Hispanics, Asians and other potential new Americans as friendly to their causes, even more so in some instances than whites.

“The Sierra Club has thrived because of the ability for our members to engage with the full tools of democracy,” Michael Brune, the group’s executive director, told POLITICO.

“Right now, there are 11 million people who don’t have the tools, who can’t act without fear. They can’t vote. They can’t engage in the public process. They can’t advocate for clean energy without the threat of deportation,” Brune added. “Nobody should live under those circumstances.”

And if Congress paves the way for undocumented workers to become new citizens with full voting rights, they reason that it’d also be good news for their cause in electing lawmakers who will speak up for the EPA, clean energy and aggressive climate change policies.

Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer welcomed the greens’ entry to the debate, noting that illegal immigrants often live and work in places that are more vulnerable than the general population to higher levels of air, water and soil pollution. But they can’t speak up now for fear of deportation.

“Where somebody is going to put the most polluting industry in a very poor neighborhood, if people are afraid to come forward because they’re not even documented, their voice isn’t heard,” the California Democrat said in an interview.

It could also be good news for the bill itself.

Sen. Marco Rubio told POLITICO that the Gang of Eight think so. “Obviously, I can’t recall the last time I’ve been aligned with” the Sierra Club or other green groups, the Florida Republican said. “But on this issue, I think by and large there’s a growing consensus across the country that we need to deal with immigration reform once and for all.”

Environmentalists say their work on the immigration issue also gives them solid ground to stand on as they engage on issues intertwined in this legislative fight.

Several environmental group leaders advocating for immigration reform said they didn’t hear from the White House before registering support. But they said their new stance emerged after talks with the Service Employees International Union and other labor groups, civil rights activists and other like-minded liberal causes who they’ve partnered with on other issues.

Still, it hasn’t been easy getting here.

Some 100 members of an American Mormon community in northern Mexico, nine of whom -- women, children, toddlers -- were massacred a week ago on a lonely stretch of highway, just crossed over into Arizona.

Other family members who have lived there for decades will follow.

The atrocity was the work of one of the cartels battling for control of the drug traffic into the United States.

In Mexico's Sinaloa state in October, an arrest of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of ""El Chapo,"" who sits in a New York prison, brought a military-style cartel attack on the state capital, Culiacan, followed by a surrender to the cartel gunmen by national guard and army troops, and a release of the captive.

""Is Mexico a failed state?"" asks The Washington Times. Its editorial describes ""Another Blood-Soaked Year in Mexico"" where 17,000 people were murdered by July and the 2019 death toll is expected to reach 32,000.

USA Today reports: ""Through August of the current fiscal year, the Border Patrol apprehended 457,871 migrants arriving as 'family units' ... a 406% increase compared to the 90,554 family unit apprehensions during the same period the previous year. Migrant families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador made up almost 92% of the total.""

With cartel battles escalating into a war that Mexico City has no stomach for fighting, and a record number of migrants from Central America crossing Mexico to flood into the USA, what is the Democratic Party's policy for halting the rising tide?

Democrats are moving toward an ""open door"" policy on the U.S. border, an open borders embrace of any and all who wish to come.

America, apparently, does not belong to those who live here and love the country. America belongs to anyone who chooses to come. America belongs to the world.

Consider Bernie Sanders' immigration proposal, outlined the week of the massacre of Mormon women and children.

On Day One, President Sanders would declare a moratorium on deportations and offer a ""swift pathway to citizenship"" for all illegal migrants who have been here for five years.

Bernie would break up ICE. Border-jumping would cease to be a crime and become a civil offense like jaywalking. The ""Muslim ban"" would be abolished.

President Sanders would back sanctuary cities that refuse to work with U.S. law enforcement. Asylum seekers would not have to wait in Mexico as their claims were processed but would be welcomed into the USA.

Family separations would end. Trump's wall, which Bernie calls ""racist,"" would be history. The administration's treatment of illegal immigration ""as a criminal and national security matter is inhuman, impractical and must end.""

Migrants who enter illegally would qualify for federal health care and the same social welfare benefits as U.S. citizens. Immigrant officials say Sanders' proposals would create an irresistible magnet for millions of migrants from all over the world to stampede into the USA.

But the reality of building the wall could be more difficult than the rallying cries would suggest . The length of the wall , when construction will begin , how much it will cost and who will pay for it remain fundamental questions .
There is also ongoing debate about the feasibility of the structure and the need for it in the first place .
Trump 's push for a wall dates back to the day in June 2015 when he announced his campaign and promised to `` build a great , great wall on our southern border '' and said Mexico would pay .
His effort to turn those words into reality is expected to be formally announced Wednesday and is among several immigration-related actions anticipated in a multi-day rollout from the new administration .

Since he first made the pledge , walling off our neighbors to the south became an oft-repeated promise and rallying cry , both for the candidate and his supporters . Chants of `` build that wall '' thundered through arenas and convention halls . In at least one instance , Trump himself led the cheer . Building `` an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border , on day one '' is listed as item No . 1 on his `` 10 Point Plan to Put America First . ''
At the first press briefing of the new administration Monday , one of the first questions to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was about the wall . Spicer said the administration was working with agency heads and Congress to move forward on the project . He offered no further details .
Not everyone is as enthusiastic as the President about building a wall , including the man whose job it was to secure the U.S. border for the past three years .
`` I do n't see any efficacy in building a wall across the border , '' said Gil Kerlikowske , who until last week served as Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama .
`` The border and migration issues are just unbelievably complex , '' Kerlikowske said in an interview with CNN . `` And a simple answer to a complex problem is most assuredly the wrong answer . ''
Kerlikowske said the rugged terrain in the Arizona desert and the shifting Rio Grande River in Texas , which routinely changes depth and even direction , both represent natural obstacles to building a border wall . Some of the land along the border in the Rio Grande Valley is privately owned , representing another challenge , he said .
Kerlikowske also noted that the vast majority of people trying to enter the US are actually showing up at border entry points and seeking asylum or turning themselves in . Most are not trying to scale the fence in the dark of night , he said . Even if a wall was built , he said , it would require a significant hiring increase to have enough agents to monitor the wall . That would be no easy feat for an agency that is currently 1,200 employees below full strength .
Kerlikowske said that , in addition to some 700 miles of fencing , the border is currently patrolled by agents on foot , bikes , motorcycles , ATVs and horseback . There 's also an air wing , unmanned predator drones , ground sensors , infrared video and tower-mounted video with a range of 25 miles .
`` It 's all preferable to a wall , '' Kerlikowske said . `` Unless you monitor that wall . ''
On the campaign trail , Trump told a crowd of supporters in Anaheim , California , in May that he 'd reached out to leaders in the union representing Border Patrol agents and asked whether a wall was truly needed .
`` Mr. Trump , It 's absolutely vital , '' came the reply , he told the crowd . `` It 's an absolutely important tool . Maybe our most important tool to stop what 's going on . ''
`` We 're going to build the wall . We have no choice . ''
At the point , the crowd began chanting , `` build that wall . '' Trump joined in from the podium .
The National Border Patrol Council , the union representing Border Patrol agents , endorsed Trump for President -- marking the first time the group had taken such an action .
Brandon Judd , president of the council , said in a recent interview with CNN , that Trump was `` by far the best on border security '' when compared with other candidates .
Judd said he did n't reach that decision based on his pledge to build a wall . He said his group favored `` barriers in strategic locations . ''
But , importantly , he did n't say those barriers had to come in the form of a wall as Trump is suggesting .
He called the double fencing along the border in the San Diego area `` insanely effective . ''
Judd , who said he met with Trump and his transition team , argued such fencing allows agents to confront people on the US side of the border while they still have a fence in front of them to slow their progress .
`` He was very much willing to listen to our perspective , '' Judd said . `` It was , you know : ' I did n't realize that ' . And 'that 's good to know ' . ''
Trump would then turn to an aide , Judd recounted , and say : `` Hey , get on this . Get back with me . I need to know more about this . ''
Judd said he was confident his group 's views were being taken into consideration .
`` If you look at the areas they 're currently surveying -- if you look at what the talk is , a lot of that is coming from us , '' he said . `` They absolutely 100 % are in the process of implementing things we suggested . ''
Judd said he signed a non-disclosure agreement that prohibited him from going into detail about planned construction .
Shawn Moran , vice president of the Border Patrol union , said he thinks most people would be surprised to learn that it 's possible to drive for 30 minutes in some Border Patrol sectors and not encounter agents on patrol .
`` I think a lot of Americans think you 're going to see agents in towers every hundred yards , '' Moran said . `` That does n't exist . ''
He said one instance in which a wall may have made a difference was in the 2009 slaying of Border Patrol Agent Robert Rosas . Rosas was shot to death by assailants who crawled under fencing near the eastern San Diego County town of Campo .
The US-Mexico border is approximately 2,000 miles long , running from San Diego to Brownsville , Texas . Trump initially said he wanted to wall off the entire border , but has since said that 1,000 miles may do .
He has offered few details on the wall since being elected president . But speaking at a news conference earlier this month , he reiterated his pledge , referring to the border as `` an open sieve . '' He made construction sound imminent .
`` Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin , '' he told reporters on Jan. 11 .
CNN reported earlier this month that Trump transition team officials had been in discussions with the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department to begin planning a wall , including how certain environmental laws could come into play .
`` It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall , '' said one U.S. official familiar with the inquiry .
A review of Trump 's statements on the campaign trail offers a glimpse of what he envisions -- or did at the time .
Trump said his wall would be solid , strong and `` probably 35 to 40 feet up in the air . ''
`` It will actually look good , '' he added . `` You know , as good as a wall is going to look . ''
The dimensions of the border barricade grew when former Mexican President Vicente Fox insisted his country would never pay for it .
`` It just got 10 feet taller , '' Trump told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer last year .
When then-Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush referred to the proposed wall as a fence in August of 2015 , Trump took to Twitter to correct him :
`` It 's not a fence , Jeb , it 's a WALL , '' Trump tweeted , `` and there 's a BIG difference ! ''
In an interview with MSNBC in February , then-candidate Trump said he 'd priced out the project at about $ 8 billion . Later that month , he told Fox News ' Sean Hannity the cost would be $ 10 billion .
`` It 's going to be a very terrific wall , '' Trump said . `` $ 10 billion is not bad . ''
Hannity asked Trump , whose name is synonymous with his brand as a builder and hotelier whether the name Trump will be on the wall .","(CNN) President Donald Trump is following through with one of the first pledges he made a year and a half ago when he announced his long-shot bid for the White House -- directing federal resources toward building a wall along the southern border.

Reality of building the wall

At the first press briefing of the new administration Monday, one of the first questions to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was about the wall. Spicer said the administration was working with agency heads and Congress to move forward on the project. He offered no further details.

Trump has yet to appoint Kerlikowske's replacement.

""It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL,"" Trump tweeted, ""and there's a BIG difference!""

In an interview with MSNBC in February, then-candidate Trump said he'd priced out the project at about $8 billion. Later that month, he told Fox News' Sean Hannity the cost would be $10 billion.

""It's going to be a very terrific wall,"" Trump said. ""$10 billion is not bad.""

Hannity asked Trump, whose name is synonymous with his brand as a builder and hotelier whether the name Trump will be on the wall.

""Only if its' beautiful,"" he replied.",www.cnn.com,left,yymTDD2HEykpSl2D

Indianapolis Star

INDIANAPOLIS — Attorney General Jeff Sessions sparked a heated debate on immigration and the meaning of a Bible passage while speaking Thursday in Fort Wayne.

Sessions cited a chapter in Romans while defending the Trump administration's policy of separating parents from their children at the border. The policy has been widely denounced by both religious leaders and immigration advocates, among others.

“I would cite you to the apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,” said Sessions, who is also a Sunday school teacher at a United Methodist Church in Mobile, Alabama.

The first three verses of Romans 13 in the Common English Bible, traditionally used by the United Methodist Church, read:

1 Every person should place themselves under the authority of the government. There isn’t any authority unless it comes from God, and the authorities that are there have been put in place by God.

2 So anyone who opposes the authority is standing against what God has established. People who take this kind of stand will get punished.

3 The authorities don’t frighten people who are doing the right thing. Rather, they frighten people who are doing wrong. Would you rather not be afraid of authority? Do what’s right, and you will receive its approval.

But some who share Sessions' faith disagree with his interpretation of the passage.

""It was terrible,"" said Mike Mather, the senior pastor at Broadway UMC in Indianapolis. ""If you read the first 11 chapters of Romans, you get a pretty good idea of what the context of that community was. If you read (Chapter) 12, you see love is supposed to be the guiding force. ...

Romans 12 includes the line, ""Contribute to the needs of God’s people, and welcome strangers into your home.""

Those verses, Mather said, seem to run contrary to the policy Sessions was defending. Launched in May, the policy forcibly removes children traveling with parents caught at the border and places them in government care.

Reuniting them is a giant mess.,2018-07-07,Analysis Stephen Collinson,"( CNN ) The family separations saga has revealed failures of governance , competence and humanity and made one thing clear : President Donald Trump does n't believe Harry S. Truman 's famous mantra , `` The buck stops here . ''
Seventeen days ago , Trump , in a rare display of bending to public outrage over his policies , seemed poised to fix the family separation crisis with a stroke of his pen .
The administrative and moral morass over children taken from their parents under the White House 's `` zero tolerance '' policy after illegally crossing the southern border is as intractable as ever -- even though it 's no longer tearing at the public 's conscience in such a direct and emotional way .
On Friday , in the latest sign of disarray in the administration , officials admitted in court that they may miss a judge 's Tuesday deadline to reunite children under 5 with their parents . One of the complications is that officials are conducting DNA tests on children to ensure they are reunited with their own parents .
`` Anybody with a heart would feel strongly about it , '' Trump said at the time , and he got a congratulatory tweet fr om his daughter Ivanka as if he had nothing to do with the practice in the first place .
`` Now that an EO has been signed , ending family separation at the border , it is time to focus on swiftly and safely reuniting the families that have been separated , '' the first daughter tweeted .
But hopes that the reunions would be swift were dashed in court on Friday and by other reports of a badly malfunctioning system that was overwhelmed when the President ordered a so-called zero tolerance policy that led to separations with no plan for dealing with the kids .
Some parents who have gone through immigration procedures have told CNN they do n't know how to get in touch with their kids -- despite a court deadline that expired Friday for the administration to at least put parents in telephone touch with their offspring .
One Guatemalan woman called Lesvia , who got out of a detention center in Texas on Thursday , told CNN 's Miguel Marquez on Friday that she received no answers about the whereabouts of her 10-year-old son , who she last saw on May 19 .
The administration has yet to tell Americans exactly how many kids are still in custody , how long they will remain split from their parents and when this grim chapter of modern political history will end .
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar tweeted on Friday that his staff was working hard to get the job done .
`` As we adapt to meet new demands and new circumstances , we have committed tremendous resources and deployed hundreds of additional personnel to expedite the reunification of minors with their verified parents , '' he wrote .
At a court hearing in San Diego on Friday , the administration said it may need more time to reunite families it separated . Currently , all kids younger than 5 must be returned to their parents by July 10 and families with older children must be reunified by July 26 .
Judge Dana Sabraw gave the government until 5 p.m. Saturday to provide a list of all under-5s that it believes are covered by the reunification order as well as the reasons why it needs more time to complete reunions in some cases .
The Justice Department said in the hearing that of 101 children in custody who were younger than 5 , 83 had been matched with 86 parents . Forty-six of those parents were in the custody of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency -- meaning that reunification could be possible .
But 19 parents have already been removed from the US and 19 have been released by ICE -- making the process of finding them more difficult .
Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California said on CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' on Friday that the government should get no extension , however .
`` Their top priority right now needs to be reuniting every child who has been separated from their mother and father . The American people , they want order on our borders but they also want to make sure we do that compassionately , '' Swalwell said .
Far from wading into the fray to break up bureaucratic logjams and ease the human misery of separations , Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have gone back to using searing political rhetoric on immigration to shore up the political foundations of their White House .
`` A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities , to let drugs pour into our cities , and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans , '' Trump tweeted on Friday , while ignoring the separations crisis .
Hours later , Pence reinforced his boss ' effort to turn the narrative away from children kept from their parents in a foreign land to calls by some obliging Democratic lawmakers for the abolition of ICE .
Trump and Pence were in some ways given an opening by several Democrats , including some potential 2020 presidential candidates , who called for the abolition of ICE without offering an alternative plan to deal with border security .
Trump is also a master of distraction , and he has a polished record of creating new political storms to disguise scandals and dramas that could damage him politically .
He also got lucky . The retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and a vacancy that could cement the court 's ideological balance f or a generation have captured the political imagination of Washington for over a week .
Next week , Trump will leave for a foreign trip packed with high-profile photo-ops , which includes a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that is likely to further shove the separations issue into the background .
Yet all this time , several thousand kids are wondering when they will see their parents again .
At times last month , it seemed that blanket television coverage of the human toll of separations would inflict irreversible political damage on the administration .
It 's a perilous moment for any president when failures make his government look callous and indifferent in the face of human suffering . The classic example is Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .

Regarding Ocasio-Cortez 's comment , Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D-NY ) tweeted , “ One of the lessons from the Holocaust is ‘ Never Again ’ - not only to mass murder , but also to the dehumanization of people , violations of basic rights , and assaults on our common morality . We fail to learn that lesson when we don ’ t callout such inhumanity right in front of us. ” Jerrold Nadler , Twitter
“ The administration ’ s efforts at deterring asylum families through displays of toughness and force have failed spectacularly , because they are fleeing conditions at home that are also terrible . There is a legitimate policy dispute here — Trump wants to detain families for far longer , so they can ’ t evade hearings , while Democrats favor addressing root causes of migrations and reforms to humanely manage the influx — but one thing that ’ s inescapable is that toughness as deterrence has been unmasked as total folly. ” Greg Sargent , Washington Post
“ Trump seems convinced that draconian immigration policy is good politics . But evidence is mounting that he ’ s wrong … a Fox News poll released this week indicates that Trump ’ s fixation on curtailing all forms of immigration isn ’ t resonating with voters . Half of American voters who responded to the poll said they think the Trump administration has gone too far with immigration enforcement — more than double the percentage who said they don ’ t think Trump has gone far enough… It ’ s unclear whether his announcement was meant as anything beyond an empty show of strength . But either way , the mere fact that Trump views using the power of the state against immigrants and their communities as a winning reelection strategy is a dark omen 15 months ahead of the next presidential election. ” Aaron Rupar , Vox
“ Trump tweeted about ‘ the millions of illegal aliens… they will be removed as fast as they come in. ’ This does not make sense . The asylum seekers at the border can not be immediately removed because they have a legal right to apply for humanitarian relief… What we see here is a chief executive who is well aware of his vulnerability to a Democratic challenger , desperately trying to rile up his followers by bashing immigrants . After several years of draconian immigration policies and optics , including images of children separated from their families and kept in pens , it is unlikely to persuade voters in 2020. ” Raul A. Reyes , CNN
“ More to the point , perhaps , doing so would necessarily entail shattering large numbers of families , including ones well established over a decade or more of residency and whose children , born in this country , are citizens . As Mr. Trump and his administration discovered a year ago , Americans are rightly appalled at the sight of government agents wrenching apart parents and their children ; they would likely react just as badly to a rerun involving their neighbors as they did to the original iteration , in which agents focused on families who had recently crossed the border. ” Editorial Board , Washington Post
“ By all measures , a plan to deport ‘ millions ’ of people is an astounding exaggeration — even beginning to deport millions , as Trump pledged ICE would do , stretches the truth to a breaking point… ICE has deported an average of 90,000 people from the interior of the United States in recent years . The largest number of people ICE deported overall — from the interior as well as recent border crossers — was about 420,000 people in 2012. ” Maryam Saleh , The Intercept
“ One of the first immigration actions Trump took as president was to eliminate a system of priorities President Barack Obama created for deportations .

Regarding Ocasio-Cortez's comment, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) tweeted, “One of the lessons from the Holocaust is ‘Never Again’ - not only to mass murder, but also to the dehumanization of people , violations of basic rights, and assaults on our common morality. We fail to learn that lesson when we don’t callout such inhumanity right in front of us.” Jerrold Nadler, Twitter

“The administration’s efforts at deterring asylum families through displays of toughness and force have failed spectacularly, because they are fleeing conditions at home that are also terrible. There is a legitimate policy dispute here — Trump wants to detain families for far longer, so they can’t evade hearings, while Democrats favor addressing root causes of migrations and reforms to humanely manage the influx — but one thing that’s inescapable is that toughness as deterrence has been unmasked as total folly.” Greg Sargent, Washington Post

“Trump seems convinced that draconian immigration policy is good politics. But evidence is mounting that he’s wrong … a Fox News poll released this week indicates that Trump’s fixation on curtailing all forms of immigration isn’t resonating with voters. Half of American voters who responded to the poll said they think the Trump administration has gone too far with immigration enforcement — more than double the percentage who said they don’t think Trump has gone far enough… It’s unclear whether his announcement was meant as anything beyond an empty show of strength. But either way, the mere fact that Trump views using the power of the state against immigrants and their communities as a winning reelection strategy is a dark omen 15 months ahead of the next presidential election.” Aaron Rupar, Vox

“Trump tweeted about ‘the millions of illegal aliens… they will be removed as fast as they come in.’ This does not make sense. The asylum seekers at the border cannot be immediately removed because they have a legal right to apply for humanitarian relief… What we see here is a chief executive who is well aware of his vulnerability to a Democratic challenger, desperately trying to rile up his followers by bashing immigrants . After several years of draconian immigration policies and optics, including images of children separated from their families and kept in pens, it is unlikely to persuade voters in 2020.” Raul A. Reyes, CNN

“More to the point, perhaps, doing so would necessarily entail shattering large numbers of families , including ones well established over a decade or more of residency and whose children, born in this country, are citizens. As Mr. Trump and his administration discovered a year ago, Americans are rightly appalled at the sight of government agents wrenching apart parents and their children; they would likely react just as badly to a rerun involving their neighbors as they did to the original iteration, in which agents focused on families who had recently crossed the border.” Editorial Board, Washington Post

“By all measures, a plan to deport ‘millions’ of people is an astounding exaggeration — even beginning to deport millions, as Trump pledged ICE would do, stretches the truth to a breaking point… ICE has deported an average of 90,000 people from the interior of the United States in recent years. The largest number of people ICE deported overall — from the interior as well as recent border crossers — was about 420,000 people in 2012.” Maryam Saleh, The Intercept

“One of the first immigration actions Trump took as president was to eliminate a system of priorities President Barack Obama created for deportations. The system prioritized the deportation of people with serious criminal records or who otherwise posed a threat to public safety, and its creation was an acknowledgement by the Obama administration that it’s simply not possible to deport the 11 million people who live in the United States without proper legal documents…

Under previous US administrations, undocumented immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses.

Why is Trump doing this?

By Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter

Administration officials have offered conflicting explanations for the harrowing details of crying children kept in fenced-in rooms and despondent parents, but Mr Trump's dual goals appear clear.

One reason is leverage. He wants to force Democrats in Congress to negotiate a legislative package that keeps migrant families intact in exchange for full funding for his much-touted border wall, speedier deportation of undocumented aliens and sweeping changes to legal immigration policy.

His other incentive comes from knowing that this could be a winning mid-term election issue. Even if he fails to get a deal, it will motivate his base to turn out in support of Republicans across the country.

According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, while 91% of Democrats and 68% of independents oppose separating asylum-seekers and others in the US illegally from their children, 55% of Republicans support it.

Who else has spoken out?

On Tuesday Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray Caso said the practice was ""cruel and inhuman"", and clearly violated human rights.

The US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, two leading business groups, said the policy was ""contrary to American values"".

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who in the past has praised Mr Trump's policy of curbing immigration, told French TV that she disagreed with splitting children from parents.

A new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll suggests that most Americans oppose the policy, with 28% supporting it.

What has the government said?

The White House has been disputing the terminology used to describe its crackdown.

It describes the holding centres where children have been pictured in metal chain-link enclosures with concrete floors as ""shelters"" instead of ""cages"".

What are Trump and lawmakers doing?

Mr Trump will meet Congress members on Wednesday afternoon to discuss a more moderate bill.

The compromise would limit, but not ban outright, family separations. It would also offer an eventual path to citizenship for undocumented adult immigrants, known as Dreamers, who entered the US as children.

Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) , a 2016 GOP presidential candidate , said he believes that President Barack Obama ’ s first executive amnesty for so-called DREAMers—the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) —is “ important ” and he won ’ t reverse it himself if elected president . He delivered these remarks in a Spanish-language interview he gave to Univision ’ s Jorge Ramos .
“ I believe DACA is important . It can ’ t be terminated from one moment to the next , because there are already people benefiting from it , ” Rubio said in Spanish on Ramos ’ s television program , according to an English translation provided by the media service Grabien . “ But yes , it is going to have to end . It can ’ t be the permanent policy of the United States , and I don ’ t think that ’ s what they ’ re asking either . I think everyone prefers immigration reform . ”
Ramos followed up , according to the translation , by asking : “ But then , to clarify , you would put an end to DACA once immigration reform is approved , but what would happen , Senator , if there is no immigration reform ; would you cancel DACA anyway ? ”
Rubio answered that DACA will end only when a legislative substitute with the exact same or similar policy prescriptions—a legislative amnesty for illegal alien minors—is implemented . He also said in Spanish that , if elected president , he believes that America can not deport illegal aliens here in the country right now , and he expects a legislative solution will be implemented that essentially has all the parts of the massively controversial “ Gang of Eight ” bill that he would pass piece-by-piece .
“ Well , at some point it is going to have to end , that is to say , it can ’ t continue being the permanent policy of the United States , ” Rubio said . “ I believe , if I become President , it is going to be possible to achieve immigration reform . It is not going to be comprehensive , that is to say , it is not going to all be in one massive bill . We already tried that a few years ago . We ’ ve seen there isn ’ t political support for it and I think we ’ ve wasted a lot of time in this process , when we could have made progress through the steps I ’ ve advocated .
“ Unfortunately , a lot has been spent with that , it ’ s become an even more controversial subject , more difficult to make progress on , but I ’ m still saying it ’ s important to modernize our system and that means improving the way we enforce in the future , modernizing the immigration system so that it isn ’ t as costly and bureaucratic , and we have to deal with the 12 million human beings who are here and no one , no one is advocating a plan to deport 12 million people , so that topic has to be dealt with as well . ”
Rubio ’ s comment , targeted toward Spanish speakers , that he would keep Obama ’ s first executive amnesty—enacted outside the purview of Congress—in effect , until passing a legislative substitute with nearly identical policies , puts him at odds with virtually the rest of the Republican field except for former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush .
Sens . Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) and Rand Paul ( R-KY ) and Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal have each said that on day one as president , they would immediately undo Obama ’ s unconstitutional and illegal executive overreaches—including DACA , as it was started without congressional approval—rather than trying to wait for a legislative solution .
Further , Rubio is calling DACA “ important , ” though it ’ s widely understood in the political world that this program caused the border crisis last summer and will likely lead to a future border crisis . Rubio ’ s comments endorse a policy that , in effect , brought tens of thousands of migrant children streaming across the border illegally and risking their lives to get into America with hopes of getting an unlawful amnesty .
The last time Rubio tried to push immigration rhetoric like this—the Gang of Eight bill back in 2013—he saw a significant drop in the polls . As he continues exposing his true beliefs when it comes to immigration matters , his emotional rhetoric as a presidential candidate will be undercut by his support of policies the Republican electorate is vehemently opposed to like Obama ’ s executive amnesty .
Ann Coulter , the massively influential conservative columnist , has said that Rubio “ can ’ t be serious ” in running for president after exposing his wildly unpopular immigration views , and he seems to be angling for a vice presidential slot .
“ I think he ’ s running for a vice presidential slot , ” Coulter said of Rubio on Fox News . “ This can ’ t be serious . ”
It ’ s also worth noting that pandering on immigration to the Hispanic community as much as Bush or Rubio have does not mean Republicans have any better chance at gaining support in such communities .
Bush , who along with Rubio is the most liberal on immigration in the 2016 field and thinks of himself as an “ honorary Hispanic ” and even checked the race as his own on a voter registration card—something he and his campaign have tried to laugh off since the story broke—is polling worse among Hispanics than even Mitt Romney got in 2012 .
Romney , who was berated for his “ self-deport ” line , got by most estimations about 29 percent of the Hispanic vote in the 2012 election against President Barack Obama . Yet Bush , according to two recent ABC News and Washington Post polls , trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton among Hispanic voters by an even worse margin than by which Romney lost—71 percent for Clinton to 26 percent for Bush .
Perhaps most importantly , however , is that Rubio ’ s comments to Ramos in Spanish show that he ’ s significantly further left than the majority of Republicans in Congress on this issue . Earlier this year , the U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment–and then passed legislation containing it–from Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( R-TN ) that would have withheld taxpayer funding for Obama ’ s DACA executive amnesty .
While 26 of the most liberal Republicans in the House voted against that amendment , it passed onto the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) funding bill , then passed the House . Rep. Renee Ellmers ( R-NC ) , who is going to face conservative Frank Roche in a rematch in her primary next year , led the charge among those liberal Republicans to try to derail Blackburn ’ s amendment . Ellmers failed in the end .
When Rubio announced he was running for president , too , he actually argued he ’ s done more for illegal aliens than Hillary Clinton has .
“ Well , I don ’ t know about others , but I ’ ve done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did , ” Rubio said in an interview with National Public Radio . “ I mean , I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats .

The United States is set to reach a contentious milestone this week when it accepts its 50,000th refugee for the fiscal year, hitting a ceiling set by President Trump in his quest to sharply curtail immigration into the country.

Williamson, Kyle Smith, Andrew C. Mccarthy, Luke Thompson, Zachary Evans, Jordan Sillars, Jay Nordlinger, Tobias Hoonhout, Julie Gunlock","President Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer talk in the Oval Office , December 11 , 2018 . ( Kevin Lamarque/Reuters )
The promise of this kind of spectacle is about one half of why Donald Trump was elected .
New York City ’ s annual Shakespeare in the Park is the worst kind of theater . Washington ’ s annual government-shutdown drama is the second-worst kind .
I wrote off the alfresco performances in Central Park after the Public Theater decided that what Shakespeare ’ s A Winter ’ s Tale really needed was a political speech by Senator Schumer , who wandered onto the stage at one point — after Bill de Blasio ’ s campaign-rally speech but before the Muppets , if I recall that slightly surreal evening correctly — to make a few of his habitually banal political observations before shouting “ Vote Democratic ! ” and wandering off .
Improvisation is not the senator ’ s forte . When President Donald Trump surprised Senator Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi — the other half of the Democrats ’ noisome slapstick-comedy duo — by broadcasting their acrimonious Oval Office meeting , the anguine gentleman from New York was caught off-guard .
Senator Schumer and Representative Pelosi invoked the word “ shutdown ” as though it were a magical incantation . President Trump said that he ’ d be “ proud ” to shut down the government if he doesn ’ t get funding for a border wall . As Trump bellowed and berated the Democrats , “ Schumer sat staring forward and not meeting the president ’ s eyes , ” as CNBC put it . The promise of that kind of spectacle is about one half of why Donald Trump was elected .
Those of us who take a more miserly view of the enumerated powers of the federal government believe that it does not have very many legitimate jobs to do . Instead of doing a few things well , it does many , many , many things — badly . But if the federal apparatus serves any purpose at all , providing for national security — beginning with securing the borders — is it .

The promise of this kind of spectacle is about one half of why Donald Trump was elected.

New York City’s annual Shakespeare in the Park is the worst kind of theater. Washington’s annual government-shutdown drama is the second-worst kind.

Oddly enough, Chuck Schumer figures in both.

I wrote off the alfresco performances in Central Park after the Public Theater decided that what Shakespeare’s A Winter’s Tale really needed was a political speech by Senator Schumer, who wandered onto the stage at one point — after Bill de Blasio’s campaign-rally speech but before the Muppets, if I recall that slightly surreal evening correctly — to make a few of his habitually banal political observations before shouting “Vote Democratic!” and wandering off.

Geoffrey Rush he is not.

Improvisation is not the senator’s forte. When President Donald Trump surprised Senator Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi — the other half of the Democrats’ noisome slapstick-comedy duo — by broadcasting their acrimonious Oval Office meeting, the anguine gentleman from New York was caught off-guard.

Senator Schumer and Representative Pelosi invoked the word “shutdown” as though it were a magical incantation. President Trump said that he’d be “proud” to shut down the government if he doesn’t get funding for a border wall. As Trump bellowed and berated the Democrats, “Schumer sat staring forward and not meeting the president’s eyes,” as CNBC put it. The promise of that kind of spectacle is about one half of why Donald Trump was elected.

Illegal immigration is the other half.

Those of us who take a more miserly view of the enumerated powers of the federal government believe that it does not have very many legitimate jobs to do. Instead of doing a few things well, it does many, many, many things — badly. But if the federal apparatus serves any purpose at all, providing for national security — beginning with securing the borders — is it.

Washington should do its damned job. Which it will, once it has exhausted every other option. Republicans have the chance to take some of those options away.

Disorder is always undesirable in government. And this year’s installment of shutdown theater finds many different currents of chaos adjoined: an increasingly dysfunctional constitutional order in which the legislative branch has effectively abdicated and ceded much of its power to the executive; a border that in practice is defended by very little more than strong language; a broken congressional budgeting process in which the regular order of appropriations have been supplanted by a series of “continuing resolutions,” stopgap measures that have now been passed more than 100 times in this still-young century.

In addition, in 14 out of the 40 years during this period, none of these regular appropriations bills were enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year. Nine of these fiscal years have occurred in the interval since FY2001.

The abandonment of what budget geeks refer to as “regular order” — the consideration, revision, and passage of a dozen or so separate appropriations bills moving through the ordinary congressional committee process — keeps Washington effectively in a state of constant fiscal emergency. That leads to a great deal of drama and much gnashing of teeth, but the stakes are almost trivial: Federal “shutdowns” are really nothing of the sort, with most of the essential functions of the government continuing uninterrupted. We don’t dock the aircraft carriers or put the nuclear arsenal in standby mode.

If the Republicans are going to shut down the government over border security, they should do it on behalf of a better border-security agenda. The most important reform would be putting an electronic wall between would-be illegal workers and their employers through a robust, mandatory program of employment-eligibility verification. And then there’s the mundane, tedious work of everyday law enforcement: Raiding a few construction sites will net a few illegal drywall installers, but if you really want to change behavior, then that begins with frog-marching the employers off to the federal pokey. The federal government does not have a very good record on that, and winning convictions in such cases is difficult. But it is the employers who provide the main lure for illegal immigration in the first place. And, unlike the millions of illegal immigrants, we know where they live.

Republicans should be the responsible party on immigration. The Democrats are too much in thrall to identity politics to do be that. And Republicans should not fear a shutdown.

The officials also declared victory from the original travel ban , saying that the process has pushed a number of other countries to begin sharing more information about their citizens who are seeking visas to enter the U.S .
The crux of the travel ban — a 90-day pause on some admissions from six terrorist-connected — is slated to expire Sunday , and White House , Homeland Security and State Department officials said Friday they ’ re looking to update it .
Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke has submitted a set of recommendations to Mr. Trump for countries that should still face travel restrictions or whose travelers will face “ enhanced screening . ”
Mr. Trump is pondering the recommendations , and officials declined Friday to talk about which countries are in play . They wouldn ’ t say whether the six countries on the original target list from March — Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen — will all remain on the updated list , but did say others have been added into the list as less-than-cooperative .
“ What the secretary has recommended are tougher measures and more specific measures , ” said Miles Taylor , counselor to Ms. Duke .
The government said it went through a months-long , two-tier review of other countries ’ information-sharing with the U.S. After an initial assessment , countries that were deemed “ inadequate ” were put on 50-day notice that if they didn ’ t promise to comply they could face restrictions .

With Vice President Joe Biden presiding over the chamber , 68 senators – 54 Democrats joined by 14 Republicans – rose from their chairs to vote for the most sweeping immigration reform overhaul to pass the chamber since 2006 .
“ This , ” says Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R ) of South Carolina , a member of the “ Gang of Eight ” that crafted this year ’ s bill , “ is as good as it gets in the Senate . ”
But one question hung over the heady proceedings : Would it all be in vain ?
Without a single House Republican leader signaling an interest in taking up the Senate ’ s legislation , immigration reform ’ s road from broadly popular idea to legislation on President Obama ’ s desk is still as murky as ever .
“ To our friends in the House , we ask for your consideration , ” said Sen. John McCain ( R ) of Arizona , plaintively , at a news conference after the vote . “ We stand ready to sit down and negotiate with you . ”
The Senate bill ’ s limited appeal to the House isn ’ t for lack of trying to sweeten the deal for conservatives . The legislation carries an amendment struck by Republican Sens . Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota that , at an eye-popping cost of more than $ 40 billion , would nearly double the number of agents stationed along the US-Mexico border and authorize more than 700 miles of border fencing , among other requirements .
“ This border-security measure blows my mind , ” Senator Graham says . “ We ’ ve practically militarized the border . ”
In addition , the Senate bill blocks the undocumented from receiving subsidies under Mr. Obama ’ s signature health-care law . Those in the United States illegally but seeking to become US citizens must wait 13 years and pay thousands of dollars in fines while being barred from receiving federal benefits .
In another nod to conservatives , none of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country today would be allowed to become permanent residents until each of five “ triggers ” are hit :
Establishing a nationwide E-Verify system for validating a person ’ s work authorization .
Making operational more than $ 4 billion in advanced border-security technology .
Bringing on line an advanced system of tracking entry and exit from the nation ’ s airports and seaports .
The bill likewise achieves two goals of the typically conservative-leaning corporate community : vastly expanding efforts to attract and retain high-skilled workers and opening up an entirely new class of visas for low-skilled foreign workers , including those in agricultural industries , to come to the US on a temporary basis .
But what rankles some conservatives is the central concession won by Democrats : The undocumented would be allowed to legalize , if provisionally , before all the bill ’ s many security measures are in place .
“ I can tell you it ’ s going to make history because it ’ s going to make the same mistakes that we made in 1986 when we thought we were securing the border and we obviously didn ’ t , ” says Sen. Charles Grassley ( R ) of Iowa , speaking of the 1986 immigration reform bill that legalized 3 million illegal immigrants but failed to secure the nation ’ s borders .
“ You find out [ if ] you reward illegality , and you get more of it by four times , ” says Senator Grassley , who voted for the 1986 bill signed by President Reagan . “ I don ’ t want to make that mistake again . ”
There ’ s hope among the GOP that the House will achieve conservative goals that couldn ’ t get enough support in the Senate .
“ Remember , this is the beginning of the process , not the end , ” Senator Hoeven says . “ In other words , the House has to do something . ”
But “ something ” is almost certainly not inclusive of the Senate ’ s legislation . House leaders – including those supportive of the immigration reform effort like House Speaker John Boehner ( R ) of Ohio , Rep. Paul Ryan ( R ) of Wisconsin , and Rep. Raúl Labrador ( R ) of Idaho – have said the Senate bill won ’ t get a hearing in the House .
What exactly the House will do is still an open question . House Judiciary chairman Robert Goodlatte ( R ) of Virginia is moving a passel of bills that address parts of the immigration system , including interior enforcement of immigration laws and nationwide implementation of E-Verify . A bipartisan group of House members has cooked up a single , comprehensive bill on which a final accord has proved elusive for weeks .
But those options and others won ’ t be formed into a legislative plan no earlier than a GOP conference meeting devoted to immigration on July 10 .

The absence of the two Gang of Eight senators with the most cachet among House Republicans spoke volumes : For now , keeping immigration reform rolling may very well mean steering clear of the bill that the Senate fought so hard to pass .","Tense negotiations, months of deliberation, hundreds of amendments, and hours of speeches on the Senate floor culminated in passage of a bipartisan immigration reform bill on Thursday.

With Vice President Joe Biden presiding over the chamber, 68 senators – 54 Democrats joined by 14 Republicans – rose from their chairs to vote for the most sweeping immigration reform overhaul to pass the chamber since 2006.

“This,” says Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina, a member of the “Gang of Eight” that crafted this year’s bill, “is as good as it gets in the Senate.”

But one question hung over the heady proceedings: Would it all be in vain?

Without a single House Republican leader signaling an interest in taking up the Senate’s legislation, immigration reform’s road from broadly popular idea to legislation on President Obama’s desk is still as murky as ever.

“To our friends in the House, we ask for your consideration,” said Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona, plaintively, at a news conference after the vote. “We stand ready to sit down and negotiate with you.”

The Senate bill’s limited appeal to the House isn’t for lack of trying to sweeten the deal for conservatives. The legislation carries an amendment struck by Republican Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota that, at an eye-popping cost of more than $40 billion, would nearly double the number of agents stationed along the US-Mexico border and authorize more than 700 miles of border fencing, among other requirements.

“This border-security measure blows my mind,” Senator Graham says. “We’ve practically militarized the border.”

In addition, the Senate bill blocks the undocumented from receiving subsidies under Mr. Obama’s signature health-care law. Those in the United States illegally but seeking to become US citizens must wait 13 years and pay thousands of dollars in fines while being barred from receiving federal benefits.

In another nod to conservatives, none of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country today would be allowed to become permanent residents until each of five “triggers” are hit:

Hiring the “surge” of more than 19,000 border agents.

Building the 750 miles of border fencing.

Establishing a nationwide E-Verify system for validating a person’s work authorization.

Making operational more than $4 billion in advanced border-security technology.

Bringing on line an advanced system of tracking entry and exit from the nation’s airports and seaports.

The bill likewise achieves two goals of the typically conservative-leaning corporate community: vastly expanding efforts to attract and retain high-skilled workers and opening up an entirely new class of visas for low-skilled foreign workers, including those in agricultural industries, to come to the US on a temporary basis.

But what rankles some conservatives is the central concession won by Democrats: The undocumented would be allowed to legalize, if provisionally, before all the bill’s many security measures are in place.

“I can tell you it’s going to make history because it’s going to make the same mistakes that we made in 1986 when we thought we were securing the border and we obviously didn’t,” says Sen. Charles Grassley (R) of Iowa, speaking of the 1986 immigration reform bill that legalized 3 million illegal immigrants but failed to secure the nation’s borders.

“You find out [if] you reward illegality, and you get more of it by four times,” says Senator Grassley, who voted for the 1986 bill signed by President Reagan. “I don’t want to make that mistake again.”

There’s hope among the GOP that the House will achieve conservative goals that couldn’t get enough support in the Senate.

“Remember, this is the beginning of the process, not the end,” Senator Hoeven says. “In other words, the House has to do something.”

But “something” is almost certainly not inclusive of the Senate’s legislation. House leaders – including those supportive of the immigration reform effort like House Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio, Rep. Paul Ryan (R) of Wisconsin, and Rep. Raúl Labrador (R) of Idaho – have said the Senate bill won’t get a hearing in the House.

What exactly the House will do is still an open question. House Judiciary chairman Robert Goodlatte (R) of Virginia is moving a passel of bills that address parts of the immigration system, including interior enforcement of immigration laws and nationwide implementation of E-Verify. A bipartisan group of House members has cooked up a single, comprehensive bill on which a final accord has proved elusive for weeks.

But those options and others won’t be formed into a legislative plan no earlier than a GOP conference meeting devoted to immigration on July 10.

And with many conservative House Republicans balking at a Democratic red line of potential citizenship for the undocumented under any circumstances, it's anyone's guess whether lawmakers can reconcile the Senate bill with whatever legislation the House approves.

The perhaps grim fate of the Senate bill in an unrepentantly conservative House was clear on Thursday, even as senators were slapping one another on the back and paying tribute to Ted Kennedy, the late Massachusetts senator whose immigration reform efforts in 2006 and 2007 were indefatigable if, eventually, futile.

Gutierrez’s group, Republicans for Immigration Reform, has no plans to launch a counteroffensive. Despite being billed as the GOP rainmaker on immigration reform, the group has struggled to make inroads with big GOP donors.

“With the problem at the border and the president’s rhetoric on executive action have totally poisoned the well,” said Charlie Spies, who helped organized Republicans for Immigration Reform. “I don’t think anybody believes anything can happen this year.”

They aren’t alone. While American Action Network was heavily invested in pushing immigration reform when legislation was under discussion in the Senate, the multi-issue conservative group isn’t active on the ground or on TV trying to make an example of House Republicans who have blocked similar efforts in that chamber.

Bloomberg’s Partnership for a New American Economy also has no plans for major network or cable TV ad buys on immigration reform.

Zuckerberg’s FWD.us could go up with ads later this fall, but doesn’t have any time reserved as of yet.

Representatives from the groups cite a variety of reasons for not playing an active role in the election — everything from immigration reform not being a top issue this cycle to trying to save limited resources for when the legislative environment in Congress becomes better.

Still, it’s a stark contrast from earlier this year when immigration groups, GOP operatives, unions and others were putting a full-court press on House Republicans with ads, private meetings and in district lobbying to engage on the issue.

Some groups fed up with Republicans became aggressive last year. Kica Matos, a spokeswoman for the Fair Immigration Reform Movement said earlier this year that it was time to “switch tactics from persuasion to punishment.”

Many hoped the big outside groups would pick up that mantle.

Sill, Republicans have moved increasingly to the right on the issue of immigration, following the dramatic surge of illegal immigrants on the Texas border. And they aren’t afraid to show it. Attack ads have aired in Arkansas, Michigan and New Hampshire — key states for which party will control the Senate. Failed Alaska tea party Republican Senate candidate Joe Miller, who was vying to become the GOP nominee, went so far as to send out a mailer that depicted illegal immigrants as gang members.

President Barack Obama has signaled he will use executive actions regarding immigration reform in mid-September. When he does, it’s expected to incite the barrage of criticism on the campaign trail from Republicans even more.

The Latino Victory Project is trying to provide a backstop for Obama. The group, which was supported by actress Eva Longoria and Democratic megadonor Henry Muñoz, is launching cable TV ads in English and Spanish to run in Washington through the beginning of September that criticize House Republican leadership’s failure to act on immigration reform. The group also plans to run digital ads in Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King’s district.

Not everyone is waving the white flag.

Latino Victory Project’s Cristobal Alex said they decided to go up with the ads because there was a “vacuum” on the pro-immigration reform side, and expects to do another round of ads once Obama takes executive action on the issue.

He praised the other pro-immigration groups activity so far, but said it would be “unfortunate if they pulled back at this moment.”

The hard line is relatively new . Not long ago , moderate Democrats signed on to a serious immigration proposal that overlapped in several ways with the president ’ s plan . In 2009 , the Brookings Institution , in tandem with Duke University ’ s Kenan Center for Ethics , convened a bipartisan group , of which I was a member , to accomplish what the title of our report promised : “ Breaking the Immigration Stalemate. ” The group , led by Clinton administration domestic policy advisor William Galston , included thoughtful policy experts from across the political spectrum .
No one proposed a wall , certainly . But we did agree on a commitment to the electronic E-Verify system , designed to make it impossible for illegal immigrants to get hired for jobs . And , before “ chain migration ” entered the political discussion , we pushed to limit the practice : “ Congress Should Eliminate Diversity Visas , Restrict Eligibility for Family-Sponsored Visas , and Increase Visas for Skilled Immigrants , ” our report declared . Doing this would mean an additional 150,000 visas for workers with coveted skills—and an end to granting preference to newcomers simply because they represented “ diversity ” or had blood relations here already . ( That was then : last night , Democrats hooted and booed President Trump when he proposed to limit this practice , demonstrating how quickly the Left has moved in a radical direction . )
Our report suggested that extended family members should no longer get immigration preference but that spouses and children , as members of nuclear families , still would . Workplace enforcement would lay the foundation for eventual legalization . Even this came with conditions , though . We proposed the launch of a “ legalization program requiring unauthorized workers who have been in the country for five or more years to : pay a fine ; provide evidence of current employment and a steady work history , payment of taxes , and good moral character ; pass a background check ; and study English and learn about U.S. history and government . ”
The Brookings-Duke report fit within a moderate-Democrat tradition of immigration restriction that has now vanished . Texas congresswoman Barbara Jordan—the first African-American woman elected to Congress from the South—chaired the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform , which reported to President Clinton in 1997 . Among its consensus conclusions : “ Effective policy means enforcement of immigration limits ; sponsors are responsible for ensuring that immigrants do not become a burden on the American taxpayer ; immigration policy must protect U.S. workers against unfair competition from foreign workers , and a sound immigration policy supports Americanization. ” Jordan called out low-skilled immigration as responsible for depressing the wages and employment of African-Americans , a perspective that has now been banished from Democratic dogma as hateful and divisive . The report led Clinton to agree to reduce legal immigration by one-third . All this at a time when Donald Trump was a Democrat !
It ’ s hard to imagine prominent Democrats endorsing such plans today , though doing so could go a long way toward defusing the bad feelings about immigration policy . Compromise with the Trump administration doesn ’ t appear to be on the table ; Democrats seem determined to stick with a hardline on amnesty , without negotiations . But the underappreciated Brookings-Duke report pointed the way toward good policy that could gain broad political acceptance . Clearly , $ 25 billion for a wall might make it tough for willing Democrats to accept Trump ’ s concessions on “ dreamers. ” But how about an “ electronic wall ? ” Let Trump and the Democrats save face—and negotiations actually get to “ yes . ”","There’s little reason to believe that President Trump’s State of the Union immigration proposals will be met with anything but continued Democratic “resistance.” The Democrats’ packing the galleries with so-called dreamers was a signal that Trump’s offer of a “path to citizenship” for 1.8 million of them, a serious concession, hasn’t softened liberal opposition.

Doing this would mean an additional 150,000 visas for workers with coveted skills—and an end to granting preference to newcomers simply because they represented “diversity” or had blood relations here already. (That was then: last night, Democrats hooted and booed President Trump when he proposed to limit this practice, demonstrating how quickly the Left has moved in a radical direction.)

Our report suggested that extended family members should no longer get immigration preference but that spouses and children, as members of nuclear families, still would. Workplace enforcement would lay the foundation for eventual legalization. Even this came with conditions, though. We proposed the launch of a “legalization program requiring unauthorized workers who have been in the country for five or more years to: pay a fine; provide evidence of current employment and a steady work history, payment of taxes, and good moral character; pass a background check; and study English and learn about U.S. history and government.”

The Brookings-Duke report fit within a moderate-Democrat tradition of immigration restriction that has now vanished. Texas congresswoman Barbara Jordan—the first African-American woman elected to Congress from the South—chaired the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, which reported to President Clinton in 1997. Among its consensus conclusions: “Effective policy means enforcement of immigration limits; sponsors are responsible for ensuring that immigrants do not become a burden on the American taxpayer; immigration policy must protect U.S. workers against unfair competition from foreign workers, and a sound immigration policy supports Americanization.” Jordan called out low-skilled immigration as responsible for depressing the wages and employment of African-Americans, a perspective that has now been banished from Democratic dogma as hateful and divisive. The report led Clinton to agree to reduce legal immigration by one-third. All this at a time when Donald Trump was a Democrat!

It’s hard to imagine prominent Democrats endorsing such plans today, though doing so could go a long way toward defusing the bad feelings about immigration policy. Compromise with the Trump administration doesn’t appear to be on the table; Democrats seem determined to stick with a hardline on amnesty, without negotiations. But the underappreciated Brookings-Duke report pointed the way toward good policy that could gain broad political acceptance. Clearly, $25 billion for a wall might make it tough for willing Democrats to accept Trump’s concessions on “dreamers.” But how about an “electronic wall?” Let Trump and the Democrats save face—and negotiations actually get to “yes.”",www.city-journal.org,right,s8C6ufmisfbXiJXp

President Obama has apparently had enough of leading from behind.

During the health-care push, Obama left Congress to its own devices. On immigration, he's doing just the opposite, attempting to prod Republican legislators to the middle by demanding a vote on his own plan.

Obama Confident Immigration Overhaul Passes This Year

The president insisted Tuesday that Congress vote on his plan as soon as possible, barring agreement on something else.

""It's important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place,"" Obama said, referring to a bipartisan Senate bill offered up by the so-called Gang of Eight senators, which looks much more palatable to Republicans than Obama's own plan. ""And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.""

In doing so, Obama dared Congress to say ""no"" to something specific.

A Glossary for Immigration Overhaul

It's the same strategy Obama used in the ""fiscal-cliff"" talks. With a year-end deadline approaching, he pushed Congress to vote on his own plan: to let higher income tax hikes go into effect if lawmakers couldn't cut a deal themselves. Obama asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada to call ""an up-or-down vote"" on that plan, the president announced in a Dec. 28 appearance before cameras at the White House.

""If members of the House or the Senate want to vote 'no,' they can, but we should let everybody vote,"" Obama said then.

Republicans hate such a negotiation tactic. Throughout Obama's White House tenure, GOP aides have griped that the president and congressional Democrats have sought political gain while refusing to negotiate in good faith. On immigration, it's the same.

The Obama plan includes a faster path to citizenship and nothing to trigger border-security enforcement. It would also clear an easier path for same-sex couples.

Before Obama rolled out his immigration plan in Nevada Tuesday, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida raised concerns that the president would launch a ""bidding war.""

In a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh, Rubio dismissed the notion of an up-or-down vote: ""It's going to have to go through committees and people are going to have their input. There's going to be public hearings. I don't want to be part of a process that comes up with some bill in secret and brings it to the floor and gives people a take it or leave it.

""I want this place to work the way it's supposed to work, with every senator having input and the public having input,"" Rubio said.

A Senate Republican aide jabbed, ""The president's been gone from the Senate a long time and perhaps he has forgotten that it's a lot easier to pass legislation if he works with Congress.""

Obama has presented Republicans with a plan they will like much less than what's been crafted by the bipartisan Senate group. The group plan includes triggers to enforce border-security measures, more unmanned drones and no provisions making it easier for same-sex couples seeking to immigrate or naturalize.

Unless other Republicans come up with a plan of their own, the president has given Republicans a choice between the left and the middle. It's not hard to tell which they'd prefer.",www.abcnews.go.com,left,zU0pax7OxjXGyaOs

During a meeting at the White House , Mr. Obama said fixing the nation ’ s immigration system and allowing illegal immigrants to become citizens is “ the right thing to do for safety and security in communities all across America . ”
“ It would allow law enforcement to focus on its primary mission , which is keeping our communities safe , ” Mr. Obama said .
But a report on Monday showed that the Obama administration in 2013 released tens of thousands of criminals awaiting possible deportation , including some accused of murder , sexual assault , arson and kidnapping . A total of 36,007 illegal immigrants who committed nearly 88,000 crimes combined were freed last year while being processed for deportation , according to the report from the Center of Immigration Studies .
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency gathered the statistics in response to a congressional inquiry . Besides violent criminals , ICE released 16,000 illegal immigrants convicted of driving under the influence . The report also showed that ICE released nearly 2,700 illegal immigrants convicted of assault , 1,300 convicted for domestic violence , and nearly 1,300 convicted for battery .
“ These figures call into question President Obama ’ s request to Congress for permission to reduce immigration detention capacity by 10 percent in favor of permission to make wider use of experimental alternatives to detention , ” the report said .
Mr. Obama is seeking the support of law enforcement agencies such as the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs ’ Association in a final push to persuade the Republican-led House to approve immigration reform . The president said there is a “ narrow window ” of time remaining before the midterm election campaigns dominate the political agenda .

“ The immigration system that we have right now makes it harder , not easier , for law enforcement agencies to do their jobs , ” Mr. Obama said . “ It makes it harder for law enforcement to know when dangerous people cross our borders . And it makes it harder for law enforcement to do their jobs when large segments of the community are afraid to report crimes or serve as witnesses because they fear the consequences for themselves or their families . ”
The president said most illegal immigrants “ are not making trouble . ”
House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , has said he wants to coax GOP lawmakers into approving a deal this year on immigration , although some conservatives oppose the so-called amnesty provisions and others say they distrust Mr. Obama ’ s willingness to carry out all of the reforms .
An aide to Mr. Boehner said Tuesday the administration needs to show good faith about enforcing current immigration laws before the system can be reformed .
“ We have a broken immigration system , but it is impossible to make progress until the American people — and their elected representatives — have faith that the president himself will actually enforce the law as written , ” said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel .
The president said House Republicans will be influenced on immigration when they hear from “ unexpected voices ” such as the law enforcement officials .
“ To their credit , I think Speaker Boehner and some of the other leaders there do believe that immigration reform is the right thing , but they ’ ve got to have a political space that allows them to go ahead and get it through their caucus and get it done , ” Mr. Obama said .
The president said he ’ s “ not hell-bent ” on getting every provision of the bipartisan Senate bill that passed in June 2013 , but said the legislation must include “ core principles ” such as addressing companies that are not “ doing the right thing by workers . ”
“ We ’ ve got to have stronger border security , ” Mr. Obama said . “ And we ’ ve got to make sure that there ’ s a way for people to earn some pathway to citizenship . ”","Just a day after the release of a report showing his administration has set free hundreds of illegal immigrants convicted of murder and other serious crimes, President Obama told law enforcement groups Tuesday that an immigration bill with amnesty provisions would make America safer.

Mr. Obama is seeking the support of law enforcement agencies such as the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs’ Association in a final push to persuade the Republican-led House to approve immigration reform. The president said there is a “narrow window” of time remaining before the midterm election campaigns dominate the political agenda.

“The immigration system that we have right now makes it harder, not easier, for law enforcement agencies to do their jobs,” Mr. Obama said. “It makes it harder for law enforcement to know when dangerous people cross our borders. And it makes it harder for law enforcement to do their jobs when large segments of the community are afraid to report crimes or serve as witnesses because they fear the consequences for themselves or their families.”

The president said most illegal immigrants “are not making trouble.”

“Most of them are not causing crimes,” he said.

House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, has said he wants to coax GOP lawmakers into approving a deal this year on immigration, although some conservatives oppose the so-called amnesty provisions and others say they distrust Mr. Obama’s willingness to carry out all of the reforms.

An aide to Mr. Boehner said Tuesday the administration needs to show good faith about enforcing current immigration laws before the system can be reformed.

“We have a broken immigration system, but it is impossible to make progress until the American people — and their elected representatives — have faith that the president himself will actually enforce the law as written,” said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.

The president said House Republicans will be influenced on immigration when they hear from “unexpected voices” such as the law enforcement officials.

“To their credit, I think Speaker Boehner and some of the other leaders there do believe that immigration reform is the right thing, but they’ve got to have a political space that allows them to go ahead and get it through their caucus and get it done,” Mr. Obama said.

The president said he’s “not hell-bent” on getting every provision of the bipartisan Senate bill that passed in June 2013, but said the legislation must include “core principles” such as addressing companies that are not “doing the right thing by workers.”

“We’ve got to have stronger border security,” Mr. Obama said. “And we’ve got to make sure that there’s a way for people to earn some pathway to citizenship.”

Now that the GOP controls all levers of power in Washington the sugar-coated rhetoric employed during Congress ’ last immigration debate is giving way to a raw anti-immigrant stance that critics argue reveals rank hypocrisy and growing nationalistic tendencies in the party .
Jeff Sessions was viewed by many as the loudest anti-immigrant voice in the Senate , but now that he ’ s the new head of the Department of Justice – where he ’ ll be able to wield an extraordinary amount of power over immigration enforcement – there seems to be a new southern sheriff on Capitol Hill .
Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton ( R-Ark . ) is one of the Senate ’ s new breed . The Harvard-educated Iraq and Afghanistan veteran came to the upper chamber after serving in the boisterous House of Representatives and has shown he isn ’ t afraid to throw bombs in the formerly austere Senate .
Cotton ’ s the senator who convinced 46 Republicans to break longstanding protocol and send a letter directly to “ leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran ” that attempted to undercut President Barack Obama ’ s nuclear agreement with the nation .
The 39-year-old is often seen pushing his baby around the Capitol in a stroller , but that ’ s about where his soft side ends . While many in the GOP have been ducking immigration questions since President Donald Trump ’ s botched rollout of his non-Muslim-Muslim-ban , Cotton came out swinging .
The southerner unveiled one of the first immigration proposals in this Congress and it has a distinctly Trumpian tone to it : Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment Act ( or the RAISE Act ) . Its aim is simple : cut legal immigration into America in half over the next decade .
The RAISE Act isn ’ t about keeping illegal immigrants out ; it ’ s about keeping legal immigrants out .
While trying to attract skilled workers , the legislation would end the current preferences for relatives of legal U.S. citizens , like adult parents of U.S. citizens , unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens , adult siblings of U.S. citizens , among other categories .
“ Once you get here , you have a green card and you can open up immigration not just to your immediate family , but your extended family , your village , your clan , your tribe , ” Cotton told reporters this week . “ I don ’ t think it works for American workers . ”
The legislation would also eliminate the 50,000 visas passes out annually through the visa lottery , which receives more applicants from impoverished African nations and war torn countries than from anywhere else in the world . Cotton ’ s also proud the bill would cap America ’ s refugee program at 50,000 permanent residents per year .
“ There ’ s no denying this generation long surge in low skilled immigration has hurt blue collar wages . It ’ s pulling the rug out from underneath them and unless we reverse this trend we ’ re going to create a near permanent underclass for whom the American dream is always just out of reach , ” Cotton continued .
The bill includes a caveat that U.S. citizens could apply for a temporary visa for sick , elderly parents . But , “ the parents are not permitted to work , can not access public benefits , and must be guaranteed support and health insurance by their sponsoring children , ” according to text provided by Cotton ’ s staff .
When a reporter questioned if the bill ’ s intent was to scare potential immigrants away from the United States , Cotton got defensive .
“ I think the premise of your question is looking at it from the wrong way : It looks at it from what ’ s good for the foreigner – not what ’ s good for American citizens , ” Cotton replied . “ I feel for my fellow man , but I serve my fellow citizen . And our current immigration system simply does not serve our citizens very well . ”
This is all new to immigration watchers though . Back in 2011 Cotton , like most Republicans , adhered to that day ’ s conservative rhetorical orthodoxy , at least in public statements on the issue .
“ Finally , amnesty is unjust and immoral because it favors those who broke our laws over those standing in line at embassies hoping to immigrate legally – exactly the kind of immigrants we should want , ” according to Cotton ’ s campaign website during the 2012 campaign cycle ( which was helpfully copied by Project Vote Smart ) .
That ’ s a stark contrast to his new bill to keep low skilled immigrants , refugees and family members of U.S. citizens out of the country . What ’ s changed in the past few years to bring about this evolution ? Critics argue Cotton and others in the GOP have been taken over by the new nationalism that was born out of the ashes of the 2016 election .
“ They say , ‘ We ’ re in jeopardy of losing our identity ’ – our identity as a country which is majority white . That ’ s what they ’ re really talking about and they express it , ” Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D-Ill. ) told The ███ . “ It ’ s part of their xenophobia , it ’ s partly their anti-immigrant and it ’ s showing their real colors . ”
Democrats charge Cotton and others with hypocrisy for the about face , but the senator and his staff disagree .
“ How is it hypocritical ? ” Cotton ’ s communications director , Caroline Rabbitt emailed The ███ . “ There is no contradiction between , on one hand , not wanting to reward illegal immigrants at the expense of legal immigrants , and on the other hand , wanting to reduce the levels of immigration to better fit the needs of our economy . .. [ H ] e ’ s simply prioritizing those immigrants who are coming here to reunite with their nuclear families or contribute to our economy . ”
One of the next items on Republican leaders list is to pay for Trump ’ s roughly $ 15 billion wall between the U.S. and our brown , I mean , southern neighbors . Party leaders have also said they want to invest more money in enhancing the nation ’ s employment verification system , in order to keep undocumented workers from employment .
“ They ’ re going to continue to go piecemeal , but it ’ s all going to be one kind of piecemeal : It ’ s all going to be very aggressive , anti-immigrant enforcement legislation , ” Gutierrez continued before he added the GOP ’ s trying to scare immigrants out of the U.S. “ We have sat down with them in the past – you can not deport your way out of this problem . ”
Components of this new stand alone , America First-immigration reform model have made it into comprehensive immigration reform in the past , but the so-called Gang of Eight also created a new visa category to bring in 200,000 low skilled workers annually .
Many Democrats argue the new GOP tone is sending a chilling message across the globe .
“ To me it ’ s dangerous . We ’ re in a global community and we need to recognize the fact that the risk factors of participating globally are minimal , ” Sen. Ben Cardin ( D-Md . ) told The ███ . “ Where America is deficient , and deficient we are , is we need broad immigration reform . ”

Now that the GOP controls all levers of power in Washington the sugar-coated rhetoric employed during Congress’ last immigration debate is giving way to a raw anti-immigrant stance that critics argue reveals rank hypocrisy and growing nationalistic tendencies in the party.

Jeff Sessions was viewed by many as the loudest anti-immigrant voice in the Senate, but now that he’s the new head of the Department of Justice – where he’ll be able to wield an extraordinary amount of power over immigration enforcement – there seems to be a new southern sheriff on Capitol Hill.

Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is one of the Senate’s new breed. The Harvard-educated Iraq and Afghanistan veteran came to the upper chamber after serving in the boisterous House of Representatives and has shown he isn’t afraid to throw bombs in the formerly austere Senate.

Cotton’s the senator who convinced 46 Republicans to break longstanding protocol and send a letter directly to “leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran” that attempted to undercut President Barack Obama’s nuclear agreement with the nation.

The 39-year-old is often seen pushing his baby around the Capitol in a stroller, but that’s about where his soft side ends. While many in the GOP have been ducking immigration questions since President Donald Trump’s botched rollout of his non-Muslim-Muslim-ban, Cotton came out swinging.

The southerner unveiled one of the first immigration proposals in this Congress and it has a distinctly Trumpian tone to it: Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment Act (or the RAISE Act). Its aim is simple: cut legal immigration into America in half over the next decade.

That’s right.

The RAISE Act isn’t about keeping illegal immigrants out; it’s about keeping legal immigrants out.

While trying to attract skilled workers, the legislation would end the current preferences for relatives of legal U.S. citizens, like adult parents of U.S. citizens, unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens, adult siblings of U.S. citizens, among other categories.

Not so with Sen. Cotton.

Miller,"The Obama administration is concealing key details about its response to the surge of unaccompanied children illegally crossing the southern border , including where the unaccompanied minors are being sheltered and the circumstances under which some are set free inside the U.S .
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill say the lack of information has handicapped their push to pass legislation to gain a handle on the surge — a debate taking place this week in both chambers .
“ We ’ re getting almost no information , and there is all kinds of conflicting information , ” said Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , who for months has been hounding the administration for answers about where unaccompanied minors , who crossed the border without their parents , are detained and released .

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill say the lack of information has handicapped their push to pass legislation to gain a handle on the surge — a debate taking place this week in both chambers.

“We’re getting almost no information, and there is all kinds of conflicting information,” said Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, who for months has been hounding the administration for answers about where unaccompanied minors, who crossed the border without their parents, are detained and released.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook
Just hours before President Trump ’ s third attempt at a travel ban targeting majority-Muslim nations was scheduled to go into effect Wednesday , federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii again shut down the controversial measure .
In Maryland , U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled late Tuesday that the travel ban continues to have the same problems , and violate the same constitutional principles , as previous versions of the ban . Despite tweaks made by the administration , Chuang ruled that it still constituted a “ Muslim ban ” that violates the Constitution ’ s protections against religious discrimination .
Earlier in the day in Hawaii , U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson struck down the ban on different grounds , arguing it violates a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on nationality . Watson said Trump overstepped his legal authority by banning 150 million people from countries targeted in the ban , and that the law does not give him “ unbridled discretion to do as he pleases . ”
The two rulings combined provide opponents of the ban with multiple legal attacks as the cases make their way through the appeals process .
“ They demonstrate the breathe of legal problems that the administration is facing as it tries again and again to impose the ban , ” said Omar Jadwat , an ACLU attorney involved in the Maryland case . “ They really undermine how any way you look at it , they lose . ”
The White House insists that will not be the case . Both judges who ruled Tuesday were appointed by former president Barack Obama . And for all the legal wrangling over the travel ban during the past nine months , the Supreme Court has not yet fully weighed in .
When it does , the high court will have Trump ’ s nominee — Justice Neil Gorsuch — on the bench , meaning the more conservative court could end up saving the travel ban for Trump .
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that she was , “ confident that the judiciary will ultimately uphold the president ’ s lawful and necessary action and swiftly restore its vital protections for the safety of the American people . ”
At issue is Trump 's third attempt to implement a travel ban set to begin Wednesday . The ban would block specific travelers from five of the original nations cited in Trump 's first ban issued in January — Iran , Libya , Somalia , Syria and Yemen — along with Chad , North Korea and Venezuela .
Iraq and Sudan were subtracted from the list in March and September , respectively .
Watson , issuing a nationwide block against the travel ban , said the measure was `` simultaneously overbroad and underinclusive '' because it targets entire countries rather than dangerous individuals . Watson ruled the new ban fails to show that nationality alone makes a person a greater security risk to the U.S .
“ The categorical restrictions on entire populations of men , women and children , based upon nationality , are a poor fit for the issues regarding the sharing of ‘ public-safety and terrorism-related information ’ that the president identifies , ” Watson wrote .

Chuang 's ruling was more limited . It prohibits the administration from enforcing the ban against people who can prove they have a `` bona fide '' — or good faith — relationship with U.S. persons or entities , such as businesses or universities .

immigration,The Daily Caller,2,http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/02/the-legal-system-is-failing-america-when-it-comes-to-immigration/,The Legal System Is Failing America When It Comes To Immigration,2017-12-02,,"The illegal immigrant who fired the gun shot that killed Kate Steinle was able to beat a murder charge this week .
Jose Garcia Zarate , a five-time deportee from Mexico and convicted felon , walked away with only a gun conviction after his legal team convinced the jury their client accidentally fired a gun three times and had no intent of killing anyone . ( RELATED : Jury Finds Illegal Immigrant NOT GUILTY In Kate Steinle Murder )
The Steinle case has attracted national attention ever since her murder occurred in 2015 in the sanctuary city of San Francisco . The murder became the focal point in the debate over illegal immigration , showing the dangers of sanctuary city policies and how America can ’ t secure its borders from convicted felons with multiple deportations .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump highlighted the murder several times on the campaign trail for why America needs to get tough on illegal immigration and eliminate sanctuary city policies .
There was always a political element to the case , and that comes into play as to why a San Francisco jury sought fit to let Zarate go free without even an involuntary manslaughter charge .
The prosecution team does warrant some of the blame for why that occurred . As RedState ’ s Sarah Rumpf argued , prosecutorial overreach trying to get a harder to prove first-degree murder charge bears some responsibility for the exoneration of Zarate for Kate ’ s killing .
However , that factor can ’ t be solely responsible for the not guilty verdict for an illegal immigrant who somehow accidentally fired off a gun three times with no malicious intent in mind .
San Francisco is a very liberal area and jury selection , according to Zarate ’ s defense team , was ensured to better benefit their client .
“ We are very pleased with the jury , ” said Matt Gonzalez , the lead defense lawyer for Zarate , upon the completion of jury selection . “ We have such great diversity built in in San Francisco and I think we have a jury that understands a lot of the concerns about the defendant receiving a fair trial . ”
That diversity was reflected in the jury consisting of three immigrants , at least one of whom ’ s primary language was Spanish . Potential jurors were quizzed about their thoughts on immigration , Latinos , guns and crime when being taken into consideration .
Gonzalez also asked them how they would be fine with a verdict that came out contrary to President Trump ’ s wishes .
While the judge presiding over the case urged the jury to leave aside their opinions on immigration and guns and focus on the facts , it was always hard for this case to escape from politics .
Juries don ’ t always make the right decision , as anyone who is still upset by O.J . Simpson walking free can attest . The Steinle case seems to be emblematic for how America ’ s legal system seems incapable of adequately dealing with immigration issues .
Zarate should ’ ve never been in the country to begin with , yet a San Francisco prison let him go free while under a sixth deportation order three months before Steinle ’ s murder . All thanks to sanctuary city policies .
And this isn ’ t the only case where the legal system failed to find justice for illegal immigrant crime .

Follow Scott on Twitter and buy his new book , “ No Campus for White Men . ”","The illegal immigrant who fired the gun shot that killed Kate Steinle was able to beat a murder charge this week.

Jose Garcia Zarate, a five-time deportee from Mexico and convicted felon, walked away with only a gun conviction after his legal team convinced the jury their client accidentally fired a gun three times and had no intent of killing anyone. (RELATED: Jury Finds Illegal Immigrant NOT GUILTY In Kate Steinle Murder)

The Steinle case has attracted national attention ever since her murder occurred in 2015 in the sanctuary city of San Francisco. The murder became the focal point in the debate over illegal immigration, showing the dangers of sanctuary city policies and how America can’t secure its borders from convicted felons with multiple deportations.

Presidential candidate Donald Trump highlighted the murder several times on the campaign trail for why America needs to get tough on illegal immigration and eliminate sanctuary city policies.

There was always a political element to the case, and that comes into play as to why a San Francisco jury sought fit to let Zarate go free without even an involuntary manslaughter charge.

The prosecution team does warrant some of the blame for why that occurred. As RedState’s Sarah Rumpf argued, prosecutorial overreach trying to get a harder to prove first-degree murder charge bears some responsibility for the exoneration of Zarate for Kate’s killing.

However, that factor can’t be solely responsible for the not guilty verdict for an illegal immigrant who somehow accidentally fired off a gun three times with no malicious intent in mind.

San Francisco is a very liberal area and jury selection, according to Zarate’s defense team, was ensured to better benefit their client.

“We are very pleased with the jury,” said Matt Gonzalez, the lead defense lawyer for Zarate, upon the completion of jury selection. “We have such great diversity built in in San Francisco and I think we have a jury that understands a lot of the concerns about the defendant receiving a fair trial.”

That diversity was reflected in the jury consisting of three immigrants, at least one of whom’s primary language was Spanish. Potential jurors were quizzed about their thoughts on immigration, Latinos, guns and crime when being taken into consideration.

Gonzalez also asked them how they would be fine with a verdict that came out contrary to President Trump’s wishes.

While the judge presiding over the case urged the jury to leave aside their opinions on immigration and guns and focus on the facts, it was always hard for this case to escape from politics.

Juries don’t always make the right decision, as anyone who is still upset by O.J. Simpson walking free can attest. The Steinle case seems to be emblematic for how America’s legal system seems incapable of adequately dealing with immigration issues.

Zarate should’ve never been in the country to begin with, yet a San Francisco prison let him go free while under a sixth deportation order three months before Steinle’s murder. All thanks to sanctuary city policies.

And this isn’t the only case where the legal system failed to find justice for illegal immigrant crime.

In October, a Texas woman who lost her husband and two children to a car crash caused by an illegal immigrant expressed outrage that the man responsible only received a two-year sentence for the crime.

In May, an Oregon circuit court overturned the conviction for an illegal immigrant who ran over and killed two girls playing in a leaf pile. The court bought the driver’s story that she didn’t realize she ran over anything as she drove away from the scene of the killing.

That reversed conviction was not for vehicular homicide, but for the driver being found guilty of failing to perform her duties as a driver. The courts also managed to dismiss her deportation case over the incident.

There’s also the example of San Francisco feeling embolden to continue to defend their sanctuary city policies, which give protection to illegal immigrants from deportation, after the Steinle verdict. A convicted felon who will apparently fire off guns without thinking isn’t exactly the poster boy you want for your policies, but San Fran seems comfortable with that association.

Then again, the city should feel emboldened by how the courts continue to strike down the immigration orders of the president.

Even more important than the individual cases of leniency given to illegal immigrant criminals is how the courts are presently shaping our country’s immigration policy.

The White House has sought to punish jurisdictions that refuse to follow federal immigration law, yet courts have blocked the administration’s attempt to do so.

Even more expansive than these court arguments on sanctuary cities is the legal system’s opinion on who the government can bar from entry into the country.

Increasingly, the courts have inched towards the opinion that the federal government cannot restrict immigration from any part of the world. The various versions of Trump’s travel ban have been knocked down by the courts for the alleged reason they discriminate on the basis “of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.”

There are obvious ways like building a wall and streamlining the deportation process. But there are more, less obvious ways, too. Here are some suggestions.

We can incentivize Mexico to care.

Mexico doesn’t care that tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of illegal aliens march through their country on the way to the US every year, and they really have no reason to. If they were stopping in Mexico they’d be tossed out like yesterday’s garbage, as Mexico actually enforces its immigration laws.

We can tax that. Hell, we can stop it. That would get the government’s attention and help prevent the invaders from receiving a 1700 mile police escort.

We can punish people who hire them.

Voters have to make them care. Voters also have to make squishy Republicans care.

End birthright citizenship.

Your geography of birth should have nothing to do with citizenship, and it was never meant to. Liberals bastardized our laws to create this mess, it’s time to fix it. It may sound heartless, but I don’t care. I care about Americans first and anyone else a distant second.

Services Costs : They reduce the cost of services , thereby increasing the purchasing power of U.S. consumers .
The two most common concerns over low-skilled immigration—that it burdens government finances and decreases native wages—are of limited importance . The impact of low-skilled immigration on the federal budget is small , although some state and local governments do face a greater fiscal burden.1 Similarly , while low-skilled immigration does benefit skilled workers and owners of capital and can hurt low-skilled workers , most studies find that the impact is small , particularly over the long term . Evidence suggests that even the sharp rise in low-skilled immigration over the past 20 years has had a surprisingly small impact on the wages of native , low-skilled workers.2 This is for two principal reasons : low-skilled immigration attracts investment in industries that use low-skilled labor , thus increasing demand for these workers ; 3 and the rising educational levels of the workforce means that few native workers compete directly with low-skilled immigrants.4,5
It is possible to have legal low-skilled immigration ; the benefits of low-skilled immigration need not come with the costs of illegal immigration , which are significant .
There are perhaps 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States , and the number of undocumented workers is probably more than 8 million . Some 60 percent of illegal immigrants live in six states , where their share of the population is about 6 percent on average , compared to less than 3 percent in the rest of the United States .
Like low-skilled immigration in general , illegal immigration generates economic benefits for native Americans . However , illegal immigration also imposes significant costs :
Legal System : Perhaps the most serious cost of illegal immigration concerns the quality of our society rather than economics . Illegal immigrants are often hesitant to cooperate with law enforcement , which increases their own vulnerability and makes it difficult for the police to obtain necessary information . The failure to enforce immigration laws erodes respect for the legal system , encouraging vigilantism and violence against ethnic minorities . The presence of large numbers of people who live outside the law ’ s protection and have little long-term stake in the country erodes the social contract and impedes the cooperation required to establish safe and vibrant communities . And some efforts to address illegal immigration threaten the civil liberties that Americans view as their birthright .

Working Conditions : Undocumented workers are limited in their ability to organize to protect their rights , which may erode working conditions for American workers in general through competition ( though some employers benefit from this ) .

Wage Competition : Undocumented status can intensify wage competition because some illegal immigrants ( and their employers ) do not pay taxes on wages . Moreover , their vulnerable position may cause illegal immigrants to accept lower wages 6 —again , some employers and U.S. households benefit from this .

Budget : Illegal immigration may have a positive impact on the federal budget , as some undocumented workers do pay taxes but don ’ t enjoy the same access to services as natives.7 However , illegal immigrants can impose a fiscal burden on states and municipalities , which are required to provide some services to all residents , regardless of their immigration status.8
Recognizing the economic value of low-skilled immigration and the large economic and social costs of illegal immigration provides a useful guide to policies :
Upgrade Skills : Concerns over low , or declining , low-skilled wage rates should be addressed by providing training and education ( perhaps financed through taxes on firms or richer workers who benefit from low-skilled immigration ) , rather than through hopes of a radical reduction in the number of low-skilled immigrants .

Regularize Illegal Immigrants : The number of illegal immigrants should be reduced by regularizing their status , thus improving their welfare and that of American households in general . 9 Depending on the take-up of regularization programs , there may be scope for increasing low-skilled immigration .
The number of illegal immigrants should be reduced by regularizing their status , thus improving their welfare and that of American households in general . Depending on the take-up of regularization programs , there may be scope for increasing low-skilled immigration .
Enforce Immigration Policy : Measures to improve the enforcement of immigration laws should avoid exacerbating the social cost of illegal immigration by attempting to arrest individual immigrants , which degrades our civil liberties , increases the vulnerability of immigrant communities , and reduces their willingness to cooperate with the police . Instead , illegal immigration should be reduced by compelling large employers to check documents , as well as imposing significant fines for violations and devising efficient but minimally-obtrusive schemes for policing these efforts .
Arizona ’ s recent law—which imposes jail sentences on illegal immigrants ( while entering the United States illegally and harboring illegal immigrants is a federal crime , residing illegally in the United States is generally treated as a civil offense ) and requires that police check immigration documents—will be damaging and counterproductive .
Though concern over illegal immigration in Arizona is doubtless the result of the high share of illegal immigrants in the state ’ s population ( the highest in the United States ) , the new law is unlikely to have much impact on the level of illegal immigration , as many immigrants take much greater risks than police harassment or even jail terms to travel to the United States.10 These measures could , however , substantially reduce immigrants ’ willingness to cooperate with the police and subject the native Hispanic population to document checks that would further inflame ethnic tensions . Since about 30 percent of Arizona ’ s population is Hispanic , the potential for social conflict is great .
Nevertheless , this law highlights how the failure of federal policy increases the potential for ill-conceived state decisions , perhaps giving impetus to more sensible solutions at the national level .
The proposal to reinterpret the fourteenth amendment to exclude children of illegal immigrants from citizenship is another dead end . Refusing to educate or provide health care to children who could become long-term members of American society would be stupid and brutal , as would be deporting children or adults who grew up in the United States to foreign countries that they have never seen . In addition , such measures would have only a limited impact on the level of illegal immigration , since wage differentials are sufficient incentive for migration .
Illegal immigration is inevitably a difficult and divisive issue , given its distributional implications and the infections of racism and xenophobia . At a minimum , we should reject policies that would make a bad situation worse .
William Shaw is a visiting scholar in Carnegie ’ s International Economics Program .
1 . Most studies find that tax revenues from both legal and illegal immigrants exceed the cost of services provided to them . For a more somber view of the budgetary implications of illegal immigrants , most of whom are low-skilled , see Camarota ( 2004 ) .
2 . See Card ( 2005 ) for a summary of the literature from the dominant view that the impact of low-skilled immigration on the wages of native low-skilled workers is small , and Borjas ( 2003 ) for the higher estimates of this effect .
3 . For example , Ottaviano and Peri ( 2008 ) find that the least-educated native workers suffered a loss of only 1.1 percent of real wages due to immigration over 1990–2004 , lower than the estimates from Borjas ( 2003 ) because they account for increased investment in response to immigration .
4 . Only about 8 percent of native Americans in ages 25–64 lack a high school diploma , while many low-skilled immigrants have little schooling and speak little English . The supply of low-skilled native workers is further reduced by those who are unsuited or unwilling to work , for example due to drug addiction .
5 . It is possible that a sharp reduction in low-skilled immigration could assist low-skilled native workers by improving incentives for businesses and the government to invest in education , training , and rehabilitation , but it would also encourage automation , which would limit the increased demand for low-skilled workers .
6 . Controlling for observable skills , legalization through the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act raised wages by 6 percent compared to wage levels if workers had remained undocumented . ( Kossoudji and Cobb-Clark 2002 ) . Legalization also improved incentives for learning skills that further boosted wages . Rivera-Batiz ( 1999 ) finds that observable characteristics accounted for less than half of the substantial difference between the wages of legal and illegal immigrants . However , Duncan and Trejo ( 2009 ) conclude that labor market skills are much more important than legal status in determining immigrants ’ wages .
7 . Estimates of the share of illegal immigrants that pay federal , state , and local taxes range between 50 and 75 percent ( CBO 2007 ) . Illegal immigrants are not eligible for most federal safety net programs . And some illegal immigrants pay into social security ( they provided fake social security numbers as proof of citizenship to employers ) but will never collect benefits .
8 . For example , the Supreme Court has determined that children can not be excluded from public education due to their immigration status . There are about 2 million school-age children who are unauthorized immigrants , and 3 million school-age children are U.S. citizens born to illegal immigrants ( Urban Institute 2006 ) . Together , these groups constitute about 9 percent of school-age children . Other unavoidable costs from illegal immigrants include emergency health care ( since 59 percent of adult illegal immigrants lack health insurance—Passel 2009 ) and law enforcement .
9 . Dixon and Rimmer ( 2009 ) find that legalization coupled with a tax on visas could generate $ 180 billion in welfare gains for U.S. households . As part of ongoing research that is still subject to revision , Aguiar and Walmsley ( forthcoming ) estimate that legalization of undocumented Mexican workers in the United States coupled with effective border controls would raise U.S. GDP by 0.17 percent .
10 . For example , since the tightening of border security in 1994 , an estimated 5,600 people have died in the wasteland that straddles part of the U.S./Mexican border ( Jiminez 2009 ) .","Illegal low-skilled immigration is a heartrending problem: workers whose very presence violates the law are deeply woven into the fabric of American society and the performance of essential tasks.

Low-Skilled Immigration Largely Benefits the U.S. Economy

Any approach to sensible policies should begin by distinguishing between low-skilled immigration and illegal immigration. The effects of the two differ in important ways.



Low-skilled immigrants benefit the U.S. economy:

Productivity: They increase the productivity of skilled workers and the stock of machines and buildings by carrying out essential tasks, and they further increase the productivity of American workers, including working parents, by freeing up their time. They also enable the productive use of agricultural land that would be unprofitable to exploit in the absence of immigration.

The two most common concerns over low-skilled immigration—that it burdens government finances and decreases native wages—are of limited importance. The impact of low-skilled immigration on the federal budget is small, although some state and local governments do face a greater fiscal burden.1 Similarly, while low-skilled immigration does benefit skilled workers and owners of capital and can hurt low-skilled workers, most studies find that the impact is small, particularly over the long term.

Illegal Immigration’s Many Costs

It is possible to have legal low-skilled immigration; the benefits of low-skilled immigration need not come with the costs of illegal immigration, which are significant.



There are perhaps 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States, and the number of undocumented workers is probably more than 8 million. Some 60 percent of illegal immigrants live in six states, where their share of the population is about 6 percent on average, compared to less than 3 percent in the rest of the United States.

Like low-skilled immigration in general, illegal immigration generates economic benefits for native Americans. However, illegal immigration also imposes significant costs:

Legal System: Perhaps the most serious cost of illegal immigration concerns the quality of our society rather than economics. Illegal immigrants are often hesitant to cooperate with law enforcement, which increases their own vulnerability and makes it difficult for the police to obtain necessary information. The failure to enforce immigration laws erodes respect for the legal system, encouraging vigilantism and violence against ethnic minorities. The presence of large numbers of people who live outside the law’s protection and have little long-term stake in the country erodes the social contract and impedes the cooperation required to establish safe and vibrant communities. And some efforts to address illegal immigration threaten the civil liberties that Americans view as their birthright.

Working Conditions: Undocumented workers are limited in their ability to organize to protect their rights, which may erode working conditions for American workers in general through competition (though some employers benefit from this).

Wage Competition: Undocumented status can intensify wage competition because some illegal immigrants (and their employers) do not pay taxes on wages. Moreover, their vulnerable position may cause illegal immigrants to accept lower wages 6 —again, some employers and U.S. households benefit from this.

Budget: Illegal immigration may have a positive impact on the federal budget, as some undocumented workers do pay taxes but don’t enjoy the same access to services as natives.7 However, illegal immigrants can impose a fiscal burden on states and municipalities, which are required to provide some services to all residents, regardless of their immigration status.8

Policy Must Change

Recognizing the economic value of low-skilled immigration and the large economic and social costs of illegal immigration provides a useful guide to policies:

Upgrade Skills: Concerns over low, or declining, low-skilled wage rates should be addressed by providing training and education (perhaps financed through taxes on firms or richer workers who benefit from low-skilled immigration), rather than through hopes of a radical reduction in the number of low-skilled immigrants.

Regularize Illegal Immigrants: The number of illegal immigrants should be reduced by regularizing their status, thus improving their welfare and that of American households in general. 9 Depending on the take-up of regularization programs, there may be scope for increasing low-skilled immigration.

Enforce Immigration Policy: Measures to improve the enforcement of immigration laws should avoid exacerbating the social cost of illegal immigration by attempting to arrest individual immigrants, which degrades our civil liberties, increases the vulnerability of immigrant communities, and reduces their willingness to cooperate with the police. Instead, illegal immigration should be reduced by compelling large employers to check documents, as well as imposing significant fines for violations and devising efficient but minimally-obtrusive schemes for policing these efforts.

The Arizona Law is Misguided

Arizona’s recent law—which imposes jail sentences on illegal immigrants (while entering the United States illegally and harboring illegal immigrants is a federal crime, residing illegally in the United States is generally treated as a civil offense) and requires that police check immigration documents—will be damaging and counterproductive.



Though concern over illegal immigration in Arizona is doubtless the result of the high share of illegal immigrants in the state’s population (the highest in the United States), the new law is unlikely to have much impact on the level of illegal immigration, as many immigrants take much greater risks than police harassment or even jail terms to travel to the United States.10 These measures could, however, substantially reduce immigrants’ willingness to cooperate with the police and subject the native Hispanic population to document checks that would further inflame ethnic tensions. Since about 30 percent of Arizona’s population is Hispanic, the potential for social conflict is great.

Arizona's recent law will be damaging and counterproductive.

Nevertheless, this law highlights how the failure of federal policy increases the potential for ill-conceived state decisions, perhaps giving impetus to more sensible solutions at the national level.



The proposal to reinterpret the fourteenth amendment to exclude children of illegal immigrants from citizenship is another dead end. Refusing to educate or provide health care to children who could become long-term members of American society would be stupid and brutal, as would be deporting children or adults who grew up in the United States to foreign countries that they have never seen. In addition, such measures would have only a limited impact on the level of illegal immigration, since wage differentials are sufficient incentive for migration.



Illegal immigration is inevitably a difficult and divisive issue, given its distributional implications and the infections of racism and xenophobia. At a minimum, we should reject policies that would make a bad situation worse.

William Shaw is a visiting scholar in Carnegie’s International Economics Program.

1. Most studies find that tax revenues from both legal and illegal immigrants exceed the cost of services provided to them. For a more somber view of the budgetary implications of illegal immigrants, most of whom are low-skilled, see Camarota (2004).

2. See Card (2005) for a summary of the literature from the dominant view that the impact of low-skilled immigration on the wages of native low-skilled workers is small, and Borjas (2003) for the higher estimates of this effect.

3. For example, Ottaviano and Peri (2008) find that the least-educated native workers suffered a loss of only 1.1 percent of real wages due to immigration over 1990–2004, lower than the estimates from Borjas (2003) because they account for increased investment in response to immigration.

4. Only about 8 percent of native Americans in ages 25–64 lack a high school diploma, while many low-skilled immigrants have little schooling and speak little English. The supply of low-skilled native workers is further reduced by those who are unsuited or unwilling to work, for example due to drug addiction.

5. It is possible that a sharp reduction in low-skilled immigration could assist low-skilled native workers by improving incentives for businesses and the government to invest in education, training, and rehabilitation, but it would also encourage automation, which would limit the increased demand for low-skilled workers.

6. Controlling for observable skills, legalization through the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act raised wages by 6 percent compared to wage levels if workers had remained undocumented. (Kossoudji and Cobb-Clark 2002). Legalization also improved incentives for learning skills that further boosted wages. Rivera-Batiz (1999) finds that observable characteristics accounted for less than half of the substantial difference between the wages of legal and illegal immigrants. However, Duncan and Trejo (2009) conclude that labor market skills are much more important than legal status in determining immigrants’ wages.

7. Estimates of the share of illegal immigrants that pay federal, state, and local taxes range between 50 and 75 percent (CBO 2007). Illegal immigrants are not eligible for most federal safety net programs. And some illegal immigrants pay into social security (they provided fake social security numbers as proof of citizenship to employers) but will never collect benefits.

8. For example, the Supreme Court has determined that children cannot be excluded from public education due to their immigration status. There are about 2 million school-age children who are unauthorized immigrants, and 3 million school-age children are U.S. citizens born to illegal immigrants (Urban Institute 2006). Together, these groups constitute about 9 percent of school-age children. Other unavoidable costs from illegal immigrants include emergency health care (since 59 percent of adult illegal immigrants lack health insurance—Passel 2009) and law enforcement.

9. Dixon and Rimmer (2009) find that legalization coupled with a tax on visas could generate $180 billion in welfare gains for U.S. households. As part of ongoing research that is still subject to revision, Aguiar and Walmsley (forthcoming) estimate that legalization of undocumented Mexican workers in the United States coupled with effective border controls would raise U.S. GDP by 0.17 percent.

10. For example, since the tightening of border security in 1994, an estimated 5,600 people have died in the wasteland that straddles part of the U.S./Mexican border (Jiminez 2009).",www.carnegieendowment.org,center,MbUxZPLIh8JDUVxg

In the GOP-controlled House , some Democrats , largely from conservative-leaning districts , are set to bolster the ranks of Republican lawmakers skeptical of the Senate 's ideas on immigration . As a small faction within the minority party , they wo n't likely sway key votes , but amid signs that momentum behind the effort might be flagging , their concerns could put the finish line further out of reach .
Like many of their GOP counterparts , hesitant House Democrats worry about how to handle the 11 million illegal immigrants already living in the U.S .
`` I 'm opposed to granting amnesty , '' said Rep. Nick Rahall , a Democrat from West Virginia , whose grandparents legally emigrated to the U.S. from Lebanon . Creating a separate way this group can gain citizenship `` would siphon scarce resources away from our already-overwhelmed immigration system and would be unfair to those other immigrants , past and present , who have dutifully waited for their turn to legally enter our country , '' he said .
Some House Democrats fret that any new immigration laws could repeat what they consider the mistakes of a 1986 law that legalized many illegal immigrants and included measures to stop illegal crossings .
`` I want to be certain that it 's not 1986 all over again , '' said Rep. Daniel Lipinski , a Democrat from Illinois , who said he 's concerned some lawmakers might be willing in future negotiations to roll back the provisions to beef up border security , which were added to the Senate bill in a bid to win GOP support . `` I have concerns about if the federal government will be serious about enforcing immigration law in the future , '' he said .
The exact number of resistant or fence-sitting House Democrats on immigration is hard to determine . Like many Republicans , some centrist Democrats are reluctant to stake out a firm position before the House strategy is set . House leaders have yet to unveil a bill tackling the issue of legalization , though senior GOP lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation this fall that could include granting citizenship to at least a portion of the population .
`` I 'm going to wait and see what they come up with and then I 'll decide , ' said Rep. Collin Peterson ( D. , Minn. ) , who said Congress needs to come up with a plan to `` regularize '' immigrants in some fashion . `` We 're not going to deport them . ''
The ranks of centrist Democrats in the House have thinned in recent years . The fiscally conservative coalition of Blue Dog Democrats , which played a major role in the health-care debate , has shrunk to just 15 lawmakers , compared with 54 before the 2010 election . Advocates of a broad immigration overhaul , including a new path to citizenship , are targeting the remaining Blue Dogs and the New Democrats , a House coalition of self-described moderate lawmakers .
Earlier this month , 39 of the New Democrats ' 53 lawmakers wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner ( R. , Ohio ) , urging him to introduce an immigration bill before the end of September that includes a pathway to citizenship . But some of the group 's members , including Rep. John Barrow , a conservative Democrat from Georgia who did n't sign the letter , may still need convincing .
Any such discussion should n't begin until employer-verification programs and border security have been strengthened , Mr. Barrow said . `` Like a preacher friend of mine once said , the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing , '' he said .
Advocates on both sides of the debate predict Democrats in swing districts will have a tough time embracing any immigration bill unless Republicans first come out in support . Some House Democrats have said their constituents are wary of broad immigration overhaul .
Centrist Democratic think tank Third Way recently targeted Democratic waverers in a memo offering suggestions for what to say if they shift on the issue , including emphasizing the economic effects of an immigration overhaul and the Senate bill 's strengthening of border security .
Roy Beck , president of Numbers USA , an organization favoring tough immigration curbs , sees a tougher road ahead . `` Any Democrat in a district that Romney carried is going to really have a reason to vote against this , '' he said .","WASHINGTON—Every Democrat voted for the Senate's immigration bill when it passed the chamber in June.

""I'm opposed to granting amnesty,"" said Rep. Nick Rahall, a Democrat from West Virginia, whose grandparents legally emigrated to the U.S. from Lebanon. Creating a separate way this group can gain citizenship ""would siphon scarce resources away from our already-overwhelmed immigration system and would be unfair to those other immigrants, past and present, who have dutifully waited for their turn to legally enter our country,"" he said.

Some House Democrats fret that any new immigration laws could repeat what they consider the mistakes of a 1986 law that legalized many illegal immigrants and included measures to stop illegal crossings.

""I want to be certain that it's not 1986 all over again,"" said Rep. Daniel Lipinski, a Democrat from Illinois, who said he's concerned some lawmakers might be willing in future negotiations to roll back the provisions to beef up border security, which were added to the Senate bill in a bid to win GOP support. ""I have concerns about if the federal government will be serious about enforcing immigration law in the future,"" he said.

The exact number of resistant or fence-sitting House Democrats on immigration is hard to determine. Like many Republicans, some centrist Democrats are reluctant to stake out a firm position before the House strategy is set. House leaders have yet to unveil a bill tackling the issue of legalization, though senior GOP lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation this fall that could include granting citizenship to at least a portion of the population.

""I'm going to wait and see what they come up with and then I'll decide,' said Rep. Collin Peterson (D., Minn.), who said Congress needs to come up with a plan to ""regularize"" immigrants in some fashion. ""We're not going to deport them.""

The ranks of centrist Democrats in the House have thinned in recent years. The fiscally conservative coalition of Blue Dog Democrats, which played a major role in the health-care debate, has shrunk to just 15 lawmakers, compared with 54 before the 2010 election. Advocates of a broad immigration overhaul, including a new path to citizenship, are targeting the remaining Blue Dogs and the New Democrats, a House coalition of self-described moderate lawmakers.

Earlier this month, 39 of the New Democrats' 53 lawmakers wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio), urging him to introduce an immigration bill before the end of September that includes a pathway to citizenship. But some of the group's members, including Rep. John Barrow, a conservative Democrat from Georgia who didn't sign the letter, may still need convincing.

Any such discussion shouldn't begin until employer-verification programs and border security have been strengthened, Mr. Barrow said. ""Like a preacher friend of mine once said, the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing,"" he said.

Advocates on both sides of the debate predict Democrats in swing districts will have a tough time embracing any immigration bill unless Republicans first come out in support. Some House Democrats have said their constituents are wary of broad immigration overhaul.

Centrist Democratic think tank Third Way recently targeted Democratic waverers in a memo offering suggestions for what to say if they shift on the issue, including emphasizing the economic effects of an immigration overhaul and the Senate bill's strengthening of border security.

Roy Beck, president of Numbers USA, an organization favoring tough immigration curbs, sees a tougher road ahead. ""Any Democrat in a district that Romney carried is going to really have a reason to vote against this,"" he said.

Washington (CNN) - An emerging immigration compromise in the House differs sharply from the measure passed by the Senate this week by making it harder for undocumented immigrants to get on a path to citizenship.

Members of the bipartisan House group negotiating the bill would require that border security measures are in place before any process toward eventual citizenship could begin.

According to text of the rule set to publish in the Federal Register on Tuesday , asylum seekers who pass through another country before reaching the United States will be ineligible for asylum when they reach the southern border .
The move marks an acceleration in the Trump administration ’ s efforts to reduce the number of migrants crossing the U.S. border with Mexico and has the potential to considerably reduce the number of asylum claims .
The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice announced the Interim Final Rule ( IFR ) in a joint statement Monday .
“ The Departments are amending their respective regulations to provide that , with limited exceptions , an alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States across the southern border after failing to apply for protection in a third country outside the alien ’ s country of citizenship , nationality , or last lawful habitual residence through which the alien transited en route to the United States is ineligible for asylum , ” states the text of the rule .
Under the rule , those who have been the victims of trafficking are granted exceptions . The rule also allows exceptions for migrants passing through countries that have not signed major international refugee treaties and for migrants who have been denied asylum in the countries they traveled through .
Trump administration officials described it as necessary to reduce the burden placed on the U.S. by the growing number of immigrants seeking asylum at the southern border by allowing agencies to more quickly process cases by weeding out individuals trying to “ exploit ” the asylum protections .
“ The United States is a generous country but is being completely overwhelmed by the burdens associated with apprehending and processing hundreds of thousands of aliens along the southern border , ” Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrOcasio-Cortez blasts McCarthy as a 'bumbling , sloppy , dishonest mess ' over Trump defense Giuliani says he 's received subpoena 'signed only by Democrat Chairs who have prejudged this case ' DOJ says Trump contacted foreign countries to assist Barr 's Russia inquiry MORE said in a statement .

According to text of the rule set to publish in the Federal Register on Tuesday, asylum seekers who pass through another country before reaching the United States will be ineligible for asylum when they reach the southern border.

The move marks an acceleration in the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the number of migrants crossing the U.S. border with Mexico and has the potential to considerably reduce the number of asylum claims.

The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice announced the Interim Final Rule (IFR) in a joint statement Monday.

“The Departments are amending their respective regulations to provide that, with limited exceptions, an alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States across the southern border after failing to apply for protection in a third country outside the alien’s country of citizenship, nationality, or last lawful habitual residence through which the alien transited en route to the United States is ineligible for asylum,” states the text of the rule.

Under the rule, those who have been the victims of trafficking are granted exceptions. The rule also allows exceptions for migrants passing through countries that have not signed major international refugee treaties and for migrants who have been denied asylum in the countries they traveled through.

Trump administration officials described it as necessary to reduce the burden placed on the U.S. by the growing number of immigrants seeking asylum at the southern border by allowing agencies to more quickly process cases by weeding out individuals trying to “exploit” the asylum protections.

“The United States is a generous country but is being completely overwhelmed by the burdens associated with apprehending and processing hundreds of thousands of aliens along the southern border,” Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrOcasio-Cortez blasts McCarthy as a 'bumbling, sloppy, dishonest mess' over Trump defense Giuliani says he's received subpoena 'signed only by Democrat Chairs who have prejudged this case' DOJ says Trump contacted foreign countries to assist Barr's Russia inquiry MORE said in a statement.

With his border wall , where the Supreme Court has cleared the way to begin construction under his emergency declaration , and negotiations with Latin American neighbors , Mr. Trump in the past weeks has finally begun to make headway on a number of major items on his immigration checklist .
The court and foreign policy victories were coupled with some policy moves within the administration that could further constrain the surge of migrants , including guidance issued Friday telling asylum officers to make sure migrants are fleeing state-sanctioned violence before they are granted asylum .
“ The Trump administration is trying to throw everything it can at this problem , ” said Jessica Vaughan , policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies .
The big moves last week included an agreement signed with Guatemala that will allow the U.S. to send any asylum-seekers who cross that country ’ s territory en route to the U.S. back to Guatemala to ask for asylum there instead .
Given Guatemala ’ s strategic geographic location — it lies on Mexico ’ s southern border , and land travelers must cross it during their journey north — the agreement could allow the U.S. to deny tens of thousands of asylum-seekers the chance to ask for status before they reach the border .
“ We ’ ve long been working with Guatemala , and now we can do it the right way , ” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office after signing the deal with Guatemalan Interior Minister Enrique Degenhart .
Hours later , the president received news of another win : The Supreme Court , in a 5-4 ruling , had cleared the way for him to use his emergency border declaration to use Pentagon money to build more of his wall .
The Republican-appointed justices ended a lower-court blockade of his budgeting moves , limits that a federal district judge in California and later an appeals court had imposed while the case was being argued on the merits .
The high court didn ’ t reveal its reasoning , but the ruling is a major victory at a crucial time .
Mr. Trump ’ s attorneys told the justices they were racing a Sept. 30 deadline . If they didn ’ t obligate the money by then , they would lose the chance to spend it on the wall .
The immediate effect of the ruling is to let the administration tap several billion dollars within the Pentagon ’ s budget and direct it toward building the wall , which was Mr. Trump ’ s most visible 2016 campaign promise .
Opponents said they will continue to fight , including pressing lower courts to speed up the arguments on their broader challenge to the emergency declaration ’ s constitutionality .
“ This is not over , ” said Dror Ladin , an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , said the Supreme Court ruling “ undermines the Constitution . ”
Mr. Trump expressed his enthusiasm in his unique system of uppercase letters on Twitter : “ Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law ! ”
The two victories for Mr. Trump last week follow on his success in June , when he used the threat of tariffs to force Mexico to the bargaining table . Mexico agreed to do more to head off migrants crossing its territory and to take back more Central American asylum-seekers , making them wait in Mexico while their cases proceed through the U.S. immigration courts .
The effects of the Mexico deal were already having some effect .
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told “ Fox Business Sunday ” that the number of illegal immigrants nabbed at the U.S.-Mexico border fell 28 % in June and is down another 20 % in July .
In May , Customs and Border Protection encountered 4,650 unauthorized migrants a day . The number now is 2,600 , he said .
The emergency border spending bill that Mr. Trump won from Congress a month ago has also helped ease overcrowding at border facilities .
At its peak in early June , CBP had 19,000 people in custody . That number is now 7,200 , Mr. McAleenan said .
One of Mr. McAleenan ’ s top lieutenants took yet another step Friday to try to reduce the flow of migrants by ordering asylum officers to cast a dim eye on some asylum claims .
“ Private violence ” doesn ’ t cut it , said Ken Cuccinelli , acting director of U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services . While conditions may be rough , he said , there just isn ’ t enough “ pervasive ” violence in El Salvador , Honduras and Guatemala to automatically grant asylum to people fleeing those countries .
Mr. Trump started winning immigration fights after he revamped his team , shuffling the leaders of the Homeland Security Department and each of the three agencies that handles immigration . The department and all three agencies are now headed by temporary officers .
The administration ’ s moves will continue to face scrutiny in the courts .
Several activist groups have vowed to challenge the Guatemala asylum agreement . Critics said that country isn ’ t safe enough nor capable enough to provide asylum to others crossing its territory .
“ Such an arrangement would make a mockery of the notion that those fleeing persecution in Central America have any recourse , ” said Eric Schwartz , president of Refugees International .
Ms. Vaughan , though , said the Guatemala agreement was proof that the U.S. does have leverage with foreign countries that previous administrations hadn ’ t used .
“ What remains to be seen is which message comes through stronger in Central America ( and around the world now ) — do they hear that the risk of failure is much higher now because Trump and the other governments are cracking down , or do they hear that American judges are blocking his efforts ? ” she said .
She said the Trump administration must be prepared to fend off those legal challenges .
“ Now that Trump has come to realize that Congress isn ’ t going to be much help , and that he needs to go at this problem from all angles , with every immigration agency involved , it looks like we are finally starting to see results , ” she said .","President Trump is suddenly on a surprising winning streak when it comes to immigration.

The plan will give more than four million illegal immigrants the chance to apply for work permits and a temporary reprieve from deportation . People who have been in the U.S. for at least five years and are parents of citizens or legal permanent residents would be eligible to apply . The White House said nearly a million more could benefit through other new or expanded programs . The president also is narrowing the group of people who would be subject to deportation , in what the White House said was an effort to focus enforcement resources on gang members , serious criminals and those who crossed the border after Jan. 1 , 2014 .
“ What I ’ m describing is accountability—a common-sense , middle ground approach : If you meet the criteria , you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law . If you ’ re a criminal , you ’ ll be deported , ” Mr. Obama said in describing his executive action .
Republicans criticized the move as presidential overreach . “ The action he ’ s proposed would ignore the law , would reject the voice of the voters , and would impose new unfairness on law-abiding immigrants—all without solving the problem , ” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) .
Mr. Obama said his move was well-grounded in law and precedent and challenged Republicans to pass a bill if they don ’ t like it . He noted contributions immigrants make to the nation , and said it was neither realistic nor desirable to deport all 11.3 million undocumented immigrants .
He also rejected accusations that his policy amounts to amnesty , and said it would rightly deport those who represent real threats . “ Felons , not families . Criminals , not children . Gang members , not a mom who ’ s working hard to provide for her kids , ” he said . “ We ’ ll prioritize , just like law enforcement does every day . ”
Mr. Obama ’ s plan contained only minor benefits for businesses that crave more visas for foreign workers and which have lobbied unsuccessfully for action in Congress . A new program will expand immigration options for foreign entrepreneurs who meet certain criteria . But White House officials said they opted against a plan , favored by high-tech companies , to make visas available from those unused in prior years , after concluding they couldn ’ t justify it legally .
By giving work papers to millions of illegal workers , Mr. Obama ’ s plan could affect businesses in unexpected ways , enabling workers to seek new jobs and higher wages to the benefit of some business sectors more than others . Some in agriculture , for example , worried that affected workers would leave for other sectors .
A 1986 law , which offered legal status to nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants , had an almost immediate labor-market impact , with many low-wage workers moving to other jobs that pay better .
Senior administration officials said the legal justification for Mr. Obama ’ s plan was based on the principle of prosecutorial discretion—there are insufficient resources to target all 11.3 million illegal immigrants , so the administration can assert priorities .
Advocates for immigrants , who lobbied Mr. Obama to act without waiting for approval from lawmakers , planned celebrations and rallies across the country . A crowd gathered outside the gates of the White House shouting , “ Si se pudo ! ” or “ Yes we could ! ” in Spanish . In an East Los Angeles immigrant enclave , people were tuned in to Spanish-language television at mom and pop shops . Univision offered simultaneous translation of the president ’ s speech into Spanish .
“ I feel like everything I did now is paying off , ” said Martha Sanchez Almaraz , of Shakopee , Minn. , who advocated for the change and stands to benefit from it . Two of her three children are U.S. citizens . “ Sometimes , I felt like this would never happen . ”
As a candidate , Mr. Obama had vowed to make an immigration overhaul a priority in his first year . That didn ’ t happen . He pushed for legislation as his second term opened , but a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate died in the GOP-run House .
Now , with two years left in office , Mr. Obama has turned to unilateral action . But the new protections in the executive action are temporary and the entire policy could be reversed by a future president .
Republicans in Congress have been looking for ways to block implementation of the Obama policy . Many have suggested using legislation that must pass by Dec. 11 , needed to keep the government funded , as a vehicle for enacting limits on Mr. Obama ’ s policies .
That idea hit a roadblock Thursday when the House Appropriations Committee said that Congress can ’ t defund the primary agency involved in Mr. Obama ’ s plan , U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , because it is self-funded by fees . In fact , the agency could continue operating even if the rest of the government shut down .
President Reagan signed a law making sweeping immigration changes . President Obama is taking executive action . What are the differences in their plans ? WSJ ’ s Jason Bellini has # TheShortAnswer .
Some GOP lawmakers favor filing a lawsuit , challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Obama ’ s action . Others suggested potentially withholding funding for other parts of the president ’ s agenda .
Mr. Obama ’ s action raised the question of whether immigration legislation was now dead for the rest of his term—as GOP leaders said his unilateral action would “ poison the well ” in working with Congress—or whether it created new pressures for lawmakers to revisit the issue .
Some lawmakers said Congress may respond to Mr. Obama by renewing efforts to pass legislation , likely in piecemeal fashion , as many Republicans have advocated . “ Congress needs to re-establish its authority in this , ” said Rep. Mike Simpson ( R. , Idaho ) . “ Ultimately , we ’ ve got to solve the problem , so why not just start doing it ? ”
Sen. Chris Murphy ( D. , Conn. ) said the president ’ s actions are “ a forcing mechanism . Republicans can sit down and negotiate with us tomorrow to make this executive action last all of a few weeks . ”
The executive action satisfies few priorities of business groups , which are now regrouping . Mr. Obama ’ s new policy will allow companies to employ certain workers who are waiting for their visas to clear , and it will expand a program that helps foreign students who have graduated and are awaiting work visas . Unions complained about both provisions , but they fall well short of legislative changes that business wants : more legal visas for high-skilled and low-skilled workers .
“ Republicans will have an opportunity in the next Congress to put forward bills to address our dysfunctional immigration system , ” said U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes .
The most controversial part of the plan is a new “ deferred action ” program , which gives a temporary reprieve from deportation and the chance to apply for work permits . Parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents will be eligible for the program . To qualify , they will have to undergo a background check and pay application fees .
In addition , the administration is expanding criteria for an existing program that gives the same benefits to young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children , sometimes called Dreamers , making about 270,000 people newly eligible .
However , senior administration officials said they couldn ’ t legally justify giving shelter to the parents of these young people . They said that Congress had recognized the importance of the relationship between children and their immigrant parents , in that citizens are able to sponsor their parents for green cards . But there is no such justification for the parents of Dreamers , who have no legal status of their own , they said .
For similar reasons , they said , they considered but didn ’ t create a special program for farm workers .
“ It ’ s a bittersweet moment for us , ” said Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez , a Brazilian immigrant who was raised in Florida and has legal protections under the existing program . “ Many people who got us to this point won ’ t have the relief of knowing their parents are protected from deportation . ”
The plan also makes changes to the enforcement regime . Under newly crafted guidelines , gang members , those with serious criminal convictions and people who crossed the border after Jan. 1 , 2014 , will top the list of priorities for deportation . People with only minor immigration violations or traffic convictions , but no other offenses , will no longer be targeted , officials said .
It wasn ’ t clear whether deportations , which have hit record numbers under Mr. Obama ’ s tenure , would drop under the new policy . Most of the people deported in recent years would have qualified as priorities for deportation under the new rules .
The president was also replacing the Secure Communities program , which mandates that local law enforcement detain illegal immigrants and notify federal authorities . Under the new program , immigration enforcement officials will be notified , but people wo n't be held for any extra time .","WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama announced Thursday that millions of illegal immigrants will gain protections from deportation, bypassing Congress and unleashing unpredictable political and economic forces.

Mr. Obama’s action raised the question of whether immigration legislation was now dead for the rest of his term—as GOP leaders said his unilateral action would “poison the well” in working with Congress—or whether it created new pressures for lawmakers to revisit the issue.

Some lawmakers said Congress may respond to Mr. Obama by renewing efforts to pass legislation, likely in piecemeal fashion, as many Republicans have advocated. “Congress needs to re-establish its authority in this,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R., Idaho). “Ultimately, we’ve got to solve the problem, so why not just start doing it?”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said the president’s actions are “a forcing mechanism. Republicans can sit down and negotiate with us tomorrow to make this executive action last all of a few weeks.”

The executive action satisfies few priorities of business groups, which are now regrouping. Mr. Obama’s new policy will allow companies to employ certain workers who are waiting for their visas to clear, and it will expand a program that helps foreign students who have graduated and are awaiting work visas. Unions complained about both provisions, but they fall well short of legislative changes that business wants: more legal visas for high-skilled and low-skilled workers.

“Republicans will have an opportunity in the next Congress to put forward bills to address our dysfunctional immigration system,” said U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes.

The most controversial part of the plan is a new “deferred action” program, which gives a temporary reprieve from deportation and the chance to apply for work permits. Parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents will be eligible for the program. To qualify, they will have to undergo a background check and pay application fees.

In addition, the administration is expanding criteria for an existing program that gives the same benefits to young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, sometimes called Dreamers, making about 270,000 people newly eligible.

However, senior administration officials said they couldn’t legally justify giving shelter to the parents of these young people. They said that Congress had recognized the importance of the relationship between children and their immigrant parents, in that citizens are able to sponsor their parents for green cards. But there is no such justification for the parents of Dreamers, who have no legal status of their own, they said.

For similar reasons, they said, they considered but didn’t create a special program for farm workers.

“It’s a bittersweet moment for us,” said Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez, a Brazilian immigrant who was raised in Florida and has legal protections under the existing program. “Many people who got us to this point won’t have the relief of knowing their parents are protected from deportation.”

The plan also makes changes to the enforcement regime. Under newly crafted guidelines, gang members, those with serious criminal convictions and people who crossed the border after Jan. 1, 2014, will top the list of priorities for deportation. People with only minor immigration violations or traffic convictions, but no other offenses, will no longer be targeted, officials said.

It wasn’t clear whether deportations, which have hit record numbers under Mr. Obama’s tenure, would drop under the new policy. Most of the people deported in recent years would have qualified as priorities for deportation under the new rules.

The president was also replacing the Secure Communities program, which mandates that local law enforcement detain illegal immigrants and notify federal authorities. Under the new program, immigration enforcement officials will be notified, but people won't be held for any extra time.

immigration,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/white-house-immigration-115273.html?hp=t4_r,White House facing rocky legal road on immigration ,2015-02-17,Josh Gerstein,"A carefully targeted lawsuit by states opposed to President Barack Obama ’ s immigration executive actions hit a bulls-eye Tuesday , forcing postponement of a key element of the president ’ s plan hours before it was to get underway .
But the injunction issued late on the President ’ s Day holiday by a federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush could just be the beginning of a rocky legal ride for the Obama White House .
Obama vowed to appeal the ruling , but that challenge will head to a court considered the most conservative federal appeals court in the country : the 5th Circuit . Its active judges are Republican by a 2-1 margin .
Still , the president sounded optimistic that his legal position will ultimately be vindicated .
“ I disagree with the Texas judge ’ s ruling , and the Justice Department will appeal , ” Obama said at a meeting with new Defense Secretary Ash Carter that was hastily opened to access by journalists .
“ This is not the first time where a lower court judge blocked something or attempted to block something that ultimately was shown to be lawful . And I ’ m confident that it is well within my authority and position of the executive branch ’ s prosecutorial discretion to execute this law , ” the president said in response to questions . “ I think the law is on our side and history is on our side . ”
The White House ’ s best chance to get Obama ’ s immigration efforts back on track may lie with the Supreme Court , which issued a 5-3 ruling in 2012 backing strong discretion for the federal government in immigration enforcement . ( Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from that decision but seems likely to back Obama in the latest fight . )
The current dispute could wind up at the high court on an emergency basis within days , but administration officials were not specific about whether they will immediately demand that Obama ’ s immigration actions be allowed to resume .
“ We are still in the process of looking at the opinion and trying to decide what steps we might take next , ” Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters at the National Press Club Tuesday . “ We have to look at this decision for what it is : it is the decision by one federal district court judge . I expect—have always expected that this is a matter that will ultimately be decided by a higher court , if not the Supreme Court then a federal court of appeals….This , I would view as an interim step in a process that has more to play out . ”
Administration officials stepped gingerly around questions about whether the decision from U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen was political .
The White House insisted that Hanen ’ s ruling did not surprise them , even though it required cancellation for now of the first round of applications for an expanded program to allow immigrants who arrived illegally in the U.S. as children to get quasi-legal status and work permits . The judge ’ s order also came as the administration and its allies had a nationwide media blitz set Tuesday to urge illegal immigrants eligible for an expanded program to file applications starting Wednesday .
“ This is something we were prepared for , ” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a late-afternoon conference call . “ Those who are veteran court-watchers were not surprised by this particular judge ’ s ruling based on his previous statements on this issue . ”
Earnest appeared to be referring to comments Hanen has made in previous immigration cases , including one more than a year ago where he may have foreshadowed his latest ruling .
The Department of Homeland Security “ has simply chosen not to enforce the United States ’ border security laws , ” Hanen wrote in a 2013 case , highlighted by the Associated Press in December .

A carefully targeted lawsuit by states opposed to President Barack Obama’s immigration executive actions hit a bulls-eye Tuesday, forcing postponement of a key element of the president’s plan hours before it was to get underway.

But the injunction issued late on the President’s Day holiday by a federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush could just be the beginning of a rocky legal ride for the Obama White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama vowed to appeal the ruling, but that challenge will head to a court considered the most conservative federal appeals court in the country: the 5th Circuit. Its active judges are Republican by a 2-1 margin.

Still, the president sounded optimistic that his legal position will ultimately be vindicated.

“I disagree with the Texas judge’s ruling, and the Justice Department will appeal,” Obama said at a meeting with new Defense Secretary Ash Carter that was hastily opened to access by journalists.

“This is not the first time where a lower court judge blocked something or attempted to block something that ultimately was shown to be lawful. And I’m confident that it is well within my authority and position of the executive branch’s prosecutorial discretion to execute this law,” the president said in response to questions. “I think the law is on our side and history is on our side.”

The White House’s best chance to get Obama’s immigration efforts back on track may lie with the Supreme Court, which issued a 5-3 ruling in 2012 backing strong discretion for the federal government in immigration enforcement. (Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from that decision but seems likely to back Obama in the latest fight.)

The current dispute could wind up at the high court on an emergency basis within days, but administration officials were not specific about whether they will immediately demand that Obama’s immigration actions be allowed to resume.

“We are still in the process of looking at the opinion and trying to decide what steps we might take next,” Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters at the National Press Club Tuesday. “We have to look at this decision for what it is: it is the decision by one federal district court judge. I expect—have always expected that this is a matter that will ultimately be decided by a higher court, if not the Supreme Court then a federal court of appeals….This, I would view as an interim step in a process that has more to play out.”

Administration officials stepped gingerly around questions about whether the decision from U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen was political.

The White House insisted that Hanen’s ruling did not surprise them, even though it required cancellation for now of the first round of applications for an expanded program to allow immigrants who arrived illegally in the U.S. as children to get quasi-legal status and work permits. The judge’s order also came as the administration and its allies had a nationwide media blitz set Tuesday to urge illegal immigrants eligible for an expanded program to file applications starting Wednesday.

“This is something we were prepared for,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a late-afternoon conference call. “Those who are veteran court-watchers were not surprised by this particular judge’s ruling based on his previous statements on this issue.”

Earnest appeared to be referring to comments Hanen has made in previous immigration cases, including one more than a year ago where he may have foreshadowed his latest ruling.

The Department of Homeland Security “has simply chosen not to enforce the United States’ border security laws,” Hanen wrote in a 2013 case, highlighted by the Associated Press in December. He called the government’s failures “both dangerous and unconscionable,” but also declared, “This court takes no position on the topic of immigration reform, nor should one read this opinion as a commentary on that issue.”

A spokesperson for Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas), who spearheaded the suit, said it was filed in Brownsville because of the impact of illegal immigration there. By filing in that court division, opponents of Obama’s immigration plan had a 50 percent chance of getting the case in front of Hanen and a 50 percent chance it would be assigned to another judge who is a Clinton appointee.

White House aides were long on criticism of Congressional Republicans for obstructing immigration reform legislation and short on direct rebuttal of the points Hanen made in his opinion.

Others say it would be wrong to give them such treatment .
Now , some members of Congress from both parties say there may be a way to satisfy both sides , offering the possibility of a common ground in the contentious debate .
Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R. , Va. ) , the conservative chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , has floated an idea that would rely partly on existing law to allow many people here illegally to gain citizenship . People in both parties say it has the potential to win backing from some Republican House members who say those here illegally should n't get special treatment unavailable to other foreigners .
Under Mr. Goodlatte 's concept , Congress could grant illegal immigrants a provisional legal status , similar to the probationary legal status available under legislation that cleared the Senate in June . Then they could use existing laws that allows foreigners who are legally in the U.S. to seek green cards—also known as permanent legal residency—and eventual citizenship if they meet strict criteria . Illegal immigrants are barred from doing so .
No illegal immigrant would gain legal status before efforts were in place to secure the border with Mexico and tighten enforcement of immigration law , Mr. Goodlatte has said . He has sketched out his idea , which is still evolving , in various public appearances .
Any proposal to provide legal status—much less citizenship—to people who came to the U.S. illegally will be sharply opposed by the most conservative Republicans on this issue . Already , Mr. Goodlatte is encountering resistance for offering legalization to people brought to the U.S. as children , and for considering legalization for others who are in the country illegally .
Mr. Goodlatte has n't proposed changing the current criteria for gaining a green card , such as marrying a U.S. citizen or having an employer say that an American could n't be found for the job an immigrant seeks . Once a person has a green card , he or she becomes eligible to apply for citizenship under existing law , usually after a period of required continuous residency .
`` All of those are ways they [ illegal immigrants ] could then eventually find themselves permanent residents and , ultimately , citizens , '' Mr. Goodlatte said on C-Span last month . `` But none of those would be special ways that have been made available only to people who have come here illegally . ''

Others say it would be wrong to give them such treatment.

Now, some members of Congress from both parties say there may be a way to satisfy both sides, offering the possibility of a common ground in the contentious debate.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.), the conservative chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has floated an idea that would rely partly on existing law to allow many people here illegally to gain citizenship. People in both parties say it has the potential to win backing from some Republican House members who say those here illegally shouldn't get special treatment unavailable to other foreigners.

Under Mr. Goodlatte's concept, Congress could grant illegal immigrants a provisional legal status, similar to the probationary legal status available under legislation that cleared the Senate in June. Then they could use existing laws that allows foreigners who are legally in the U.S. to seek green cards—also known as permanent legal residency—and eventual citizenship if they meet strict criteria. Illegal immigrants are barred from doing so.

No illegal immigrant would gain legal status before efforts were in place to secure the border with Mexico and tighten enforcement of immigration law, Mr. Goodlatte has said. He has sketched out his idea, which is still evolving, in various public appearances.

Any proposal to provide legal status—much less citizenship—to people who came to the U.S. illegally will be sharply opposed by the most conservative Republicans on this issue. Already, Mr. Goodlatte is encountering resistance for offering legalization to people brought to the U.S. as children, and for considering legalization for others who are in the country illegally.

Mr. Goodlatte hasn't proposed changing the current criteria for gaining a green card, such as marrying a U.S. citizen or having an employer say that an American couldn't be found for the job an immigrant seeks. Once a person has a green card, he or she becomes eligible to apply for citizenship under existing law, usually after a period of required continuous residency.

""All of those are ways they [illegal immigrants] could then eventually find themselves permanent residents and, ultimately, citizens,"" Mr. Goodlatte said on C-Span last month. ""But none of those would be special ways that have been made available only to people who have come here illegally.""

Because existing law makes it difficult to qualify for a green card, only a sliver of the 11 million people now here illegally might actually make it to citizenship under the concept. That is why Mr. Goodlatte's idea also is encountering resistance from some advocates for immigrants on the left.

""What we want is something that works. It can't be a path to a dead end,"" said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D., Calif.).

Meantime, Rep. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.) said he didn't want to consider such an approach until the issue of border security had been resolved.

""The important part of this debate is to get the security enforcement provisions up front first, and then discussions of what the 11 million looks like [can occur] after that's in place,"" Mr. Gardner said.

On Sunday, former GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) seemed to back an approach in line with Mr. Goodlatte's. Mr. Ryan said on CBS News that House Republicans are looking for ways to give the 11 million illegal immigrants ""a chance to get right with the law,"" once border security and other measures are in place and the immigrants have paid back taxes, fines and undergone a background check. He, too, emphasized that there would be ""no special pathway"" for them.

Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House immigration subcommittee.

The approach may be what is needed to get an immigration bill through the House, said Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), who supports the Senate method of handling those here illegally but fears it can't gain House passage.

The report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General showed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement released `` criminal aliens '' from jails all over the country as part of a wave of releases in February 2013 . The agency came under fire at the time for the decision , which critics described as politically motivated and dangerous .
The report , obtained in advance by FoxNews.com and released late Tuesday morning , found that ICE indeed was trying to address the budget shortfall when leadership moved to sharply reduce the number of people in the detention centers .
But in releasing more than 2,200 detainees , the agency reported it also had sprung 629 with criminal convictions ( the agency later lowered that estimate slightly ) -- some of whom had been nabbed on serious offenses . The report indicated many should not have been released .
`` Between February 9 and March 1 , 2013 , Enforcement and Removal Operations field offices released some aliens with criminal convictions whose detention was statutorily required , '' the report found .
The probe was requested by Sens . John McCain , R-Ariz. , and Tom Coburn , R-Okla. , who slammed the agency over the findings .
`` It is baffling how an agency charged with homeland security and immigration enforcement would knowingly release hundreds of illegals with criminal histories . In this single action , ICE undermined its own credibility , the rule of law , and the safety of Americans and local law enforcement , '' Coburn said in a statement .
The report said that in advance of the highly publicized budget cuts -- which the Obama administration was publicly opposed to -- ICE released 2,226 immigration detainees .
Most of the hundreds with criminal convictions were categorized as `` level 3 '' -- meaning they were implicated in lower-level offenses .
But the group included dozens of `` level 1 '' and `` level 2 '' inmates . Level 1 is a category that includes those convicted of offenses ranging from murder to rape to robbery to serious drug crimes . Level 2 includes those convicted of fraud , burglary , money laundering and other offenses . The IG report did not say which offenses these individuals were being held on .
The report called the agency 's approach here `` problematic , '' saying ICE leadership did not `` communicate effectively '' with the division in charge of detentions and did not inform higher-ups about the budget shortfalls .
The report described an inconsistent and confusing scramble to make space in the detention centers . Local divisions did not have written guidance on how to `` prioritize '' the releases , and had `` limited access '' to legal advice since ICE leadership `` did not formally notify ICE attorneys '' of the plan . Only one local field office had an attorney on hand to review `` each case , '' according to the report .
Yet the report noted that many of the illegal immigrants were required by law to be held . Adding to the confusion , ICE leaders did not tell local field offices to track the releases . When they started asking questions , officers had trouble providing the information .
In the end , while the agency found officers made `` reasonable release decisions '' given the time frame , they ended up redetaining dozens of those they had released .
In April 2013 , the agency reported that 34 `` level 1 '' detainees had been released , but 24 of them were returned to ICE custody . Thirty of the 80 `` level 2 '' inmates were also brought back .
In a written statement , ICE said the reductions in 2013 were `` necessary '' due to the `` high levels of detention at the time , coupled with the looming prospect of sequestration . ''
ICE said the agency took `` careful steps to ensure public safety by focusing efforts to reduce the detained population on non-criminal , non-mandatory detention cases and cases involving individuals who posed no serious risk to community safety . '' The assessments , according to ICE , were made by `` career law enforcement officials on a case-by-case-basis following a careful examination of each detainee 's criminal and immigration history . ''
The agency said those released remained in removal proceedings and `` continue to be monitored . ''
Then-ICE Director John Morton earlier acknowledged to Congress in March 2013 that those released included individuals with criminal backgrounds . He said at the time the agency was bringing some of them back into custody , but claimed some had been held just on financial offenses .
Morton stressed that the releases were made on a case-by-case basis and not `` willy-nilly . ''
But Republicans have long voiced concern that the agency , in this case and others , has put local communities at risk with its releases . The IG report comes as the agency , along with other federal departments , grapple with the surge of illegal immigrant children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border .
The IG report did note , however , the constraints ICE is facing . The agency is required by law to maintain an average daily population of 34,000 detainees , with funding coming from Congress and other sources . But at the time , the report said , ICE was dealing with an average population of more than 35,000 detainees ; facing budget cuts and other fiscal restraints , the agency decided to reduce the number of prisoners .","More than 600 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions were released by federal authorities in early 2013 in advance of the ""sequester"" budget cuts, according to a government watchdog report obtained by FoxNews.com.

''
`` Today , after 10 years of investments in training and equipment and improved information sharing our cities and communities and our nation are stronger , more prepared and engaged and better equipped to address a range if threats , '' Napolitano said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on immigration reform . `` This legislation will build on these gains , strengthening both our overall national security posture and our border security . ''
In light of last week 's bombing , in which three people were killed and nearly 300 were injured when two IEDs exploded at the Boston Marathon , a small group of senators on the right -- including Senators Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , and Rand Paul , R-Ky. -- have questioned whether or not the Senate should proceed with immigration reform given that the alleged bombers were foreign-born . The calls threaten to derail delicate and longstanding bipartisan negotiations for a bill to overhaul the nation 's immigration system , and Democrats have been swift to decry GOP efforts to link the two issues .
`` Last week opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston Marathon , '' Sen. Pat Leahy , D-Vt. , said at the beginning of an immigration hearing yesterday . `` I urge restraint in that regard . ''
Even so , Grassley continued to urge caution in remarks today at a second immigration hearing , contending that what happened in Boston should serve as a cautionary tale .
`` The tragic events that occurred in Boston ... [ serve as ] reminders that our immigration system is directly related to our sovereignty and national security matters , '' Grassley said Tuesday . `` I 'm advocating that we carefully review the immigration laws and the administration policies in place . ''
Paul , in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , Monday , argued the point more vehemently , contending that `` the facts emerging in the Boston Marathon bombing have exposed a weakness in our current system '' and that `` we should not proceed until we understand the specific failures of our immigration system . ''
`` Why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia , an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism , who then committed acts of terrorism ? '' he wrote in the letter . `` Were there any safeguards ? Could this have been prevented ? Does the immigration reform before us address this ? ''
The two bombing suspects , Tamerlan and Dzokhar Tsarnaev , the first of whom was killed in a shoot-out early Friday morning , immigrated to the United States from Russia around the early 2000s . In light of their actions last week , questions have since arisen about whether the brothers , who were of Chechen descent but do not appear to have ever lived in Chechnya , were at all affiliated with radical Chechen actors . While Dzokhar Tsarnaev , the younger , surviving brother , appears to have indicated in early statements that the brothers acted alone , Tamerlan 's 2011 trip to Russia has led to speculation about the possibility that he might have sought foreign assistance with his mission . Russia had previously requested that the FBI investigate Tamerlan Tsarnaev for possible terrorist ties , though the FBI says a subsequent investigation turned up nothing .
Napolitano said Tuesday that the FBI was alerted when Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the U.S. for Russia in 2011 , despite the fact that his name was misspelled in one of his travel documents . But , she said , the `` matter had been closed '' by the time Tsarnaev returned and thus the FBI was not alerted to his reentry .
`` By the time he returned all investigations - the matter had been closed , '' Napolitano said .
She argued , though , that the immigration bill would actually work to reduce human error and thus reinforce the strength of existing systems .
`` The bill will help with this , because it requires that passports be electronically readable , '' Napolitano said . `` It really does a good job of getting human error to the extent it exists out of the process . ''
She also said the Saudi national who was apprehended directly after the bombings was only temporary placed on a `` watch list , '' and that ultimately , he was `` in the wrong place at the wrong time . ''
`` He was never even really a person of interest , '' Napolitano said . She said after he was questioned , it was `` quickly determined he had nothing to do with the status , '' and his name was removed from the list .","Amid calls from some Republicans to slow down or even halt immigration reform in light of last week's Boston bombings, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano argued Tuesday that the immigration bill up for debate would actually enhance national security - not detract from it -- and ""build on"" 10 years worth of investments into the nation's defense, ultimately ""strengthening both our overall national security posture and our border security.""

immigration,Newsmax,2,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/immigrants-arrested-routine-us/2017/02/10/id/773101/,Hundreds of Immigrants Arrested in 'Routine' US Enforcement Surge,2017-02-10,,"U.S. federal immigration agents arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least four states this week in what officials on Friday called routine enforcement actions .
Reports of immigration sweeps this week sparked concern among immigration advocates and families , coming on the heels of President Donald Trump 's executive order barring refugees and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations . That order is currently on hold .
`` The fear coursing through immigrant homes and the native-born Americans who love immigrants as friends and family is palpable , '' Ali Noorani , executive director of the National Immigration Forum , said in a statement . `` Reports of raids in immigrant communities are a grave concern . ''
The enforcement actions took place in Atlanta , New York , Chicago , Los Angeles and surrounding areas , said David Marin , director of enforcement and removal for the Los Angeles field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Only five of 161 people arrested in Southern California would not have been enforcement priorities under the Obama administration , he said .
The agency did not release a total number of detainees . The Atlanta office , which covers three states , arrested 200 people , Bryan Cox , a spokesman for the office , said . The 161 arrests in the Los Angeles area were made in a region that included seven highly populated counties , Marin said .
In a conference call with reporters , he said that such actions were routine , pointing to one last summer in Los Angeles under former President Barack Obama .
`` The rash of these recent reports about ICE checkpoints and random sweeps , that 's all false and that 's dangerous and irresponsible , '' Marin said . `` Reports like that create a panic . ''

Michael Kagan , a professor of immigration law at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas , said immigration advocates are concerned that the arrests could signal the beginning of more aggressive enforcement and increased deportations under Trump .
`` It sounds as if the majority are people who would have been priorities under Obama as well , '' Kagan said in a telephone interview . `` But the others may indicate the first edge of a new wave of arrests and deportations . ''
Trump recently broadened the categories of people who could be targeted for immigration enforcement to anyone who had been charged with a crime , removing an Obama-era exception for people convicted of traffic misdemeanors , Kagan said .","U.S. federal immigration agents arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least four states this week in what officials on Friday called routine enforcement actions.

Reports of immigration sweeps this week sparked concern among immigration advocates and families, coming on the heels of President Donald Trump's executive order barring refugees and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations. That order is currently on hold.

""The fear coursing through immigrant homes and the native-born Americans who love immigrants as friends and family is palpable,"" Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said in a statement. ""Reports of raids in immigrant communities are a grave concern.""

The enforcement actions took place in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and surrounding areas, said David Marin, director of enforcement and removal for the Los Angeles field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Only five of 161 people arrested in Southern California would not have been enforcement priorities under the Obama administration, he said.

The agency did not release a total number of detainees. The Atlanta office, which covers three states, arrested 200 people, Bryan Cox, a spokesman for the office, said. The 161 arrests in the Los Angeles area were made in a region that included seven highly populated counties, Marin said.

Marin called the five-day operation an ""enforcement surge.""

In a conference call with reporters, he said that such actions were routine, pointing to one last summer in Los Angeles under former President Barack Obama.

""The rash of these recent reports about ICE checkpoints and random sweeps, that's all false and that's dangerous and irresponsible,"" Marin said. ""Reports like that create a panic.""

He said that of the people arrested in Southern California, only 10 did not have criminal records. Of those, five had prior deportation orders.

Michael Kagan, a professor of immigration law at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said immigration advocates are concerned that the arrests could signal the beginning of more aggressive enforcement and increased deportations under Trump.

immigration,Pew Research Center,1,http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/21/executive-actions-on-immigration-have-long-history/,Executive actions on immigration have long history,2014-11-21,Drew Desilver,"President Obama ’ s executive action to protect millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation is an act that both follows and departs from precedents set by his predecessors .
As immigrant advocates — and the White House itself — point out , presidents have a long history of using their discretionary enforcement powers to allow people to enter and remain in the country outside the regular immigration laws . But Obama ’ s move offers relief to more people than any other executive action in recent history — about 3.9 million people , or roughly 35 % of the estimated total unauthorized-immigrant population — a point that some opponents have used to differentiate Obama ’ s action from those of past presidents .
Obama ’ s announcement follows his decision in June 2012 to grant temporary reprieves from deportation for 1.5 million eligible unauthorized immigrants who ’ d been brought to the U.S. as children — the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA . In the memorandum announcing DACA , then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano framed it as part of the executive branch ’ s role “ to set forth policy for the exercise of discretion within the framework of the existing law. ” Obama ’ s action expands that program , and protects other groups , using a similar rationale .
Most previous executive actions on immigration were targeted fairly narrowly , according to a summary compiled by the American Immigration Council . The 39 “ executive grants of temporary immigration relief ” since 1956 listed by the council covered , among other groups , Ethiopians fleeing that country ’ s Marxist military dictatorship in the 1970s , Liberians who escaped their country ’ s brutal civil wars , and foreign students whose academic eligibility was interrupted by Hurricane Katrina .
Other actions taken by prior administrations affected considerably more people . Most of them were eventually formalized or superseded by legislation , though sometimes — as often happens with complicated subjects such as immigration — the new laws led to new issues .
Cubans fleeing Castro : In early 1961 , at a time when thousands of Cubans were trying to escape the new Castro government , President Kennedy directed Health , Education and Welfare Secretary Abraham Ribicoff to set up a “ Cuban Refugee Program ” to provide federal assistance to Cuban refugees , including medical care , financial aid , help with education and resettlement , and child welfare services . That program was formalized the following year by the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act , and by subsequent legislation . By 1971 , 600,000 Cuban refugees had entered the U.S. ; as of 2012 there were more than 1 million Cubans living in the U.S. who had immigrated since 1959 ( representing 97 % of all Cuban immigrants ) , according to the 2012 American Community Survey .
The Cuban program , however , sparked a lawsuit from would-be immigrants from elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere , who argued that the immigrant visas given to Cuban refugees unfairly limited spots that otherwise would be available for them . In 1977 , a federal court in Chicago ordered what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service to issue so-called “ Silva letters ” to about 250,000 people — nearly all Mexicans living in the Southwest , according to a 1985 Los Angeles Times article — giving them temporary protection from deportation and letting them work while the complex case worked its way through the courts . Eventually , about 145,000 Silva letter holders received visas ; the rest ( at least those who were still living in the U.S. ) remained in administrative limbo until the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act enabled them to apply for legal permanent residency .
Refugees from the Indochina wars : In early 1975 , when it became clear South Vietnam was going to fall to the communist North , the Ford administration evacuated around 130,000 Vietnamese from Saigon . Ford and his successor , Jimmy Carter , subsequently allowed more Vietnamese , Cambodian and Laotian refugees to come to the U.S. ; between 1975 and 1979 , about 360,000 people from the countries of Indochina were allowed to remain in the country .
Mariel boatlift : Between April and October 1980 , approximately 125,000 Cubans and 25,000 Haitians ( who were trying to escape that nation ’ s grinding poverty and the brutal Duvalier dictatorship ) arrived in south Florida by boat . The Carter administration used its discretionary authority to admit most of them into the country ; those migrants eventually were made legal permanent residents by the 1986 immigration-reform law .
Spouses and children : The 1986 law , however , created a new dilemma : how to deal with spouses and children of newly-legalized immigrants who didn ’ t themselves qualify for legal status . In October 1987 , the Reagan administration said it wouldn ’ t seek to deport minor children living with their parents as long as both parents qualified for amnesty under the 1986 law . Reagan ’ s successor , George H.W . Bush , expanded that policy in February 1990 : Under the new “ family fairness ” rules , all spouses and unmarried children of people who gained legal status under the 1986 law could apply for permission to remain in the country and receive work permits . Bush ’ s policy was formalized later that year as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 .
Central American refugees : The conflicts in El Salvador , Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a new series of executive actions on immigration . In July 1987 , Attorney General Edwin Meese announced that the approximately 200,000 Nicaraguan exiles then living in the U.S. would not be deported so long as they had a “ well-founded fear of persecution. ” Meese also encouraged them to seek work permits and reapply for asylum if they ’ d been denied before .
A similar number of Salvadoran refugees were allowed to remain in the country in “ temporary protected status ” under the provisions of the 1990 immigration law . When that status expired two years later , Bush extended it ; his successor , Bill Clinton , extended it again , until the end of 1994 . Eventually , the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 allowed Nicaraguans , Salvadorans , Guatemalans and others to apply to become legal permanent residents . This opportunity was eventually extended to several thousand Haitian migrants ( estimates range from 20,000 to 40,000 ) who ’ d been left out of the 1997 law — first by executive action from President Clinton , and ultimately through passage of the Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act enacted in October 1998 .
Chinese in U.S. : On at least one occasion , a president actively discouraged Congress from carving out an exception to the immigration laws . In November 1989 , the first President Bush vetoed a bill that would have provided emergency immigration relief for Chinese nationals in the United States following the Tiananmen Square massacre . In his veto message , Bush said that he was already providing greater protections to the Chinese through administrative actions and “ opposed congressional micromanagement of foreign policy. ” In April 1990 , Bush formalized and extended his policy by Executive Order 12711 .

Williamson, Tobias Hoonhout, Julie Gunlock","Central American migrants walk along the road in Ciudad Hidalgo , Mexico , October 26 , 2018 . ( Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters )
It ’ s the only way to meet the challenge to our national sovereignty posed by illegal immigration .
King Leonidas had his 300 . President Trump has his 800 . That ’ s the number of soldiers Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has ordered to the southern border to greet the caravan of illegal immigrants originating from Honduras . The band of families and singles , traveling en masse to avoid exploitation by smugglers and coyotes , now numbers 10,000 souls , according to one report . It may take them weeks to reach the United States . A second caravan is already taking shape behind the first . It won ’ t be the last .
An unauthorized march on a border — any border — is a challenge to national sovereignty . And it is precisely the idea of sovereignty that one of the groups supporting the caravan , Pueblo Sin Fronteras , wants to undermine . The confrontation is all the more emphatic when the men at the head of the column bear the flag not of the country they seek to enter but that of their homeland . Americans who oppose illegal immigration and are concerned at the mounting crisis in our border states , where thousands of family units and unaccompanied children are detained as an inundated bureaucracy decides their fates , look to Trump , Mattis , and the Army for relief .
Prepare to be disappointed . The soldiers aren ’ t going to the border to stop the caravan . They ’ re going to assist Customs and Border Protection , Immigration and Customs Enforcement , Health and Human Services , and other authorities as they take in the newcomers . There is little the government can do to turn back the tide . Why ? Because the same rule of law challenged by illegal immigration also incentivizes and protects the illegal immigrants within the caravan .

It’s the only way to meet the challenge to our national sovereignty posed by illegal immigration.

King Leonidas had his 300. President Trump has his 800. That’s the number of soldiers Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has ordered to the southern border to greet the caravan of illegal immigrants originating from Honduras. The band of families and singles, traveling en masse to avoid exploitation by smugglers and coyotes, now numbers 10,000 souls, according to one report. It may take them weeks to reach the United States. A second caravan is already taking shape behind the first. It won’t be the last.

An unauthorized march on a border — any border — is a challenge to national sovereignty. And it is precisely the idea of sovereignty that one of the groups supporting the caravan, Pueblo Sin Fronteras, wants to undermine. The confrontation is all the more emphatic when the men at the head of the column bear the flag not of the country they seek to enter but that of their homeland. Americans who oppose illegal immigration and are concerned at the mounting crisis in our border states, where thousands of family units and unaccompanied children are detained as an inundated bureaucracy decides their fates, look to Trump, Mattis, and the Army for relief.

Prepare to be disappointed. The soldiers aren’t going to the border to stop the caravan. They’re going to assist Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Health and Human Services, and other authorities as they take in the newcomers. There is little the government can do to turn back the tide. Why? Because the same rule of law challenged by illegal immigration also incentivizes and protects the illegal immigrants within the caravan. It’s a paradox — one inflaming this most polarizing of issues at a moment of political decision.

According to Axios , President Trump is gearing up to sign an executive order that would , in their words , “ remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens born on U.S. soil. ” There is some ambiguity in this formulation .

Pressed by Swan as to whether such an executive order was in process of being drafted , Trump confidently replied that “ it ’ s in the process , it ’ ll happen. ” Will it happen , though ? I ’ m skeptical .
First , I should stipulate that I have in the past argued for an amnesty for the long-settled unauthorized-immigrant population that would be accompanied by a constitutional amendment that would do two things : ( a ) grant Congress the authority to revise the rules around automatic birthright citizenship and ( b ) allow naturalized U.S. citizens who are otherwise eligible to serve as president . I ’ ve since changed my mind .
Though an amendment along these lines would have a hard time clearing the high hurdles we rightly put in the way of new constitutional amendments , it struck me as a tough-minded but ultimately fair way to address a serious and legitimate concern often raised by critics of an expansive amnesty : that such an amnesty would encourage further unauthorized inflows , future unauthorized immigrants would form families in the U.S. ( including native-born citizen children ) , and these mixed-status households have long been among the most sympathetic cases , as most Americans are , for good reason , reluctant to divide families .

Some economic migrants are using children as chits , but the problem is fixable — if Congress acts .
The latest furor over Trump immigration policy involves the separation of children from parents at the border .
As usual , the outrage obscures more than it illuminates , so it ’ s worth walking through what ’ s happening here .
For the longest time , illegal immigration was driven by single males from Mexico . Over the last decade , the flow has shifted to women , children , and family units from Central America . This poses challenges we haven ’ t confronted before and has made what once were relatively minor wrinkles in the law loom very large .
The Trump administration isn ’ t changing the rules that pertain to separating an adult from the child . Those remain the same . Separation happens only if officials find that the adult is falsely claiming to be the child ’ s parent , or is a threat to the child , or is put into criminal proceedings .
It ’ s the last that is operative here . The past practice had been to give a free pass to an adult who is part of a family unit . The new Trump policy is to prosecute all adults . The idea is to send a signal that we are serious about our laws and to create a deterrent against re-entry . ( Illegal entry is a misdemeanor , illegal re-entry a felony . )
When a migrant is prosecuted for illegal entry , he or she is taken into custody by the U.S . Marshals . In no circumstance anywhere in the U.S. do the marshals care for the children of people they take into custody . The child is taken into the custody of HHS , who cares for them at temporary shelters .
The criminal proceedings are exceptionally short , assuming there is no aggravating factor such as a prior illegal entity or another crime . The migrants generally plead guilty , and they are then sentenced to time served , typically all in the same day , although practices vary along the border . After this , they are returned to the custody of ICE .
If the adult then wants to go home , in keeping with the expedited order of removal that is issued as a matter of course , it ’ s relatively simple . The adult should be reunited quickly with his or her child , and the family returned home as a unit . In this scenario , there ’ s only a very brief separation .
Where it becomes much more of an issue is if the adult files an asylum claim . In that scenario , the adults are almost certainly going to be detained longer than the government is allowed to hold their children .
That ’ s because of something called the Flores Consent Decree from 1997 . It says that unaccompanied children can be held only 20 days . A ruling by the Ninth Circuit extended this 20-day limit to children who come as part of family units . So even if we want to hold a family unit together , we are forbidden from doing so .
The clock ticking on the time the government can hold a child will almost always run out before an asylum claim is settled . The migrant is allowed ten days to seek an attorney , and there may be continuances or other complications .
This creates the choice of either releasing the adults and children together into the country pending the ajudication of the asylum claim , or holding the adults and releasing the children . If the adult is held , HHS places the child with a responsible party in the U.S. , ideally a relative ( migrants are likely to have family and friends here ) .
Even if Flores didn ’ t exist , the government would be very constrained in how many family units it can accommodate . ICE has only about 3,000 family spaces in shelters . It is also limited in its overall space at the border , which is overwhelmed by the ongoing influx . This means that — whatever the Trump administration would prefer to do — many adults are still swiftly released .
Why try to hold adults at all ? First of all , if an asylum-seeker is detained , it means that the claim goes through the process much more quickly , a couple of months or less rather than years . Second , if an adult is released while the claim is pending , the chances of ever finding that person again once he or she is in the country are dicey , to say the least . It is tantamount to allowing the migrant to live here , no matter what the merits of the case .
1 ) Family units can go home quickly . The option that both honors our laws and keeps family units together is a swift return home after prosecution . But immigrant advocates hate it because they want the migrants to stay in the United States . How you view this question will depend a lot on how you view the motivation of the migrants ( and how seriously you take our laws and our border ) .
2 ) There ’ s a better way to claim asylum . Every indication is that the migrant flow to the United States is discretionary . It nearly dried up at the beginning of the Trump administration when migrants believed that they had no chance of getting into the United States . Now , it is going in earnest again because the message got out that , despite the rhetoric , the policy at the border hasn ’ t changed . This strongly suggests that the flow overwhelmingly consists of economic migrants who would prefer to live in the United States , rather than victims of persecution in their home country who have no option but to get out .
Even if a migrant does have a credible fear of persecution , there is a legitimate way to pursue that claim , and it does not involve entering the United States illegally . First , such people should make their asylum claim in the first country where they feel safe , i.e. , Mexico or some other country they are traversing to get here . Second , if for some reason they are threatened everywhere but the United States , they should show up at a port of entry and make their claim there rather than crossing the border illegally .
3 ) There is a significant moral cost to not enforcing the border . There is obviously a moral cost to separating a parent from a child and almost everyone would prefer not to do it . But , under current policy and with the current resources , the only practical alternative is letting family units who show up at the border live in the country for the duration . Not only does this make a mockery of our laws , it creates an incentive for people to keep bringing children with them .
Needless to say , children should not be making this journey that is fraught with peril . But there is now a premium on bringing children because of how we have handled these cases . They are considered chits .
Some migrants have admitted they brought their children not only to remove them from danger in such places as Central America and Africa , but because they believed it would cause the authorities to release them from custody sooner . Others have admitted to posing falsely with children who are not their own , and Border Patrol officials say that such instances of fraud are increasing .
According to azcentral.com , it is “ common to have parents entrust their children to a smuggler as a favor or for profit . ”
If someone is determined to come here illegally , the decent and safest thing would be to leave the child at home with a relative and send money back home . Because we favor family units over single adults , we are creating an incentive to do the opposite and use children to cut deals with smugglers .
4 ) Congress can fix this . Congress can change the rules so the Flores consent decree will no longer apply , and it can appropriate more money for family shelters at the border . This is an obvious thing to do that would eliminate the tension between enforcing our laws and keeping family units together . The Trump administration is throwing as many resources as it can at the border to expedite the process , and it desperately wants the Flores consent decree reversed . Despite some mixed messages , if the administration had its druthers , family units would be kept together and their cases settled quickly .
The missing piece here is Congress , but little outrage will be directed at it , and probably nothing will be done . And so our perverse system will remain in place and the crisis at the border will rumble on .","U.S. Border Patrol agents with illegal immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, May 9, 2018.

Some economic migrants are using children as chits, but the problem is fixable — if Congress acts.

The latest furor over Trump immigration policy involves the separation of children from parents at the border.

As usual, the outrage obscures more than it illuminates, so it’s worth walking through what’s happening here.

For the longest time, illegal immigration was driven by single males from Mexico. Over the last decade, the flow has shifted to women, children, and family units from Central America. This poses challenges we haven’t confronted before and has made what once were relatively minor wrinkles in the law loom very large.

The Trump administration isn’t changing the rules that pertain to separating an adult from the child. Those remain the same. Separation happens only if officials find that the adult is falsely claiming to be the child’s parent, or is a threat to the child, or is put into criminal proceedings.

It’s the last that is operative here. The past practice had been to give a free pass to an adult who is part of a family unit. The new Trump policy is to prosecute all adults. The idea is to send a signal that we are serious about our laws and to create a deterrent against re-entry. (Illegal entry is a misdemeanor, illegal re-entry a felony.)

When a migrant is prosecuted for illegal entry, he or she is taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals. In no circumstance anywhere in the U.S. do the marshals care for the children of people they take into custody. The child is taken into the custody of HHS, who cares for them at temporary shelters.

The criminal proceedings are exceptionally short, assuming there is no aggravating factor such as a prior illegal entity or another crime. The migrants generally plead guilty, and they are then sentenced to time served, typically all in the same day, although practices vary along the border. After this, they are returned to the custody of ICE.

If the adult then wants to go home, in keeping with the expedited order of removal that is issued as a matter of course, it’s relatively simple. The adult should be reunited quickly with his or her child, and the family returned home as a unit. In this scenario, there’s only a very brief separation.

Where it becomes much more of an issue is if the adult files an asylum claim. In that scenario, the adults are almost certainly going to be detained longer than the government is allowed to hold their children.

That’s because of something called the Flores Consent Decree from 1997. It says that unaccompanied children can be held only 20 days. A ruling by the Ninth Circuit extended this 20-day limit to children who come as part of family units. So even if we want to hold a family unit together, we are forbidden from doing so.

The clock ticking on the time the government can hold a child will almost always run out before an asylum claim is settled. The migrant is allowed ten days to seek an attorney, and there may be continuances or other complications.

This creates the choice of either releasing the adults and children together into the country pending the ajudication of the asylum claim, or holding the adults and releasing the children. If the adult is held, HHS places the child with a responsible party in the U.S., ideally a relative (migrants are likely to have family and friends here).

Even if Flores didn’t exist, the government would be very constrained in how many family units it can accommodate. ICE has only about 3,000 family spaces in shelters. It is also limited in its overall space at the border, which is overwhelmed by the ongoing influx. This means that — whatever the Trump administration would prefer to do — many adults are still swiftly released.

Why try to hold adults at all? First of all, if an asylum-seeker is detained, it means that the claim goes through the process much more quickly, a couple of months or less rather than years. Second, if an adult is released while the claim is pending, the chances of ever finding that person again once he or she is in the country are dicey, to say the least. It is tantamount to allowing the migrant to live here, no matter what the merits of the case.

A few points about all this:

Advertisement

1) Family units can go home quickly. The option that both honors our laws and keeps family units together is a swift return home after prosecution. But immigrant advocates hate it because they want the migrants to stay in the United States. How you view this question will depend a lot on how you view the motivation of the migrants (and how seriously you take our laws and our border).

2) There’s a better way to claim asylum. Every indication is that the migrant flow to the United States is discretionary. It nearly dried up at the beginning of the Trump administration when migrants believed that they had no chance of getting into the United States. Now, it is going in earnest again because the message got out that, despite the rhetoric, the policy at the border hasn’t changed. This strongly suggests that the flow overwhelmingly consists of economic migrants who would prefer to live in the United States, rather than victims of persecution in their home country who have no option but to get out.

Even if a migrant does have a credible fear of persecution, there is a legitimate way to pursue that claim, and it does not involve entering the United States illegally. First, such people should make their asylum claim in the first country where they feel safe, i.e., Mexico or some other country they are traversing to get here. Second, if for some reason they are threatened everywhere but the United States, they should show up at a port of entry and make their claim there rather than crossing the border illegally.

3) There is a significant moral cost to not enforcing the border. There is obviously a moral cost to separating a parent from a child and almost everyone would prefer not to do it. But, under current policy and with the current resources, the only practical alternative is letting family units who show up at the border live in the country for the duration. Not only does this make a mockery of our laws, it creates an incentive for people to keep bringing children with them.

Needless to say, children should not be making this journey that is fraught with peril. But there is now a premium on bringing children because of how we have handled these cases. They are considered chits.

In April, the New York Times reported:

Some migrants have admitted they brought their children not only to remove them from danger in such places as Central America and Africa, but because they believed it would cause the authorities to release them from custody sooner. Others have admitted to posing falsely with children who are not their own, and Border Patrol officials say that such instances of fraud are increasing.

According to azcentral.com, it is “common to have parents entrust their children to a smuggler as a favor or for profit.”

If someone is determined to come here illegally, the decent and safest thing would be to leave the child at home with a relative and send money back home. Because we favor family units over single adults, we are creating an incentive to do the opposite and use children to cut deals with smugglers.

4) Congress can fix this. Congress can change the rules so the Flores consent decree will no longer apply, and it can appropriate more money for family shelters at the border. This is an obvious thing to do that would eliminate the tension between enforcing our laws and keeping family units together. The Trump administration is throwing as many resources as it can at the border to expedite the process, and it desperately wants the Flores consent decree reversed. Despite some mixed messages, if the administration had its druthers, family units would be kept together and their cases settled quickly.

The missing piece here is Congress, but little outrage will be directed at it, and probably nothing will be done. And so our perverse system will remain in place and the crisis at the border will rumble on.

immigration,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44515123,US child migrants: First ladies speak out on Trump separation policy,,,"The former US First Lady Laura Bush has condemned a controversial policy that splits up families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border .
Writing in the Washington Post newspaper , she describes the separation of children from their parents as cruel , immoral and heart-breaking .
Her comments follow growing controversy over President Donald Trump 's `` zero-tolerance '' immigration policy .
Mrs Trump `` hates to see children separated from their families '' , her spokeswoman said .
She repeated her husband 's call for `` both sides '' to work on immigration reform as a solution . However , fact-checkers point out that the policy was introduced by Mr Trump 's attorney general and does not require congressional action to be stopped .
In a recent six-week period there were nearly 2,000 family separations following a crackdown on illegal border crossings .
Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry .
As a result , hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centres , including warehouses and converted supermarkets , and kept away from their parents .
Laura Bush , wife of the former Republican President George W Bush and a Texas resident , launched an outspoken attack on the policy .
`` This zero-tolerance policy is cruel . It is immoral . And it breaks my heart , '' she wrote in the Washington Post .
`` Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert . ''
`` These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War Two , now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history , '' she added .
Earlier Mrs Trump said she `` hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [ Republicans and Democrats in Congress ] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform '' .
`` We need to be a country that follows all laws , but also a country that governs with heart , '' her statement added .

The former US First Lady Laura Bush has condemned a controversial policy that splits up families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border.

Writing in the Washington Post newspaper, she describes the separation of children from their parents as cruel, immoral and heart-breaking.

Her comments follow growing controversy over President Donald Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy.

Earlier Melania Trump made a rare statement expressing concern.

Mrs Trump ""hates to see children separated from their families"", her spokeswoman said.

She repeated her husband's call for ""both sides"" to work on immigration reform as a solution. However, fact-checkers point out that the policy was introduced by Mr Trump's attorney general and does not require congressional action to be stopped.

In a recent six-week period there were nearly 2,000 family separations following a crackdown on illegal border crossings.

Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry.

As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents.

What's been said?

Laura Bush, wife of the former Republican President George W Bush and a Texas resident, launched an outspoken attack on the policy.

""This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,"" she wrote in the Washington Post.

""Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert.""

""These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War Two, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history,"" she added.

Earlier Mrs Trump said she ""hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [Republicans and Democrats in Congress] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform"".

""We need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart,"" her statement added.

The first ladies' comments come amid growing alarm over the impact of the policy.

On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the US to end what he called its ""unconscionable"" strategy of forced separations.

Earlier Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended her agency's role at the border, saying: ""We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.""

But she said authorities would remove children if the parent they were travelling with had broken the law.

Who is to blame?

Mr Trump has said a law ""Democrats gave us"" is responsible for the policy, but it is unclear which law he is referring to.

In a tweet on Saturday he urged Democrats to work with Republicans to create new legislation.

However, critics have pointed out that detaining children separately from their parents is the consequence of a policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to deter new arrivals.

Until this policy was announced, such families were usually subject to civil deportation proceedings, which did not require separation.

What's happening now?

The recent child detentions have resulted in some shelters and foster homes reporting that they are running out of space.

Is the policy working?

The number of families trying to enter the US overland without documentation is on the rise.

In the first two weeks of the new ""zero-tolerance"" approach, 658 minors - including many babies and toddlers - were separated from the adults that travelled with them, according to US border officials.

In many of the cases, the families have been reunited after the parent was released from detention. However, there are reports of people being kept apart for weeks and even months.

But it is not clear if this new tougher policy will stop the migrants from travelling.

Bush lays out his plan with co-author Clint Bolick in the new book Immigration Wars. Bush tells NPR's Steve Inskeep that they propose legalizing undocumented immigrants ""after there is a recognition that if people come here illegally, they have to pay a fine or do community service [and] make sure they don't commit any serious crimes.""

On why Republicans need to sign on to an immigration overhaul

Bush: ""Being against other people's policies eventually puts you in a downward spiral.

And so Clint and I believe that what we've proposed is a good, conservative, economically driven, respect-for-the-rule-of-law set of policies that would work, and it's something that the Republicans could embrace.""

On whether Republicans are fighting too many budget battles

Bush: ""No, I think it's correct to say that we have a spending problem that's going to overwhelm all the priorities that people in public life would want, so advocating spending restraint is important. But I think it also ought to be combined with an advocacy of reform ... of our entitlement system and engage the president to get him to be public about what his plan is.""

On overhauling Medicare

Bush: ""If the president is for increasing the eligibility rate, which I think makes sense, given the changing demographic nature of our country, if he's for whatever substantive changes he's for, he should be public about it. This is not a radical idea. This is how it has been done in American history — presidents have led, and they have used all the skills at their disposal to convince and persuade and to find common ground. My brother did it, Bill Clinton did it, my dad did it, Ronald Reagan did it, Lyndon Johnson did it. Why is it such a hard thing for us now to expect presidents to lead?""

`` We will begin moving them out Day One . As soon as I take office . Day One . In joint operation with local , state , and federal law enforcement , '' he said , according to transcripts .
As he has in the past , Mr. Trump tied his promise to carry out deportations to anti-globalist economic ideas . But he also drew a direct line between the fortunes of the country 's native-born laborers and the presence of undocumented immigrants – a connection he has rarely made in his remarks on the topic .
`` While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people , many , many , this does n't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education , who compete directly against vulnerable American workers , and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back , '' he said .
`` We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers , the forgotten people . Workers . We 're going to take care of our workers . ''
But the globalization that Trump denounces has also contributed to a decades-long reshaping of unions – a traditional voice for workers , and often vocal opponents of globalization – toward greater inclusion of immigrants , even those without legal status . And the reasons behind organized labor 's shifting stance on immigrant workers , now decades in the making , may undercut Trump 's narrative of foreigners arriving to America to crowd out the native-born .
`` If you have a union job , you know that immigrants are not stealing your jobs , '' says Lowell Turner , a professor at Cornell University ’ s School of Industrial and Labor Relations , in an interview with The ███ . `` You see your reality around you and know that 's not happening . ''
This electoral season , Trump has seen greater support among union members than any Republican candidate in recent memory – enough to spook Democrats and union leaders . His core support in the primaries , surveys showed , was from white men who worked with their hands , and they tended to look favorably upon both unions and economic policies typically considered progressive .
He has also bragged of having `` tremendous support '' with union members .
`` Manhattan is a hundred percent – you 're building a building , it 's essentially a hundred percent union . So I 've worked with unions over the years – I 've done very well with unions , '' he told a crowd in New Hampshire in February , according to The Washington Times .
But he has garnered endorsements from only two unions – those representing border patrol and New England police – and his low approval among Hispanics and other minorities has likely helped ensure that the vast majority of union endorsements have chosen to remain firmly in the Democrats ' camp .
One of those Hillary Clinton supporters is Richard Trumka , president of the AFL-CIO , who was the guest at a Monitor Breakfast earlier this week :
Trumka expressed confidence in organized labor ’ s ability to turn out votes for Clinton , despite Mr. Trump ’ s inroads into the white working class . “ We ’ re probably about where we were with Barack Obama at this point with the election , ” Trumka said , adding that the more organized labor gets information out to workers , “ the better off we get . ”
For much of their early history in the United States , unions viewed certain groups of immigrants with suspicion , if not outright animus . Perhaps the most notoriously xenophobic law in US history , the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 , was passed largely at the behest of the organized labor . The fear of job replacement faded after the passage of a 1924 national-origins quota , as immigration levels fell for several decades . When national reform came up for passage again in 1986 , unions ' focus was on winning sanctions against employers that hired the undocumented , whom they saw as potential strikebreakers .
But by then , changes in unions ' attitudes were already beginning . Starting in the late 1970s , deregulation measures had sent membership numbers reeling . And in urban areas like Los Angeles , deteriorated wages , benefits , and working conditions caused many native-born workers to abandon certain lines of low-skilled manual jobs , according to the 2000 book `` Voices from the Front Lines , '' edited by sociologists Ruth Milkman and Kent Wong .
When they left , immigrants stepped in to take their place , mostly from Central America and Mexico .
`` They were soon replaced by low-wage immigrants , and as employment skyrocketed [ in those sectors ] , vigorous new organizing efforts emerged among the newly recruited foreign-born workers , '' Dr. Milkman and Mr. Wong write .
Union leaders in favor of organizing immigrants thought they were likely to be too nervous for collective action , however . Campaigns like the Service Employees International Union 's Janitors for Justice , first conceived in 1985 , won important victories from employers and showed unions that immigrants , including the undocumented , were capable of loud advocacy , Dr. Milkman tells the Monitor .
`` I myself was very surprised at the successes that occurred in that area , '' she says . `` The whole thing – immigrant unionization – is one of the few bright spots in a bleak story . ''

As those efforts were replicated across labor , especially in meatpacking , hospitality , restaurants , and other service industries , immigrants and native-born Hispanics began to exercise growing clout within the ranks . In 2000 , the AFL-CIO , the largest union confederation in the country , called for an end to employer sanctions , and for legal status for 6 million undocumented immigrants . The move came largely as a result of pressure from an immigrant-led coalition known as the Change to Win Federation , and it caused a sea change in thought .
`` I think there was a shift in consciousness , '' says Mae Ngai , a historian at Columbia University who specializes in immigration and labor . `` Even if some of these older unions like the Machinists were not organizing immigrants , they could see other people doing it . They could see that immigrants were not their enemy , not their competition , not their enemy they had to fear .

His core support in the primaries, surveys showed, was from white men who worked with their hands, and they tended to look favorably upon both unions and economic policies typically considered progressive.

He has also bragged of having ""tremendous support"" with union members.

""Manhattan is a hundred percent – you're building a building, it's essentially a hundred percent union. So I've worked with unions over the years – I've done very well with unions,"" he told a crowd in New Hampshire in February, according to The Washington Times.

But he has garnered endorsements from only two unions – those representing border patrol and New England police – and his low approval among Hispanics and other minorities has likely helped ensure that the vast majority of union endorsements have chosen to remain firmly in the Democrats' camp.

One of those Hillary Clinton supporters is Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, who was the guest at a Monitor Breakfast earlier this week:

Trumka expressed confidence in organized labor’s ability to turn out votes for Clinton, despite Mr. Trump’s inroads into the white working class. “We’re probably about where we were with Barack Obama at this point with the election,” Trumka said, adding that the more organized labor gets information out to workers, “the better off we get.”

For much of their early history in the United States, unions viewed certain groups of immigrants with suspicion, if not outright animus. Perhaps the most notoriously xenophobic law in US history, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, was passed largely at the behest of the organized labor. The fear of job replacement faded after the passage of a 1924 national-origins quota, as immigration levels fell for several decades. When national reform came up for passage again in 1986, unions' focus was on winning sanctions against employers that hired the undocumented, whom they saw as potential strikebreakers.

But by then, changes in unions' attitudes were already beginning. Starting in the late 1970s, deregulation measures had sent membership numbers reeling. And in urban areas like Los Angeles, deteriorated wages, benefits, and working conditions caused many native-born workers to abandon certain lines of low-skilled manual jobs, according to the 2000 book ""Voices from the Front Lines,"" edited by sociologists Ruth Milkman and Kent Wong.

When they left, immigrants stepped in to take their place, mostly from Central America and Mexico.

""They were soon replaced by low-wage immigrants, and as employment skyrocketed [in those sectors], vigorous new organizing efforts emerged among the newly recruited foreign-born workers,"" Dr. Milkman and Mr. Wong write.

Union leaders in favor of organizing immigrants thought they were likely to be too nervous for collective action, however. Campaigns like the Service Employees International Union's Janitors for Justice, first conceived in 1985, won important victories from employers and showed unions that immigrants, including the undocumented, were capable of loud advocacy, Dr. Milkman tells the Monitor.

""I myself was very surprised at the successes that occurred in that area,"" she says. ""The whole thing – immigrant unionization – is one of the few bright spots in a bleak story.""

As those efforts were replicated across labor, especially in meatpacking, hospitality, restaurants, and other service industries, immigrants and native-born Hispanics began to exercise growing clout within the ranks. In 2000, the AFL-CIO, the largest union confederation in the country, called for an end to employer sanctions, and for legal status for 6 million undocumented immigrants. The move came largely as a result of pressure from an immigrant-led coalition known as the Change to Win Federation, and it caused a sea change in thought.

""I think there was a shift in consciousness,"" says Mae Ngai, a historian at Columbia University who specializes in immigration and labor. ""Even if some of these older unions like the Machinists were not organizing immigrants, they could see other people doing it. They could see that immigrants were not their enemy, not their competition, not their enemy they had to fear.""",www.csmonitor.com,center,UEn3Oy13yPd65jux

Senate Democratic leaders are grappling with how far to push President Barack Obama on immigration before the crucial midterm elections.

For all the insistence that Obama take bold action — and despite a furious push from immigration activists — there’s palpable fear that Obama could cause trouble for the Senate’s most vulnerable Democrats if he decides to circumvent Congress before the elections to make immigration changes through executive action. Such a move could complicate the reelection bids of Democrats in red states like Arkansas, North Carolina, Louisiana and Alaska — races that could determine whether the party will maintain its grip on the Senate.

The dynamic is leaving the Senate’s most powerful Democrats in a jam. Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington all called for executive action to halt deportations. In March, Schumer even said the White House should move on the matter “in October.”

But now the leaders are coy. Representatives for each of the senators refused to say this week whether their bosses want the president to move before November or wait until after the elections.

“The timing of it is entirely up to him,” Durbin spokesman Ben Marter said of the president.

Democrats are trying to shift focus back to the Republican controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has already told Obama he has no plans to act on immigration this year.

Added a Schumer spokesman: “The president would not be forced to even contemplate taking independent action to cope with our broken system had House Republicans not spent more than a year blocking the Senate’s already-passed bipartisan immigration reform legislation.” The spokesman also declined to weigh in further.

The White House declined to comment.

The debate reflects the balancing act that Democrats are walking on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue when it comes to immigration. Obama and Democratic congressional leaders are weighing calls from activists to do something to stem deportations but risk going too far and flipping the Senate to the GOP. That would give Republicans full control of Congress and an even more powerful platform to block immigration reform.

The GOP is already beginning to pounce on the issue, making immigration reform an issue in key Senate races.

Atlanta (CNN) - While troubles over health care and immigration continue to dog the Obama administration, Vice President Joe Biden addressed a friendly crowd Thursday, delivering the keynote speech at a naturalization ceremony.

immigration,The Guardian,0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/us-mexico-border-trump-wall-dispatch,"What is life really like in border country, where Trump wants his wall?",2019-01-15,"Charles Davis, Edwin Delgado, Ed Pilkington, Ana Adlerstein","Donald Trump ’ s “ big , beautiful wall ” has become the trademark of his presidency . It is the promise that more than any other has energized his base , and riled his opponents , and his dogged attachment to it has now brought a large part of the US government to a historic 25 days of partial shutdown .
The potency of Trump ’ s wall – for his supporters and his detractors – stems from its simplicity . Build it tall , build it wide – he has pledged 1,000 miles of it – and America will be safe again .
But how does that uncomplicated notion compare to the complexity of the border itself ? Taken as a whole , the 1,954 miles of US-Mexican border is a place of astounding diversity – of terrain , of land use , of city and countryside , of ethnicity . It traverses desert , river , mountain and sea .
There is diversity , too , of political view among the 7.5 million people who live in US border counties . Some are ardent backers of Trump ’ s wall . Others see their future , and the future of America , as being inextricably linked to that of their neighbor to the south .
Hike 45 minutes past salt marshes and sand dunes , down a lonely beach empty but for occasional tourists on horseback , and you arrive at a steel fence that juts out into the Pacific Ocean .
This is where Trump would like to start building his wall should he find the billions of dollars necessary . With the impasse over funding , which prompted the shutdown , administration officials have started to describe what ’ s already here , as well as repairs to a two-mile stretch of fence in Calexico 100 miles to the east , as Trump ’ s wall . They are not .
The length of wall that has been built by Trump since he entered the White House in January 2017 is zero .
This is the westernmost point of the US-Mexico border , on the outskirts of San Ysidro , California , a suburb of San Diego that is home to one of the busiest border crossings in the world . Here , the hopes of thousands of migrants who try to make it to the US every year are often dashed .
The fence stretches out just to where the waves break , and reaches 15 or 20ft , not the looming 30ft the president has demanded .
Adjacent to this stretch of fence is Friendship Park , a patch of bi-national ground where loved ones from both sides of the border are allowed to meet . The name is paradoxical given the hostility Trump has engendered since he began his wall obsession .
Outside Friendship Park – which only takes 10 visitors at a time – separated families and friends must make do with waving at each other from a distance . Today the US side is unpopulated save for a lone American , and on the Mexican side a father and young boy are looking northwards . “ USA ! ” the man says , pointing through a slot for his son ’ s benefit .
From San Ysidro , the fence extends for 46 of the next 60 miles of border before finally giving way way to the unforgiving desert . That ’ s 46 out of a total of 654 miles of fencing that already exists , much of it in various stages of disrepair .
Those hundreds of miles of double reinforced fencing and wire meshing were the product of a different era in politics where some degree of bipartisan consensus was possible . They were largely funded by the Secure Fence Act , an immigration compromise reached in 2006 under former president George W Bush .
Compromise seems unthinkable these days . Trump has laid out a vision of the border that is harshly binary : on his side of the territorial line there is the rule of law , hard work and freedom ; on the other side there is criminality , gangs and drug smuggling .
The purpose of the wall , in Trump ’ s dystopia , is to prevent America being overrun by the dark forces billowing out of its neighbor . In his Oval Office address to the nation last week he said : “ Over the years , thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don ’ t act right now . ”
But talk to people in San Ysidro on the American side of the border , and they will tell you about fear and intimidation inflicted on them by the US government .
In this town , where 90 % of residents speak Spanish at home , the land south of the border is not equated with lawlessness and evil , but with family , friends and affordable healthcare . If there ’ s a dystopia , its not the Mexican one of Trump ’ s imagining but the hardened militarism that is fast emerging on the US side replete with helicopters , barricades and armed border patrol .
“ The feeling like you ’ re in a war zone is so dramatic the last couple months , ” said Lisa Cuestas , head of Casa Familiar , a non-profit that provides social services to San Ysidro .
Militarization sped up after the arrival in Tijuana , on the Mexican side , of the caravan of Central American migrants which Trump made so much of during the November midterm elections , calling it an “ immigration invasion ” . Now members of the caravan are stuck in Mexico and barbed wire has proliferated everywhere like a mutant weed .
Estrella Flores has family and a job in San Ysidro , working with youth at Casa Familiar , but she lives in Tijuana with her husband and 18-month-old child . Her commute has become hellish since Trump ’ s border crackdown .
“ The first time I went across the border where they had the barricades and the barbed wire and the helicopters I was like : ‘ Am I in a war zone ? What ’ s going on here ? I ’ m just trying to get to work. ’ This isn ’ t just a friendly crossing , it could turn very bad , very quickly . ”
Such views are commonplace across California . A poll conducted by the San Diego Union-Tribune after Trump ’ s Oval Office speech found that 56 % of Californians opposed the idea of the wall , compared with 34 % in favor .
That ’ s not surprising for a state that is a leading force of progressive politics in the US . But California is also significant for having more undocumented migrants than any other state – 2.4 million to Texas ’ s 1.7 million .
Close by is the site of Trump ’ s eight wall prototypes . He came here last March to pose for photos in front of the giant slabs of concrete and steel . Now they languish and rust .
According to a later report by the Government Accountability Office , the eight model sections were riddled with design and construction flaws . US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) tested the slabs and found they can be breached .
The first light glistens off the frosted spines of the cholla cacti as 30 volunteers in neon yellow shirts fan out to comb the desert under a pale pink sky . Ely Ortiz , the leader of the Águilas del desierto ( Eagles of the desert ) rallies his team who have driven through the night from San Diego to Ajo , Arizona . He tells them the last time they searched this area they found 11 sets of remains .
The volunteers are joined by a team of cadaver dogs to help in the grim search . A dog called Zabra , whose last job was looking for victims of the California wildfires , is unaccustomed to the desert terrain and has to stop every couple of hundred yards to have barbed spines yanked from her paws .
Unexploded ordnance dropped by the US military in training is one element of danger for migrants .
Trump can already count on a metaphorical wall here . This is the most frequently travelled , but also most deadly , migrant corridor across the Sonoran desert .
Water is scarce and temperatures rise above 120F ( 49C ) in the summer months . The official CBP count records 7,209 deaths along the south-western border in the past 20 years , but that is almost certainly a gross underestimate .
Despite the human tragedy , federal prosecutors have seen fit to prosecute nine volunteers with the humanitarian group No More Deaths . Their offence : “ littering ” and driving on restricted roads in the Cabeza Prieta reserve when responding to search and rescue calls . The nine will face trial on Tuesday in a federal district court in Tucson .
“ The irony is that they tell us we can ’ t drive here or leave water because it ’ s protected wilderness , but meanwhile border patrol drives their trucks and ATVs off road , and fly helicopters and drones wherever they want , ” one of the nine , Parker Deighan , told ███ .
Trump ’ s policy of “ prevention through deterrence ” is forcing migrants to take greater risks . As legal admission to the US through official ports of entry becomes ever more restricted , migrants are being “ funneled ” away from fenced sections of the border towards the desert .
One of the only towns in the area is Ajo . Today it ’ s a ghost town , as its copper mine closed in the 1980s . Since then most residents have switched to the main local job-provider : border security .
Ajo Samaritans recently gathered in the plaza for a vigil to honor the lives of the people who succumbed in the surrounding wilderness . They laid out 118 white crosses , one for each of those lost in 2018 . Those whose bones had yet to be identified were called desconocido – unknown .
Before Trump decided to throw a bone to his voter base during the midterm election campaign last year by sending more than 5,000 active-duty military troops to the border , the gate at Lukeville port of entry in Arizona was almost always open . American tourists , seeking to flee the winter , would blithely pour through heading for the beach at Rocky Point , an hour ’ s drive south on the Mexican coast .
Trump ’ s border clampdown hasn ’ t only cramped the style of beach-lovers as they pass through the now half-closed gate . Over the past two months , the US military have brought with them concertina wire and a double stack of shipping containers , ready to be used to block the entry as an impenetrable barricade should another caravan – or “ immigrant invasion ” – arise .
Not that there ’ s any sign of that . Most of the traffic through Lukeville is commercial and passenger , and the main concern of federal agents is not migrants but drugs .
It is one of the myths propagated by the Trump administration that America is awash with drugs that have flooded into the country through lack of a wall . In his Oval Office address last week , Trump said that “ the border wall would very quickly pay for itself ” by halting the flow of illicit drugs – implying that narcotics came into the US through sections of open border .
Not true . In fact , most illegal drugs are hidden away in cars and tractor-trailers as they pass over international bridges and through small ports of entry like Lukeville . The 2018 annual drug threat assessment of the Drug Enforcement Administration points out that for drugs like heroin , up to 90 % enters the country through ports of entry .
Another contradiction is that Trump insists on immigrants showing up legally at border crossings , yet for those who do so he has made it increasingly difficult for them to claim asylum . In November the Trump administration announced it would deny asylum to anyone who tries to cross the border illegally , though a federal court has since temporarily blocked the new regulation .
Meanwhile , a new system of “ metering ” has been introduced that amounts to a federal slowdown at legal entry points . As a result , growing numbers of increasingly desperate families , most coming from the trio of violence-ridden Central American countries – Honduras , El Salvador and Guatemala – have been left stranded in Mexico .
At Lukeville , asylum seekers following Trump ’ s orders and showing up legally at the port of entry have simply been turned away . ███ spoke to Alberto ( not his real name ) in a shelter on the Mexican side . In November , he presented himself at Lukeville and asked for asylum .
The supervising agent there told him to leave , claiming it was out of hours . Alberto was left on the streets where , days before , mafia members had told him they would kill him if they saw him again .
Volunteer groups working with immigrants protested , and CBP apologized . Now when asked if they accept claims , Lukeville agents repeat the official mantra : “ Asylum seekers are being accepted at all ports of entry . ”
That doesn ’ t mean claims will be successful . Alberto did try a second time to have his claim heard . He will testify before an immigration judge in two weeks ’ time .
There is no place along the border that more strongly rebuts Trump ’ s dystopian vision than El Paso . The Texas city is so intertwined with Ciudad Juárez across the Rio Grande to the south that they are virtually inseparable .
Between them they are home to almost 3 million people – roughly the size of Chicago . About 20,000 pedestrians and more than 35,000 vehicles cross into El Paso from Mexico every day , many to work , others to go to school or shop .
It ’ s two-way traffic : Americans in El Paso also regularly cross into Juárez to visit family or experience the nightlife .
Eighty per cent of El Paso ’ s residents are of Hispanic origin , and a quarter of the city ’ s population was born outside the US .
Mary Gonzalez , the Democratic representative for El Paso in the Texas house , said : “ It ’ s a very generous , diverse , multinational , welcoming and loving community . That human component is left out when the border is discussed . ”
Retail sales in the US side of the twin cities are estimated to generate $ 10bn a year , with a fifth attributed to Mexican shoppers .
Against that reality , Trump has painted a picture of rampant crime and the threat of violence being imported into the US . That ’ s a particularly loaded argument for El Paso , given the historically high murder rate in neighboring Juárez .
Last year saw it rise again to almost 200 people killed each month . Yet crime in El Paso on the US side of the border remains relatively low . Violent crimes have fallen sharply from about 6,500 in 1993 to around 3,000 today .
That ’ s why Beto O ’ Rourke , the rising star of the Democratic party and former Congress representative for this strongly left-leaning city , lauded El Paso as the “ safest city in America ” as part of his senatorial election campaign in November . ( His claim wasn ’ t entirely accurate – factcheckers found it was only “ half true ” . )
O ’ Rourke failed in his bid to unseat Ted Cruz in the midterm elections , but the fact that he came within three points of doing so suggests that Texans might be more open to his liberal stance on immigration and less in step with Trump than is often assumed .
Opinion polls show that while most Texans are concerned about immigrants entering the country illegally , most are also opposed to Trump ’ s wall .
Some people go as far as to suggest that El Paso could be a harbinger of things to come for the whole of America . As Josiah Heyman , director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies , put it : “ El Paso is a place where there is a vision of the future , where people , instead of being part of a closed defensive community , are able to find the joy of relating to others . ”
Travel 40 miles east from El Paso along the Rio Grande to Tornillo , and it feels a world away from the big city . Vast open areas are filled with orchards , and pecan nut and dairy farms .
Of the 1,317 miles of border with no fence or human barrier , much of it lies along the 1,248 miles of Rio Grande . The river serves as the demarcation line between the two countries all the way from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico .
Powerful currents , towering canyons and cliffs that in the Big Bend section rise to 50ft reduce the need for a solid barrier through much of the river ’ s trajectory .
Still , Trump has his eye on the Rio Grande for his wall . Of the $ 5.7bn he is demanding from Congress , a sizable chunk would go towards building more than 100 miles of wall along the river .
Here just outside Tornillo , the existing fence that runs west to Sunland Park in New Mexico has a 10-mile gap in it . Despite the lack of an artificial barrier , most locals go about their daily routine without fuss .
Miguel Alvarez , who has lived close to the border for 25 years , said the arrival of the fence has made precious little difference . “ You still see small groups of people passing through just like they did before any fencing , ” he said .
A farmer who didn ’ t want to reveal his name said he would feel more comfortable if the gap in the fencing were closed . “ I haven ’ t had any issues with people coming across , but you never know , ” he said .
Tornillo itself fell under the national spotlight after the Trump administration chose the Marcelino Serna port of entry south of the town to house thousands of unaccompanied minors in a tent-like facility . It was meant to be temporary , designed to help deal with hundreds of children who had been separated from their families as a result of Trump ’ s crackdown on border crossers .
But it rapidly grew , to up to 2,400 beds , becoming the face of the brutality of Trump ’ s policy of tearing families apart as a form of deterrent .
In November , a government watchdog warned that conditions in the tent city were putting children at risk , and since then the numbers have been reduced until the last teenager was transferred out of the facility last week . As far as locals are concerned , its closure couldn ’ t happen fast enough .
They are eager for things to get back to normal . Or at least as close to what passes as normal these days .
• This article was amended on 15 January 2019 because the fence is not unbroken for the 46 miles from San Ysidro to the desert , as an earlier version said .","Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful wall” has become the trademark of his presidency. It is the promise that more than any other has energized his base, and riled his opponents, and his dogged attachment to it has now brought a large part of the US government to a historic 25 days of partial shutdown.

There is diversity, too, of political view among the 7.5 million people who live in US border counties. Some are ardent backers of Trump’s wall. Others see their future, and the future of America, as being inextricably linked to that of their neighbor to the south.

Friendship through the fence

Hike 45 minutes past salt marshes and sand dunes, down a lonely beach empty but for occasional tourists on horseback, and you arrive at a steel fence that juts out into the Pacific Ocean.

This is where Trump would like to start building his wall should he find the billions of dollars necessary. With the impasse over funding, which prompted the shutdown, administration officials have started to describe what’s already here, as well as repairs to a two-mile stretch of fence in Calexico 100 miles to the east, as Trump’s wall. They are not.

The length of wall that has been built by Trump since he entered the White House in January 2017 is zero.

This is the westernmost point of the US-Mexico border, on the outskirts of San Ysidro, California, a suburb of San Diego that is home to one of the busiest border crossings in the world. Here, the hopes of thousands of migrants who try to make it to the US every year are often dashed.

The fence stretches out just to where the waves break, and reaches 15 or 20ft, not the looming 30ft the president has demanded.

Adjacent to this stretch of fence is Friendship Park, a patch of bi-national ground where loved ones from both sides of the border are allowed to meet. The name is paradoxical given the hostility Trump has engendered since he began his wall obsession.

Outside Friendship Park – which only takes 10 visitors at a time – separated families and friends must make do with waving at each other from a distance. Today the US side is unpopulated save for a lone American, and on the Mexican side a father and young boy are looking northwards. “USA!” the man says, pointing through a slot for his son’s benefit.

From San Ysidro, the fence extends for 46 of the next 60 miles of border before finally giving way way to the unforgiving desert. That’s 46 out of a total of 654 miles of fencing that already exists, much of it in various stages of disrepair.

Those hundreds of miles of double reinforced fencing and wire meshing were the product of a different era in politics where some degree of bipartisan consensus was possible. They were largely funded by the Secure Fence Act, an immigration compromise reached in 2006 under former president George W Bush.

Compromise seems unthinkable these days. Trump has laid out a vision of the border that is harshly binary: on his side of the territorial line there is the rule of law, hard work and freedom; on the other side there is criminality, gangs and drug smuggling.

The purpose of the wall, in Trump’s dystopia, is to prevent America being overrun by the dark forces billowing out of its neighbor. In his Oval Office address to the nation last week he said: “Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.”

But talk to people in San Ysidro on the American side of the border, and they will tell you about fear and intimidation inflicted on them by the US government.

In this town, where 90% of residents speak Spanish at home, the land south of the border is not equated with lawlessness and evil, but with family, friends and affordable healthcare. If there’s a dystopia, its not the Mexican one of Trump’s imagining but the hardened militarism that is fast emerging on the US side replete with helicopters, barricades and armed border patrol.

“The feeling like you’re in a war zone is so dramatic the last couple months,” said Lisa Cuestas, head of Casa Familiar, a non-profit that provides social services to San Ysidro.

Militarization sped up after the arrival in Tijuana, on the Mexican side, of the caravan of Central American migrants which Trump made so much of during the November midterm elections, calling it an “immigration invasion”. Now members of the caravan are stuck in Mexico and barbed wire has proliferated everywhere like a mutant weed.

Estrella Flores has family and a job in San Ysidro, working with youth at Casa Familiar, but she lives in Tijuana with her husband and 18-month-old child. Her commute has become hellish since Trump’s border crackdown.

“The first time I went across the border where they had the barricades and the barbed wire and the helicopters I was like: ‘Am I in a war zone? What’s going on here? I’m just trying to get to work.’ This isn’t just a friendly crossing, it could turn very bad, very quickly.”

Such views are commonplace across California. A poll conducted by the San Diego Union-Tribune after Trump’s Oval Office speech found that 56% of Californians opposed the idea of the wall, compared with 34% in favor.

That’s not surprising for a state that is a leading force of progressive politics in the US. But California is also significant for having more undocumented migrants than any other state – 2.4 million to Texas’s 1.7 million.

Close by is the site of Trump’s eight wall prototypes. He came here last March to pose for photos in front of the giant slabs of concrete and steel. Now they languish and rust.

According to a later report by the Government Accountability Office, the eight model sections were riddled with design and construction flaws. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tested the slabs and found they can be breached.

Death in the desert

The first light glistens off the frosted spines of the cholla cacti as 30 volunteers in neon yellow shirts fan out to comb the desert under a pale pink sky. Ely Ortiz, the leader of the Águilas del desierto (Eagles of the desert) rallies his team who have driven through the night from San Diego to Ajo, Arizona. He tells them the last time they searched this area they found 11 sets of remains.

The volunteers are joined by a team of cadaver dogs to help in the grim search. A dog called Zabra, whose last job was looking for victims of the California wildfires, is unaccustomed to the desert terrain and has to stop every couple of hundred yards to have barbed spines yanked from her paws.

Unexploded ordnance dropped by the US military in training is one element of danger for migrants.

Trump can already count on a metaphorical wall here. This is the most frequently travelled, but also most deadly, migrant corridor across the Sonoran desert.

Water is scarce and temperatures rise above 120F (49C) in the summer months. The official CBP count records 7,209 deaths along the south-western border in the past 20 years, but that is almost certainly a gross underestimate.

Despite the human tragedy, federal prosecutors have seen fit to prosecute nine volunteers with the humanitarian group No More Deaths. Their offence: “littering” and driving on restricted roads in the Cabeza Prieta reserve when responding to search and rescue calls. The nine will face trial on Tuesday in a federal district court in Tucson.

“The irony is that they tell us we can’t drive here or leave water because it’s protected wilderness, but meanwhile border patrol drives their trucks and ATVs off road, and fly helicopters and drones wherever they want,” one of the nine, Parker Deighan, told the Guardian.

Trump’s policy of “prevention through deterrence” is forcing migrants to take greater risks. As legal admission to the US through official ports of entry becomes ever more restricted, migrants are being “funneled” away from fenced sections of the border towards the desert.

One of the only towns in the area is Ajo. Today it’s a ghost town, as its copper mine closed in the 1980s. Since then most residents have switched to the main local job-provider: border security.

Ajo Samaritans recently gathered in the plaza for a vigil to honor the lives of the people who succumbed in the surrounding wilderness. They laid out 118 white crosses, one for each of those lost in 2018. Those whose bones had yet to be identified were called desconocido – unknown.

Making an entry

Before Trump decided to throw a bone to his voter base during the midterm election campaign last year by sending more than 5,000 active-duty military troops to the border, the gate at Lukeville port of entry in Arizona was almost always open. American tourists, seeking to flee the winter, would blithely pour through heading for the beach at Rocky Point, an hour’s drive south on the Mexican coast.

Trump’s border clampdown hasn’t only cramped the style of beach-lovers as they pass through the now half-closed gate. Over the past two months, the US military have brought with them concertina wire and a double stack of shipping containers, ready to be used to block the entry as an impenetrable barricade should another caravan – or “immigrant invasion” – arise.

Not that there’s any sign of that. Most of the traffic through Lukeville is commercial and passenger, and the main concern of federal agents is not migrants but drugs.

It is one of the myths propagated by the Trump administration that America is awash with drugs that have flooded into the country through lack of a wall. In his Oval Office address last week, Trump said that “the border wall would very quickly pay for itself” by halting the flow of illicit drugs – implying that narcotics came into the US through sections of open border.

Not true. In fact, most illegal drugs are hidden away in cars and tractor-trailers as they pass over international bridges and through small ports of entry like Lukeville. The 2018 annual drug threat assessment of the Drug Enforcement Administration points out that for drugs like heroin, up to 90% enters the country through ports of entry.

Another contradiction is that Trump insists on immigrants showing up legally at border crossings, yet for those who do so he has made it increasingly difficult for them to claim asylum. In November the Trump administration announced it would deny asylum to anyone who tries to cross the border illegally, though a federal court has since temporarily blocked the new regulation.

Meanwhile, a new system of “metering” has been introduced that amounts to a federal slowdown at legal entry points. As a result, growing numbers of increasingly desperate families, most coming from the trio of violence-ridden Central American countries – Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala – have been left stranded in Mexico.

At Lukeville, asylum seekers following Trump’s orders and showing up legally at the port of entry have simply been turned away. The Guardian spoke to Alberto (not his real name) in a shelter on the Mexican side. In November, he presented himself at Lukeville and asked for asylum.

The supervising agent there told him to leave, claiming it was out of hours. Alberto was left on the streets where, days before, mafia members had told him they would kill him if they saw him again.

Volunteer groups working with immigrants protested, and CBP apologized. Now when asked if they accept claims, Lukeville agents repeat the official mantra: “Asylum seekers are being accepted at all ports of entry.”

That doesn’t mean claims will be successful. Alberto did try a second time to have his claim heard. He will testify before an immigration judge in two weeks’ time.

The twin city

There is no place along the border that more strongly rebuts Trump’s dystopian vision than El Paso. The Texas city is so intertwined with Ciudad Juárez across the Rio Grande to the south that they are virtually inseparable.

Between them they are home to almost 3 million people – roughly the size of Chicago. About 20,000 pedestrians and more than 35,000 vehicles cross into El Paso from Mexico every day, many to work, others to go to school or shop.

It’s two-way traffic: Americans in El Paso also regularly cross into Juárez to visit family or experience the nightlife.

Eighty per cent of El Paso’s residents are of Hispanic origin, and a quarter of the city’s population was born outside the US.

Mary Gonzalez, the Democratic representative for El Paso in the Texas house, said: “It’s a very generous, diverse, multinational, welcoming and loving community. That human component is left out when the border is discussed.”

Retail sales in the US side of the twin cities are estimated to generate $10bn a year, with a fifth attributed to Mexican shoppers.

Against that reality, Trump has painted a picture of rampant crime and the threat of violence being imported into the US. That’s a particularly loaded argument for El Paso, given the historically high murder rate in neighboring Juárez.

Last year saw it rise again to almost 200 people killed each month. Yet crime in El Paso on the US side of the border remains relatively low. Violent crimes have fallen sharply from about 6,500 in 1993 to around 3,000 today.

That’s why Beto O’Rourke, the rising star of the Democratic party and former Congress representative for this strongly left-leaning city, lauded El Paso as the “safest city in America” as part of his senatorial election campaign in November. (His claim wasn’t entirely accurate – factcheckers found it was only “half true”.)

O’Rourke failed in his bid to unseat Ted Cruz in the midterm elections, but the fact that he came within three points of doing so suggests that Texans might be more open to his liberal stance on immigration and less in step with Trump than is often assumed.

Opinion polls show that while most Texans are concerned about immigrants entering the country illegally, most are also opposed to Trump’s wall.

Some people go as far as to suggest that El Paso could be a harbinger of things to come for the whole of America. As Josiah Heyman, director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies, put it: “El Paso is a place where there is a vision of the future, where people, instead of being part of a closed defensive community, are able to find the joy of relating to others.”

On the edge – the Rio Grande

Travel 40 miles east from El Paso along the Rio Grande to Tornillo, and it feels a world away from the big city. Vast open areas are filled with orchards, and pecan nut and dairy farms.

US border patrol vehicles keep a watchful eye.

Of the 1,317 miles of border with no fence or human barrier, much of it lies along the 1,248 miles of Rio Grande. The river serves as the demarcation line between the two countries all the way from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico.

Powerful currents, towering canyons and cliffs that in the Big Bend section rise to 50ft reduce the need for a solid barrier through much of the river’s trajectory.

Still, Trump has his eye on the Rio Grande for his wall. Of the $5.7bn he is demanding from Congress, a sizable chunk would go towards building more than 100 miles of wall along the river.

Here just outside Tornillo, the existing fence that runs west to Sunland Park in New Mexico has a 10-mile gap in it. Despite the lack of an artificial barrier, most locals go about their daily routine without fuss.

Miguel Alvarez, who has lived close to the border for 25 years, said the arrival of the fence has made precious little difference. “You still see small groups of people passing through just like they did before any fencing,” he said.

A farmer who didn’t want to reveal his name said he would feel more comfortable if the gap in the fencing were closed. “I haven’t had any issues with people coming across, but you never know,” he said.

Tornillo itself fell under the national spotlight after the Trump administration chose the Marcelino Serna port of entry south of the town to house thousands of unaccompanied minors in a tent-like facility. It was meant to be temporary, designed to help deal with hundreds of children who had been separated from their families as a result of Trump’s crackdown on border crossers.

But it rapidly grew, to up to 2,400 beds, becoming the face of the brutality of Trump’s policy of tearing families apart as a form of deterrent.

In November, a government watchdog warned that conditions in the tent city were putting children at risk, and since then the numbers have been reduced until the last teenager was transferred out of the facility last week. As far as locals are concerned, its closure couldn’t happen fast enough.

They are eager for things to get back to normal. Or at least as close to what passes as normal these days.

The controversial deal , which critics say is illegal and immoral , is sure to face legal challenges in the U.S. and already does in Guatemala .
President Donald Trump had publicly pressured his Guatemalan counterpart Jimmy Morales to sign this week , threatening a `` ban '' or tariffs after Morales was forced to back out of signing a similar deal last week because of political pressure and a legal challenge back home .
`` They 're doing what we 've asked them to do . I think it 's going to be a great thing for Guatemala , '' Trump said in the Oval Office alongside acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and Guatemalan Interior Minister Enrique Degenhart . `` They do n't want the problems either . ''

There is already , however , a legal challenge in Guatemala . The Constitutional Court ruled earlier this month that Morales would have to get congressional approval before being able to declare his country is a safe third country . That ruling and the intense political pressure back home forced him to cancel a visit to Washington on July 15 , where he and Trump were expected to sign a similar deal .
After the cancellation , Trump took to Twitter to threaten Guatemala with tariffs , restrictions on remittances from Guatemalans in the U.S. to their families back home , or some sort of travel ban if they did not sign .
It 's unclear if and how the legal challenge has been avoided . Guatemalan Interior Minister Degenhart denied Friday that the court said Morales and his administration could not move ahead .
`` What the court said , which is a provisional injunction , was basically define the process that had to be followed ... define how to do that procedure , and we are going to implement it , '' Degenhart said .
While the White House celebrated the deal as a victory for Trump 's tactics , it 's also not clear if the deal does exactly what the administration says it does . McAleenan declined to call it a `` safe third country agreement , '' and in Guatemala 's own statement , the country makes no mention of any binding deal .
Instead , Guatemala says the two sides agreed to cooperate on the execution of an implementation plan that would affect Salvadorans and Hondurans -- those Central American migrants who would have to travel through Guatemala en route to the U.S .
The deal is also expected to face legal challenges in the U.S. , especially because Guatemala is a dangerous country in its own right and does not have a strong asylum system .
`` President Trump 's decision to sign this agreement with Guatemala is cruel and immoral . It is also illegal . Simply put , Guatemala is not a safe country for refugees and asylum seekers , as the law requires , '' said Rep. Eliot Engel , D-NY , chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
McAleenan dismissed those concerns , saying it was `` risky '' to paint Guatemala and Central America in general with a `` broad brush ... There are places that are dangerous , but that does n't mean there is n't a process for people to seek protection . ''
In five trips to the country in the last year , he said that he saw refugee and international organizations working to increase the government 's capacity and that the U.S. was committed to helping them improve it .","The United States and Guatemala have signed an agreement to allow the U.S. to deport migrants seeking asylum if they reached the southern U.S. border by crossing through Guatemala, the Trump administration said Friday.

The controversial deal, which critics say is illegal and immoral, is sure to face legal challenges in the U.S. and already does in Guatemala.

President Donald Trump had publicly pressured his Guatemalan counterpart Jimmy Morales to sign this week, threatening a ""ban"" or tariffs after Morales was forced to back out of signing a similar deal last week because of political pressure and a legal challenge back home.

""They're doing what we've asked them to do. I think it's going to be a great thing for Guatemala,"" Trump said in the Oval Office alongside acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and Guatemalan Interior Minister Enrique Degenhart. ""They don't want the problems either.""

The agreement, sometimes known as a ""safe third country"" agreement, will force any migrants traveling through the Central American country en route to the U.S. to claim asylum there. If they don't and they apply for asylum in the U.S., they will face deportation to Guatemala, according to McAleenan.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy vowed to move swiftly on immigration legislation despite calls from conservatives , including Sen. Marco Rubio , to slow the process .
Reacting to a Rubio ( R-Fla. ) letter over the weekend calling for extensive hearings on the soon-to-be-unveiled immigration bill by a group of eight senators , the Vermont Democrat said his panel would “ consider ” holding a hearing on the measure once it was introduced . But Leahy raised concerns that waiting too long could undermine the larger effort to pass the comprehensive bill , calling the matter “ urgent . ”
“ While you have conducted the process of the ‘ gang of eight ’ behind closed doors , I can assure you that it has always been my position … that the work of the Committee should be open to the public , ” Leahy said in a Tuesday letter , “ so I have every intention of ensuring that debate and consideration of any future comprehensive immigration reform legislation will be thorough and will be conducted in open session and streamed live on the Judiciary Committee website . ”
Leahy added : “ I will , however , remain mindful of the urgent need for us to actually get to the work of debating and considering amendments without unnecessary delay because this is an issue to which our attention is long overdue . … Those who have been committed to this effort for decades are counting on us and expect the Senate to act thoughtfully and without further delay . ”
“ I have little doubt we are capable of doing both [ . ] ”
A Rubio aide said the senator was pleased that Leahy promised to consider scheduling a hearing on the forthcoming proposal as it had been unclear he would do so .
“ It ’ s a good sign that Chairman Leahy has recognized the need for a public hearing on the bipartisan proposal , ” Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said . “ Sen . Rubio has always said that public hearings and debate are critical to the process . ”
How the bill advances became a sticking point over the weekend when Rubio sent a letter Saturday to Leahy calling for hearings on the bill . Rubio — a member of the Senate group that is set to unveil a bill next week — was seeking to allay concerns from conservatives that the controversial bill will be rushed .

Leahy vows fast work on immigration

Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy vowed to move swiftly on immigration legislation despite calls from conservatives, including Sen. Marco Rubio, to slow the process.

Reacting to a Rubio (R-Fla.) letter over the weekend calling for extensive hearings on the soon-to-be-unveiled immigration bill by a group of eight senators, the Vermont Democrat said his panel would “consider” holding a hearing on the measure once it was introduced. But Leahy raised concerns that waiting too long could undermine the larger effort to pass the comprehensive bill, calling the matter “urgent.”

“While you have conducted the process of the ‘gang of eight’ behind closed doors, I can assure you that it has always been my position … that the work of the Committee should be open to the public,” Leahy said in a Tuesday letter, “so I have every intention of ensuring that debate and consideration of any future comprehensive immigration reform legislation will be thorough and will be conducted in open session and streamed live on the Judiciary Committee website.”

Leahy added: “I will, however, remain mindful of the urgent need for us to actually get to the work of debating and considering amendments without unnecessary delay because this is an issue to which our attention is long overdue. … Those who have been committed to this effort for decades are counting on us and expect the Senate to act thoughtfully and without further delay.”

“I have little doubt we are capable of doing both[.]”

A Rubio aide said the senator was pleased that Leahy promised to consider scheduling a hearing on the forthcoming proposal as it had been unclear he would do so.

“It’s a good sign that Chairman Leahy has recognized the need for a public hearing on the bipartisan proposal,” Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. “Sen. Rubio has always said that public hearings and debate are critical to the process.”

How the bill advances became a sticking point over the weekend when Rubio sent a letter Saturday to Leahy calling for hearings on the bill. Rubio — a member of the Senate group that is set to unveil a bill next week — was seeking to allay concerns from conservatives that the controversial bill will be rushed.

“While you and your colleagues on the Judiciary Committee will agree on the details, I respectfully suggest that such a process must begin with a careful examination in the committee including: hearings that explore multiple perspectives on the scope of the problems we face and the efficacy of the solutions we propose, markups in which a broad range of amendments can be considered and a robust floor debate,” Rubio said.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee raised similar concerns.

In response, Leahy noted his panel has held several “widely attended hearings” on the issue of immigration reform. And he said, in consultation with senior Judiciary Committee members, Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), he would “consider scheduling” a hearing on the Gang of Eight measure once it is unveiled.

Almost 2,000 migrant children were separated from their families at the US border over six weeks, officials say.

Following a Trump administration crackdown on illegal border crossings from Mexico, adults are being detained, meaning the children with them are removed from their care.

The issue is causing a growing political storm in the US.

On Thursday Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited the Bible to defend the ""zero tolerance"" approach.

It means that those entering the US irregularly are criminally prosecuted, a change to a long-standing policy of charging most of those crossing for the first time with a misdemeanour offence.

As the adults are being charged with a crime and detained, the children that travel with them are being separated and classed as unaccompanied minors.

What do we know about the children?

Figures from the US Department of Homeland Security show that 1,995 children were separated from 1,940 adults who are being held between 19 April and 31 May.

No information was given on the age of the separated children.

The children are passed into the care of the US Department of Health and Human Services. They are transferred to government detention facilities or foster care while officials try to resolve their case.

The United Nations has called on the US to immediately halt the separations.

Mr Sessions said having children would not shield border-crossing migrants from prosecution.

The attorney general quoted a verse from St Paul's Letter to the Romans on obeying the laws of government.

Critics say that verse was once used to justify slavery.

What has been the political response?

The Trump administration policy is supported by some Republicans, but others have expressed misgivings.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Congress' highest-ranking Republican, said he was not comfortable with the tactics.

This week, House Republicans pitched draft immigration legislation that would end the separation of children and parents at the border.

Under the plan, families would be detained together.

Also in the proposal are provisions to protect 1.8 million Daca 'Dreamers', eliminate the diversity lottery, and add $25bn (£18bn) for border security.

The bill, a compromise between moderates and conservatives, is expected to be voted on next week. So will another, more hard line bill.

President Donald Trump said on Friday he would not sign the compromise bill, despite Republican lawmakers having said he supported it.

His remark sent legislators on Capitol Hill scrambling, but the White House later said the president had misspoken and he would back both measures.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo joined the chorus of New York officials calling for the release of an Ecuadorian native detained while delivering pizza at a Brooklyn Army base after his impending deportation was halted, at least for now, by a federal judge.

""There’s compelling evidence that Pablo Villavicencio was improperly detained,"" Cuomo said late Saturday. ""He should be immediately released from ICE custody and an investigation should be launched into the circumstances of his arrest.""

Villavicencio, 35, was taken into custody June 1 at Army Garrison Fort Hamilton after military police officers conducting a routine check discovered a deportation order from 2010. He was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is being held at an ICE facility in New Jersey.

New York's Legal Aid Society said it sought an emergency stay after learning Villavicencio's deportation was imminent. Federal Judge Alison Nathan issued an emergency deportation stay pending a hearing July 20.

Villavicencio's wife, Sandra Chica, and his two children are American citizens.

In 2016, London’s mayor said Islamic terror attacks are just part of living in a big city.

There’s just one major problem with that.

The biggest city in the world hasn’t even had a single terrorist attack from a radical Muslim.

Tokyo, Japan boasts the largest population of any city, and they’ve got their problems, including a declining population, but Islamic terrorism isn’t one — not a single one.

There’s a few logical reasons for this.

Japan has a long history and tradition of extremely strict immigration policies, making it one of the highest homogeneous countries in the world, next to Korea. Japanese make up 98.5% with the next highest ethnic group as Koreans at 0.5%, then Chinese with 0.4%, and other at a whopping 0.6%.

In the West, diversity is seen as a moral superiority and objective, but wide open doors to Islamic extremists only invites terrorism.

From 9/11 to the Boston Marathon bombing to San Bernardino to the Pulse nightclub massacre — America has seen brutal terror attacks done in the name of radical Islam.

President Donald Trump was elected in large part because of his promise to secure the Southern border, get “tough” on illegal immigration, and “defeat” radical Islamic terrorism.

Each attempt Trump does to make America safer and more secure, he is met with protests from the mainstream media, Hollywood elites, and liberals across the coasts.

In stark contrast, London Mayor Sadiq Khan ran on diversity, and in September of last year, said the threat of terror attacks are “part and parcel of living in a big city.”

How did the West come to expect terror attacks in bigger cities? According to Tucker Carlson, “It wasn’t always this way. We made it this way.”

Carlson points out we brought this upon ourselves, or rather “the people in charge” through “reckless immigration policies…that none of us were asked to endorse, much less vote on.”

“Some of us didn’t even know they were happening,” he added, and I couldn’t agree more.

“Western cities got dangerous when they imported radical religious ideologies from other countries,” he said, and I’ll add the nuance, those are from the Islamic faith — not the Buddhists, Pentecostals, Baptists, Lutherans, or Catholics.

Tucker continued:

“Nobody from government wants to admit that, because it reflects poorly on them, but it’s true, and increasingly voters know it’s true, despite the official ban on saying it’s true.”

“In heavily Islamic areas terror is depressingly common. Elsewhere it is vanishably rare.”

I couldn’t agree more with Tucker, and the facts back us up as well.

Interestingly, President Trump’s first meeting with a foreign leader was UK Prime Minister Theresa May, who had to be rushed to safety Wednesday when Parliament came under threat of a terror attack.

May described the attack as “sick and depraved,” but sadly it has become accepted as a norm for many in the West.

Getting back to Tokyo, though. The United States could learn a vital lesson from our friends in Japan.

President Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as president-elect and just a couple weeks after hosting May at the White House.

Trump reaffirmed his promise to Abe that he has spoken to the public many times: “America First.”

Although Trump was mostly referring to trade, this could be broadened to include national security.

You know, Japan doesn’t have to worry about homegrown terrorism.

If America doesn’t want to become another London, we have to pause, and ask ourselves if we really want to tolerate any more terror — haven’t enough American lives been taken at the hands of jihadists?

This doesn’t have to be our reality. We can change it. Let’s take a lesson from Japan.

For 42 days now , demonstrators , mainly Muslim women , have blocked a highway in the southeastern part of the Indian capital to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) , passed by Parliament last month .
The CAA fast-tracks the naturalisation of non-Muslim immigrants from Pakistan , Bangladesh and Afghanistan , who came to India before 2015 .

Critics say the law violates India 's secular constitution and is a step towards marginalising the country 's 200 million Muslims , who form nearly 15 percent of India 's 1.3 billion people .
Coupled with a proposed National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and a continuing National Population Register ( NPR ) exercise , Muslims fear the move will force them to show documentation to prove their nationality .
India 's governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) dismisses those fears and calls the protests `` misguided '' .
But daily protests across India have been demanding a rollback of the CAA and an assurance from the government that no Indian citizen will be forced to prove their nationality .
On Sunday , as the clock struck midnight , protesters at Shaheen Bagh read out the preamble to the Indian constitution , which on this day in 1950 , came into effect .
Sarwari , 75 , was one of the women who unfurled the Indian flag at Shaheen Bagh [ Nasir Kachroo/███ ]
`` It was an honour for me , '' Sarwari told ███ . `` I had never taken part in any flag hoisting event before . ''
Around her were thousands of people , carrying the national flag and raising slogans . Many had painted their faces with the tricolour , while hundreds of women , wearing burqas - black full-body veils that cover the face as well - were seen with tricoloured-fabric and ribbons wrapped around them . Children ran around , waving little flags .
`` This is a historic day for all of us , '' Abid Ahmed , a resident of Shaheen Bagh , told ███ .
`` We impress upon the government to understand the preamble of our constitution and in light of that announce a rollback of the controversial law . The law is in contravention of the constitution . ''
Insha Hussain , a 16-year-old student who had been participating in the Shaheen Bagh protest since the middle of December , told ███ their `` fight is for the soul of India '' .
`` Our constitution which was adopted on this day 70 years ago is the soul of our nation and we are out to protect that soul , '' she said .
`` It 's shameful that after 73 years of independence , our focus should be on providing jobs to people , not to prove our citizenship . ''
Indian protesters are demanding a withdrawal of the controversial citizenship law [ Nasir Kachroo/███ ]
Similar `` Save the constitution '' events were held at other sites in New Delhi and in Kolkata , Bengaluru , Hyderabad , Mumbai , Lucknow and other cities .
In the southern state of Kerala , hundreds of thousands of people formed a 620km ( 385-mile ) human chain from Kasaragod in the north to Kaliyakkavilai in the south , demanding the CAA 's withdrawal .
The massive protest was organised by the governing Left Democratic Front party , with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself joining in the state capital , Thiruvananthapuram .
`` The movement in Kerala is to resist attempts to undermine India 's secular fabric , its plural ethos , federal structure and democratic values , '' politician S Ramachandran Pillai , who flagged off the protest at Kasargod , told ███ .
Pillai said the human chain was one of the largest mass mobilisations ever in Kerala . `` The central government will be forced to withdraw [ the citizenship law ] , '' he said .
Protesters in Kolkata city organised an 11km human chain [ Ronny Sen/███ ]
In the eastern state of West Bengal , thousands in the capital Kolkata also formed an 11km ( seven-mile ) human chain .
The protest in Kolkata was organised by the United Interfaith Foundation India , a group comprising leaders of different religious communities in the state .
`` Almost two million people have been left out in the final NRC list in Assam and many are already in detention camps , '' Priyankar Dey , who was part of the human chain in Kolkata , told ███ , referring to the northeastern state where the NRC exercise was first carried out .

Sarwari, 75, who goes by her first name, was among a group of women invited on Sunday to unfurl the tricolour - India's national flag - amid loud chants of the national anthem at Shaheen Bagh, the main site of protest in New Delhi.

About 15 kilometres (nine miles) away in the heart of the capital, Indian President Ram Nath Kovind hosted his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro, the Republic Day chief guest this year, as they watched the annual parade aimed at showcasing India's military might and cultural diversity.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who the protesters accuse of pursuing a Hindu supremacist agenda, also attended the government event.

Epicentre of the protests

For 42 days now, demonstrators, mainly Muslim women, have blocked a highway in the southeastern part of the Indian capital to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), passed by Parliament last month.

The CAA fast-tracks the naturalisation of non-Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, who came to India before 2015.

Critics say the law violates India's secular constitution and is a step towards marginalising the country's 200 million Muslims, who form nearly 15 percent of India's 1.3 billion people.

Coupled with a proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and a continuing National Population Register (NPR) exercise, Muslims fear the move will force them to show documentation to prove their nationality.

India's governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dismisses those fears and calls the protests ""misguided"".

But daily protests across India have been demanding a rollback of the CAA and an assurance from the government that no Indian citizen will be forced to prove their nationality.

'Fight for the soul of India'

On Sunday, as the clock struck midnight, protesters at Shaheen Bagh read out the preamble to the Indian constitution, which on this day in 1950, came into effect.

""It was an honour for me,"" Sarwari told Al Jazeera. ""I had never taken part in any flag hoisting event before.""

Around her were thousands of people, carrying the national flag and raising slogans. Many had painted their faces with the tricolour, while hundreds of women, wearing burqas - black full-body veils that cover the face as well - were seen with tricoloured-fabric and ribbons wrapped around them. Children ran around, waving little flags.

""This is a historic day for all of us,"" Abid Ahmed, a resident of Shaheen Bagh, told Al Jazeera.

""We impress upon the government to understand the preamble of our constitution and in light of that announce a rollback of the controversial law. The law is in contravention of the constitution.""

Insha Hussain, a 16-year-old student who had been participating in the Shaheen Bagh protest since the middle of December, told Al Jazeera their ""fight is for the soul of India"".

""Our constitution which was adopted on this day 70 years ago is the soul of our nation and we are out to protect that soul,"" she said.

""It's shameful that after 73 years of independence, our focus should be on providing jobs to people, not to prove our citizenship.""

Massive human chains

Similar ""Save the constitution"" events were held at other sites in New Delhi and in Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Lucknow and other cities.

In the southern state of Kerala, hundreds of thousands of people formed a 620km (385-mile) human chain from Kasaragod in the north to Kaliyakkavilai in the south, demanding the CAA's withdrawal.

The massive protest was organised by the governing Left Democratic Front party, with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself joining in the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram.

""The movement in Kerala is to resist attempts to undermine India's secular fabric, its plural ethos, federal structure and democratic values,"" politician S Ramachandran Pillai, who flagged off the protest at Kasargod, told Al Jazeera.

Pillai said the human chain was one of the largest mass mobilisations ever in Kerala. ""The central government will be forced to withdraw [the citizenship law],"" he said.

Protesters in Kolkata city organised an 11km human chain [Ronny Sen/Al Jazeera]

In the eastern state of West Bengal, thousands in the capital Kolkata also formed an 11km (seven-mile) human chain.

The protest in Kolkata was organised by the United Interfaith Foundation India, a group comprising leaders of different religious communities in the state.

""Almost two million people have been left out in the final NRC list in Assam and many are already in detention camps,"" Priyankar Dey, who was part of the human chain in Kolkata, told Al Jazeera, referring to the northeastern state where the NRC exercise was first carried out.

""CAA, NRC and NPR are inherently discriminatory. The human chain today is a message to everyone in power that we Indians are all together in this fight,"" he said.

Yoo and others also argue that prosecutorial discretion does not allow the president to refuse to enforce an ""entire law,"" as opposed to merely doing so in specific cases. But Obama has not in fact refused to enforce the entire relevant law requiring deportation of illegal immigrants. He has simply chosen to do so with respect to people who fit certain specified criteria that the vast majority of undocumented migrants do not meet.",www.reason.com,right,kqRWrp3jmpLScX4j

Go too far on any of those elements, and liberal Democrats — who aren’t thrilled with many aspects of the bill already — begin to pull away.

Meanwhile, a handful of conservative Democrats, who have been asked to cast several tough votes this year already, won’t commit to the bill unless they secure many of the same fixes that Republicans are seeking.

And even if the Senate approves a bill, the route through the House is a puzzle for reform proponents. Their only game plan, at this point, is to run up the numbers in the Senate, sending an emphatic message to the House that it needs to act.

“Our goal is to get 70 votes. It is going to take a lot of work,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leader of the Gang of Eight. “This is one of the most important bills to pass for America. It’s one of the hardest bills to pass for America. And we got a long way to go, we don’t have any doubts about that. But so far, at each step of the road where it’s been difficult, we’ve been able to overcome.”

No one’s expecting final commitments until just before the vote as the senators look to extract compromises and concessions. But Schumer said the Gang of Eight would meet Thursday to begin plotting out a strategy for the floor debate, which is expected to begin soon after senators return from the Memorial Day recess.

The group heads into the next phase of the fight with the strength that comes from sticking together.

Predictions that a drawn-out debate would kill the bill haven’t come to pass. It’s been more than four months since the Gang of Eight released its principles and more than one month since it offered the bill. And coming out of a three-week-long Judiciary Committee markup Tuesday, the legislation picked up one more Republican vote — Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah — although his support isn’t guaranteed on the floor.

The debate has yet to turn unusually heated, in part because it’s been repeatedly overshadowed by a string of headline-grabbing news events including the Boston Marathon bombings, the Benghazi investigation, the IRS scandal, and the Oklahoma tornadoes.

This has all given the Gang of Eight a chance to start on favorable terrain, with undecided senators as open-minded as they may ever be to tackling the controversial issue.

Federal law found at 18 U.S.C. § 1425(a) makes it a crime to “knowingly procur[e], contrary to law, the naturalization of any person” to become a U.S. citizen. (“Naturalization” is the legal term for becoming a citizen.) Moreover, a second federal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1451(e) adds that a foreigner who obtains U.S. citizenship through such a violation will lose that newly granted citizenship.

Divna Maslenjak is a Serb who, along with her husband and two children, sought refugee status in 1998 to flee Bosnia. As part of seeking protected status, she swore under oath that the family feared persecution because her husband evaded military service. They were admitted to the United States in 2000 as refugees.

In 2006, she applied for U.S. citizenship. One question on her application asked if she had ever given “false or misleading information” while applying for immigration benefits. Another asked if she had “lied … to gain entry or admission” in this country. She answered “no” to both and became an American citizen in 2007.

Those answers were false. Her husband had served in the Bosnian Serb Army. A third federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1015(a), criminalizes making a false sworn statement during naturalization. The U.S. government argued that her statement violating § 1015(a) also counts as a violation of § 1425(a), which meant she must lose her citizenship under § 1451(e).

A judge on the federal district court accepted that argument and stripped Maslenjak of her citizenship. The Sixth Circuit appeals court affirmed.

In an opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court in Maslenjak v. United States vacated (i.e., set aside) the lower court’s decision and remanded the case back down for more proceedings.

The federal government had argued that the citizenship-stripping provision is triggered whenever an immigrant commits a crime during the process of seeking citizenship.

All nine justices rejected that argument. “The most natural understanding is that the illegal act must have somehow contributed to the obtaining of citizenship,” Justice Kagan wrote. In other words, “§ 1425(a) demands a means-ends connection between a legal violation and naturalization.”

“We hold that the Government must establish that an illegal act by the defendant played some role in her acquisition of citizenship,” the Court declared. “When the illegal act is a false statement, that means demonstrating that the defendant lied about facts that would have mattered to an immigration official.”

The Court concluded that the contrary instructions given to the jury were faulty and that, instead, the jury should have been told that they needed to decide the factual question of whether Maslenjak’s lying about her husband’s military service was part of the cause of obtaining her own citizenship.

The majority vacated the lower court’s decision and remanded back to the trial court for a new jury proceeding where a correct explanation of the law would be provided to the jury.

Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a decision concurring in part, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Gorsuch wrote that the majority created a framework that was too elaborate, consisting of two complex tests with multiple parts. These new tests focus on causation, which was not the focus of the parties’ legal briefs or oral arguments.

He struck a note of judicial modesty, explaining:

Respectfully, it seems to me at least reasonably possible that the crucible of adversarial testing on which we depend, along with the experience of our thoughtful colleagues on the district and circuit benches, could yield insights (or reveal pitfalls) we cannot muster guided only by our own lights.

Justice Gorsuch added that he believes the Supreme Court should send the case back down with a less-elaborate holding, and allow the lower courts to flesh out additional details as necessary over time. After a period of trial and error, the Supreme Court could then in future cases review aspects of those legal interpretations.

“This Court often speaks most wisely when it speaks last,” he concluded.

Justice Samuel Alito also wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, writing that when it comes to false statements, the immigration statute is violated when a person says something that is “material” to the naturalization process of obtaining citizenship. But contrary to the Court’s majority, Justice Alito believes that the statement need not actually be part of the cause of obtaining citizenship.

The case is Maslenjak v. United States, No. 16-309.

immigration,The Daily Caller,2,http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/10/cnn-accidentally-makes-the-case-for-limiting-immigration/,CNN Accidentally Makes The Case For Limiting Immigration,2017-08-10,,"CNN joined the ranks Thursday of The Washington Post , The New York Times and other national media outlets in warning about the supposedly harmful economic effects of the RAISE Act , a Trump administration-backed bill to reduce legal immigration levels by half over a decade .
In a report titled “ Trump immigration plan to cost 4.6 million jobs , Ivy League study finds , ” CNN highlighted an analysis of the bill by the University of Pennsylvania ’ s Wharton School of Business . The Wharton study projects that by 2040 , the American economy would lose more than 4 million jobs and be 2 percent smaller under the RAISE Act than it would be under current immigration levels .
Even assuming Wharton ’ s predictive model is accurate , CNN unquestioningly relies on the study ’ s jobs and GDP figures , and then misreads what they actually portend for the U.S. economy .
Steve Camarota , the director of research at the Center For Immigration Studies ( CIS ) , says CNN is ignoring the fact that there will be 4.6 million fewer workers in the U.S. under the RAISE Act precisely because there will be roughly 10 million fewer immigrants . In other words , a smaller population will have fewer workers than a larger population , but that fact illustrates nothing about the the bill ’ s effect on the native population .
“ It looks like what they ’ re arguing is that that the U.S. population will be somewhat smaller , and the overall GDP will be somewhat less , but all of that is absorbed by the people that don ’ t come , ” Camarota told ███ News Foundation . “ There ’ s nothing in there that says the existing population of native-born and legal immigrants will in any way be harmed . ”
“ In fact , it all looks like good news because it states that the employment rate — that is the share of people with a job — is going to go up , ” Camarota added . “ They inadvertently make the case for the RAISE Act . ”
According to the study ’ s authors , the domestic worker participation rate wouldn ’ t increase enough under the RAISE Act to fill the jobs that immigrants would have filled . That means the job market will become more favorable for native-born Americans , as CIS fellow Jason Richwine noted in a blog post Thursday .
“ That suggests not only that Americans will work more under the RAISE Act , but also that the ‘ lost jobs ’ will be lost not by Americans , but by the immigrants who would not arrive , ” Richwine wrote .
As for the lost economic output that results from lighter immigration , Camarota says the media ’ s focus on gross domestic product ( GDP ) is highly misleading .
“ Adding people to the United States , as a general proposition , doesn ’ t raise the standard of living , ” Camarota explained . “ If it did why wouldn ’ t Bangladesh be richer than New Zealand ? After all , it ’ s got a lot more people , and its GDP is slightly larger . But nobody says ‘ Oh , Bangladesh is a richer country than New Zealand and the people are better off. ’ What matters is per capita . ”
The Wharton analysis does address GDP per capita , finding a negligible effect from reduced immigration under the RAISE Act . According to the study , the bill would cause per capita GDP to be 0.02 percent higher in 2027 that it would have been under current policy .","CNN joined the ranks Thursday of The Washington Post, The New York Times and other national media outlets in warning about the supposedly harmful economic effects of the RAISE Act, a Trump administration-backed bill to reduce legal immigration levels by half over a decade.

The CBP and the Trump administration have been heavily criticized for the treatment of migrants along the southern border , with doctors , lawyers , and the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) inspector general reporting that children have been held for weeks in overcrowded facilities without adequate food , water , and sanitation .

Testifying before the House Oversight Committee , acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said the agency has been coping with “ an unprecedented crisis at the border. ” More than 530,000 migrants have been apprehended at the southern border since January , during which time he says the department has delivered more than 6 million meals , conducted more than 400,000 medical interviews , and conducted medical transport and held hospital watch for migrants for over 250,000 hours . More than 200 medical professionals are now embedded in facilities on the border , he said , a tenfold increase from January .
Henry Gass/The ███ Dr. Marsha Griffin sits in her office at the University of Texas , Rio Grande Valley . Dr. Griffin , a pediatrician , has been visiting migrant children in government custody for decades and says conditions have been getting increasingly worse as the flow of families and unaccompanied minors has increased .
But what concerns Dr. Griffin is the quality of the meals and what is not being detected in the medical interviews , among other things . The interview has been edited for clarity and length .
What has been your general impression of how the government has been taking care of detained migrant children ?
There ’ s a lot of different agencies that take care of them . I went into the Border Patrol facility in Donna in May , and then I was in two weeks ago again with officials from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Texas Pediatric Society , because we feel that as the leading pediatric organized medical association we need to know how our government is treating children . We came down , and we ’ ve been down here almost every year for the last four or five years , going in to see what ’ s going on . And it has gotten increasingly worse .
The Donna temporary influx facility – we saw it before it opened . They were hoping it would be for unaccompanied children ; it ’ s now for families . We went in there two weeks ago . We also went into the Ursula facility [ in McAllen ] , which is all in the news . That one is overcrowded , and it ’ s where the cages are . Because they had so many coming in 2013 and 2014 they needed a pop-off valve . So Ursula was built in 2014 , and it has the big cages in it . And it ’ s the one that everyone is up in arms about because of the sanitary conditions .
The Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) ones are completely separate .
Sixty-two percent of them are upper respiratory infection . Another 20 % are vomiting and diarrhea . And then you ’ ll have 1 to 2 % that are influenza ... or you have someone going into premature labor , or you ’ ve got some child that actually has an upper respiratory but also has a heart condition , and that heart condition was never recognized .
So the EMTs at the Border Patrol facility may have said , ‘ This child has an upper respiratory infection , ’ but when we see them and we actually examine them , we have to get them to the hospital and we find they actually are in congenital heart failure . It ’ s not an upper respiratory problem , or it ’ s an upper respiratory problem on top of something else . That ’ s not every day , but I think it contributes to why we had six kids die here . Because they ’ re screening , but they ’ re not screening the way we would screen , by actually examining them .
You mentioned earlier that HHS facilities are different from CBP facilities . How so ?
HHS facilities are more child-friendly . ... They have licensed people in there , they get lots of training . They are not perfect , and there has been lots of news about how bad some of them are , but the vast majority of them are good .
But it used to be [ the children ] would be out within three to four weeks . Three to four weeks is OK , a kid can do that , but when it keeps dragging on is when it ’ s problematic . Because for the kids , it ’ s still detention to them . They can ’ t really leave , there ’ s locks on the doors , if they try to get out they ’ re going to be in trouble . But their medical care , although not perfect , is far superior to what ’ s at CBP .
What has happened is you ’ ve got a law enforcement organization , Customs and Border Protection , who have told us they don ’ t want to take care of kids . They want to be bringing in the bad guys . They don ’ t want to be babysitting , and we ’ ve charged them with setting up a facility that ’ s not going to traumatize kids . But the only thing they know how to do is set up jails . They ’ re law enforcement . They haven ’ t gone out and studied what ’ s a space for a child . They haven ’ t been trained in child development . They don ’ t know what ’ s going to traumatize them .
They don ’ t have that training to know how to design a building . Even though when CBP designed Ursula in 2014 they said they were designing it for unaccompanied children , what they did is put in cages . So , come on . Kids don ’ t go in cages .
Do you think all migrant children should be kept in HHS custody then ?
Yes . You could send all the families to ORR [ the Office of Refugee Resettlement ] , and you could have CBP have an office in there . They could design it so if the kids weren ’ t there long , it would be more friendly for a child , and be less traumatic , and you could have one tent where the Border Patrol came and the Border Patrol did all their processing there . ...
It seems easy , just give HHS most of that money . Give it to them and let them figure it out , and let Border Patrol go catch all the drug guys .
Lots of people want to make enemies of the Border Patrol . They want to demonize them just like [ President Donald ] Trump demonizes the immigrants . They are not demons .
They hire some of our best , best nieces and nephews in the Valley , because it ’ s a great job , great benefits . There are some great people in there . What they ’ re being asked to do goes against many of their morality and what they would consider right .
You said earlier that “ it has gotten increasingly worse. ” What do you mean by that ?
First it ’ s the overcrowding . But the rhetoric around it in the last two years , the rhetoric about them being criminals , has made the atmosphere and the way that people talk about their time in the Border Patrol facilities more egregious than it was before .
When families come out , then what they talk about – about people kicking them , or about them abusing them – that has gotten worse . In the past migrants may have complained that it was cold , that they didn ’ t get good food and they kept the lights on all the time , but it wasn ’ t this constant , ‘ Oh , and they abused us. ’ You ’ d hear some , but not like this .
Maybe people are just frustrated because there ’ s so many . But this kind of behavior – we should be prepared for this . We don ’ t have to become animals .
What does that mean ? That “ we should be prepared for this ” ?
I think we can keep our core morality and our basic values in how to treat human beings when we ’ re faced with a humanitarian crisis . If we had just 10 arriving every day forever and ever and we treated them well , and then we suddenly got , for whatever reason , a hundred every day , we don ’ t have to start abusing them . You treat them like a human being , with dignity .
Sometimes I ’ ll fall down and cry . It ’ s like , this is not OK. It ’ s not what we would have our grandkids or kids be exposed to . And once you get to know them , once you see them and play with them , then it becomes a real atrocity . As long as it ’ s over there and you ’ re just seeing it in the news , it doesn ’ t hit you as much as if they ’ re running through here and you ’ ve got them in your arms . And then it ’ s , “ Don ’ t you dare touch this kid . ”","“What has happened is you’ve got a law enforcement organization, Customs and Border Protection, who have told us they don’t want to take care of kids,” Dr. Griffin says. “They want to be bringing in the bad guys.

But it used to be [the children] would be out within three to four weeks. Three to four weeks is OK, a kid can do that, but when it keeps dragging on is when it’s problematic. Because for the kids, it’s still detention to them. They can’t really leave, there’s locks on the doors, if they try to get out they’re going to be in trouble. But their medical care, although not perfect, is far superior to what’s at CBP.

What has happened is you’ve got a law enforcement organization, Customs and Border Protection, who have told us they don’t want to take care of kids. They want to be bringing in the bad guys. They don’t want to be babysitting, and we’ve charged them with setting up a facility that’s not going to traumatize kids. But the only thing they know how to do is set up jails. They’re law enforcement. They haven’t gone out and studied what’s a space for a child. They haven’t been trained in child development. They don’t know what’s going to traumatize them.

They don’t have that training to know how to design a building. Even though when CBP designed Ursula in 2014 they said they were designing it for unaccompanied children, what they did is put in cages. So, come on. Kids don’t go in cages.

Do you think all migrant children should be kept in HHS custody then?

Yes. You could send all the families to ORR [the Office of Refugee Resettlement], and you could have CBP have an office in there. They could design it so if the kids weren’t there long, it would be more friendly for a child, and be less traumatic, and you could have one tent where the Border Patrol came and the Border Patrol did all their processing there. ...

It seems easy, just give HHS most of that money. Give it to them and let them figure it out, and let Border Patrol go catch all the drug guys.

What is your estimation of CBP officers?

Lots of people want to make enemies of the Border Patrol. They want to demonize them just like [President Donald] Trump demonizes the immigrants. They are not demons.

They hire some of our best, best nieces and nephews in the Valley, because it’s a great job, great benefits. There are some great people in there. What they’re being asked to do goes against many of their morality and what they would consider right.

You said earlier that “it has gotten increasingly worse.” What do you mean by that?

First it’s the overcrowding. But the rhetoric around it in the last two years, the rhetoric about them being criminals, has made the atmosphere and the way that people talk about their time in the Border Patrol facilities more egregious than it was before.

When families come out, then what they talk about – about people kicking them, or about them abusing them – that has gotten worse. In the past migrants may have complained that it was cold, that they didn’t get good food and they kept the lights on all the time, but it wasn’t this constant, ‘Oh, and they abused us.’ You’d hear some, but not like this.

Maybe people are just frustrated because there’s so many. But this kind of behavior – we should be prepared for this. We don’t have to become animals.

What does that mean? That “we should be prepared for this”?

I think we can keep our core morality and our basic values in how to treat human beings when we’re faced with a humanitarian crisis. If we had just 10 arriving every day forever and ever and we treated them well, and then we suddenly got, for whatever reason, a hundred every day, we don’t have to start abusing them. You treat them like a human being, with dignity.

Sometimes I’ll fall down and cry. It’s like, this is not OK. It’s not what we would have our grandkids or kids be exposed to. And once you get to know them, once you see them and play with them, then it becomes a real atrocity. As long as it’s over there and you’re just seeing it in the news, it doesn’t hit you as much as if they’re running through here and you’ve got them in your arms. And then it’s, “Don’t you dare touch this kid.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,fkQVR7b56KY2Sp2t
