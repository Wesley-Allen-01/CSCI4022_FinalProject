The North 's state-run Korean Central News Agency , KCNA , reported that the reclusive state 's atomic energy department intends to `` readjust and restart all the nuclear facilities '' at its main nuclear complex , in Yongbyon .
Those facilities include a uranium enrichment facility and a reactor that was `` mothballed and disabled '' under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks among North Korea , the United States and four other nations , KCNA said .
The announcement was followed by a plea for calm from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who is South Korean .
`` The current crisis has already gone too far , '' he said in a statement from Andorra . `` Nuclear threats are not a game . Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counteractions , and fuel fear and instability .
`` Things must begin to calm down , as this situation , made worse by the lack of communication , could lead down a path that nobody should want to follow . ''
Ban said dialogue and negotiations are `` the only way to resolve the current crisis . ''
The tensions on the Korean Peninsula have led Pyongyang to sever a key military hot line with Seoul and declare void the 1953 armistice that stopped the Korean War .
The United States has made a show of its military strength amid annual training exercises with South Korea , flying B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons , Cold War-era B-52s and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over South Korea .
On Tuesday , the United States positioned a second destroyer -- the USS Decatur -- near the Korean peninsula , a defense official said on condition of anonymity . The official was not authorized to release details to the media .
A day earlier , the U.S Navy moved a warship and a sea-based radar platform closer to the North Korean coast in order to monitor that country 's military moves , including possible new missile launches , the Defense Department said Monday .
North Korea on Wednesday also blocked more than 480 South Korean workers from entering the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Complex , which sits on the North Korea side of the border , according to the South Korean Unification Ministry .
`` North Korea said today that it is only approving people to go back to South Korea and not approving entrance '' to the complex , said Kim Hyung-seok , a spokesman for the ministry . He urged the North to resume letting workers enter .
There are 861 South Koreans inside Kaesong at the moment , the ministry said , and 446 have registered to leave .

The North's latest declaration comes after a stream of verbal attacks against South Korea and the United States in recent weeks, including the threat of a nuclear strike.

The current North Korean crisis has yet to play out. The regime could yet launch multiple medium-range missiles and conduct another nuclear-weapon test. However, naysayers already are concluding that a recent U.S. military demonstration of resolve was “provocative,” and an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test has been postponed. The reality is that this crisis and many more likely to follow have their roots in American weakness.

After China rejected President Obama’s early overtures for “partnership” in late 2009, it fell to then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff to fashion what became known as the “pivot” — now called “rebalancing” — toward Asia, propelled by increasing North Korea and Chinese malevolence and the anxieties of U.S. allies.

Well, It's Hard to Say",2018-06-10,"Timothy Meads, Beth Baumann, Leah Barkoukis, Matt Vespa","Axios ' Jonathan Swan has another great scoop ahead of President Trump 's historic peace negotiations with North Korea 's Kim Jong-un this week . Apparently , the United States could possibly construct an embassy in the communist country in exchange for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula . This report comes weeks after sources said that the potbellied Dictator is also interested in bringing a McDonald 's to the famished nation as a sign of willingness to work with the west .
As noted by Swan 's sources , President Trump 's end goal is ultimately getting North Korea to give up its stash of nuclear weapons . If that includes establishing an official U.S. Embassy in the country , then President Trump could agree to that . His negotiating tactic is to be open to most possibilities that could reasonably get the two countries to a mutual agreement ( Via Axios ) :
`` One of the sources , who is familiar with the president ’ s thinking , said Trump had made it a point not to reject any ideas headed into the summit : `` It ’ s definitely been discussed , '' the source said . `` His view is : 'We can discuss that : It 's on the table . Let ’ s see . ' Of course we would consider it . There ’ s almost nothing he 'll take off the table going in . ''
The source said North Korean officials have been wildly inconsistent in the pre-meetings , making it difficult to get any read on how the discussions might go . The source close to the White House added : `` POTUS will consider any idea anyone brings him if it delivers on denuclearization that is irreversible and verifiable . He wo n't be played by Kim . But it is not his style to — on the front end — rule out possibilities of what could happen or may happen depending on how negotiations go . ''
But , besides political reform , the communist country has also signified economic reform by a potential establishment of a fast food chain . ( Via Washington Post )
`` North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may allow a `` Western hamburger franchise '' into the country as a show of goodwill to the United States , according to an intelligence report described by U.S. officials to NBC . That follows remarks by South Korean adviser Chung-in Moon in late April , who said that North Korea might be interested in welcoming a McDonald 's as tensions ease . Compared to the threat of nuclear war , of course , a Pyongyang McDonald 's seems like small fries . But experts and history suggest there 's more at play here than one token franchise . McDonald 's has long been seen as a symbol of Western culture and capitalism - particularly in communist countries . And it 's expansion into China and Russia was seen as a landmark in the 1990s .
This might seem silly , but allowing a private sector businesses such as McDonald 's can actually have extraordinary impact between the west and communist countries .
`` This has happened with a number of different communist cultures , '' said Jenny Town , a research analyst at the Stimson Center and the managing editor of 38 North , an academic news site about North Korea . `` Once they start to get different points of contact with the West , it changes their views - and it usually starts with McDonald 's or Coca-Cola . ''
At this point in negotiations , creative ideas are needed to try and get Kim Jong-un to give up his arsenal . As Ambassador Susan Rice noted today on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' this is going to be a long , complicated process that can not be judged based on one meeting .
`` ... It 's clear that the past set of efforts have not succeeded . I am a believer in diplomacy and I am open to- to new methods of trying to accomplish the- the consistent objective that we have of full denuclearization . I think the question is are we walking in prepared ? Are we walking in with our allies behind us ? Are we in a position to understand that one meeting it 's not going to be one and done . This is the start of a serious negotiating process , '' Rice said today .

McDonald's has long been seen as a symbol of Western culture and capitalism - particularly in communist countries. And it's expansion into China and Russia was seen as a landmark in the 1990s.

This might seem silly, but allowing a private sector businesses such as McDonald's can actually have extraordinary impact between the west and communist countries.



""This has happened with a number of different communist cultures,"" said Jenny Town, a research analyst at the Stimson Center and the managing editor of 38 North, an academic news site about North Korea. ""Once they start to get different points of contact with the West, it changes their views - and it usually starts with McDonald's or Coca-Cola.""

At this point in negotiations, creative ideas are needed to try and get Kim Jong-un to give up his arsenal. As Ambassador Susan Rice noted today on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" this is going to be a long, complicated process that cannot be judged based on one meeting.

""...It's clear that the past set of efforts have not succeeded. I am a believer in diplomacy and I am open to- to new methods of trying to accomplish the- the consistent objective that we have of full denuclearization. I think the question is are we walking in prepared? Are we walking in with our allies behind us? Are we in a position to understand that one meeting it's not going to be one and done. This is the start of a serious negotiating process,"" Rice said today.

""The global chorus of condemnation has been loud and clear,"" after North Korea's successful launch of a long-range rocket that carried a satellite into space, NPR's Louisa Lim said today on Morning Edition.

From Beijing, Louisa reported that ""Japan was quick off the mark, saying the launch was intolerable and calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations security council later today. Even North Korea's traditional ally, China expressed its displeasure, albeit mildly.""

Not surprisingly, the reaction to the launch was quite different in North Korea, The Associated Press reports from Pyongyang: ""North Koreans danced in the streets of their capital Wednesday.""

The wire service adds that:

""The rocket launch will enhance the credentials of 20-something leader Kim Jong Un at home a year after he took power following the death of his father Kim Jong Il.

And just in case fawning over Kim Yo Jong wasn’t enough, along came the North Korean cheerleaders.

Dubbed the “army of beauties,” the 230-person cheer squad danced in perfect unison and waved flags in support of their team. Within hours, videos of their routine were trending on Twitter. NBC posted the video with the caption “this is so satisfying to watch.”

There’s little doubt that the media response to their spectacle met the exact intentions of the regime that produced it.

north_korea,The Guardian,0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/10/north-korea-release-prisoners-summit-kim-jong-un-donald-trump,OPINION: North Korea’s release of US prisoners doesn’t mean peace,2018-05-10,Polly Toynbee,"Hold the jubilation today as President Trump boarded the plane at Andrews Air Force base near Washington DC to greet three hostages released by North Korea . As a full presidential welcome celebrates this gesture of peace , expectations of the upcoming Trump/Kim summit soar dangerously high .
“ A remarkable foreign policy moment for Donald Trump , ” said the breathless BBC correspondent – as if hostages had never been strategically released before by Pyongyang . On the runway , asked if he hoped to go to North Korea himself , Trump said : “ It could happen . ”
Indeed , anything could happen with this irrational , impulsive president . Here ’ s the high risk : he expects total capitulation , and anything less than the “ comprehensive , verifiable , irreversible denuclearisation ” being demanded of North Korea will see his mood turn to furious revenge . This first small gesture is a long way from the final goal . Will anything less than total victory satisfy the nervy vanity of the US leader ?
North Korea has reneged on agreements before , its leader as unpredictable and combustible as the US president . So far , closing one nuclear test site is the first concrete offer . But negotiating the next stage requires subtlety , dexterity , patience , caution and some understanding of the other side – not team Trump qualities . Surrounding him are arch non-compromisers , including hawkish national security adviser John Bolton , all of them over-investing in the outcome , at risk of over-reacting to anything less than surrender . More cynical observers suggest that provoking these wild expectations will give them an excuse for attack when the deal falls short . Trump has given a blood-curdling warning of what failure means : “ If I can ’ t do it , it will be a very tough time for a lot of countries , and a lot of people . ”
Stand back and ask how realistic it is to expect a country that has acquired nuclear weapons to give them up altogether . North Korea has learned that nuclear weapons bring the mighty US president to negotiate on equal terms with a minnow , the poorest and weakest of countries . Look what happened to Muammar Gaddafi when he bartered away his nuclear capability . How perverse and provocative of Bolton to keep calling for a “ Libya-style deal ” when Kim knows how well that ended – with Gaddafi sodomised by bayonet and riddled with bullets .
Countries that turn nuclear illegally – Pakistan , Israel – gain power and status . Is Kim really willing to give that up absolutely ? Will Trump accept anything less ? The answer to both questions looks like a no . Jeffrey Lewis , arms control expert , warns in Foreign Policy that Kim has never pledged to abandon what he calls his “ powerful treasured sword ” . While the North/South Korean agreement speaks hazily of some future denuclearisation of the peninsula , Trump demands a specific short timeline .
Trump welcomes home three Americans released by North Korea Read more
Having visited South Korea a few months ago , I hear their pragmatism , feet planted firmly in the realm of the possible . Plenty of good could come from the negotiation , with Kim offering a moratorium on testing and on intercontinental-range ballistic missiles with a pledge not to use nuclear weapons . In a summit of reason , calm , and give-and-take , these are great prizes , signalling peaceful intent and normalisation of relations . But that won ’ t be enough for Trump and his hot-heads , so the higher they raise expectations , the more dangerous all this looks .
Meanwhile , overnight , the first direct result of Trump ’ s sabotage of the Iran nuclear deal landed with an entirely predicable thud . The 20 Iranian missiles fired into the occupied Golan Heights received a heavy Israeli retaliation on Iranian bases in Syria . Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel may go to war with Iran “ sooner rather than later ” to stop it attacking Israel , after urging Trump to end his support for the nuclear agreement with Iran .

As a full presidential welcome celebrates this gesture of peace, expectations of the upcoming Trump/Kim summit soar dangerously high.

“A remarkable foreign policy moment for Donald Trump,” said the breathless BBC correspondent – as if hostages had never been strategically released before by Pyongyang. On the runway, asked if he hoped to go to North Korea himself, Trump said: “It could happen.”

Indeed, anything could happen with this irrational, impulsive president. Here’s the high risk: he expects total capitulation, and anything less than the “comprehensive, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation” being demanded of North Korea will see his mood turn to furious revenge. This first small gesture is a long way from the final goal. Will anything less than total victory satisfy the nervy vanity of the US leader?

North Korea has reneged on agreements before, its leader as unpredictable and combustible as the US president. So far, closing one nuclear test site is the first concrete offer. But negotiating the next stage requires subtlety, dexterity, patience, caution and some understanding of the other side – not team Trump qualities. Surrounding him are arch non-compromisers, including hawkish national security adviser John Bolton, all of them over-investing in the outcome, at risk of over-reacting to anything less than surrender. More cynical observers suggest that provoking these wild expectations will give them an excuse for attack when the deal falls short. Trump has given a blood-curdling warning of what failure means: “If I can’t do it, it will be a very tough time for a lot of countries, and a lot of people.”

Stand back and ask how realistic it is to expect a country that has acquired nuclear weapons to give them up altogether. North Korea has learned that nuclear weapons bring the mighty US president to negotiate on equal terms with a minnow, the poorest and weakest of countries. Look what happened to Muammar Gaddafi when he bartered away his nuclear capability. How perverse and provocative of Bolton to keep calling for a “Libya-style deal” when Kim knows how well that ended – with Gaddafi sodomised by bayonet and riddled with bullets.

Countries that turn nuclear illegally – Pakistan, Israel – gain power and status. Is Kim really willing to give that up absolutely? Will Trump accept anything less? The answer to both questions looks like a no. Jeffrey Lewis, arms control expert, warns in Foreign Policy that Kim has never pledged to abandon what he calls his “powerful treasured sword”. While the North/South Korean agreement speaks hazily of some future denuclearisation of the peninsula, Trump demands a specific short timeline.

Having visited South Korea a few months ago, I hear their pragmatism, feet planted firmly in the realm of the possible. Plenty of good could come from the negotiation, with Kim offering a moratorium on testing and on intercontinental-range ballistic missiles with a pledge not to use nuclear weapons. In a summit of reason, calm, and give-and-take, these are great prizes, signalling peaceful intent and normalisation of relations. But that won’t be enough for Trump and his hot-heads, so the higher they raise expectations, the more dangerous all this looks.

Meanwhile, overnight, the first direct result of Trump’s sabotage of the Iran nuclear deal landed with an entirely predicable thud. The 20 Iranian missiles fired into the occupied Golan Heights received a heavy Israeli retaliation on Iranian bases in Syria. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel may go to war with Iran “sooner rather than later” to stop it attacking Israel, after urging Trump to end his support for the nuclear agreement with Iran.

Trump unilaterally tearing up an international treaty is an act of war, near as damn it. The cringe-making sight of European leaders hugging, hand-holding and flattering the US president was all to no avail, as he treats his closest allies’ views with petulant contempt. Now he stands alone in the world, with only Israel and Saudi Arabia staunchly by his side, as his Iran sanctions fall on everyone else, with oil prices already soaring. As he fulfils all the world’s worst fears and expectations, don’t hold your breath for North Korea to be the peace victory that counterbalances wars caused by Trump elsewhere.

In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency , the government said the sanctions were a “ violent violation of our sovereignty ” and part of a “ heinous plot to isolate and stifle ” the country .
The UN security council unanimously backed new sanctions on Saturday that could slash the regime ’ s $ 3bn in annual export revenue by a third . The measures target key revenue earners such as coal , iron , lead and seafood – but not oil .
Pyongyang threatened to take “ righteous action ” , describing the sanctions as a crime for which the US would pay “ thousands of times ” .
The US secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , said on Monday that North Korea should halt missile launches if it wanted to negotiate .
The UN measures forbid China , Russia and other countries from hiring any more North Korean labourers , whose remittances help fund the regime , and prohibit joint ventures with the country and any new investment in existing business partnerships .
The US ambassador to the UN , Nikki Haley , described the measures as “ the single largest economic sanctions package ever levelled ” against North Korea .

North Korea has vowed to exact “thousands-fold” revenge against the US after the UN imposed new sanctions in response to its recent tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the government said the sanctions were a “violent violation of our sovereignty” and part of a “heinous plot to isolate and stifle” the country.

The UN security council unanimously backed new sanctions on Saturday that could slash the regime’s $3bn in annual export revenue by a third. The measures target key revenue earners such as coal, iron, lead and seafood – but not oil.



Pyongyang threatened to take “righteous action”, describing the sanctions as a crime for which the US would pay “thousands of times”.

The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said on Monday that North Korea should halt missile launches if it wanted to negotiate.

The UN measures forbid China, Russia and other countries from hiring any more North Korean labourers, whose remittances help fund the regime, and prohibit joint ventures with the country and any new investment in existing business partnerships.

The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, described the measures as “the single largest economic sanctions package ever levelled” against North Korea.

Q&A Why does the North Korean regime pursue a nuclear programme? Show Hide Much of the regime’s domestic legitimacy rests on portraying the country as under constant threat from the US and its regional allies, South Korea and Japan.

To support the claim that it is in Washington’s crosshairs, North Korea cites the tens of thousands of US troops lined up along the southern side of the demilitarised zone – the heavily fortified border dividing the Korean peninsula. Faced with what it says are US provocations, North Korea says it has as much right as any other state to develop a nuclear deterrent. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un is also aware of the fate of other dictators who lack nuclear weapons.

In a telephone call on Monday, the US president, Donald Trump, and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, agreed that Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes “pose a grave and growing direct threat” and vowed to apply maximum pressure on the regime.

Some still doubt North Korea can make a warhead small enough , or miniaturize it enough , to mount atop a missile . But that 's what North Korea said it proved Friday .
South Korean monitors said Friday 's nuclear test had a yield equivalent to 10 kilotons of TNT , which would make it North Korea 's most powerful of five tests to date
That blast came just days after North Korea test-fired three ballistic missiles , which landed in Japan 's Air Defense Identification Zone , about 155 miles ( 250 kilometers ) from a Japanese island . Last month , a missile fired from a submarine also landed in the same zone .
`` They 've been demonstrating not just the ability to cause a nuclear detonation , but to mount it and turn it into a weapon , '' said John Delury , an assistant professor of East Asian studies at Yonsei University in South Korea .
`` If there 's evidence that they can do that -- or they have done that -- then this is a major concern for the region , '' Alexander Neill , a North Korea expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Asia , said .
Friday 's nuclear test was North Korea 's second this year , something that shows North Korea is `` mastering the technology , '' said Lassina Zerbo , executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization .
But analysts say there 's no way to determine the extent of North Korea 's missile technology until they actually use it .
`` We ca n't learn anything about the physical size of the device , '' said Melissa Hanham , senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey , California .
`` My deep fear is that they will launch a live nuclear weapon on one of their missiles , '' Hanham said . `` It would be hard for Japan , China , the US , to know that it was a test and not the real thing . ... That would be extremely dangerous as that could trigger a war . ''
Reaction was swift and harsh around the world after Friday 's test with the United States , Russia , South Korea , and even China , with whom North Korea shares a border and a long but frayed diplomatic relationship , denouncing it .
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called Friday 's test `` a significant threat to the safety of our country . ''
Christopher Hill , the former US ambassador to South Korea , said Friday it 's time to stop guessing about North Korea 's capabilities and start planning a response .
`` Before long , I think they 're going to have a nuclear warhead on a missile and we have to look really carefully and see what we 're going to do , '' said Hill , who was the top U.S. diplomat in Seoul from 2004 to 2005 .
Hill said the world ca n't expect North Korea to bow to further sanctions or even be open to new negotiations over its nuclear program .
`` I would n't make bets on whether Kim Jong Un would be a reasonable guy , '' Hill said . `` I do n't put it past them to threaten countries and suggest that they will be prepared to launch a nuclear strike . ''
The solution may come in an alliance with China , said Hill , who was also assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs from 2005 to 2009 .
`` I think we need to sit down with the Chinese ... and say together we need to solve this , '' Hill said of North Korea 's weapons program . `` What direct means we can take to either slow it down or kill it ? ''
Philip Yun , executive director of the Ploughshares Fund , an organization that aims to eliminate nuclear weapons , also said the world can not delay a response to North Korea 's testing .
`` Unless we figure out a way to deal with North Korea and stop their activity , at some point in the near future they 're going to have a relatively sophisticated nuclear arsenal that is capable of hitting the United States and that is a huge problem , '' Yun said .","(CNN) Could North Korea actually put a nuclear warhead atop a rocket and fire it at a potential adversary?

Trump days later announced that the summit was back on but has remained only cautiously optimistic about how the historic meeting would pan out. On Saturday, he told reporters that while he was optimistic, Kim would only get one chance.

“It’s unknown territory in the truest sense, but I really feel confident,"" he said. ""I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people and he has that opportunity and he won't have that opportunity again.""

""It’s a one-time shot and I think it's going to work out very well,"" he said.

At the end of the presser, he said that the minimum he was hoping for was a relationship and a dialogue. When asked how quickly he will know if something good will come of the summit and if Kim was serious, Trump said he’d know very quickly.

“Within the first minute I’ll know,” he said.

As for what issues would be raised at the summit, Trump said everything will be on the table:

“We’re going to raise every issue, every issue will be raised,” he said.",www.foxnews.com,right,TLXg0ZjfMQr4auYb

It was a week in which Donald Trump ’ s relationship with Russia and domestic issues such as healthcare took a back seat , and probably the most intractable problem in the president ’ s foreign policy in-tray came to the fore , as Trump and North Korea competed to ratchet up the rhetoric over Pyongyang ’ s nuclear arsenal .
At the United Nations on Saturday , the UN security council voted unanimously to impose new sanctions on North Korea for its recent missile tests , cutting about a third of its export revenue . Trump said he was “ very happy and impressed ” with the vote , which saw both China and Russia side against Pyongyang in the wake of a test which experts said meant North Korea could now potentially reach the continental United States .
Vice-President Mike Pence has walked a tightrope few others in the White House have managed during the seven months of Trump ’ s presidency : keeping himself out of the jaws of the Russia inquiry – despite questions over what he knew about the fired national security adviser Michael Flynn – and out of the line of fire of his boss ’ s Twitter account .
So far , anyway . On Sunday , Pence was forced to push back forcefully against a New York Times article suggesting he is preparing for a presidential run in 2020 , calling it “ disgraceful ” , “ offensive ” and “ categorically false ” in a statement many saw as largely directed towards one reader : the man currently on vacation at his golf club in Bedminster , New Jersey . Sorry , my mistake – as Trump tweeted on Saturday : “ This is not a vacation – meetings and calls ! ”
North Korea reacted badly to the UN sanctions , vowing to exact a “ thousand-fold ” revenge on the US and threatening to take “ righteous action ” in response . “ There is no bigger mistake than the United States believing that its land is safe across the ocean , ” the KCNA state news agency said .
Elsewhere , ███ revealed that two congressional staffers had travelled to London last month to contact Christopher Steele , the former British intelligence officer behind the infamous unconfirmed Trump dossier , on the orders of an aide to Devin Nunes , the chairman of the House intelligence committee and a close ally of the White House . The committee is investigating links between Trump and Russia and the revelation shone a light on the power struggle for control of the inquiry .
Tensions with North Korea continued to rise , with Japan warning that Pyongyang may now have the acquired the ability to miniaturise nuclear warheads – necessary if it wants to use its new intercontinental ballistic missiles for a nuclear strike on the US . That warning was followed by a story in the Washington Post stating that US intelligence agencies believed the same thing .
That development appeared to prompt a startlingly bellicose response from Trump , who told journalists at his Bedminster golf club : “ North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States . They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen . ”
As experts warned that such bombastic threats could lead Kim Jong-un to overreact , North Korea said it was “ carefully examining ” a plan for a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam – home to significant US naval and air bases – and could carry out a pre-emptive operation if the US showed signs of “ provocation ” .
In domestic news , at an event billed as a “ major briefing ” on the US opioid crisis , the president rebuffed a call from his commission on the subject to declare the situation a national emergency , and focused instead on harsher sentences and policing the Mexican border , without mentioning the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture many addictive painkillers such as Vicodin and OxyContin within the US . The health secretary , Tom Price , said the administration did not think it was necessary to declare an emergency “ although all things are on the table for the president ” . Critics claimed the president was stuck in a 1980s view of how to tackle drug abuse .
Defying Trump ’ s pledge to respond militarily to any more threats from North Korea , Pyongyang set out a detailed plan to attack Guam , with Gen Kim Rak-gyom , the head of the country ’ s strategic forces , outlining a demonstration launch of four intermediate-range missiles that would fly over Japan and then land in the sea around the US territory , “ enveloping ” the island .
The statement said the plan for this show of force would be ready by the middle of this month and then await orders from Kim . Trump ’ s comments , it said , were a “ load of nonsense ” and the president himself was “ a guy bereft of reason … only absolute force can work on him ” .
In Russia news , it emerged that the FBI used a search warrant to raid the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort ’ s home late last month – indicating agents are likely to have had probable cause to believe Manafort might not comply with a subpoena request to hand over all relevant records .
Addressing reporters at Bedminster at two wide ranging Q & A sessions on Thursday , Trump warned Kim that if “ he does something in Guam , it will be an event the likes of which nobody ’ s seen before , what will happen in North Korea ” and mused that his “ fire and fury ” statement of earlier in the week may not have been tough enough . He would not rule out a pre-emptive strike , but also said he would consider negotiations .
The president also seemed to reverse course on the opioid epidemic , saying : “ We ’ re going to draw it up and we ’ re going to make it a national emergency. ” It was not immediately clear whether this would lead to a formal declaration , something that would empower the government to quickly expand access to in-patient treatment services and negotiate lower prices for the overdose reversal drug naloxone .
In stark contrast to his condemnation of US sanctions against Russia last week , Trump praised Russia ’ s sanctions against the US , saying it was good Vladimir Putin had ordered the US to cut 755 diplomatic staff in Russia because “ we ’ re trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I ’ m concerned , I ’ m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll ” .
While continuing to deny collusion with Russia over what US intelligence says was Moscow ’ s attempt to swing the election in his favour last year , Trump seemed to acknowledge that some of his staff might have broken rules regarding their meetings with Russians . “ Did they do something wrong because they didn ’ t file the right document or whatever ? ” he asked . “ Perhaps , you ’ d have to look at them , but I guarantee you this , there are probably a lot of people in Washington who did the same thing. ” As for Manafort , the raid on his house was “ pretty tough stuff ” , the president said .
A study found that the uncertainty triggered by the Trump administration ’ s statements and actions regarding the future of Barack Obama ’ s healthcare reforms is triggering double-digit premium increases on individual health insurance policies purchased by many consumers . Trump made time to attack Mitch McConnell on the issue , suggesting the Republican leader in the Senate might have to step down if he failed to enact his legislative agenda . “ Mitch , get back to work and put Repeal & Replace , Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing , ” he instructed the veteran senator later on Twitter , adding encouragingly : “ You can do it ! ”
As the US and South Korea prepared for scheduled military exercises later this month – now fraught with tension – Trump kept the pressure up on Kim with a tweet on Friday morning threatening Pyongyang again , but indicating he wanted to avoid hostilities . “ Military solutions are now fully in place , locked and loaded , should North Korea act unwisely , ” he wrote . “ Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path ! ”
But despite the gung-ho language there was no change in US deployments in the region or a change in the alert status of US forces . And it was reported on Friday that the Trump administration had reopened a channel of communication between American and North Korean diplomats at the United Nations .
Trump later said of Kim : “ If he utters one threat , in the form of an overt threat ... or if he does anything with respect to Guam , or any place else that ’ s an American territory or an American ally , he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast . ”
Worrying stuff . If you need cheering up , take a look at the listing on Airbnb for Trump ’ s childhood home , a bargain at $ 725 a night .

WILMINGTON, Del. — People from all over the country are calling for a University of Delaware adjunct professor to be fired after she wrote on Facebook that Otto Warmbier ""got exactly what he deserved"" after being taken into custody by North Korea, falling into a coma and dying.

On her personal Facebook page, Kathy Dettwyler, an anthropology professor, wrote Tuesday that Warmbier was ""typical of a mindset of a lot of the young, white, rich, clueless males who come into my classes.""

""These are the same kids who cry about their grades because they didn't think they'd really have to read and study the material to get a good grade. ... His parents ultimately are to blame for his growing up thinking he could get away with whatever he wanted. Maybe in the US, where young, white, rich, clueless white males routinely get away with raping women. Not so much in North Korea. And of course, it's Ottos' parents who will pay the price for the rest of their lives.""

Medical mysteries surround end of Otto Warmbier's life

Dettwyler made similar remarks in the comments section of an article published by the National Review. Her Facebook page has since been taken down or made private.

Warmbier, who died on Monday, was a University of Virginia student visiting North Korea in January 2016 when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years hard labor after being accused of stealing a propaganda poster from his hotel.

Two months after his sentence he suffered a neurological injury and went into a coma. He was returned to his family last week and died shortly thereafter.

The university released the following statement regarding Dettwyler's online comments about Warmbier:

""The comments of Katherine Dettwyler do not reflect the values or position of the University of Delaware. We condemn any and all messages that endorse hatred and convey insensitivity toward a tragic event such as the one that Otto Warmbier and his family suffered.

""The University of Delaware values respect and civility and we are committed to global education and study abroad; therefore we find these comments particularly distressing and inconsistent with our values. Our sympathies are with the Warmbier family.""

The tweet has been shared by thousands, many of whom called for Dettwyler's resignation/termination and said they would not be sending their children to the university in light of her comments.

When asked if any disciplinary action would be taken against Dettwyler, university spokeswoman Andrea Boyle said, ""We are not able to comment on the specifics of her employment. Personnel matters are confidential.""

Dettwlyer, reached by email, had no comment.

`` So much for China working with us , '' the US president tweeted .
The US and South Korea conducted a ballistic missile fire exercise in the Sea of Japan in response to the North .
China and Russia have urged both sides to stop flexing their military muscle and said they oppose any attempts at regime change in North Korea .
`` It is perfectly clear to Russia and China that any attempts to justify the use of force by referring to [ United Nations ] Security Council resolutions are unacceptable , and will lead to unpredictable consequences in this region which borders both the Russian Federation and the People 's Republic of China , '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said .
`` Attempts to strangle the DPRK [ North Korea ] economically are equally unacceptable , '' he added .
The missile launch , the latest in a series of tests , was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council .
The US has asked for an urgent meeting of the Security Council to discuss the issue . A closed-door session of the 15-member body will take place later on Wednesday .
The US president held talks with China 's leader Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida in April .
Mr Trump hailed `` tremendous progress '' with China after those meetings .
The trade figures showing an increase in trade between China and North Korea , which he was apparently referring to in Wednesday 's critical tweet , appear to relate to the period before that April meeting .
The US president is now en route to Poland and Germany , where he will meet Mr Xi for the second time .
China , which is Pyongyang 's main economic ally , and Russia have called on North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile programme in exchange for a halt on the large-scale military exercises by the US and South Korea .
Mr Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin , who met in Moscow on Tuesday , said `` the opposing sides should start negotiations '' .
Japan on Tuesday said `` repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable '' and lodged a protest .
There 's little doubt the honeymoon between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping is over .
The administration is frustrated that China is n't doing more to put the squeeze on North Korea . Beijing is angry about recent moves taken by the White House , including sanctions on a Chinese bank for doing `` illicit '' business with Pyongyang , and a $ 1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan .
In one way this tension is neither new nor surprising - previous American presidents encountered similar resistance from Beijing , which is determined to prevent chaotic upheaval in North Korea . But the stakes are higher because Pyongyang 's nuclear weapons programme is becoming more of a threat .
Mr Trump might respond by imposing more sanctions on Chinese banks and front companies that deal with North Korea . But some Asia experts say China would be readier to increase economic pressure on the regime if the US took up Beijing 's push for negotiations to deal with the crisis .
Tuesday 's launch was North Korea 's first-ever test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) .
State news agency KCNA quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a `` gift '' to the Americans on their independence day .
The report warned of the possibility of more tests , saying he ordered officials to `` frequently send big and small 'gift packages ' to the Yankees '' .
Pyongyang said earlier the Hwasong-14 ICBM had reached an altitude of 2,802km ( 1,731 miles ) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea .
North Korea , it said , was now `` a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world '' .
A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead
The minimum range is 5,500km ( 3,400 miles ) , although most fly about 10,000km or more
Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs : the KN-08 , with a range of 11,500km , and the KN-14 , with a range of 10,000km , but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM . It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14
Some experts believe that Tuesday 's test proves that North Korea has a missile that could travel across the globe and reach Alaska .
Physicist David Wright said it could reach a maximum range of about 6,700km on a standard trajectory , while South Korea 's defence ministry on Wednesday put the range between 7,000 and 8,000km .
But whether that missile could deliver a warhead is still a question .
Pyongyang claimed the rocket carried a `` heavy warhead '' and that it `` accurately hit the targeted waters without any structural breakdown '' .
South Korea said there was no evidence proving the missile could withstand high temperatures and successfully re-enter the atmosphere , reported Yonhap news agency .
Experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead , fit it onto a long-range missile , and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target .
They say many of North Korea 's missiles can not accurately hit targets .
But others believe that at the rate it is going , Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon that could strike the US within five to 10 years .
What now for Washington ? - Dr John Nilsson-Wright , Chatham House
By bringing Alaska within range , the new missile test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms .
US territory ( albeit separate from the contiguous continental US ) is now finally within Pyongyang 's cross-hairs .
For the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a `` real and present '' danger not merely to north-east Asia and America 's key allies - but to the US proper .

""So much for China working with us,"" the US president tweeted.

The US and South Korea conducted a ballistic missile fire exercise in the Sea of Japan in response to the North.

China and Russia have urged both sides to stop flexing their military muscle and said they oppose any attempts at regime change in North Korea.

""It is perfectly clear to Russia and China that any attempts to justify the use of force by referring to [United Nations] Security Council resolutions are unacceptable, and will lead to unpredictable consequences in this region which borders both the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.

""Attempts to strangle the DPRK [North Korea] economically are equally unacceptable,"" he added.

The missile launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council.

The US has asked for an urgent meeting of the Security Council to discuss the issue. A closed-door session of the 15-member body will take place later on Wednesday.

The US president held talks with China's leader Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida in April.

Mr Trump hailed ""tremendous progress"" with China after those meetings.

The trade figures showing an increase in trade between China and North Korea, which he was apparently referring to in Wednesday's critical tweet, appear to relate to the period before that April meeting.

The US president is now en route to Poland and Germany, where he will meet Mr Xi for the second time.

China, which is Pyongyang's main economic ally, and Russia have called on North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile programme in exchange for a halt on the large-scale military exercises by the US and South Korea.

Mr Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in Moscow on Tuesday, said ""the opposing sides should start negotiations"".

Japan on Tuesday said ""repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable"" and lodged a protest.

Why have US-China relations soured?

Barbara Plett Usher, BBC State Department correspondent

There's little doubt the honeymoon between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping is over.

The administration is frustrated that China isn't doing more to put the squeeze on North Korea. Beijing is angry about recent moves taken by the White House, including sanctions on a Chinese bank for doing ""illicit"" business with Pyongyang, and a $1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan.

In one way this tension is neither new nor surprising - previous American presidents encountered similar resistance from Beijing, which is determined to prevent chaotic upheaval in North Korea. But the stakes are higher because Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme is becoming more of a threat.

Mr Trump might respond by imposing more sanctions on Chinese banks and front companies that deal with North Korea. But some Asia experts say China would be readier to increase economic pressure on the regime if the US took up Beijing's push for negotiations to deal with the crisis.

What has North Korea said?

Tuesday's launch was North Korea's first-ever test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

State news agency KCNA quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a ""gift"" to the Americans on their independence day.

The report warned of the possibility of more tests, saying he ordered officials to ""frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees"".

Pyongyang said earlier the Hwasong-14 ICBM had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea.

North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"".

What is an ICBM?

A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead

The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more

Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14

North Korea's missile programme in detail

Does North Korea really have a long-range weapon now?

Some experts believe that Tuesday's test proves that North Korea has a missile that could travel across the globe and reach Alaska.

Physicist David Wright said it could reach a maximum range of about 6,700km on a standard trajectory, while South Korea's defence ministry on Wednesday put the range between 7,000 and 8,000km.

But whether that missile could deliver a warhead is still a question.

Pyongyang claimed the rocket carried a ""heavy warhead"" and that it ""accurately hit the targeted waters without any structural breakdown"".

South Korea said there was no evidence proving the missile could withstand high temperatures and successfully re-enter the atmosphere, reported Yonhap news agency.

Experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it onto a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target.

They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets.

But others believe that at the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon that could strike the US within five to 10 years.

How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme?

What now for Washington? - Dr John Nilsson-Wright, Chatham House

Image copyright KCNA Image caption North Korean media released this image of Tuesday's missile launch

By bringing Alaska within range, the new missile test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms.

US territory (albeit separate from the contiguous continental US) is now finally within Pyongyang's cross-hairs.

For the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a ""real and present"" danger not merely to north-east Asia and America's key allies - but to the US proper.

President Trump's weakness lies in having overplayed his hand too publicly and too loudly.

“Most notably, the administration has yet to impose sanctions on any of the many Chinese companies and banks that, according to a recent U.N. report, continue to support the North Korean regime. This must change. We’ve seen before that China will only comply with sanctions if Chinese banks face real consequences for doing business in North Korea.



“The United States and our foreign partners should also act quickly to sanction North Korea’s state-owned airline. Air Koryo continues to flagrantly violate the ban on luxury goods and has been implicated in the proliferation of SCUD missile parts. At the same time, the administration must also work with European governments to better block luxury items – including cars, watches, and liquor – from reaching North Korea’s repressive ruling elite,"" Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce released in a statement. “Aggressive sanctions enforcement, along with a renewed focus on stopping the North Korean regime’s export of slave labor, is key to cutting off the cash needed to sustain Kim Jong Un’s power, and his illicit weapons programs. Today’s detonation wasn’t just about testing nuclear technology. It was also about testing America’s resolve. Now is the time for this administration to act.”

– Olympic ice-breaker –

Last year Pyongyang carried out its sixth nuclear blast, by far its most powerful to date, and launched missiles capable of reaching the US mainland.

Its actions sent tensions soaring as Kim and Trump traded personal insults and threats of war.

Moon seized on the South’s Winter Olympics as an opportunity to broker dialogue between them, and has said his meeting with Kim will serve to set up the summit between Pyongyang and Washington.

The White House said it hoped the summit would “achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula”.

Trump has demanded the North give up its weapons, and Washington is pressing for it to do so in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way.

Seoul had played down expectations before the summit, saying the North’s technological advances in its nuclear and missile programmes made the summit “all the more difficult”.

Pyongyang is demanding as yet unspecified security guarantees to discuss its arsenal.

North Korea claimed it successfully test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile Tuesday which, if true, is a potential milestone in its mission to develop a weapon with a nuclear warhead capable of reaching the United States.

North Korea said the missile was capable of hitting targets anywhere in the world and a U.S. scientist said that with an altered trajectory the missile could strike Alaska.

However, the North's claim contradicted South Korean and U.S. officials who earlier said it was an intermediate-range ballistic missile. Cho Han Gyu, director of operations at South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff, said South Korean and U.S. intelligence were determining whether the missile has intercontinental capability.

It also follows a vow by Trump to stop Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions and amid rising tensions between the U.S. president and China's leader Xi Jinping. China is one of North Korea's few allies.

The timing of the launch could have been undertaken for maximum symbolic effect: It took place on the eve of the July 4th holiday in the U.S.

Abe, who talked by phone with Trump on Monday, said the two leaders plan to seek cooperation from leaders when they attend the G-20 summit in Germany this week.

People in the North Korean capital Pyongyang praised the launch.

Ri Song Gil, 38, said the ""time when the U.S. could threaten the world with nuclear weapons has passed away.”

Kim Hye Ok, 27, added that the launch was “extremely delightful news.”

The Korean Peninsula has been divided between the American-backed South and the authoritarian North since the 1950-53 Korean War.

Worries have increased as the North’s leader pushes to expand his nuclear arsenal and develop ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear warheads.

Tuesday’s launch is the first by the North since a June 8 test of a new type of missile that Pyongyang says is capable of striking U.S. and South Korean warships “at will.”

north_korea,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44134910,North Korea threatens to cancel Trump summit,,,"North Korea has said it may pull out of a summit with US President Donald Trump if the US insists it gives up its nuclear weapons unilaterally .
The highly anticipated meeting between Mr Trump and North Korea 's Kim Jong-un is due to take place on 12 June .
But in an angry statement , North Korea 's vice-foreign minister accused the US of making reckless statements and of harbouring sinister intentions .
He pointed the finger squarely at US National Security Adviser John Bolton .
`` We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him , '' Kim Kye-gwan said .
The White House has responded by saying it is still hopeful the meeting will go ahead .
`` The president is ready if the meeting takes place . If it does n't , we 'll continue the maximum pressure campaign that 's been ongoing , '' said spokesperson Sarah Sanders .
The groundbreaking agreement for Mr Kim and Mr Trump to meet came about as North Korea said it was committed to denuclearising the Korean peninsula .
Exactly what that would entail has remained unclear , but North Korea has invited foreign media to witness the dismantling of its main nuclear test site later this month .
Mr Bolton recently said North Korea could follow a `` Libya model '' of verifiable denuclearisation , but this alarms Pyongyang , which watched Libya 's Colonel Gaddafi give up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later .
The BBC 's Laura Bicker in Seoul says North Korea - which had long said its nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival as a state - is now making its demands clear .
The whole reason it has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal , at such a great cost , is for survival .
So to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya or indeed Iraq as John Bolton did on Sunday is not going to offer much comfort . Both regimes collapsed .
This is also a warning shot to the Trump administration . They will be aware how much Mr Trump wants this summit and how it is being spun as a success brought about by his maximum pressure strategy .

North Korea has said it may pull out of a summit with US President Donald Trump if the US insists it gives up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.

The highly anticipated meeting between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un is due to take place on 12 June.

But in an angry statement, North Korea's vice-foreign minister accused the US of making reckless statements and of harbouring sinister intentions.

He pointed the finger squarely at US National Security Adviser John Bolton.

""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" Kim Kye-gwan said.

The White House has responded by saying it is still hopeful the meeting will go ahead.

""The president is ready if the meeting takes place. If it doesn't, we'll continue the maximum pressure campaign that's been ongoing,"" said spokesperson Sarah Sanders.

The groundbreaking agreement for Mr Kim and Mr Trump to meet came about as North Korea said it was committed to denuclearising the Korean peninsula.

Exactly what that would entail has remained unclear, but North Korea has invited foreign media to witness the dismantling of its main nuclear test site later this month.

Mr Bolton recently said North Korea could follow a ""Libya model"" of verifiable denuclearisation, but this alarms Pyongyang, which watched Libya's Colonel Gaddafi give up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later.

The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says North Korea - which had long said its nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival as a state - is now making its demands clear.

Why has the North changed its tune?

The whole reason it has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal, at such a great cost, is for survival.

So to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya or indeed Iraq as John Bolton did on Sunday is not going to offer much comfort. Both regimes collapsed.

This is also a warning shot to the Trump administration. They will be aware how much Mr Trump wants this summit and how it is being spun as a success brought about by his maximum pressure strategy.

There were signs this boasting irritated Pyongyang, but now it has decided to speak out through someone in a position of power.

North Korea wants the world to know that it is coming to the negotiating table from a position of strength, and they may feel that they are making all the concessions.

They've suspended all missile tests, released the three US detainees, Kim Jong-un met President Moon and the pair signed a declaration, and they're about to dismantle a nuclear test site in front of international media.

So to hear the Trump administration claiming credit for a deal they don't like has been a step too far.

These statements more than hint that North Korea is prepared to walk away from President Trump's summit in Singapore until it does hear a deal it does like.

What else does the North's statement say?

Mr Kim's statement, carried by state media, said that if the US ""corners us and unilaterally demands we give up nuclear weapons we will no longer have an interest in talks"" and ""will have to reconsider"" attending the 12 June summit in Singapore.

He said North Korea did have ""high hopes"" but that it was ""very unfortunate that the US is provoking us ahead of the summit by spitting out ludicrous statements"".

Kim Kye-gwan is known to be highly respected in the North Korean leadership and has taken part in negotiations with the US before. There is very little chance his comments were not personally endorsed by Kim Jong-un.

Hours before the announcement, in a sign of growing problems, North Korea had also pulled out of a meeting scheduled with South Korea on Wednesday. because of anger over the start of US-South Korea joint military drills.

North Korea had earlier said it would allow them to go ahead, but then called them ""a provocative military ruckus"" which was undermining its diplomatic efforts.

The sudden change in tone from Pyongyang is said to have taken US officials by surprise. Analysts said North Korea could be trying to strengthen its hand before talks.

The US state department said it was continuing to plan the Trump-Kim meeting, and Mr Trump is yet to comment.

A Chinese government spokesman urged North Korea and the US to ""meet each other halfway"" ahead of negotiations.

Why the personal attack on John Bolton?

The hawkish conservative is a firm defender of US power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad. He has previously said it would be ""perfectly legitimate"" to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea.

In media interviews over the weekend, he said North Korea could follow a Libyan model of nuclear disarmament - Libya gave up its weapons' programmes in the early 2000s and only then secured economic aid and normalised relations with the US.

This would be a chance to make history on par with President Nixon going to China and the collapse of the Soviet Union . Our grandchildren and their grandchildren would learn about this in school .
But , we must be clear , nothing is certain . We are a long way from the two leaders sitting down . My guess is that they will meet somewhere along the Demilitarized Zone dividing North from South Korea , trying to solve one of the world ’ s most dangerous foreign policy challenges – the removal of North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons .

For example , if Kim demands U.S. troops leave the Korean peninsula or demands that America destroy its own nuclear arsenal , the negotiations will implode in absurdity .
To avoid such a scenario , here is how I would recommend the Trump administration proceed :
First , President Trump should demand the meeting can only take place in South Korea – and I would insist it be at the Demilitarized Zone .
Kim is likely eager to have the meeting in his capital of Pyongyang , to show his people he delivered the ultimate prize – an American president who is trying to sue for peace on Kim ’ s terms .
If President Trump goes to the North we would also run the risk of legitimizing a nation that still has 100,000-plus people in prison camps and holds U.S. citizens as its captives . We simply can ’ t take such a risk . If North Korea demands the talks be on Kim ’ s home court , President Trump needs to say there won ’ t be talks .
Next , President Trump must make it clear to Kim that there will be no letup in planned U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise set for the end of this month . As North Korea has trained its army all winter long , Washington and Seoul must be afforded that same right . If Pyongyang insists on these exercises being cancelled , President Trump should walk away from the potential bargaining table .
Third , North Korea must get no economic incentives for coming to the bargaining table . If Kim insists on a bribe – food aid , fuel or any letup of the maximum pressure campaign of economic sanctions – President Trump needs to make it clear that won ’ t happen . If North Korea puts its hand out for cash , Trump needs to pull his hand away – and walk . No exceptions .
And finally , for talks to commence , North Korea must spell out at least a preliminary roadmap to what it would offer in terms of denuclearization . This will allow President Trump to ensure we aren ’ t about to go through a replay of the old North Korean negotiating strategy : offer talks to stall for time and build more advanced nuclear weapons and missiles .
If North Korea will not offer even the faintest idea of how , when and where it will remove its nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula – and it looks like Kim is just playing for time – President Trump needs to decline Kim ’ s invitation .
In many respects , we are very much in unchartered waters . However , President Trump is smart to test North Korea ’ s intentions and see what very well could be history in the making .
My gut tells me that this is most likely another in a long line of Kim family fiascos , an effort to gain sanctions relief . But the Trump administration owes it to history to give this a shot . The bell simply may never ring again .","“When history comes calling you answer the door. You simply have no choice.

We simply can’t take such a risk. If North Korea demands the talks be on Kim’s home court, President Trump needs to say there won’t be talks.

Next, President Trump must make it clear to Kim that there will be no letup in planned U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise set for the end of this month. As North Korea has trained its army all winter long, Washington and Seoul must be afforded that same right. If Pyongyang insists on these exercises being cancelled, President Trump should walk away from the potential bargaining table.

Third, North Korea must get no economic incentives for coming to the bargaining table. If Kim insists on a bribe – food aid, fuel or any letup of the maximum pressure campaign of economic sanctions – President Trump needs to make it clear that won’t happen. If North Korea puts its hand out for cash, Trump needs to pull his hand away – and walk. No exceptions.

And finally, for talks to commence, North Korea must spell out at least a preliminary roadmap to what it would offer in terms of denuclearization. This will allow President Trump to ensure we aren’t about to go through a replay of the old North Korean negotiating strategy: offer talks to stall for time and build more advanced nuclear weapons and missiles.

If North Korea will not offer even the faintest idea of how, when and where it will remove its nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula – and it looks like Kim is just playing for time – President Trump needs to decline Kim’s invitation.

In many respects, we are very much in unchartered waters. However, President Trump is smart to test North Korea’s intentions and see what very well could be history in the making.

My gut tells me that this is most likely another in a long line of Kim family fiascos, an effort to gain sanctions relief. But the Trump administration owes it to history to give this a shot. The bell simply may never ring again.",www.foxnews.com,right,Hpkp4eIYbvpzMZdj

North and South Korea have exchanged gunfire in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) which divides the two countries.

North Korea has reopened a hotline to South Korea, almost two years after it was disabled on the orders of leader Kim Jong-un.

South Korea confirmed it had received a call from the North at 15:30 local time (06:30 GMT) on Wednesday.

The North Korean leader had earlier said he was open to dialogue with Seoul and to sending a team to the Winter Olympics in the South next month.

Why have the Olympics become so important?

In a New Year's Day speech, Mr Kim spoke of lowering tensions and of melting ""frozen North-South relations"".

When did the line stop being used?

North Korea cut off communications on the hotline in 2016, following a row over the Kaesong industrial complex.

The complex was a joint economic venture between the two Koreas, but the South suspended the project in response to a nuclear weapons test by the North.

Have the two already held secret meetings?

In China in late December, according to North Korean leadership specialist Michael Madden.

A North Korean vice-minister of athletics was sent to interact with his South Korean counterparts, who may or may not have been acting on President Moon's instructions, he says, adding that this might ease the higher-level talks.

Will nuclear testing be discussed?

North Korea has come under increasing international pressure in the past year over its nuclear weapons programme.

President Moon said the North's continuing tests would be the backdrop to any new discussions about the Olympics.

What role might the US play?

At the same time as offering an apparent olive branch to the South, Mr Kim used his speech to repeat threats against the US, saying a nuclear launch button was always on his table.

US state department spokesman Heather Nauert said that Mr Kim's latest move ""may be trying to drive a wedge of some sort between the two nations - between our nation and the Republic of Korea [South Korea]"".

Washington has encouraged all countries to isolate North Korea.

The South says it has discussed its latest steps with the US.

Meanwhile, Mr Trump remains outspoken in his tweets. On Tuesday night, the US president boasted that his nuclear button was ""much bigger"" and ""more powerful"" than the North Korean leader's.

north_korea,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0428/John-Kasich-raises-taking-out-top-North-Korean-leaders,John Kasich raises 'taking out' top North Korean leaders,2017-04-28,Linda Feldmann,"With that bold assertion , Gov . John Kasich ( R ) of Ohio raised a controversial argument for American action aimed at neutralizing the North Korean nuclear threat .
“ An ability to remove a number of the top people , and have a more benign leadership there that understands what ’ s at risk , I think is perhaps doable , ” Governor Kasich told reporters Friday at a breakfast hosted by The ███ .
Kasich – the final competitor against Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 – has not fully closed the door to running again in 2020 , one more reason that his views on policy command an audience . He is currently on tour to promote his new book , “ Two Paths : America Divided or United . ”
Amid an escalation of rhetoric vis-a-vis North Korea , Kasich suspects that his approach is under consideration by the Trump administration , though he acknowledges that he does not have access to the intelligence . To be successful , he said , the US would need “ very good intelligence ” and would have to move “ very , very quickly . ”
“ I bet they ’ re thinking about it , ” says Kasich , a former member of Congress who served 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee . “ If I were there , I ’ d be asking them about it . Are you staging raids ? Do you know how to land ? Do you know how to get there ? Are your helicopters going to work ? ”
The Trump administration has not publicly discussed such an approach . But speaking Friday at the United Nations Security Council , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that “ all options ” for dealing with North Korea must remain on the table if diplomacy fails . In an interview with NPR that aired Friday , Secretary Tillerson said the US is open to direct talks with the North Korean leadership .
On Wednesday , in an unusual move , the Trump administration summoned all 100 US senators to the White House complex for a briefing on North Korea , then provided the same briefing for House members on Capitol Hill .
But while Trump , Kasich , and others in Washington have been talking tough on North Korea , many observers have said that the likely outcome of current tensions is a gradual intensification , rather than imminent war .
Kasich on war : ' I do n't think that 's going to work '
Kasich ’ s suggestion raises legal questions , as well as the specter of history . The US has a long and storied past of assassination , and attempted assassination , of foreign leaders . In 1976 , President Gerald Ford signed Executive Order 11905 , which banned political assassination as part of a broader reform of the US intelligence community .
Kasich praised Mr. Trump ’ s military strike against the Assad regime in Syria earlier this month , calling it an important message to world leaders . But there comes a point when “ saber-rattling is not effective , ” Kasich said .
The Ohio governor also praised the US deployment of an anti-missile system in South Korea as leverage to spur the Chinese to rein in North Korea ’ s nuclear program . But he warned against a US military strike against North Korea .
“ Moving warships in and having a war , I don ’ t think that ’ s going to work , ” Kasich said . “ The problem of bombing is , you ’ re going to lose a million people . ”
The alternative “ has to do with taking out the North Korean leadership , ” he said .

“ You better believe I ’ m willing to obliterate North Korea ’ s missile program before I were to allow one to be built that could hit America , ” Graham said .","“The North Korean top leadership has to go.”

With that bold assertion, Gov. John Kasich (R) of Ohio raised a controversial argument for American action aimed at neutralizing the North Korean nuclear threat.

“An ability to remove a number of the top people, and have a more benign leadership there that understands what’s at risk, I think is perhaps doable,” Governor Kasich told reporters Friday at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.

Kasich – the final competitor against Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 – has not fully closed the door to running again in 2020, one more reason that his views on policy command an audience. He is currently on tour to promote his new book, “Two Paths: America Divided or United.”

Amid an escalation of rhetoric vis-a-vis North Korea, Kasich suspects that his approach is under consideration by the Trump administration, though he acknowledges that he does not have access to the intelligence. To be successful, he said, the US would need “very good intelligence” and would have to move “very, very quickly.”

“I bet they’re thinking about it,” says Kasich, a former member of Congress who served 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee. “If I were there, I’d be asking them about it. Are you staging raids? Do you know how to land? Do you know how to get there? Are your helicopters going to work?”

The Trump administration has not publicly discussed such an approach. But speaking Friday at the United Nations Security Council, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that “all options” for dealing with North Korea must remain on the table if diplomacy fails. In an interview with NPR that aired Friday, Secretary Tillerson said the US is open to direct talks with the North Korean leadership.

On Wednesday, in an unusual move, the Trump administration summoned all 100 US senators to the White House complex for a briefing on North Korea, then provided the same briefing for House members on Capitol Hill.

But while Trump, Kasich, and others in Washington have been talking tough on North Korea, many observers have said that the likely outcome of current tensions is a gradual intensification, rather than imminent war.

Kasich on war: 'I don't think that's going to work'

Kasich’s suggestion raises legal questions, as well as the specter of history. The US has a long and storied past of assassination, and attempted assassination, of foreign leaders. In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed Executive Order 11905, which banned political assassination as part of a broader reform of the US intelligence community.

Kasich praised Mr. Trump’s military strike against the Assad regime in Syria earlier this month, calling it an important message to world leaders. But there comes a point when “saber-rattling is not effective,” Kasich said.

The Ohio governor also praised the US deployment of an anti-missile system in South Korea as leverage to spur the Chinese to rein in North Korea’s nuclear program. But he warned against a US military strike against North Korea.

“Moving warships in and having a war, I don’t think that’s going to work,” Kasich said. “The problem of bombing is, you’re going to lose a million people.”

The alternative “has to do with taking out the North Korean leadership,” he said.

Senator: 'I'm willing to obliterate N. Korea's missile program'

Speaking to reporters Monday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina praised Trump’s foreign policy, and called North Korea a central question, but did not openly discuss “regime change” as an option.

“Are you going to allow North Korea to develop an ICBM that can reach the homeland with a nuclear weapon on top?” Senator Graham said. If the answer is “no,” he added, then the two basic options are diplomacy and military force.

Negotiations have been all but deadlocked since U.S. President Donald Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June.

Pompeo has pressed for tangible steps toward North Korea’s abandonment of its nuclear arsenal while Pyongyang is demanding that Washington first make concessions of its own.

North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said U.S. special units based in Japan were staging an air drill aimed at “the infiltration into Pyongyang”, citing a South Korean media outlet.

“Such acts prove that the U.S. is hatching a criminal plot to unleash a war against the DPRK and commit a crime which deserves merciless divine punishment in case the U.S. fails in the scenario of the DPRK’s unjust and brigandish denuclearisation first,” the paper said.

A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said he had no information on the drill alleged in the newspaper. The U.S. military spokesman in South Korea was not immediately available to comment.

The editorial, which did not mention the Pompeo visit, urged Washington to give up the “pointless military gamble” and implement the Singapore agreement, in which the leaders pledged to work towards a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Since the summit, the two sides have struggled to narrow differences over the North’s nuclear weapons program.

Pyongyang is calling for a declaration of peace as part of security guarantees designed to encourage it to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, while the Trump administration says a peace deal and other concessions will only come after more progress on denuclearization.

In part to reassure North Korea, Trump canceled or delayed joint military drills with South Korea, but smaller exercises continue.

Trump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing. China expressed “serious concern” about Trump’s comments, which it called “irresponsible”.",www.reuters.com,center,fQudBwSyH6Q3CnnY

We can not afford for North Korea to pretend to eliminate its nuclear program while we pretend to believe it .
The pageantry , platitudes , and optimistic assessments from the Moon government on full display at the just concluded North–South summit have raised the stakes for the highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un . That meeting , expected to take place by June , is eliciting a range of expectations , from cautious optimism to assured skepticism . For many observers , Kim ’ s reported willingness to consider “ denuclearization ” has generated hope that this time , after decades of failed diplomacy , the outcome will be different . The North ’ s announcement of a freeze on nuclear- and ballistic-missile tests only reinforced this expectation .
In contrast , skeptics point out that there is nothing new in Kim ’ s playbook . The North ’ s “ smile diplomacy ” is directed not at achieving a permanent peace on the Peninsula but at undermining international sanctions while driving a wedge between the United States and South Korea . After all , in exchange for concessions , Pyongyang has agreed on multiple occasions to denuclearization and freezes but has always cheated on those commitments .
The outcome of the Trump–Kim meeting , if it occurs , is unknowable at this time . It will depend on many factors . What , if anything , is Kim willing to give up ? Is the North ’ s acceptance of denuclearization still tied to unacceptable conditions , including the removal of all U.S. forces from South Korea and the U.S. withdrawal of its nuclear guarantees to Seoul and Tokyo ? Does the announced freeze reflect a willingness on the part of the North to forgo development and deployment of an ICBM-class threat against the U.S. homeland , or has it already achieved that long-held objective ? ( For months , the intelligence community has assessed that the North is only a few months away from having this capability . ) Is the North willing to abandon its nuclear program entirely , or will it insist on maintaining reprocessing and enrichment capabilities for “ peaceful ” purposes ?
Other key factors will be shaped by U.S. policy choices . For example , we know from past mistakes that , if Washington relieves pressure on the North prior to the meeting , failure is certain . The “ maximum pressure ” campaign , perhaps in combination with the president ’ s stated willingness to use force to prevent North Korea from acquiring the capability to hold American cities hostage to nuclear-armed missile attack , has seemingly worked to get the North to the table . In the lead-up to the meeting , more pressure , not less , is the best means for improving the prospects for a positive outcome .
Perhaps the most important policy choice before the administration is the negotiating approach it will take before and at the meeting . The advice from many veterans of past negotiations is both conventional and wrong . The assumption is that success in any negotiation is dependent on both sides benefiting equally . It means “ all sides must give as well as get. ” It means “ carrots as well as sticks. ” It means a “ step-by-step ” process that has always meant concessions before denuclearization . With North Korea , this is the approach we have followed for 25 years , always with the same outcome . If we don ’ t change our approach , there is little prospect for success .
Equating negotiations with compromise is , while a classic American arms control principle , also a formula for failure . This is the approach followed by previous administrations , with identical results . While we negotiated , most often granting serial concessions , Pyongyang built up its nuclear and missile forces . At times , the North would readily take the carrots in exchange for empty promises or temporary pauses but never veered from its quest . For North Korea , negotiations have never been about shared benefits or compromise . Rather , it sees negotiations as an opportunity to seek unilateral advantage and buy time to expand its illicit , often clandestine programs .
A different model is that pursued with Libya in 2003 . Those negotiations led to complete denuclearization in four months . All associated centrifuge and uranium-conversion equipment was removed to the United States , along with Libya ’ s longer-range missiles . North Korea is obviously not Libya of 15 years ago . The Libyan nuclear program , although much larger than assessed at the time , was far less advanced than Pyongyang ’ s . The Libyan missile program and conventional threat were nothing approaching that of North Korea . And the nature of the regime was different . The thugs who constituted the Qaddafi clique , while guilty of heinous crimes , were choir boys compared with those of the Kim regime . But we dealt with them , and we brought their nuclear program to Tennessee . This was a diplomatic , negotiated outcome based not on the search for compromise but on achieving U.S. interests and advancing international nonproliferation goals .
The question is not whether North Korea is different from Libya but what lessons learned from the Libyan experience can be applied to North Korea today . Four relevant lessons are :
• Insist on a strategic decision from Kim — not words but concrete actions — to abandon the nuclear program in months not years . With Libya , it became apparent that Qaddafi had made the decision to abandon his nuclear program when , on a secret in-country visit by technical experts , the Libyans provided access to previously unknown facilities and volunteered documents and drawings , including those of a nuclear warhead . With North Korea , a strategic decision to abandon its nuclear program may take a different form . But without a strategic decision , there will be little merit in the outcome , as it will only indicate a continuation of past behavior that has always ended in failure .
• Use all tools of statecraft in the context of a comprehensive strategy . In its North Korea policy , he Trump administration is doing a good job in employing a wide range of tools , including diplomacy ( especially with China and U.S. allies ) , economic sanctions , intelligence , and the threat of the use of force . It is essential to avoid the mistake of past administrations , shifting to a policy of diplomacy only and having “ talks ” with North Korea masquerade as a strategy .
• Insist on effective verification . North Korea has violated every agreement it has made regarding its nuclear program . None of those agreements contained effective verification . We know from experience that this must include anywhere , anytime inspections , as well as full and immediate access to people and documentation . If this condition is not met , any negotiated agreement will fail . With the North , it is a matter not of trust but of verify .
• Don ’ t bargain on denuclearization . Though it may be counterintuitive to many , bargaining — the process of trading X for Y — can actually undermine the chances for success . This does not mean that U.S. negotiators should impose or demand conditions beyond denuclearization that are unacceptable to the North Koreans . Rather , the U.S. side should state its principled position and not compromise on the complete , irreversible , and verifiable dismantlement of the nuclear program . Holding firm on the fundamentals of denuclearization does not rule out a win–win outcome , a result the U.S. should seek . Nor does it rule out an outcome that allows Kim to save face .
The above approach will surely be rejected by many professional diplomats and negotiators alike , who will criticize it for making a deal impossible . These same professionals , had the opportunity existed , would undoubtedly have made a similar case against the approach taken with Libya . But the Libya talks were conducted in secret without their input , and the successful removal of Libya ’ s program made their opinions moot .
What we seek is a successful negotiated outcome , not to score debating points .
The critics of adapting to North Korea the lessons learned from Libya will also likely argue that the model doesn ’ t apply because Qaddafi was overthrown after abandoning his nuclear program — a line also frequently used by Pyongyang . But this is about negotiating strategies , not about the fate of Qaddafi . Eight years after Tripoli gave up its nuclear aspirations , President Obama decided to intervene in Libya , apparently without regard to a day-after plan or without any consideration of the nonproliferation message that intervention would signal . But that decision should not preclude us from applying relevant lessons to meet the present challenges we face . What we seek is a successful negotiated outcome , not to score debating points .
President Trump , author of The Art of the Deal , prides himself on his negotiating skills .

Saying he will likely meet with the Russian leader on the sidelines of an economic conference in Vietnam later this week , Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One , `` We want Putin 's help on North Korea . ''
Trump , who travels to Asia amid investigations into Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election , said North Korea would be `` a big subject '' this week , calling it `` a big problem for our country and for the world , and we want to get it solved . ''
During a brief question-and-answer session aboard Air Force One , Trump also :
• Disputed suggestions that Chinese President Xi Jinping is coming into his meetings with Trump this week in an especially strong political position . `` Excuse me , so am I , '' he said , citing the `` highest stock market in history , lowest unemployment in 17 years , a military that ’ s rapidly rebuilding , ISIS is virtually defeated in the Middle East . ''
• Declined to combat criticism from Republican predecessors George H.W . Bush and George W. Bush . `` I ’ ll comment after we come back . I don ’ t need headlines . ''
• Echoed his goals for the weeklong trip that will take him to Japan , South Korea and China , as well as Asian economic conferences in Vietnam and the Philippines : `` Our big focus is going to be obviously on North Korea . But a very , very big focus is going to be on fair trade . And that ’ s very important to me . ''
After landing at Yokota Air Base , Trump spoke to military services members and thanked them for their work and sacrifice . Donning a bomber jacket , the president also spoke about his goals for the trip and made campaign-style remarks about the rise of the stock market and the fall in American unemployment rates .

USA TODAY

President Trump touched down in Japan on Sunday morning — Saturday night in the United States — to start a tour of Asia devoted to arguments about trade, worries about North Korea's nuclear weapons, and probably a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Saying he will likely meet with the Russian leader on the sidelines of an economic conference in Vietnam later this week, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, ""We want Putin's help on North Korea.""

Trump, who travels to Asia amid investigations into Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election, said North Korea would be ""a big subject"" this week, calling it ""a big problem for our country and for the world, and we want to get it solved.""

During a brief question-and-answer session aboard Air Force One, Trump also:

• Disputed suggestions that Chinese President Xi Jinping is coming into his meetings with Trump this week in an especially strong political position. ""Excuse me, so am I,"" he said, citing the ""highest stock market in history, lowest unemployment in 17 years, a military that’s rapidly rebuilding, ISIS is virtually defeated in the Middle East.""

• Declined to combat criticism from Republican predecessors George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. ""I’ll comment after we come back. I don’t need headlines.""

• Echoed his goals for the weeklong trip that will take him to Japan, South Korea and China, as well as Asian economic conferences in Vietnam and the Philippines: ""Our big focus is going to be obviously on North Korea. But a very, very big focus is going to be on fair trade. And that’s very important to me.""

After landing at Yokota Air Base, Trump spoke to military services members and thanked them for their work and sacrifice. Donning a bomber jacket, the president also spoke about his goals for the trip and made campaign-style remarks about the rise of the stock market and the fall in American unemployment rates.

""We always fight for what we believe in,"" Trump said.

Trump planned to devote a low-key opening day to lunch with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and a round of golf with Abe and Japanese links star Hideki Matsuyama. The president and first lady Melania Trump will cap their first day in Asia at a dinner with the prime minister and spouse Akie Abe.

Air Force One landed at Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo, where a group of U.S. service members awaited the arrival of the commander in chief. Shortly before landing, Trump tweeted, ""Can’t wait to be with our GREAT MILITARY. See you soon!""

As often happens on presidential foreign trips, domestic politics intruded on Trump's trip to the East — in this case, the Russia investigation as well as another spat with his Republican predecessors, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.

The elder Bush called Trump a ""blowhard,"" while George W. Bush said ""this guy doesn't know what it means to be president,"" the author of a new book told CNN.

The White House struck back with a harsh statement issued while Trump winged his way to Japan.

""If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won.”

In addition, a pre-trip interview of Trump included questions about the Russia investigation being conduced by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Before leaving Hawaii, Trump stopped for a visit to one of his hotels. ""It has been a tremendously successful project,"" Sanders said, ""and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work.”

Trump arrived in Tokyo on Sunday morning, local time.

Prime Minister Abe planed to welcome the president with pomp and ceremony, as well as the round of golf.

Behind the scenes, however, Japanese leaders still wonder about Trump's harsh criticism of U.S. trade deals with other countries, and worry about getting caught in the middle if tensions with North Korea lead to military conflict, maybe even one with nuclear weapons.

CIA director Mike Pompeo forged a ""good relationship"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when they met last week, US President Donald Trump has tweeted.

Confirming media reports of the secret meeting in Pyongyang, Mr Trump said it had gone ""very smoothly"".

The surprise visit marks the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since 2000.

Mr Trump is expected to hold a summit with Mr Kim by June. Details are being worked out, the US president said.

South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the longstanding conflict on the peninsula. President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week.

The US president earlier gave his ""blessing"" for the talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War.

What do we know about the secret meeting?

Mr Pompeo's trip took place after he was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.

Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit.

Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in the coming weeks, although Democratic opposition to the conservative's candidacy is strong.

The hawkish CIA chief is known for his opposition to same-sex marriage and has made controversial remarks about Islam.

How do the US and North Korea communicate otherwise?

The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and so-called ""back channels"" are used to communicate with Pyongyang.

The last senior US official to meet a North Korean leader was Madeleine Albright, who was secretary of state when she travelled to Pyongyang for talks with Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader.

In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens.

Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader.

When and where might a summit take place?

Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader.

He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration.

Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea, another Asian country, or a neutral European country.

North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its human rights abuses and pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions.

It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US.

But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US.

What does the timing of this news tell us?

News of Mr Pompeo's visit is likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea.

South Korea has a $10.7 billion trade deficit in services with the United States, but a $27.7 billion trade surplus in goods.",www.nytimes.com,left,VZB7FIaNHCD7B77Y

They're all bad.,2017-07-06,"Alex Ward, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer","North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that can hit most of the US mainland on July 28 . It detonated its largest nuclear bomb yet on September 3 . And it also twice launched missiles over Japan this year , most recently on September 15 local time .
North Korea continues to expressly defy the wishes of the United States and the international community by carrying out provocative actions . Now it is up to Trump to decide how to respond — and he is left with very bad options to do so .
On August 8 , Trump said the US would unleash “ fire and fury ” on North Korea if it continued to threaten America . But the administration prefers to pursue its strategy of diplomacy and economic pressure — for now .
Still , Trump is the next US leader to struggle with how to handle North Korea after its most recent provocation . Presidents from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama tried different approaches to deal with the Hermit Kingdom , such as diplomatic engagement , labeling it a state sponsor of terror , or simply ignoring it in hopes that the regime would collapse on its own .
None of those approaches worked as the regimes of Kim and his father — and North Korea ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programs more generally — outlasted them all .
“ US policy toward North Korea has been unsuccessful for a couple of decades , ” Sheena Greitens , a North Korea expert at the University of Missouri , said in an interview . “ We ’ re seeing the consequences of that now . ”
With Pyongyang successfully testing a missile capable of hitting the mainland , Trump is tasked with trying to find some way to keep the danger from getting even worse . However , the options he has available to him are broadly the same as the ones his predecessors had : military strikes , diplomacy , or economic sanctions .
The military option would entail a “ surgical strike ” on North Korea ’ s nuclear sites to take out the country ’ s missiles as well as the country ’ s political leadership , including Kim Jong Un . The problem is that North Korea would be certain to hit back hard , using its own large artillery arsenal to strike at America ’ s allies , South Korea , and Japan . That would likely kill tens or even hundreds of thousands of people — including US troops stationed in both countries — even before nuclear weapons were dropped .
The diplomatic option would see the US try to come to some sort of agreement with North Korea to either give up its programs or , at a minimum , freeze their development . Over the past few decades , though , North Korea has shown no desire to follow any agreements , consistently breaking accords with the US and its partners and covertly advancing its nuclear weapons and missile efforts .
And the sanctions would be meant to impose so much economic pain on Pyongyang that it would conclude that the costs of continuing the programs are too high . But many items the country wants and needs , like weapons and fuel , are already highly sanctioned by the US . North Korea hasn ’ t changed its course .
So , the options for Trump are poor and fraught with risk . “ There are no silver bullet solutions , ” James Miller , the top Pentagon policy official from 2012 to 2014 , told me .
In some ways , that means the bigger and more immediate question is whether Trump can avoid taking steps that make the problem worse .
The options for dealing with North Korea all have huge downsides
As Greitens told me , there are basically three broad options Trump can choose from : 1 ) military strikes ; 2 ) diplomacy ; or 3 ) economic sanctions . But here ’ s the rub : option one is incredibly dangerous , and options two and three have a mixed track record at best .
First , the military option . The last thing Defense Secretary James Mattis wants is a war with North Korea . `` A conflict in North Korea , ” he told CBS ’ s John Dickerson on May 28 , “ would be probably the worst kind of fighting in most people 's lifetimes . ''
Gen. Vincent Brooks , who commands US troops in South Korea , thinks that tensions are high between the North and South , as the only thing keeping both sides from fighting is “ self-restraint. ” In other words , there ’ s nothing really keeping the two countries from warring except a massive provocation or miscalculation .
That ’ s not only a problem for the Koreas , but also for America . Around 23,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea . Many of them are within reach of North Korea ’ s artillery . And , should a war break out , many would be killed as they would be considered top targets by the North .
If the US is worried North Korea might make the first move , though , it could launch a preemptive surgical strike on North Korea . It would certainly do damage to the country ’ s missile and nuclear programs . But North Korea would retaliate , imperiling the safety of US allies South Korea and Japan .
Pyongyang has the world ’ s largest artillery arsenal at its disposal , with around 8,000 rocket launchers and artillery cannons on its side of the demilitarized zone between the North and South , and it could use that arsenal to strike the major capital of Seoul . It could also use its short-range missiles to strike Tokyo and other large Japanese urban areas , some of them with only about a 10-minute warning .
But a fight between the North and South would be bad enough . Simulations of a large-scale artillery fight produce pretty bleak results . One war game convened by the Atlantic back in 2005 predicted that a North Korean attack would kill 100,000 people in Seoul in the first few days alone . Others put the estimate even higher . A war game mentioned by the National Interest predicted Seoul could “ be hit by over half-a-million shells in under an hour. ” Those results don ’ t bode well for one of Washington ’ s closest allies , or for the 25.6 million people living in Seoul .
None of this even factors in the large-scale refugee crisis that a war would create , where millions would flock north to China as their homes and livelihoods are ravaged by war . That ’ s something China expressly does not want . Beijing prioritizes stability on the peninsula , and it helps explain why it has been so unwilling to alter the status quo in North Korea . Any change , China fears , may lead to problems for the Chinese government down the road .
Here ’ s the end result , according to my colleague Zack Beauchamp : “ Given North Korea ’ s massive conventional military and unknown number of nuclear weapons , conflict on the Korean Peninsula would cost hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of lives . ”
So a surgical strike may have risks because of what North Korea might do . It ’ s also a risk because the strike itself may not work as planned .
The reason for that is many of North Korea ’ s nuclear sites are underground or in caves . Plus , the US and its partners are unsure where many of the dozens of missiles that would carry a nuclear weapon are . Some are hidden away and others are on mobile launchers that could be moved if North Korea sensed an attack was coming . Either way , special operations forces would likely be on the ground in North Korea , conducting risky military maneuvers — putting themselves in harm ’ s way .
But so far , the Trump administration has avoided military options . It would prefer to solve the crisis diplomatically , according to an August 13 op-ed piece by Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson .
“ While diplomacy is our preferred means of changing North Korea ’ s course of action , it is backed by military options , ” they wrote . “ The US is willing to negotiate with Pyongyang . But given the long record of North Korea ’ s dishonesty in negotiations and repeated violations of international agreements , it is incumbent upon the regime to signal its desire to negotiate in good faith . ”
Clearly , that approach has yet to work . But to be fair , its hasn ’ t worked for past administrations , either .
America and others have tried to come to some sort of diplomatic , negotiated agreement with North Korea over its programs since 1985 , according to the Arms Control Association . They got really close twice . In 1994 , the US and North Korea signed the Agreed Framework , in which the North agreed to freeze its plutonium weapons program in exchange for two proliferation-resistant nuclear power reactors and fuel oil from the United States .
However , the agreement collapsed in 2002 , and by January 2003 the North had resumed its nuclear program .
Then in August 2003 , the international community launched the so-called “ Six Party Talks , ” which were designed to get North Korea to halt its nuclear program through negotiations with five other countries : China , the United States , South Korea , Japan , and Russia .
In September 2005 , it looked like the talks might work — North Korea formally agreed to abandon “ all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs ” in exchange for energy assistance from the other countries .
But in 2009 , amid disagreements over technical details related to verification , North Korea walked out on the talks . It says it will never return to the negotiations and maintains that it is no longer bound by their agreements . And it has been ramping up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs ever since .
Kelsey Davenport , a North Korea expert at the Arms Control Association , thinks diplomacy has the best chance of success , but notes that the cost for the US would be high . “ That will require the United States to put something on the table that North Korea wants , perhaps a reduction in US-South Korean military exercises , ” she said .
South Korea , which relies on US security backing to protect it from China and North Korea , would worry about America ’ s commitment to it if that trade were made . South Korea ’ s president , Moon Jae In , has sought a less hawkish approach to North Korea , preferring tougher sanctions instead of military maneuvers .
Trump is stuck with the same weak hand to respond to North Korea — but North Korea ’ s hand got stronger after the ICBM test
Sanctions tend to work much better before a country obtains what it wants , Greitens noted . In this case , North Korea achieved a big step toward its goal of having a missile that can carry a nuclear weapon to America ’ s largest cities . It ’ s going to be hard at this point to use sanctions to change North Korea ’ s behavior when Pyongyang feels like it is so close to the finish line .
And it ’ s not like North Korea sanctions are a new idea . In fact , sanctions have already been placed on key items being imported or exported by North Korea : weaponry big and small ; coal , minerals , and fuel ; luxury goods like yachts ; funding for its missile and nuclear programs ; and even a ban on travel into UN member states for those who work on the country ’ s nuclear program . On September 11 , the United Nations passed its harshest sanctions package it ’ s ever adopted against North Korea , which includes banning textiles exports and capping shipments of crude oil into the country . But even then North Korea continues to defy international pressure by improving its program .
There are also some other maneuvers Trump could take . He could try to increase the cyber program meant to sabotage North Korea ’ s missile launches within their first few seconds , which the Obama administration pioneered . Trump could also continue to send more aircraft carriers off the coast of the peninsula as a show of force , hoping to intimidate North Korea into stopping their tests .
Or , he could decide to just accept that North Korea is a nuclear power with the ability to strike America . After doing so , the US and its partners would seek to contain North Korea ’ s nuclear ambitions and deter an attack launched from Pyongyang . But accepting North Korea ’ s programs as they are is likely the least palatable for the tough-talking Trump .
So , the president is stuck with the same weak hand to respond to North Korea — but North Korea ’ s hand got stronger after the ICBM and nuclear weapon tests . It ’ s no wonder , then , that Trump tried something different by relying on China to solve the problem — even if it didn ’ t work .
Trump ’ s reliance on China to handle North Korea was unlikely to work
Trump ’ s plan was to get China to make North Korea halt its missile and nuclear programs . But Kelly Magsamen , a top Asia Pentagon official in the Obama administration , never thought that was a good idea .
“ President Trump was foolish to outsource his North Korea strategy to China , ” she said in an interview . “ China can certainly play a major role , but they don ’ t share our interests . It takes more than one summit and a few tweets to address the North Korea challenge . ”
China ’ s failure to deliver was evident back in April when new data showed its trade with North Korea had increased by 37.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017 . North Korea ’ s economy is almost entirely dependent on China , with Beijing providing Pyongyang with food , fuel , and machinery . Had China cut that off , North Korea would ’ ve been in trouble . But , clearly , the opposite happened .
Trump himself seems to realize now that China is unwilling to do America ’ s bidding on North Korea , per his tweet on July 5 .
Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 % in the first quarter . So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 5 , 2017
That was a surprising turnaround for Trump , especially after he felt he and Xi came to an understanding on North Korea during their Mar-a-Lago summit back in April . Then again , Trump promised to be much tougher on China during the campaign , claiming he would deem it a currency manipulator on his first day in office . He later changed his mind on that . So , Trump decided to scrap the China plan , and now he has to decide what the new course of action will be .

north_korea,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/30/north-korea-white-houseenvoy-pompeo-687898,‘Nobody in the bullpen’: White House approaches North Korea talks without envoy,2018-06-30,"Nahal Toosi, Michael Crowley, Louis Nelson, Annie Karni, Eliana Johnson","The Trump administration is barreling ahead in its high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with North Korea even though it lacks a full-time envoy to oversee the negotiations .
Currently , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is serving as the point man on the administration ’ s effort to convince North Korea to give up its atomic arsenal . But some lawmakers and former officials are urging President Donald Trump to put a special representative in charge , arguing that Pompeo can ’ t give the topic the explicit , sustained attention it requires .
The calls for an envoy come as Trump aides remain coy about details of their strategy to deal with the isolated Asian country . There have been no formal talks announced since Trump held a much-ballyhooed June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , although there are reports that Pompeo will go next week to Pyongyang .
Kim ’ s regime , meanwhile , is reported to have upgraded a nuclear facility and stepped up its production of fuel for nuclear weapons , raising questions about its true intentions .
“ This is like going to the World Series with nobody in the bullpen , ” said New York Rep. Eliot Engel , the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee . “ To address a challenge the magnitude of North Korea , the United States needs an empowered secretary of state and a competent and resourced diplomatic staff to back him up — especially a top official dealing exclusively with North Korea . ”
Until recently , the U.S. had a special representative for North Korea policy : Joseph Yun , a respected career Foreign Service officer . Yun announced his retirement in late February , just weeks before Trump upended diplomatic convention and agreed to meet with Kim , a brutal dictator who has expanded North Korea ’ s nuclear arsenal .

You can unsubscribe at any time . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply .
Yun ’ s departure exacerbated existing staffing shortages at the State Department , to the point where his predecessor in the role , U.S . Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim , was tasked with helping plan the summit . Ultimately , State , with Pompeo at the helm , coordinated with the National Security Council , the CIA and other agencies to pull off the June 12 Trump-Kim meeting , held in Singapore .
The meeting resulted in a vague U.S.-North Korea statement committing to denuclearization , but few specifics . The hard work lies ahead , analysts say , as the two sides hammer out what they mean by denuclearization , the timeframes involved , what the U.S. will give Pyongyang and more . It could be many months before a comprehensive nuclear deal is reached .
Pompeo , who took over as secretary of state in late April , assured lawmakers this week that people across the government are working on the steps ahead . He said he is charge of the inter-agency effort , but he declined to detail the U.S. strategy for the talks , saying that could be “ counterproductive . ”
“ They ’ re watching this hearing , ” he said of the North Koreans .
There ’ s no doubt U.S. officials have kept busy on the North Korea front . Pompeo this week spoke with his counterpart in South Korea , while Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has raised the issue on a swing through Asia , with stops in Beijing , Seoul and Tokyo . The Senate on Thursday also finally confirmed a U.S. ambassador to South Korea , filling what many analysts said was a glaring hole in the Trump administration ’ s approach to the nuclear issue .
But while Pompeo is considered a smart , versatile player — with special insight into North Korea from his time as CIA chief — he is still new to diplomacy and has limited knowledge of nuclear technicalities . Kim , on the other hand , is likely to dispatch highly experienced negotiators for future discussions — delegates who will wrestle with every word of any deal .
As the chief U.S. diplomat , Pompeo also has plenty of other crises to tackle , including escalating U.S. tensions with Iran , fraying U.S.-European ties , and general global discontent with Trump ’ s trade and environmental policies .
“ At the stage of the game , the appointment of a senior U.S. envoy dedicated to [ the North Korea ] process would make a great deal of sense , ” said Suzanne DiMaggio of the New America think tank . “ The next weeks and months will be critical , and it ’ s difficult to see how Pompeo can devote the day-to-day attention needed to keep things moving forward . ”
Asked if the administration plans to fill the special envoy ’ s position , the State Department said it had “ no personnel announcements at this time. ” Yun , who is now with the U.S. Institute of Peace , did not respond to requests for comment .
Sung Kim , who previously held the North Korea role , would be an obvious choice , but his current job as the U.S. ambassador in Manila is also important , especially given the authoritarian antics of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte . He did not respond to a request for comment .
Evans Revere , a retired Foreign Service officer with extensive North Korea knowledge , said that if Trump wishes to name an envoy , “ it will have to be a person of considerable gravitas , very high rank and be someone who can speak authoritatively on behalf of the president . ”
“ If we have learned nothing else after over a quarter of a century of dealing with the North Koreans on the nuclear issue , if you are not directly engaged with [ North Korea ’ s ] leader and his inner circle , you are almost certainly wasting your time , ” Revere said .
Earlier this week , researchers with the group 38 North released satellite images that they said indicated North Korea was improving the infrastructure at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center “ at a rapid pace. ” The upgrades included modifying a cooling system and construction on support facilities .
On Friday evening , NBC News , citing U.S. officials familiar with intelligence assessments , reported that even as Washington and Pyongyang were engaged in diplomacy , North Korea was increasing its production of enriched uranium , a key fuel for nuclear weapons .
The news was unsettling given North Korea ’ s past failure to meet nuclear commitments , adding to concerns that Kim has no genuine interest in relinquishing his program now that he ’ s raised his global profile by meeting with Trump . It also ran counter to Trump ’ s claim , in a tweet shortly after he met Kim , that “ there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea . ”
Trump ’ s decision to meet Kim at the start of the process was highly unusual . Although there ’ s no universal model for international nuclear negotiations , such diplomatic processes tend to start with lower-level aides working out specifics — such as the number of centrifuges a country can have — before higher-level officials come in to seal the deal .
One key task for U.S. officials now is figuring out what model of negotiations the two sides can live with , and whether the North Koreans are serious about giving up their nuclear program , former officials and analysts said . Given those unknowns , delaying the appointment of a special envoy may not be a bad thing , said Christopher Hill , who led the U.S. delegation during a previous round of nuclear talks with North Korea under President George W. Bush .
“ For now , before they have any really sense of what they have from the North Koreans , it is probably best that Pompeo is his own envoy , albeit with a team , ” Hill said . “ He has the senior relationships , including with the president . If they get real traction , that is when they should name someone . ”
Lawmakers are also trying to shape the process . This week , Sens .

Currently, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is serving as the point man on the administration’s effort to convince North Korea to give up its atomic arsenal. But some lawmakers and former officials are urging President Donald Trump to put a special representative in charge, arguing that Pompeo can’t give the topic the explicit, sustained attention it requires.

Story Continued Below

The calls for an envoy come as Trump aides remain coy about details of their strategy to deal with the isolated Asian country. There have been no formal talks announced since Trump held a much-ballyhooed June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, although there are reports that Pompeo will go next week to Pyongyang.

Kim’s regime, meanwhile, is reported to have upgraded a nuclear facility and stepped up its production of fuel for nuclear weapons, raising questions about its true intentions.

“This is like going to the World Series with nobody in the bullpen,” said New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “To address a challenge the magnitude of North Korea, the United States needs an empowered secretary of state and a competent and resourced diplomatic staff to back him up — especially a top official dealing exclusively with North Korea.”

Until recently, the U.S. had a special representative for North Korea policy: Joseph Yun, a respected career Foreign Service officer. Yun announced his retirement in late February, just weeks before Trump upended diplomatic convention and agreed to meet with Kim, a brutal dictator who has expanded North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.

Yun’s departure exacerbated existing staffing shortages at the State Department, to the point where his predecessor in the role, U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim, was tasked with helping plan the summit. Ultimately, State, with Pompeo at the helm, coordinated with the National Security Council, the CIA and other agencies to pull off the June 12 Trump-Kim meeting, held in Singapore.

The meeting resulted in a vague U.S.-North Korea statement committing to denuclearization, but few specifics. The hard work lies ahead, analysts say, as the two sides hammer out what they mean by denuclearization, the timeframes involved, what the U.S. will give Pyongyang and more. It could be many months before a comprehensive nuclear deal is reached.

Pompeo, who took over as secretary of state in late April, assured lawmakers this week that people across the government are working on the steps ahead. He said he is charge of the inter-agency effort, but he declined to detail the U.S. strategy for the talks, saying that could be “counterproductive.”

“They’re watching this hearing,” he said of the North Koreans.

There’s no doubt U.S. officials have kept busy on the North Korea front. Pompeo this week spoke with his counterpart in South Korea, while Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has raised the issue on a swing through Asia, with stops in Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo. The Senate on Thursday also finally confirmed a U.S. ambassador to South Korea, filling what many analysts said was a glaring hole in the Trump administration’s approach to the nuclear issue.

But while Pompeo is considered a smart, versatile player — with special insight into North Korea from his time as CIA chief — he is still new to diplomacy and has limited knowledge of nuclear technicalities. Kim, on the other hand, is likely to dispatch highly experienced negotiators for future discussions — delegates who will wrestle with every word of any deal.

As the chief U.S. diplomat, Pompeo also has plenty of other crises to tackle, including escalating U.S. tensions with Iran, fraying U.S.-European ties, and general global discontent with Trump’s trade and environmental policies.

“At the stage of the game, the appointment of a senior U.S. envoy dedicated to [the North Korea] process would make a great deal of sense,” said Suzanne DiMaggio of the New America think tank. “The next weeks and months will be critical, and it’s difficult to see how Pompeo can devote the day-to-day attention needed to keep things moving forward.”

Asked if the administration plans to fill the special envoy’s position, the State Department said it had “no personnel announcements at this time.” Yun, who is now with the U.S. Institute of Peace, did not respond to requests for comment.

Sung Kim, who previously held the North Korea role, would be an obvious choice, but his current job as the U.S. ambassador in Manila is also important, especially given the authoritarian antics of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. He did not respond to a request for comment.

Evans Revere, a retired Foreign Service officer with extensive North Korea knowledge, said that if Trump wishes to name an envoy, “it will have to be a person of considerable gravitas, very high rank and be someone who can speak authoritatively on behalf of the president.”

“If we have learned nothing else after over a quarter of a century of dealing with the North Koreans on the nuclear issue, if you are not directly engaged with [North Korea’s] leader and his inner circle, you are almost certainly wasting your time,” Revere said.

Earlier this week, researchers with the group 38 North released satellite images that they said indicated North Korea was improving the infrastructure at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center “at a rapid pace.” The upgrades included modifying a cooling system and construction on support facilities.

On Friday evening, NBC News, citing U.S. officials familiar with intelligence assessments, reported that even as Washington and Pyongyang were engaged in diplomacy, North Korea was increasing its production of enriched uranium, a key fuel for nuclear weapons.

The news was unsettling given North Korea’s past failure to meet nuclear commitments, adding to concerns that Kim has no genuine interest in relinquishing his program now that he’s raised his global profile by meeting with Trump. It also ran counter to Trump’s claim, in a tweet shortly after he met Kim, that “there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.”

Trump’s decision to meet Kim at the start of the process was highly unusual. Although there’s no universal model for international nuclear negotiations, such diplomatic processes tend to start with lower-level aides working out specifics — such as the number of centrifuges a country can have — before higher-level officials come in to seal the deal.

One key task for U.S. officials now is figuring out what model of negotiations the two sides can live with, and whether the North Koreans are serious about giving up their nuclear program, former officials and analysts said. Given those unknowns, delaying the appointment of a special envoy may not be a bad thing, said Christopher Hill, who led the U.S. delegation during a previous round of nuclear talks with North Korea under President George W. Bush.

“For now, before they have any really sense of what they have from the North Koreans, it is probably best that Pompeo is his own envoy, albeit with a team,” Hill said. “He has the senior relationships, including with the president. If they get real traction, that is when they should name someone.”

Lawmakers are also trying to shape the process. This week, Sens. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado, introduced a bill laying out broad desires for what a deal with Pyongyang will look like, while requiring the president to submit to Congress reports on the negotiation strategy and outcomes. The legislation challenges Trump’s stated confidence about the talks so far.

“This is not reality TV,” a senior Democratic Senate aide said. “And thus far the president hasn’t demonstrated that he is serious or capable of doing this right, or even that he understands the basics of how to keep our allies at the center of our policy or how to effectively exercise leverage.”

One of Pompeo’s ongoing challenges is dealing with the concerns of U.S. allies, in particular Japan and South Korea, who also are deeply invested in denuclearization of North Korea.

Pompeo spoke to South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha on Thursday, and the two “agreed that pressure must continue until [North Korea] denuclearizes,” according to a State Department readout of the call. The conversation came the same day the Senate confirmed retired Navy Adm. Harry Harris as the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, filling a position that’s been vacant since Trump took office. Pompeo also spoke Thursday to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, urging Beijing to continue enforcing sanctions on North Korea.

Mattis offered his own assurances on a trip to the region this week, meeting with top Chinese, South Korean and Japanese officials. Japan and South Korea have been especially concerned because the Pentagon, at Trump’s order following his talks with Kim, has suspended some joint military exercises with South Korea.

The Trump-Kim statement issued June 12 committed both countries to “hold follow-on negotiations, led by the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high-level [North Korean] official, at the earliest possible date.”

But, nearly three weeks since Trump and Kim met, the State Department has not officially announced any North Korea-related travel plans for Pompeo. Officials at the department would not confirm reports Pompeo will be in Pyongyang next week.

If Pompeo goes to North Korea again soon, “that’s a good sign,” said Joel Wit, a former State Department official who has negotiated with the Pyongyang regime. “If you don’t see him going in the next two weeks, you’ve got to start scratching your head.”

DORASAN STATION, South Korea (AP) — International women activists including Gloria Steinem and two Nobel Peace laureates on Sunday were denied an attempt to walk across the Demilitarized Zone dividing North and South Korea, but were allowed to cross by bus and complete what one of them called a landmark peace event.

The group of 30 women from 15 countries made a final appeal to authorities on both sides to allow them to walk across the demarcation line, but were turned down. The North allowed a South Korean bus to cross the demarcation line to pick them up on the North side of the DMZ and transport them over the border to South Korea.

United Nations Command officials met the group inside the DMZ after they crossed the demarcation line, and allowed them to march again after the final checkpoint on the southern side.

""We were able to be citizen diplomats,"" said Steinem, the 81-year-old feminism pioneer and author. ""We are feeling very, very positive. We have received an enormous amount of support,"" she said after passing through South Korean immigration.

The group includes two Nobel Peace Prize laureates — Mairead Maguire, from Northern Ireland, and Leymah Gbowee, from Liberia.

The women walked, carried banners and sang on the North Korean side of the first checkpoint leading into the DMZ. They were then met by a large contingent of media on the South side.

The Koreas have remained divided since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The DMZ that divides them is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world. Authorities on both sides said they could not guarantee the safety of the women had they walked across.

Organizer Christine Ahn, a Korean-American peace activist, said the group had initially wanted to walk through the symbolic truce village of Panmunjom, where the armistice was signed.

Still, she said the crossing itself was a success and a ""historic event"" despite ""governments setting boundaries.""

Some members of the group expressed disappointment that the walk inside the DMZ was denied. But Ahn said she was satisfied that they were able to meet with North Korean women during their several-say stay in Pyongyang and to cross through the DMZ, which is rarely allowed in any form to civilians.

The women will also meet with South Korean counterparts.

north_korea,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/16/kim-says-north-korea-is-nearing-goal-military-equilibrium-with-us.html,Kim says North Korea is nearing goal of military 'equilibrium' with US,2017-09-16,,"North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un said his country is close to achieving military `` equilibrium '' with the United States as a way to make American leaders `` dare not talk '' about military options for dealing with Pyongyang .
Kim ’ s comments Saturday came a day after the rogue country fired its latest missile over Japan , a test the United Nations Security Council strongly condemned as “ highly provocative. ” The U.N. slapped North Korea with new sanctions just days ago in response to a powerful Sept. 3 nuclear test .
The dictator said the country ’ s final goal `` is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military option for the DPRK , '' referring to North Korea 's official name , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency .
Kim indicated that more missile tests would be forthcoming , saying that all future drills should be `` meaningful and practical ones for increasing the combat power of the nuclear force '' to establish an order in the deployment of nuclear warheads for `` actual war . ''

Kim’s comments Saturday came a day after the rogue country fired its latest missile over Japan, a test the United Nations Security Council strongly condemned as “highly provocative.” The U.N. slapped North Korea with new sanctions just days ago in response to a powerful Sept. 3 nuclear test.

The dictator said the country’s final goal ""is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military option for the DPRK,"" referring to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.

Kim indicated that more missile tests would be forthcoming, saying that all future drills should be ""meaningful and practical ones for increasing the combat power of the nuclear force"" to establish an order in the deployment of nuclear warheads for ""actual war.""

The BBC quoted Kim as scoffing at the new U.N. sanctions.

""We should clearly show the big power chauvinists how our state attain the goal of completing its nuclear force despite their limitless sanctions and blockade,"" the BBC quoted Kim as saying to the KCNA.

Kim supervised Friday’s launch of a Hwasong-12 ballistic missile.

It traveled 2,300 miles as it passed over the Japanese island of Hokkaido before landing in the northern Pacific Ocean. It was the country's longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile.

Under Kim Jong Un's watch, North Korea has maintained a torrid pace in weapons tests, including its most powerful nuclear test to date on Sept. 3 and two July flight tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that could strike deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected.

north_korea,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/08/politics/north-korea-trump-administration-nuclear-talks/index.html,Diplomatic disconnect with North Korea spells trouble for Trump,2018-07-08,"Analysis Clare Foran, Elise Labott","Washington ( CNN ) Less than a month after President Donald Trump talked about opening `` a new chapter '' between the US and North Korea , the relationship between the two nations has taken a tense and hostile , but predictable turn .
In a fiery escalation , North Korea on Saturday accused the US of a `` gangster-like mindset '' in high-level negotiations over denuclearization , a glaring contradiction of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 's description of the talks as `` productive . ''
The diplomatic disconnect makes it clear that the nations are not on the same page . It calls into question the US effort to extract concessions from Pyongyang and underscores a vast difference in the way the two sides view the agreement between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last month .
`` I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding , '' said CNN global affairs analyst Joseph Yun , a former top US diplomat on North Korea policy . `` The US still believes North Korea will denuclearize substantially before we give them any major rewards , while North Korea believes that the two need to move together jointly , and both make concessions . ''
The rebuke from North Korea -- and the fact that Pompeo left the talks with little to show for his effort -- suggests that Pyongyang , and not the US , is setting the terms of negotiation . Rather than announcing any concrete achievements , the most Pompeo seemed able to deliver on Saturday was the promise of more talks .
Two US officials and other sources familiar with preparations for Pompeo 's trip had said the top US diplomat was expected to get some clarity on some issues not directly related to denuclearization , including the return of US service members ' remains from the Korean War and a timeline for the destruction of a missile engine test site .
But Pompeo , who has staked his political future on efforts to dismantle the isolated country 's nuclear program , had little to say about remains or the missile site in his Saturday remarks to reporters . He did say that a meeting has been set up for July 12 that will involve `` discussions between the folks responsible for the repatriation of remains , '' and that `` some progress '' had been made in discussing `` what the modalities would look like for destruction '' of the missile facility , but overall he offered few specifics .
Kim did not meet with Pompeo , a move that could be interpreted as a snub , though his spokesman said that was never an expectation . Instead , the top US diplomat met on Friday and again on Saturday with Kim Yong Chol , the vice chairman of the country 's Party Central Committee .
On Saturday , Pompeo insisted to reporters that `` the complete denuclearization of North Korea '' remains the objective , and `` no one walked away from that , '' adding , `` Chairman Kim is still committed . '' But in response to a reporter 's question over whether the US is moving closer to firming up a timeline for denuclearization , he said , `` I 'm not going to get into the details of our conversations . ''
Despite the contradictory take on the discussions , a spokesman for North Korea 's foreign ministry said toward the end of a lengthy statement Saturday , `` We still cherish our good faith in President Trump . ''
Yun said Pyongyang seemed to have the advantage in the talks at the moment .
`` So far , it appears that North Korea has gained more than the US , '' he said , adding , `` it looks like North Korea is dictating the pace and the direction of the talks . ''
The outcome of the most recent talks underscores the challenging situation Pompeo is in as he attempts to turn Trump 's vague rhetoric into reality with one of the toughest and most recalcitrant negotiating partners on the global stage . North Korea has stymied other administrations with a combination of contradiction , subterfuge and mixed messaging -- and is playing true true to form .
has repeatedly insisted must take place . The US may have backed itself into a corner early on as a result of Trump 's agreement to meet with the North Korean leader for a historic summit last month without first extracting a formal pledge of `` complete , '' `` verifiable '' and `` irreversible '' denuclearization , which the administration
Instead , the US received only a vague assurance from North Korea last month that it would `` work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . ''
In the meantime , satellite images indicate that North Korea has made upgrades to a nuclear facility and researchers in the US have said that it also appears to be finalizing the expansion of a ballistic missile manufacturing site .
Defense and administration officials working on the North Korea portfolio say it 's still not clear whether the US and North Korea will even be able to agree on the definition and extent of what `` denuclearization '' means . Leaked information has revealed that the Defense Intelligence Agency does n't think Kim has any intention of giving up his nuclear weapons anytime soon .
Current officials , diplomatic sources and others familiar with internal policy discussions say the administration has been having trouble pulling together a coherent approach for dealing with North Korea , and that there is a growing sense of concern .
These sources say the Trump administration has yet to agree with the North Koreans on a common goal or timeline , or on who will run point on detailed negotiations with Pyongyang alongside Pompeo .
Administration officials familiar with the work on North Korea had told CNN they saw cause for worry if Pompeo returned from this trip -- his third to North Korea in as many months -- without a definite plan in hand for moving forward .
They say there 's a sense within the White House and at the State Department that they need a solid timeline or some specifics on North Korea 's denuclearization by the end of August at the latest .

There is also speculation that Trump and Kim may meet again at the United Nations General Assembly , which takes place every September .
Such a meeting , or even a return trip by Pompeo to Pyongyang , would be hard for the administration to agree to without some tangible progress .","Washington (CNN) Less than a month after President Donald Trump talked about opening ""a new chapter"" between the US and North Korea, the relationship between the two nations has taken a tense and hostile, but predictable turn.

In a fiery escalation, North Korea on Saturday accused the US of a ""gangster-like mindset"" in high-level negotiations over denuclearization, a glaring contradiction of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's description of the talks as ""productive.""

The diplomatic disconnect makes it clear that the nations are not on the same page. It calls into question the US effort to extract concessions from Pyongyang and underscores a vast difference in the way the two sides view the agreement between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last month.

""I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding,"" said CNN global affairs analyst Joseph Yun, a former top US diplomat on North Korea policy. ""The US still believes North Korea will denuclearize substantially before we give them any major rewards, while North Korea believes that the two need to move together jointly, and both make concessions.""

The rebuke from North Korea -- and the fact that Pompeo left the talks with little to show for his effort -- suggests that Pyongyang, and not the US, is setting the terms of negotiation. Rather than announcing any concrete achievements, the most Pompeo seemed able to deliver on Saturday was the promise of more talks.

Two US officials and other sources familiar with preparations for Pompeo's trip had said the top US diplomat was expected to get some clarity on some issues not directly related to denuclearization, including the return of US service members' remains from the Korean War and a timeline for the destruction of a missile engine test site.

But Pompeo, who has staked his political future on efforts to dismantle the isolated country's nuclear program, had little to say about remains or the missile site in his Saturday remarks to reporters. He did say that a meeting has been set up for July 12 that will involve ""discussions between the folks responsible for the repatriation of remains,"" and that ""some progress"" had been made in discussing ""what the modalities would look like for destruction"" of the missile facility, but overall he offered few specifics.

Kim did not meet with Pompeo, a move that could be interpreted as a snub, though his spokesman said that was never an expectation. Instead, the top US diplomat met on Friday and again on Saturday with Kim Yong Chol, the vice chairman of the country's Party Central Committee.

On Saturday, Pompeo insisted to reporters that ""the complete denuclearization of North Korea"" remains the objective, and ""no one walked away from that,"" adding, ""Chairman Kim is still committed."" But in response to a reporter's question over whether the US is moving closer to firming up a timeline for denuclearization, he said, ""I'm not going to get into the details of our conversations.""

Despite the contradictory take on the discussions, a spokesman for North Korea's foreign ministry said toward the end of a lengthy statement Saturday, ""We still cherish our good faith in President Trump.""

Yun said Pyongyang seemed to have the advantage in the talks at the moment.

""So far, it appears that North Korea has gained more than the US,"" he said, adding, ""it looks like North Korea is dictating the pace and the direction of the talks.""

The outcome of the most recent talks underscores the challenging situation Pompeo is in as he attempts to turn Trump's vague rhetoric into reality with one of the toughest and most recalcitrant negotiating partners on the global stage. North Korea has stymied other administrations with a combination of contradiction, subterfuge and mixed messaging -- and is playing true true to form.

has repeatedly insisted must take place. The US may have backed itself into a corner early on as a result of Trump's agreement to meet with the North Korean leader for a historic summit last month without first extracting a formal pledge of ""complete,"" ""verifiable"" and ""irreversible"" denuclearization, which the administration

Instead, the US received only a vague assurance from North Korea last month that it would ""work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.""

In the meantime, satellite images indicate that North Korea has made upgrades to a nuclear facility and researchers in the US have said that it also appears to be finalizing the expansion of a ballistic missile manufacturing site.

Defense and administration officials working on the North Korea portfolio say it's still not clear whether the US and North Korea will even be able to agree on the definition and extent of what ""denuclearization"" means. Leaked information has revealed that the Defense Intelligence Agency doesn't think Kim has any intention of giving up his nuclear weapons anytime soon.

Current officials, diplomatic sources and others familiar with internal policy discussions say the administration has been having trouble pulling together a coherent approach for dealing with North Korea, and that there is a growing sense of concern.

These sources say the Trump administration has yet to agree with the North Koreans on a common goal or timeline, or on who will run point on detailed negotiations with Pyongyang alongside Pompeo.

Administration officials familiar with the work on North Korea had told CNN they saw cause for worry if Pompeo returned from this trip -- his third to North Korea in as many months -- without a definite plan in hand for moving forward.

They say there's a sense within the White House and at the State Department that they need a solid timeline or some specifics on North Korea's denuclearization by the end of August at the latest.

Soon after, suspended military exercises with South Korea -- which Trump and Pompeo have called ""war games,"" using North Korean terminology -- are due to start up again.

There is also speculation that Trump and Kim may meet again at the United Nations General Assembly, which takes place every September.

TOKYO — North Korea claimed Friday that it successfully conducted a ""higher level"" test of a nuclear weapon, its second in eight months and its fifth since 2006. The announcement drew immediate condemnation from the United States, South Korea, China and Japan.

The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on the matter Friday, and President Obama warned North Korea that the United States would use ""the full spectrum of U.S. defense capabilities"" to defend its allies.

“To be clear, the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state,” Obama said.

The North Korean government in the capital of Pyongyang said the test was of a nuclear warhead designed to be mounted on ballistic rockets and demonstrated that it was prepared to hit back at its enemies including the United States if provoked. North Korea’s state TV said the test was ""examined and confirmed."" The announcement followed seismic activity near the country's nuclear site picked up by foreign monitors.

The test violates United Nations resolutions and will further strain North Korea's already tense relations with the U.S. and other countries in the region.

Obama: U.S. will not accept a nuclear North Korea

China, an ally and economic lifeline for North Korea, was among the countries that swiftly reprimanded North Korea.

The White House said Obama, who was en route home from a summit in Laos, spoke by phone with South Korean President Park Geun Hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Obama said the allies agreed to work with the U.N. Security Council, China and Russia to impose new sanctions on North Korea. The U.S. will also deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to South Korea, Obama said.

Park called the detonation an act of “fanatic recklessness.”

Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike told reporters the city was testing water samples and monitoring radiation levels to gauge any impact from the test in Japan.

Previous U.N. resolutions have forbidden North Korea from developing nuclear weapons or ballistic missile technology but have had little effect. Seoul estimated the test may be the North’s biggest explosive yield yet.

""We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners,"" Ned Price, a spokesperson for the National Security Council in Washington, said in a prepared statement.

Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. expects its partners in the six party talks “to take necessary steps to ensure the (North Korean) regime understands there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.”

Earlier, South Korea’s military detected a magnitude-5 earthquake near the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in northeastern North Korea. It described that quake as ""artificial.""

The test coincides with the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as North Korea is known officially. In the past, the reclusive nation has marked major anniversaries with weapons tests or other provocative actions.

South Korean news agency Yonhap reported the test is believed to have taken place in the same location where North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January.

Pyongyang also conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

While North Korea’s nuclear tests are “unwanted,” they are no longer destabilizing, said Robert E. Kelly, professor of political science at South Korea’s Pusan National University. “We've known for awhile that North Korea has functional nuclear weapons,"" he said.

""The real issues are can they improve these weapons from basic atomic bombs to hydrogen weapons? And can they marry them to a missile so that they can deliver them? The answer on both counts right now is probably 'No,' ” Kelly said in email exchange Friday.

A look at North Korea's 5 nuclear tests

About 28,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, which technically remains at war with its neighbor to the north.

In January, North Korea conducted what it said was a test of a much more powerful hydrogen bomb, although the U.S. government disputed that claim. Since then the North has conducted several tests of medium- and long-range missiles as part of its push for a nuclear-armed missile that could one day reach the U.S. mainland.

Earlier this week, North Korea fired three ballistic missiles into Japan’s exclusive economic zone in the Sea of Japan in an apparent signal of its displeasure with Group of 20 summit talks being held in Hangzhou, China.

north_korea,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/25/18236174/north-korea-trump-kim-vietnam-nuclear,An expert on what “success” in Trump-North Korea talks would look like,2019-02-25,"Alex Ward, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou","President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are set to meet in Vietnam this week for their second summit aimed at ending North Korea ’ s nuclear program .
And nearly every expert I ’ ve spoken to is incredibly pessimistic about the chances that the summit will succeed . That ’ s in large part because it seems that the Trump administration has no idea what the hell it ’ s doing right now or how it plans to handle the upcoming incredibly critical negotiations .
Rebecca Hersman , an expert on nuclear weapons at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington , is one of those people who doubt much substantive will likely come out of the meeting .
Yet when I saw Hersman speak at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington last week , she made some really interesting comments about the smaller steps the US and North Korea could agree to in Vietnam that would be meaningful — things she said would demonstrate the negotiations are serious . None of them would end the current nuclear threat , but they might prove Trump has gotten somewhere with Kim .
So after her presentation , I called Hersman to better understand her views and find out more about what it would take to call the Vietnam summit a success — or a failure .
Let ’ s start with what you spoke about on the panel : the steps the US and North Korea could take that would signal that the talks to end North Korea ’ s nuclear program were truly serious . The first one you mentioned was the disclosure by North Korea of at least some of its secret nuclear facilities .
That would mark a move away from recycling the same old thing . I think that would offer us genuine insight into North Korea ’ s range of capabilities that we haven ’ t really seen before . We would gather , I think , actual concrete new information that we might not otherwise have .
Second , it ’ d be great if North Korea allowed inspectors into the country so they could take samples . That would allow the world to know what ’ s really going on inside North Korea .
Of course , none of this would denuclearize North Korea , but perhaps we could start to slow its further accumulation of materials .
Specifically , I ’ m talking about what we call “ weapons-usable nuclear material ” like plutonium or highly enriched uranium that could be used to make nuclear bombs .
So why would having inspectors on the ground also be a sign of progress , potentially ?
North Korea may say it ’ s dismantling its nuclear arsenal or ceasing plutonium production or whatever . But if the world can ’ t verify that , it ’ s not clear how meaningful Pyongyang ’ s concession would be .
So what I ’ m looking for are things that are meaningful reductions in capability , or that I think meaningfully contribute to a more stable posture in the interim .
So even if Trump and Kim come out of Vietnam with agreements to do some of the things you discuss , there would still be a lot of steps to take to make sure North Korea is actually following through with that agreement .
Well , yes but let me be clear : These steps wouldn ’ t make me think that we were on a path to a more successful process . These are the types of things that would make me feel more hopeful about the process .
They don ’ t constitute a deal or an endgame , but they constitute a more serious conversation than what we ’ ve seen to date . I think that that is really important in terms of making concrete progress .
Let ’ s go back to the sampling part for a second . What does that even look like ? I assume the inspectors would do it ?
Yes , I think it would be a typical part of an inspection process to take environmental samples . That helps to confirm what ’ s being produced .
It could be in the air , but it could also be what we would think of as a swipe of surfaces . That allows you to test those materials for nuclear residue .
Okay , so let ’ s recap what might make you hopeful : North Korea 1 ) revealing undeclared facilities ; 2 ) disclosing how it enriches materials to use in bombs , 3 ) allowing inspections , and 4 ) allowing inspectors to take samples in previously unknown locations .
Yes , but on the inspectors bit , I want to reiterate that they need to be at a meaningful location . If they ’ re hanging out at a hotel somewhere , talking to each other , drinking coffee , that ’ s not helpful . But if you combine the declaration of a facility with at least a first initial inspection , and an opportunity to do some analysis , that sounds more meaningful .
Putting an inspector back into the same places they might have been before is less encouraging . Maybe not terrible , but less encouraging .
What would the Holy Grail be for inspectors in this case , then ? That they are allowed to go into a previously undeclared facility ?
The Holy Grail is getting production to cease at various facilities . But a starting point is to gain a better insight into where these facilities are , what was produced there , how much , and of what nature .
That all starts to fill in a picture of what we call “ material accounting , ” which is the ability to know how much nuclear stuff has been produced and of what character . For example , if inspectors are looking at uranium , they should get to know at least at what levels the uranium was enriched .
Knowing that allows us to accumulate some pretty meaningful information that previously we would not have had access to .
So what ’ s your confidence level that we might get anything close to what you ’ ve outlined ?
There are two different issues involved with the confidence level .
One is whatever the administration seeks to achieve . I confess to being a little bit confused . On the one hand , you hear descriptions of a very all-or-nothing approach , in terms of how we must do something big or it doesn ’ t mean anything . Then on the other hand , we hear that this could take forever and that there ’ s “ no rush . ”
What I ’ m trying to identify is : What are some things that could be done fairly quickly that would let me believe the process was more serious and worth these additional engagements ?
Let me emphasize that it ’ s not just on the nuclear side . I think these types of gestures can happen on the missile side , too . Identifying missile bases or allowing inspections in undeclared missile facilities , and sharing more detailed information about missile capabilities . Those would be impactful , as well .
If we got , let ’ s say , any one of these things that you discussed out of the Hanoi meeting , should we consider at least the summit itself a success ?
That might be a little too hypothetical . It really may depend on some of the details and what the package looks like .
You haven ’ t asked me what we gave up to get any of these things . That would certainly color my thinking on that . I don ’ t believe we should make any concessions on the scale of withdrawing our 28,500 troops from the Korean Peninsula .
I wouldn ’ t rule out the possibility of getting transparency-type measures , confidence building-type measures , crisis communications measures . Those might help us build in a little bit of a safety net here should the two leaders stop getting along so well .
That ’ s an interesting point . Everyone ’ s going to be looking at the nuclear stuff , but there is a chance to move forward on the US-North Korea relationship on its own . That ’ s important , because if things go south between Kim and Trump , it ’ s vital for there to be a framework in place so both countries don ’ t go at each other ’ s throats down the line .
Exactly , we don ’ t want to revisit “ fire and fury , ” right ? That is not a good place to be . What we want to do is , at a minimum , come out of this dialogue with a sense that the environment is safer and that the risk of catastrophic conflict is diminished as we continue to work towards goals of denuclearization .
My concern is that everybody getting along and sending letters back and forth doesn ’ t meaningfully do that . Perhaps further looking at how you posture troops along the demilitarized zone might do that , or how moving artillery further out of range might do that . And again , establishing important crisis-communication mechanisms might do that .
There are ways that we could create a situation that , while far from ideal , is slightly more stable .
We ’ ve talked a lot about success . What does failure look like ?
First , failure is a decoupling of our alliance with South Korea — where we basically break our relationship with South Korea to make a deal with North Korea .
Second , failure would be if we leave the summit with North Korea feeling emboldened and potentially more aggressive in the future .
Third , failure would be another situation where there are incredibly superficial agreements and broadly worded statements that never manifest into concrete steps that could lead to a more stable situation .
Fourth , failure is the United States continuing to make concessions without seeing commensurate progress on the part of the North Koreans — or seeing , frankly , disproportionate progress .
It ’ s not the United States or South Korea that has been under UN Security Council resolutions for threatening the peace and security of the globe , that ’ s North Korea . The idea that actions have to be proportionate is a bit misguided .
It ’ s of course unclear right now what Trump and Kim will agree to , but a massive deal where Kim gives up all his weapons is extremely unlikely . So even if they agree to all the measures we discussed , the central problem — that North Korea has a nuclear program that threatens the US and its allies — will remain the same after Hanoi , right ?
Absolutely . Actually , North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program , which has the potential to threaten the United States and its allies , will exist after Hanoi even if it is a success beyond all imagining .
Even if Kim Jong Un walks into the meeting and says , “ I ’ ve made a strategic decision : I no longer want nuclear weapons , just come in and take it all , ” those will still just be words .
The process of actually working to eliminate that program is not something that ’ s done in a few days or weeks or even months . You have to get beyond the words to actually reduce the threat . What you don ’ t want is to have an agreement in words that doesn ’ t move the needle in practice and in turn provides almost a cover for ongoing misbehavior .","President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are set to meet in Vietnam this week for their second summit aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear program.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation is below.

Alex Ward

Let’s start with what you spoke about on the panel: the steps the US and North Korea could take that would signal that the talks to end North Korea’s nuclear program were truly serious. The first one you mentioned was the disclosure by North Korea of at least some of its secret nuclear facilities.

Of course, none of this would denuclearize North Korea, but perhaps we could start to slow its further accumulation of materials.

Alex Ward

What materials, specifically?

Rebecca Hersman

Specifically, I’m talking about what we call “weapons-usable nuclear material” like plutonium or highly enriched uranium that could be used to make nuclear bombs.

Rebecca Hersman

Well, yes but let me be clear: These steps wouldn’t make me think that we were on a path to a more successful process. These are the types of things that would make me feel more hopeful about the process.

They don’t constitute a deal or an endgame, but they constitute a more serious conversation than what we’ve seen to date. I think that that is really important in terms of making concrete progress.

Alex Ward

Let’s go back to the sampling part for a second. What does that even look like? I assume the inspectors would do it?

Rebecca Hersman

Yes, I think it would be a typical part of an inspection process to take environmental samples. That helps to confirm what’s being produced.

Alex Ward

And by environmental testing, you mean like air samples?

Rebecca Hersman

It could be in the air, but it could also be what we would think of as a swipe of surfaces. That allows you to test those materials for nuclear residue.

Alex Ward

Okay, so let’s recap what might make you hopeful: North Korea 1) revealing undeclared facilities; 2) disclosing how it enriches materials to use in bombs, 3) allowing inspections, and 4) allowing inspectors to take samples in previously unknown locations.

Rebecca Hersman

Yes, but on the inspectors bit, I want to reiterate that they need to be at a meaningful location.

Alex Ward

Korea capable of arming missile with nuke, officials downplay finding",2013-04-12,,"Obama administration officials scrambled to downplay the errant disclosure of a classified portion of an intelligence report finding that North Korea has advanced its nuclear knowledge to the point that it could arm a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead .
The analysis , disclosed Thursday at a hearing on Capitol Hill , says the Pentagon 's intelligence wing has `` moderate confidence '' that North Korea has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles but that the weapon was unreliable .
The revelation was significant , because it has not been previously reported or believed that the country had the ability to miniaturize and deliver a nuclear weapon .
But top U.S. officials repeatedly stressed that the finding does not mean North Korea has the capabilities to launch a nuclear missile with any reliability at this point .
`` North Korea has not demonstrated the capability to deploy a nuclear-armed missile , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Friday .
`` It is inaccurate to suggest that ( North Korea ) has the capability articulated in that report -- they have a missile but that is very different than having the militarization , nuclearization , etcetera , '' Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier , after landing in South Korea as part of a tour of Asian countries .
On Thursday night , the Pentagon and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper both downplayed the report .
`` While I can not speak to all the details of a report that is classified in its entirety , it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested , developed , or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage , '' Pentagon spokesman George Little said . Clapper echoed the assessment .
Meanwhile , North Korea was leveling new threats Friday . According to South Korea 's Yonhap News Agency , the regime warned that Tokyo would , in the event of a war , be the first target `` if it continues to maintain its hostile posture . '' North Korea was apparently threatening Japan because it vowed to destroy any missile heading toward the country .
Separately , South Korean President Park Geun-hye reportedly said she 's open to working with the North to resolve the standoff if the regime ends its provocative behavior .
The dispute over the North 's nuclear capability started with the Capitol Hill hearing Thursday . At the hearing , Rep. Doug Lamborn , R-Colo. , read aloud what he said was an unclassified paragraph from a secret Defense Intelligence Agency report that was supplied to some members of Congress .
He said , reading from the report : `` DIA assesses with moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivering by ballistic missiles , however the reliability will be low . ''
The reading seemed to take Gen. Martin Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , by surprise , who said he had n't seen the report and declined to answer questions about it .
Pentagon officials told Fox News that the memo he read from was in fact classified . However , someone at the Defense Intelligence Agency mistakenly marked it `` unclassified , '' which led to the confusion .
A U.S. official in Seoul said Friday it is `` premature '' to say North Korea has developed the expertise to make a nuclear weapon small enough to put on a ballistic missile .
`` It is a very difficult task , '' the official told Fox News . `` They have n't been able to put everything together . ''
The official also says there is no indication a North Korea missile launch is imminent , saying officials `` have not seen activity '' that would show that a launch will happen soon , or that the country is planning a large scale attack .
`` There has been no indication of massive troop movements or anything to back up the rhetoric going on , '' the official said .
Meanwhile , Kerry 's trip to South Korea comes in the midst of bellicose threats from the unpredictable communist regime in the North .
Kerry and his South Korean counterpart said in a joint press conference Friday that North Korea will gain nothing by threatening tests of its missile or nuclear programs .
Kerry said the U.S. and its Asian ally wo n't accept the North as a nuclear power , calling the country 's rhetoric `` unacceptable . ''
South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se called Pyongyang 's threats a `` grave provocation '' to the entire international community .
Since the beginning of March , the Navy has moved two missile defense ships closer to the coast of the Korean peninsula , in part to protect against a potential missile launch aimed at Guam , a U.S. territory in the Pacific .
The Pentagon also has announced it will place a more advanced land-based missile defense on Guam , and Hagel said in March that he approved installing 14 additional missile interceptors in Alaska to bolster a portion of the missile defense network that is designed to protect all of U.S. territory .
On Thursday , the Pentagon said it had moved a sea-based X-band radar -- designed to track warheads in flight -- into position in the Pacific .
Notably absent from that unclassified segment of the Pentagon report was any reference to what the DIA believes is the range of a missile North Korea could arm with a nuclear warhead . Much of its missile arsenal is capable of reaching South Korea and Japan , but Kim has threatened to attack the United States as well .
But David Wright , a nuclear weapons expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists , said the DIA assessment probably does not change the views of those who closely follow developments in North Korea 's pursuit of a nuclear weapon .
`` People are starting to believe North Korea very likely has the capability to build a nuclear weapon small enough to put on some of their shorter-range missiles , '' Wright said . `` Once you start talking about warheads small enough and technically capable to be on a long-range missile , I think it 's much more an open question . ''
The DIA assessment is not out of line with comments Dempsey made Wednesday when he was asked at a Pentagon news conference whether North Korea was capable of pairing a nuclear warhead to a ballistic missile that could reach Japan or beyond .
In response , Dempsey said the extent of North Korean progress on designing a nuclear weapon small enough to operate as a missile warhead was a classified matter . But he did not rule out that the North has achieved the capability revealed in the DIA report .
`` They have conducted two nuclear tests , '' Dempsey told a Pentagon news conference . `` They have conducted several successful ballistic missile launches . And in the absence of concrete evidence to the contrary , we have to assume the worst case , and that 's why we 're postured as we are today . '' He was referring to recent moves by the U.S. to increase its missile defense capabilities in the Pacific .
At the same House hearing where Lamborn revealed the DIA conclusion , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was asked a different version of the same question : Does North Korea have the capability to strike U.S. territory with a nuclear weapon ? Hagel said the answer is no .
`` Now does that mean that they wo n't have it or they ca n't have it or they 're not working on it ? '' Hagel added . `` No . That 's why this is a very dangerous situation . ''
`` Now is the time for North Korea to end the belligerent approach they have taken and to try to lower temperatures , '' Obama said in his first public comments since Pyongyang threatened the United States and its allies in East Asia with nuclear attack .
Obama , speaking from the Oval Office , said he preferred to see the tensions on the peninsula resolved through diplomatic means , but added that `` the United States will take all necessary steps to protect its people . ''

North Korea lashed out at the U.S. on Sunday for imposing new sanctions in retaliation for its suspected role in the cyberattack against Sony Pictures, saying the move shows the White House's ""inveterate repugnancy and hostility"" toward the nation.

In a statement carried on the state-run Korean Central News Agency, a spokesman for the foreign ministry again denied the nation was behind the attack, largely seen as a response to Sony's The Interview, a satirical comedy involving a plot to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

The reclusive nation accused Sony of producinga ""disgusting movie openly agitating terrorism against a sovereign state."" It also claimed the U.S. is ""kicking off a noisy anti-DPRK campaign, deliberately linking the 'cyber terror' with the DPRK,"" referring to North Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

""The U.S. anti-DPRK hostile act ... is aimed to save its face and tarnish the image of the DPRK in the international arena at any cost,"" the statement said.

Obama signed an executive order Friday for the new sanctions citing ""the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014.""

The new measures come on top of previous sanctions designed to punish North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. Indeed, three of the North Korean entities sanctioned Friday were already on the Treasury Department sanctions list.Ten individuals — including North Korean agents operating in Namibia, Russia, Iran, Syria and China — were added to the list.

In its statement Sunday, North Korea said the sanctions have not weakened the nation or its military and are counterproductive.

This, along with what Mr Moon described as agreement ""on a way to achieve denuclearisation"" appears to have swayed the US.

Mr Pompeo said it was ""on the basis of these important commitments"" that the US was ""prepared to engage immediately in negotiations"".

What else did Moon's visit achieve?

Plans were laid out for a reciprocal visit by Mr Kim to Seoul - which would make him the first North Korean leader to do so.

On Wednesday evening, Mr Moon and his host attended a show of the North Korean Arirang propaganda festival.

The South Korean president gave a speech to tens of thousands of North Koreans, speaking both about reunification and the aim to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.

Why climb a mountain?

Mr Moon's trip to Mount Paektu was also highly symbolic.

South Korea's national anthem opens with a reference to the volcano while for the North it is the alleged birthplace of Mr Kim's father and grandfather, and is used in propaganda to reinforce the cult of personality around the ruling family.

Mr Moon has stated that visiting Mount Paektu was a ""long unfulfilled dream"".

""Many people in the South would go to Mount Paektu from the China side, but I decided not to, pledging myself that I would go stepping on our soil,"" he told Mr Kim at the summit.

Moon's huge gamble

Analysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul

South Korean President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong.

His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded.

These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read.

But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace Prize.

If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship.

Read Laura's piece in full

How did we reach this point?

The South Korean envoys met Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week. It was the culmination of a rapprochement that began at the New Year and saw the Koreas marching together at the Winter Olympics.

The envoys then travelled to Washington to brief Mr Trump.

Speaking outside the White House after the meeting, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said Mr Kim was prepared to sit down with the US president and was now ""committed to denuclearisation"".

In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the ""courageous decision"" of Mr Kim would help secure ""peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the East Asia region"".

There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options.

What could be on the agenda?

Clearly for the US, South Korea and allied nations, denuclearisation is the key issue.

North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws.

The North has carried out six nuclear tests and has missiles that could reach the US.

However, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely.

The North's well-documented human rights abuses are also a key issue for the US.

So what does the North want? An easing, if not removal, of sanctions certainly.

Perhaps a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea.

The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North because it believes they are preparation for invasion.

What has the reaction been?

The UN was among the most positive, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commending the ""leadership and vision"" of all concerned.

Chinese President Xi Jinping telephoned Donald Trump on Friday to welcome the development and urge all sides to avoid doing anything that could impede the improving situation.

Russia, Germany, the EU and the IAEA all voiced hope that talks would reduce the risk of conflict erupting.

The Philippine government has impounded a North Korean freighter , the Jin Teng , in Subic Bay and plans to deport its crew , presidential spokesman Manuel Quezon III said in a radio interview , according to the official Philippines News Agency .
This would n't have happened if not for Pyongyang 's recent nuclear test and missile launch , and the global community 's reaction to these defiant acts .
The 15-member U.N. Security Council voted this week to impose an array of new sanctions in response to what it called `` violation and flagrant disregard '' of previous resolutions . Tellingly , this vote was unanimous -- with not only from longtime North Korean foes such as the United States and Japan , but also Russia and China , who have been less adversarial to the regime .
Among other provisions , Resolution 2270 mandates that other countries `` should inspect cargo within or transiting through their territory — including airports , sea ports and free trade zones — that was destined for or originating from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea . '' It also makes special mention of calling out any `` evasion of sanctions '' by various parties .
The Jin Teng is one of 31 vessels operated by Ocean Maritime Management , which is named in the U.N. resolution as being `` subject to the asset freeze . ''
Documents show that all 21 of the Sierra Leone-flagged ship 's crew are North Korean nationals .
The freighter arrived Thursday in Subic Bay , on the west of the Philippines ' main island of Luzon , from Indonesia with a load of palm kernels , according to state news . CNN crews saw its cargo being subsequently unloaded and put onto trucks at the port .
In addition to the U.N.-related issues , coast guardsmen also found minor safety violations like faulty emergency light bulbs , a lack of fire hoses , corroded air vents and inadequate accommodations for crew , according to Philippines Coast Guard spokesman Armand Balilo .
A team from the United Nations may also inspect the Jin Teng , according to Quezon . Regardless , the Philippine government will report its findings to that world body .
Such actions -- this ship seizure , specifically , and stronger sanctions , generally -- seemingly have done little to deter North Korea 's muscle flexing , bellicose talk and nuclear ambitions .
Several times this week , in fact , North Korea has continued and , if anything , escalated its threat to potentially deploy a nuclear weapon .
On Friday , for instance , state news agency KCNA reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country 's `` nuclear warheads need to be ready for use at any time . ''
`` Under the extreme situation that the U.S. Imperialist is misusing its military influence and is pressuring other countries and people to start war and catastrophe , the only way for our people to protect sovereignty and rights to live is to strengthen the quality and quantity of nuclear power and realize the balance of power , '' Kim said , according to KCNA .

This rhetoric came out a day after the news agency reported tests of a new multiple-launch rocket system . This may or may not be referring to a launch of `` short-range projectiles '' chronicled one day earlier by the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Pyongyang has long boasted about its nuclear ambitions , about as long as countries like South Korea and the United States have sought to derail them . The issue has only furthered the isolation of North Korea , a communist , closed-off state led for decades by the authoritarian Kim , his late father and his grandfather .
A chief concern is not only that Pyongyang will develop effective nuclear warheads , but that they 'll pair them with missiles that can strike targets around East Asia and perhaps beyond .
North Korea has even repeatedly threatened to attack the United States , including saying last August that it would do so `` with tremendous muscle . '' A state television report in 2015 mentioned that such strikes could reach the American mainland .
There are strong doubts North Korea currently has the technology to mate a nuclear warhead to a missile that could travel 5,000 miles and hit the U.S. West Coast . But much is still unknown about Pyongyang 's military potential , and there 's no disputing its bravado .
One anti-nuclear advocate thinks a lot of the talk is intended for internal consumption , to help Kim consolidate power , and is not proof of his military 's abilities .
`` To me , right now , it 's a lot of bluster , '' said Philip Yun , executive director of the Ploughshares Fund , a group that calls for nuclear disarmament .
`` For them to deliver on a threat , they have to have intent and they have to have capability . And quite frankly , I do n't think they have both .

There are strong doubts North Korea currently has the technology to mate a nuclear warhead to a missile that could travel 5,000 miles and hit the U.S. West Coast. But much is still unknown about Pyongyang's military potential, and there's no disputing its bravado.

One anti-nuclear advocate thinks a lot of the talk is intended for internal consumption, to help Kim consolidate power, and is not proof of his military's abilities.

""To me, right now, it's a lot of bluster,"" said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, a group that calls for nuclear disarmament.

""For them to deliver on a threat, they have to have intent and they have to have capability. And quite frankly, I don't think they have both.""",www.cnn.com,left,rkOkk2zCg3BVgrJC

Huddling with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to strategize on the summit with Pyongyang , Mr. Trump told reporters that he is not sure the denuclearization talks will go forward as planned on June 12 in Singapore . He hinted again that China , which is engaged in contentious trade talks with the U.S. , may be undermining the North Korea summit .
“ It may not work out for June 12th , ” Mr. Trump said . “ I don ’ t want to waste a lot of time , and I ’ m sure [ Mr. Kim ] doesn ’ t want to waste a lot of time . So there ’ s a very substantial chance that it won ’ t work out . ”
Asked by a reporter if the fate of the summit is resting on a coin toss , the president replied , “ Yeah . ”
It was the most doubt the president has expressed openly about the meeting since North Korea threatened last week to back out . North Korea said it won ’ t agree to Mr. Trump ’ s demand to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally .
A top South Korean official predicted this week that the summit was a “ 99.9 percent done deal . ”
The time frame for North Korean denuclearization also appears to be a sticking point . The U.S. and its allies South Korea and Japan are seeking immediate and verifiable removal of Pyongyang ’ s weapons of mass destruction , while North Korea is reported to be asking for a longer timetable .
“ All in one would be nice , ” Mr. Trump said . “ You do have some physical reasons that [ North Korea ] may not be able to do exactly that . ”
Seeming to negotiate on camera , Mr. Trump said he is willing to accept Pyongyang ’ s denuclearization over “ a very short period of time . ”
“ Essentially , that would be all in one , ” he said . “ There are certain conditions that we want , and I think we ’ ll get those conditions . And if we don ’ t , we don ’ t have the meeting . ”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later told reporters that the Trump administration was still planning for a June 12 summit , although he wouldn ’ t predict whether it was certain .
A North Korean flight carrying international journalists to cover the dismantlement of the Punggye-ri nuclear test ground left Beijing for North Korea on Tuesday without a group of South Korean reporters originally invited to attend . The nuclear test ground is scheduled to be dismantled sometime before Friday , depending on weather conditions .
The president expressed hope for a summit with Mr. Kim at some point . He said the U.S. is emphasizing to Mr. Kim that an agreement will provide economic benefits to the isolated and heavily sanctioned North Korea .
“ He will be extremely happy if something works out , ” Mr. Trump said . “ He will be safe , he will be happy , his country will be rich , his country will be hardworking and very prosperous . ”
The prospect of eventual reunification between communist North Korea and democratic South Korea is also dangling over the summit . Mr . Moon said “ the fate and the future of the Korean Peninsula hinges on this . ”
“ I have every confidence that President Trump will be able to achieve a historic feat of making the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit successful and end the Korean War that has been lasting for the past 65 years , ” Mr . Moon said . He also spoke of his hope that the U.S. will normalize relations with North Korea .
North and South Korea have been separated by a Demilitarized Zone since a truce in 1953 . Mr. Trump called it “ an artificial border ” and spoke of the possibility that the countries could “ go back to one Korea . ”
“ It ’ s going to be largely up to them , as to whether or not they get together , ” he said . “ I would say that we are looking , certainly , right now , at two Koreas . Two very successful Koreas . But someday in the future , maybe they ’ ll get together and you ’ ll go back to one Korea . ”
The president also was more direct Tuesday in blaming Chinese President Xi Jinping , whom he calls a friend , for causing Mr. Kim ’ s apparent change of heart about the summit . China is Pyongyang ’ s main trading partner and has largely worked with the U.S. to enforce economic sanctions on North Korea .
Mr. Kim has visited Beijing twice in two months , and his second trip to China on May 7 caught the U.S. by surprise . It came amid escalating threats of tariffs by China and the U.S. as Mr. Trump seeks to stop what he calls China ’ s unfair trade practices .
“ The second meeting , I think there was a little change in attitude from Kim Jong-un , ” said Mr. Trump , adding that he was disappointed by the meeting . “ The second time was like a surprise . I don ’ t like that . I think things changed after that meeting . So I can ’ t say that I ’ m happy about it . I think that President Xi is a world-class poker player . ”
Amid such high-level concerns and negotiations , the White House came under criticism for a decidedly more trivial aspect of the planned June 12 summit : a commemorative “ challenge coin ” marking the historic event . It features images of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim , and is inscribed with the North Korean ’ s title of “ supreme leader . ”
Some critics on social media said it was un-American to commemorate Mr. Kim , who has an abysmal human rights record .
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , called on the White House to remove the image of a “ brutal dictator ” from the coin .
“ I urge the White House to take Kim off the coin , ” Mr. Schumer said . “ Challenge coins are a time-honored tradition and certainly appropriate in this situation , but Kim Jong-un ’ s face has no place on this coin . ”
He suggested that a more appropriate image would be the Peace House , a building in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea .
Such coins are released routinely to commemorate a president ’ s foreign trips . White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the coin “ is not something that the White House has anything to do with . ”
“ We don ’ t have any input on the design , the manufacturer , the process , in any capacity , ” she said . “ This is a standard procedure by the White House Communications Agency , which is made up exclusively of career military officials . And these coins are designed and done by that organization . ”
Coin or no coin , canceling the summit would be a blow to negotiations that Mr. Trump has hoped would produce his biggest foreign policy achievement . As the preparations progressed and North Korea released three American captives this month , there was even talk in some quarters of awarding the president the Nobel Peace Prize if the summit is fruitful .

USA TODAY Opinion

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed Saturday that he is prepared to wage war against the United States if necessary, using as a backdrop a massive display of firepower in the form of troop columns, missile launchers, tanks and other military hardware during a choreographed parade in the capital of Pyongyang.

""Our military force is ready to respond to any kind of war the American imperialists want,"" Kim said in his speech marking the 70th anniversary of party rule, according to the Associated Press.

The heavily rehearsed event played out in the city's central Kim Il Sung Square, named after Kim's grandfather and founding leader of the North Korean state. Tens of thousands of onlookers rhythmically waved pink and red artificial flowers as throngs of goose-stepping soldiers paraded and Kim, wearing his signature dark Maoist suit, saluted as he overlooked the spectacle.

Military aircraft flew in a formation overhead spelling out the hammer, brush and sickle symbol of North Korea and the number 70. Amid the tanks, drones and armored vehicles in the parade, were what appeared to be North Korea's first intercontinental ballistic missile, the KN-08, carried on a 16-wheeled vehicle, according to media reports.

While North Korea has nuclear weapons, it remains unclear whether its scientists have developed a means of delivering the bombs on long-range missiles. After the show of military might, the 30-something leader delivered 25 minutes of tough-worded remarks reiterating the United States as North Korea's chief adversary.

“Through the line of Songun (military-first) politics, our Korean People’s Army has become the strongest revolutionary force and our country has become an impenetrable fortress and a global military power,” he said, according to AP.

Standing beside Kim was a visiting dignitary from the isolated nation's primary ally and trade partner, China. Liu Yunshan, a fifth-ranked member of Chinese Communist Party, arrived with a letter from Chinese President Xi Jinping urging the continuation of close ties between the countries.

But Liu has also urged during his visit that North Korea resume six-party talks that are aimed at pushing Pyongyang to abandon nuclear weapons in exchange for economic assistance, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese-run news agency. The negotiations would also involve the United States.

North Korea uncharacteristically invited large numbers of foreign media and delegations to Pyongyang for the showy 70th celebration.

Shortly after these comments , North Korea ’ s foreign minister threatened to test a hydrogen bomb in the atmosphere — something that North Korea has never done , and that no country has done in more than 35 years . On Friday morning , Trump responded to the North ’ s twin statements with yet another bellicose tweet : “ Kim Jong Un of North Korea , who is obviously a madman who does n't mind starving or killing his people , will be tested like never before ! ”
Now , this isn ’ t the first time that Washington and Pyongyang have lobbed insults at each other during the Trump administration — far from it . But North Korea experts say the current round of threats is riskier than previous episodes .
“ We 've never seen anything like it , ” Jenny Town , assistant director of Johns Hopkins University ’ s US-Korea Institute , says of Kim ’ s statement . “ I would not take this as bluster but would expect action . What action exactly is unclear , but I would expect it to be severe . ”
The highly unusual nature of the Kim statement , together with the highly specific nature of the atmospheric nuclear test threat , suggests that the country may really be gearing up to do something provocative . And experts say that as long as Trump insists on handling the North with angry rhetoric like his Friday morning tweet , rather than working to calm tensions , the situation is likely to keep escalating . It ’ s gotten to the point where the risk of actual war is , according to the Arms Control Association ’ s Kingston Reif , “ unacceptably high . ”
“ The cycle of the threats and counter-threats has entered an even more dangerous phase , ” Reif explains . “ We have two volatile leaders with nuclear weapons making it personal and further digging in with their reckless rhetoric . ”
What makes this Kim threat different from his previous ones
North Korea makes threats against the US all the time without sparking this kind of reaction from experts . Just a week ago , for example , Pyongyang issued a statement threatening to “ annihilate the US imperialist aggressors ” and “ reduce the US mainland into ashes and darkness , ” adding that the US should “ be beaten to death with a stick fit for a rabid dog . ”
Yet this statement wasn ’ t greeted with the same level of concern among experts as the North ’ s Thursday night statements .
There are two reasons for that . The first is the source of the comments . Usually , North Korea ’ s threats are issued through official press outlets , like the Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) or the Rodong Sinmun newspaper . Kim Jong Un does not personally sign them , and he definitely doesn ’ t read them on state-run TV . The sheer rarity of a personal statement by the country ’ s dictator makes the statement a sign that the North is taking the current situation extremely seriously .
“ The fact that it is written as if a personal memo from Kim Jong Un to President Trump is unprecedented and worth pause , ” Town explains . “ It 's clear that Kim feels justified in his actions and is insulted at the tone that Trump uses when he speaks of Kim . ”
Second , experts say the hydrogen bomb test threat is unique and particularly worrying . Typically , North Korea tests its nuclear weapons in an underground bunker at its Punggye-ri facility . Doing so contains the radioactive fallout and limits the risk of accidentally harming anyone . By contrast , detonating a bomb in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean , as the North Korean foreign minister threatened , could spread fallout far and wide .
In 1963 , the US and the Soviet Union agreed to cease atmospheric tests because the fallout couldn ’ t necessarily be contained . The last atmospheric test was conducted by China in 1980 . The North conducting one , even far away from populated areas , would be its most serious provocation yet .
“ If [ Kim Jong Un ] did an atmospheric test , that would be a big , big problem , ” Mira Rapp-Hooper , a scholar at Yale University Law School who studies North Korea , tells me . “ [ Any ] president would feel compelled to respond in some way . ”
These two problems feed each other . Kim ’ s sense of personal slight could lead him to follow through on the atmospheric test , potentially leading to a response from Trump that brings us even closer to war .
“ A personal statement from Kim certainly takes things to a whole new level , and if the North follows through on its apparent threat to test conduct an atmospheric nuclear test , we will be in very dangerous territory , ” says Laura Rosenberger , the National Security Council director for Korea and China in the Obama administration .
“ This is not a game , and these are not just words , ” she adds .
None of this means that war is likely in the near future . Kim may very well not follow through on his threat to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific , and if he does , the American military and political response might well be more restrained than experts fear .
But the fact that we ’ re even worrying about this suggests that the Trump administration ’ s emerging strategy to deal with North Korea — fiery rhetoric coupled with a push for harsher economic sanctions — isn ’ t working very well .
The consensus among North Korea experts is that Pyongyang wants nuclear weapons to deter an American invasion . Threats , like Trump ’ s vow back in August to respond to North Korean threats against the US with “ fire and fury like the world has never seen , ” only cause it to feel more insecure . When it feels insecure , it lashes out — demonstrating its own strength in order to signal to Washington that an invasion would be far too costly .
The two sides are essentially caught in a cycle of escalation that could theoretically escalate into outright conflict — even though neither side actually wants a war .
The current situation “ is a continuation of the one that started with the ‘ fire and fury comments , ’ ” Jeffrey Lewis , an expert on North Korea at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies , tells me .
The threat to test a bomb over the Pacific , specifically , is an example of this cycle in action . It ’ s the clearest way yet for the North to signal its own strength .
The test “ never would have been a consideration for [ the North Korean ] regime if Trump administration had n't embarked on a policy of continuous rhetorical escalation , ” Barry Pavel , a defense expert at the Atlantic Council , tweeted .
The solution to all of this , the experts say , is very simple : The Trump administration needs to stop unnecessarily antagonizing North Korea and instead start coming up with a strategy for managing the threat it poses .
“ It is still a crisis of our own making , ” Lewis says . “ We can stop it any time by shutting the president up and working to deescalate the situation . ”","President Trump’s speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, in which he threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, provoked an unprecedented response: On Thursday evening, Kim Jong Un delivered a rare televised statement in which he declared, “I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.” In the Korean version of the statement, he refers to Trump using a phrase that translates as “old beast lunatic” or “old man lunatic.”

President Donald Trump has again traded barbs with North Korea, shortly before offering to mediate in a heated regional dispute.

He took to Twitter to complain he would never call North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""short and fat"", after its foreign ministry called him ""old"".

It was one of a series of remarks he made on social media before volunteering his services over maritime claims in the South China Sea.

''
Trump gave his two-word prescription Monday morning when asked by a reporter at the White House Easter Egg Roll . The president has been tweeting warnings at North Korea for weeks as the dictatorship ramps up provocative missile tests .
Vice President Pence , speaking near the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea on Monday , delivered a similar steely statement , saying the `` era of strategic patience is over . '' Pence , expressing impatience with the speed and willingness of the regime to end its nuclear weapons program , said Trump was hopeful that China would use its “ extraordinary levers ” to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its weapons .
`` President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change , '' Pence said . `` We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons , and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable . ''
Later Monday , Pence reiterated that “ all options were on the table ” to deal with the threat posed by Pyongyang . He said any use of nuclear weapons would be met with “ an overwhelming and effective response. ” Speaking alongside South Korean Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn , Pence said the American commitment to South Korea is “ iron-clad and immutable . ”
A day earlier , deputy national security adviser K.T . MacFarland told Fox News ’ Chris Wallace on “ Fox News Sunday ” that North Korea was a problem for everybody in the region , including China -- the North ’ s strongest ally .
`` North Korea is a liability to everybody and it 's a threat not just to the United States , not just to South Korea , not just to Japan , not just to Russia , but it 's actually a threat to China as well . ”
H.R . McMaster , Trump ’ s top national security adviser , told ABC ’ s “ This Week ” the U.S. would rely on its allies as well as Chinese leadership to solve the issues with North Korea .
McMaster cited Trump 's recent decision to order missile strikes in Syria after a chemical attack blamed on the Assad government as a sign that the president `` is clearly comfortable making tough decisions . '' But at the same time , McMaster said , `` it 's time for us to undertake all actions we can , short of a military option , to try to resolve this peacefully . ''

The high-profile failure came as the North tried to showcase its nuclear and missile capabilities around the birth anniversary of the North 's late founder and as a U.S. aircraft carrier neared the Korean Peninsula .","President Trump has a simple message for the complex North Korea conundrum: ""Gotta behave.""

Trump gave his two-word prescription Monday morning when asked by a reporter at the White House Easter Egg Roll. The president has been tweeting warnings at North Korea for weeks as the dictatorship ramps up provocative missile tests.

Vice President Pence, speaking near the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea on Monday, delivered a similar steely statement, saying the ""era of strategic patience is over."" Pence, expressing impatience with the speed and willingness of the regime to end its nuclear weapons program, said Trump was hopeful that China would use its “extraordinary levers” to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its weapons.

""President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change,"" Pence said. ""We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.""

Later Monday, Pence reiterated that “all options were on the table” to deal with the threat posed by Pyongyang. He said any use of nuclear weapons would be met with “an overwhelming and effective response.” Speaking alongside South Korean Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, Pence said the American commitment to South Korea is “iron-clad and immutable.”

A day earlier, deputy national security adviser K.T. MacFarland told Fox News’ Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” that North Korea was a problem for everybody in the region, including China -- the North’s strongest ally.

""North Korea is a liability to everybody and it's a threat not just to the United States, not just to South Korea, not just to Japan, not just to Russia, but it's actually a threat to China as well.”

H.R. McMaster, Trump’s top national security adviser, told ABC’s “This Week” the U.S. would rely on its allies as well as Chinese leadership to solve the issues with North Korea.

McMaster cited Trump's recent decision to order missile strikes in Syria after a chemical attack blamed on the Assad government as a sign that the president ""is clearly comfortable making tough decisions."" But at the same time, McMaster said, ""it's time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully.""

A North Korean missile exploded during launch on Sunday, U.S. and South Korean officials said. The high-profile failure came as the North tried to showcase its nuclear and missile capabilities around the birth anniversary of the North's late founder and as a U.S. aircraft carrier neared the Korean Peninsula.

The country lifted some sanctions on North Korea in July 2014 after Pyongyang agreed to reopen an investigation into the fate of Japanese citizens abducted decades ago by North Korean agents to help train spies.

Progress in the investigation has since been slow.

China's foreign minister on Sunday urged North Korea to halt its missile and nuclear testing, one day after China and Russia joined with the United States in a unanimous U.N. Security Council vote approving the toughest economic sanctions yet against the increasingly isolated regime.

“Do not violate the U.N.’s decision or provoke international society’s goodwill by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned.

Wang and his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, met at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' meeting of foreign ministers in Manila. Wang said he pressed Ri to abide by U.N. resolutions and also lobbied for resumption of the six-party talks that would include both Koreas, the U.S., Japan, China and Russia. The talks were initiated in Beijing in August 2003, but have been stalled since December 2008, with North Korea formally dropping out in April 2009.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week the U.S. was willing to talk with Pyongyang — if the North agrees to abandon its quest for nuclear weapons.

On Saturday, the Security Council approved crippling economic sanctions targeting about a third of North Korea's estimated $3 billion in annual exports. China and Russia could have vetoed the effort, and have at times protected Pyongyang in the world body. While both global powers went along, their representatives again urged the U.S. and South Korea to scale back joint military exercises and a missile defense program that have raised the ire of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Wang said Sunday the dual proposal is the most practical, viable and reasonable solution to de-escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula while providing a ""way out"" of the nuclear issue. The U.S. has consistently rejected the plan.

The sanctions ban countries from purchasing the North's coal and related minerals as well as seafood. They also prohibit countries from increasing investments and the number of North Korean workers, and place nine individuals and four entities on the U.N. blacklist, including a global asset freeze and travel ban on North Korea's primary foreign exchange bank.

“It was a good outcome,” Tillerson said before meeting Sunday with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung Wha.

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the sanctions the most stringent on any country ""in a generation."" President Trump was equally thrilled, tweeting: ""The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!""

China's position appeared to reflect some positive movement from Trump’s unrelenting effort to enlist Beijing’s aid in curbing Pyongyang's military buildup. Still, the U.S. also warned it planned to rigorously monitor China’s compliance with the new penalties. Susan Thornton, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia, said Beijing had historically cooperated with sanctions after flagrant North Korean violations but then slipped back over time.

“We want to make sure China is continuing to implement fully the sanctions regime,” Thornton said in Manila. “Not this kind of episodic back and forth that we’ve seen.”

Harry J. Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, was unimpressed by China's tough talk.

""We have no reason to believe China will enforce these new sanctions,"" Kazianis told USA TODAY. ""They never have and likely never will. The simple fact is Beijing is likely more afraid of North Korea than we are.""

Kazianis said China fears that too much pressure could collapse the regime of Kim Jong Un, sending millions of refugees into China and igniting a civil war where nuclear and chemical weapons could lead to catastrophe.

""While these sanctions look rather robust, it all comes down to enforcement--and that means what will China do to enforce them?"" he said.

The North Korean envoy hasn’t spoken publicly since arriving in the Philippines. But a commentary in the ruling party’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said Washington had disregarded the warning the North sent with its intercontinental ballistic missile tests and was pursuing “desperate efforts” in the form of stepped-up sanctions.

“Now the U.S. mainland is on the crossroads of life and death,” the commentary warned.

The U.S. drafted the sanctions resolution and negotiated it with China following North Korea’s unprecedented test of an ICBM in July and a follow-up test weeks later. Those tests sharply escalated U.S. fears that Pyongyang is a key step closer to mastering the technology needed to strike American soil with a nuclear-tipped missile.

“Who has been carrying out the U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea? It is China,” Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, said Sunday. “Who bore the cost? It is also China.”

North Korea has reportedly conducted a third test launch in just over a week , firing what appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles , according to South Korean officials .
The presidential office in Seoul said the South Korean and U.S. militaries believe the test involved short-range ballistic missiles . South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that they flew about 137 miles and reached an altitude of 15 miles , traveling at the hypersonic speed of Mach 6.9 .
Last week , North Korea is thought to have tested a pair of KN-23 missiles , based on Russia 's SS-26 Iskander . As NPR 's Geoff Brumfiel reported in May , such a weapon presents a challenge to missile defenses in South Korea . Defense analysts say the solid-fuel missile is highly mobile and uses its speed and erratic flight path to evade interception .
On Wednesday , the North conducted a second test , claiming later that it was of a `` newly developed '' type of tactical missile , apparently for use against ground forces .
South Korea 's presidential office said it needed to conduct further analysis to determine exactly what type of projectiles were involved in the latest test . They were launched from North Korea 's east and landed in the waters that separate the peninsula from Japan .
As NPR 's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul , the U.S. has downplayed the recent spate of launches , with President Trump calling them `` very standard , '' and Washington arguing that the tests of short-range weapons do n't necessarily get in the way of resuming talks with Pyongyang aimed at ending the country 's nuclear weapons program .
Nonetheless , North Korea has indicated that its tests are meant to emphasize its displeasure over planned U.S.-South Korea military exercises scheduled for this month .

North Korea has reportedly conducted a third test launch in just over a week, firing what appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles, according to South Korean officials.

The presidential office in Seoul said the South Korean and U.S. militaries believe the test involved short-range ballistic missiles. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that they flew about 137 miles and reached an altitude of 15 miles, traveling at the hypersonic speed of Mach 6.9.

Last week, North Korea is thought to have tested a pair of KN-23 missiles, based on Russia's SS-26 Iskander. As NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reported in May, such a weapon presents a challenge to missile defenses in South Korea. Defense analysts say the solid-fuel missile is highly mobile and uses its speed and erratic flight path to evade interception.

On Wednesday, the North conducted a second test, claiming later that it was of a ""newly developed"" type of tactical missile, apparently for use against ground forces.

South Korea's presidential office said it needed to conduct further analysis to determine exactly what type of projectiles were involved in the latest test. They were launched from North Korea's east and landed in the waters that separate the peninsula from Japan.

As NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul, the U.S. has downplayed the recent spate of launches, with President Trump calling them ""very standard,"" and Washington arguing that the tests of short-range weapons don't necessarily get in the way of resuming talks with Pyongyang aimed at ending the country's nuclear weapons program.

Nonetheless, North Korea has indicated that its tests are meant to emphasize its displeasure over planned U.S.-South Korea military exercises scheduled for this month.

What happens next?

By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent

China is key but it is a conflicted party. On the one hand it does not want to see a nuclear-armed North Korea and it has made its view clear to Pyongyang on many occasions.

However, it does not want to see the North Korean regime swept away. This would result in millions of refugees flooding into China and would probably result in a unified Korea very much in the US orbit. This is seen in Beijing as worse than having a difficult nuclear neighbour.

If China were to take the view that the coincidence of a rapidly advancing North Korean nuclear programme and the uncertainties of the Trump administration's diplomatic capabilities means that there is a very real risk of misunderstanding and catastrophe, then maybe it might bring much greater pressure to bear on Pyongyang.

North Korea is a very isolated country and China is both its major ally and economic prop. There is a lot more that China can do. North Korea's recent testing has been as much an embarrassment to China as it has angered the US. But the Chinese have a difficult diplomatic calculation to make.

Full version of analysis

What other sanctions remain?

Last month, the Security Council voted unanimously to ban North Korean exports and limit investments in the country.

Ms Haley did not spell out what additional measures might be taken but diplomats have suggested an oil embargo would have a crippling effect.

There could also be a ban on the North's national airline, curbs on North Koreans working abroad, and asset freezes and travel bans on officials.

How big was the latest test?

It was North Korea's sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date. The US Geological Survey recorded a resulting tremor at 6.3 magnitude.

Trump last week said he would meet face to face with Kim after a South Korean delegation met with the North Korean leader and said Pyongyang wants to begin discussions with the United States about halting nuclear tests.

The summit announcement follows a year of tough rhetoric from Trump on North Korea, which the president vowed to destroy should the Asian nation provoke the United States.

CIA Director Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoProtests serve as backdrop to Erdoğan's visit to White House Chris Wallace: Taylor testimony 'very damaging to President Trump' The Hill's 12:30 Report: Democrats open televised impeachment hearings MORE described the United States as being in a strong negotiating position to denuclearize North Korea.

“This administration has its eyes wide open and the whole time this conversation takes place the pressure will continue to mount on North Korea,” Pompeo told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

“There is no relief in sight until the president gets the objective that he has set forth consistently during his entire time in office.”

But some Republican lawmakers are expressing caution on North Korea amid the country’s past threats to the United States. A group of GOP senators last week in a letter to Trump called for the administration to keep pressure on Pyongyang as it evaluated future discussions.

One of those senators, Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonOvernight Health Care: Trump officials making changes to drug pricing proposal | House panel advances flavored e-cig ban | Senators press FDA tobacco chief on vaping ban Why Republicans are afraid to call a key witness in the impeachment inquiry Lindsey Graham basks in the impeachment spotlight MORE (R-Wis.), on Sunday warned that the United States should “not be Charlie Brown to North Korea's Lucy.”

“What we can't do is do what we did with Iran and let off the pressure and then just watch the behavior go in the wrong direction,” Johnson told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“So, again, it's just incredibly important to keep — I would ratchet up the sanctions against North Korea until they actually do, in a verifiable fashion, denuclearize.”

Another Republican senator expressed skepticism that the Trump administration is near that goal.

“I don't think anybody really believes that North Korea is prepared to denuclearize. Now, maybe a freeze where they say, ‘All right. We are a nuclear power. Let's get some security guarantees,’ ” Sen. Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeLindsey Graham basks in the impeachment spotlight Kelly, McSally virtually tied in Arizona Senate race: poll The Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by Nareit — White House cheers Republicans for storming impeachment hearing MORE (R-Ariz.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

He added there are ""dozens and dozens of meetings, high-level meetings,"" that need to happen before the summit.

""The important thing is the diplomatic work that has to go in before such a meeting,"" he said. ""A meeting like that would be kind of an afterthought after things are negotiated. Here it looks as if, you know, that's kind of the opening gambit. And that's a little worrisome.""

Democrats raised concerns about whether Trump has the resources for that kind of complex, behind-the-scenes diplomacy due to a State Department that is short of senior staff after Trump's first year in office.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenWarren goes local in race to build 2020 movement 2020 Democrats make play for veterans' votes 2020 Dems put focus on stemming veteran suicides MORE (D-Mass.) noted that the agency lacks an assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.

“I am very worried that he's going to go into these negotiations and be taken advantage of,"" Warren told CNN’s “State of the Union"" on Sunday, while adding she wants the president ""to succeed"" in negotiations.

Warren also argued in a separate appearance on Fox News Sunday that a meeting between Kim and a U.S. president is “the big prize” for North Korea because the talks legitimize the government and its nuclear program.

A former adviser to President Obama on Sunday also said the Trump administration needs more diplomats in this situation.

""They have no ambassador to Seoul. The person who was in charge of North Korean negotiations just left the State Department,"" Ben Rhodes told ABC's Jonathan Karl on ""This Week.""

""When you're in a negotiation as complex as a North Korean nuclear program, and a situation that is volatile as the Korean Peninsula, you need diplomats,"" he said.

But the Trump administration says the planned summit is the culmination of a diplomatic effort.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinNew book questions Harris's record on big banks On The Money: US paid record .1B in tariffs in September | Dems ramp up oversight of 'opportunity zones' | Judge hints at letting House lawsuit over Trump tax returns proceed Democrats ramp up oversight efforts over 'opportunity zone' incentive MORE argued during a morning show appearance that U.S. economic sanctions have brought North Korea to the table.

“So now we have a situation where the president is using diplomacy, but we’re not removing the maximum pressure campaign. That’s the big difference here,” Mnuchin told NBC’s Chuck Todd.

“The sanctions are staying on, the defense posture is staying the same as it is, so the president is going to sit down and see if he can cut a deal,"" he continued.

Still, lawmakers overall appear more cautious in celebrating the meeting as a sign of change.

Sen. Cory Gardner Cory Scott GardnerTariffs threaten 1.5M jobs: Study This week: House kicks off public phase of impeachment inquiry Progressive veterans group launches campaign labeling Trump as a 'national security threat' MORE (R-Colo.), who pressed the Trump administration to increase pressure on Pyongyang ahead of last year’s inauguration, said Sunday that he would like to see more from North Korea before Trump and Kim meet.

“Well I'd like to see some concrete steps, more than just a cessation of testing because you can still do computer modeling,” he told CBS.

The administration appears to be pushing ahead with the meeting, regardless of concerns on both sides of the aisle.

North Korea’s nuclear ambitions plagued the Trump administration’s first year in the White House, as Pyongyang conducted multiple missile tests in 2017.

In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly last year, Trump said he would “totally destroy North Korea” if it threatened the United States. Meanwhile, the president has exchanged personal insults with Kim, whom he has called a ""Rocket Man” on “a suicide mission.”

While administration officials on Sunday did not provide details on a meeting, the South Korean national security adviser Chung Eui-Yong said last week that Trump agreed to meet with Kim by May.

Deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah on Sunday said ""nothing is being ruled out"" in the planning, including the possibility of Kim coming to the White House.

""I have no announcement, it's a time and a place to be determined,"" Shah told ABC's Jonathan Karl on ""This Week.""",www.thehill.com,center,eWUs2EPb5j39Nm65

USA TODAY

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the United Nations Security Council on Friday to impose new sanctions against North Korea to stop its nuclear threat, warning that failure to act would be ""catastrophic.""

Tillerson said the world community needs to increase North Korea's financial isolation and tighten sanctions already in place. He said the U.S. would not hesitate to sanction other countries that support North Korea's illegal efforts to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, adding that he looked forward to further action by China, North Korea's patron.

Hours later, North Korean ballistic missile test failed on takeoff early Saturday, the second straight failure this month, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.

President Trump told Reuters Thursday that a ""major, major conflict"" with North Korea is a possibility for the U.S., but the White House is trying to come up with diplomatic solutions.

Here are some of those possible solutions:

Report: Trump warns of 'major, major conflict' with North Korea

Enforce current sanctions

Tighten enforcement of existing U.N. Security Council sanctions. The latest sanctions resolution passed by world powers in November was touted as the strongest ever, but the State Department and analysts say those measures have yet to be fully enforced.

The sanctions limit North Korea’s sale of conventional weapons, coal and iron ore, especially if revenue would benefit its nuclear or ballistic missile programs.

“China and other countries in Africa and Southeast Asia are plainly not implementing all these sanctions,” said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank in Washington.

Some of those countries need help from the West to screen for complicated financial arrangements designed to hide North Korean involvement, and others are simply not interested in implementing the sanctions because they benefit from cut-rate North Korean pricing, Ruggiero said.

UN security council strengthens North Korea sanctions

Stop Chinese missile carriers

The U.S. could start publicly calling out companies involved in North Korea's weapons programs, such as two Chinese trucking companies that provided or helped build large vehicles that North Korea uses to transport, erect and launch its missiles, said Richard Fisher, a China and Korea analyst at the International Assessment and Strategy Center.

The China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and the China National Heavy Duty Truck Group or Sinotruk, have provided trucks or large missile carriers that North Korea uses to transport missiles aimed at U.S. forces in Asia, Fisher said. The vehicles were displayed in an April 15 military parade, where North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s forces showed off their capabilities and intentions to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles able to reach U.S. cities.

""In order for those trucks to carry the missile, the missile company has to be involved,"" Fisher said. ""We should have no problem demanding that the Chinese take back all these large 16-wheel transporter erector launchers.""

Expose Beijing's support

U.S. intelligence officials could expose companies involved in helping North Korea obtain the capacity to produce lithium-6, a substance that is crucial for the development of thermo-nuclear weapons — hydrogen bombs and boosted atomic bombs — that produce a far more powerful blast than mere atomic bombs, Fisher said.

According to a March 17 report by the Institute for Science and International Security, citing government sources, North Korea arranged in 2012 to purchase industrial equipment and materials in China, including mercury and lithium hydroxide. Those substances have civilian as well as military uses, but together indicate an effort to produce lithium 6 for weapons, according to the ISIS report.

That means the Chinese government approved the transfer of technology to manufacture thermonuclear weapons to North Korea, Fisher said.

“It’s simply inconceivable that the Chinese government would have allowed the transfer of this kind of technology without multi-level approval up to the Chinese Communist Party politburo,” he said. “Only when these leaders are identified and given the international opprobrium they deserve will they even bother to consider changing their policies.”

Impose tougher U.N. sanctions

Tillerson is exploring whether Security Council members are willing to tighten North Korea sanctions even more, according to the State Department.

The November Security Council sanctions resolution “calls upon” the international community to “exercise vigilance” over North Korean activities that produce revenue for the regime and its weapons program. Among these are workers sent by North Korea abroad to earn hard currency used for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, according to the Security Council.

This “slave labor,” Ruggiero said, has been used to build World Cup facilities in Qatar and St. Petersburg, Russia, in the Russian logging industry, and in Kuwait, and generates $500 million annually for North Korea.

Tillerson should seek a change to the resolution's permissive language to an outright ban, Ruggiero said. He should seek a new resolution that cuts off North Korea’s access to revenue streams from laborers, and to counter illicit activities such as cyber bank heists and drug trafficking, Ruggiero said.

15 fascinating facts about mysterious North Korea

Impose U.S.-coalition sanctions

The U.S. could bypass the Security Council and impose its own sanctions. The Trump administration could develop a multi-national coalition to cut off revenue to the North Korean government, like the Obama administration did to counter Iran’s nuclear weapons program.

The U.S. and its allies should issue arrest warrants for senior company officers in China and other countries who participate in military assistance programs that benefit North Korea, and seize their assets, Fisher said.

They could start with targeting individuals, companies and financial institutions who did business with the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Company, a Chinese firm named in U.S. sanctions issued in September, or citizens of China, Russia, Vietnam and Cuba who worked with North Koreans named in sanctions issued on March 31. The two sets of sanctions targeted Chinese and North Koreans alleged to have raised money to fund illicit North Korean proliferation activities.

""The Dandong Hongxiang company (and four of its officers) is sanctioned, but 22 front companies are not and no banks were sanctioned in the recent action,"" Ruggiero said.

Cut access to U.S. banks

The U.S. Treasury could cut off access to the U.S. financial system for banks, companies and individuals anywhere in the world who do business with North Korean entities. That would shut down North Korea’s missile and conventional weapons sales, which represent 40% of the nation’s economy, said Bruce Bechtol, a political science professor at Angelo State University in Texas and an expert on North Korea.

A financial dragnet that covers all foreign intermediaries working on North Korea’s behalf, including banks involved in money laundering, front companies and foreign individuals who establish bank accounts in return for financial kickbacks “would bring North Korea to its knees,” Bechtol said.",www.usatoday.com,center,TgmzMgn2RGDerXZc

Missile and launch components have been moved to the east coast of North Korea in the `` last few days , '' a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the information told CNN Thursday .
The apparent deployment comes amid further threatening statements by North Korea and heightened tensions in the region -- a situation that `` does not need to get hotter , '' a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said .
The move of the missile and launch equipment could mean that Pyongyang , which unleashed another round of scathing rhetoric accusing the United States of pushing the region to the `` brink of war , '' may be planning a missile launch soon .
The components , the official said , are consistent with those of a Musudan missile , which has a 2,500-mile range , meaning it could threaten South Korea , Japan and Southeast Asia .
The United States has been looking for a hidden North Korean east coast launch site or mobile launchers , a concern because a launch from the east coast would go over Japan , the official said .

`` The U.S. imperialists have pursued ceaseless war moves since their occupation of South Korea , creating a touch-and-go situation several times .

`` Cutting-edge weapons are not a monopoly of the U.S. and gone are the days never to return when it could invade other countries with nukes as it pleased , '' the statement said . `` The U.S. and the South Korean warmongers had better stop their rash actions , deeply aware of the gravity of the prevailing situation .

SEOUL — Kim Jong Un has invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in to North Korea for talks in the first major development to stem from North Korea's participation in the Olympics, Moon's office announced Saturday.

The invitation was delivered by Kim Yo Jong, the sister of the North Korean leader, when she and other members of the North Korean delegation ate lunch with Moon at the presidential palace. Kim Yo Jong arrived here Friday as part of a delegation to the Olympics.

The invitation is a victory for Moon who urged North Korea to participate in the Olympics in the hopes it could lead to broader talks and ease tensions on the Korean peninsula.

It was the first time a member of North Korea's ruling family ever visited the presidential palace, called the Blue House.

It is not clear whether the talks will lead to a significant reduction in tensions. North Korea has tested a record number of missiles last year and has shown no interest in abandoning the country's nuclear program.

The country has had a history of taking provocative acts and agreeing to talks that lead nowhere.

In a statement, Moon said he planned to set the conditions to allow the talks to happen. He also urged North Korea to engage in talks with the United States.

Tensions between the U.S and North Korea intensified during the past year, raising worries of armed conflict on the peninsula.

President Trump has traded insults with North Korea's leader and has led efforts to slap sanctions on the country for its refusal to yield to international pressure to halt its nuclear weapons program.

Talks between North and South Korean leaders have happened in the past without yielding any significant changes in North Korea's behavior.

The last summit between leaders of the two Koreas occurred in 2007 when South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun and Kim Jong-il met in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital.

The presence of Kim Yo Jong as part of the delegation to the Olympics led to speculation that she might have been sent because, as a close relative of the North Korean leader, she would be in a position to deliver a personal message to Moon.

Her presence overshadowed the nominal head of the delegation, Kim Yong Nam, the aging head of the North Korean Parliament.

“She’s a pretty important person in the regime,” said Michael Madden, an analyst at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “No one else in leadership can bring messages directly to Kim Jong Un.”

Her muted style stands in stark contrast to Kim Jong Un, whose eccentric style and fiery rhetoric has shaped the image of North Korea.

“It helps that she also appears dynamic and photogenic,” he said.

Her exact role in the regime is unclear, but her job is similar to a chief of staff and she regularly reviews the statements and speeches issued by her brother.

Kim Yo Jong, 30, was elected to the politburo last year, but remains little known outside North Korea and has not appeared much in public until now.

“She is a bit of a mystery figure,” Madden said.

Under the watchful eyes of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea says it conducted an underwater test-firing of a submarine ballistic missile, the Korean Central News Agency reported Saturday.

The test ""proved and confirmed that the ballistic missile fire from the submarine fully met the requirements of the latest military science and technology,"" KCNA said.

The unidentified sources tell the news agency that the North has succeeded in installing a missile launcher onto the submarine after conducting a series of experiments on shore as well as underwater.

Ministry officials have previously said that North Korea has about 70 submarines and appears to be mainly imitating Russian designs in its efforts to develop a system for submarine-launched missiles. North Korea is believed to have obtained several of the Soviet Navy's retired Golf-class ballistic missile submarines in the mid-1990s.

The move is seen as part of efforts by North Korea to equip its missiles with miniaturized nuclear bombs.

If so, that would mean the Pyongyang has developed a naval strike capability that is at least a decade ahead of the South, the Yonghap news agency says, quoting unidentified ""North Korea watchers.""

The website 38 North, operated by the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said in January that such capability posed a potential new threat to South Korea, Japan and U.S. bases in East Asia, although North Korea's submarines tend to be old and would be vulnerable to attack.

The South Korean navy has just laid out a plan to build six 3,000-ton submarines equipped with vertical missile launchers between 2027 and 2030, the South Korean agency says.

War, in other words, may not be imminent. But it’s important to know exactly how bloody one would be.

North Koreans see their rulers as literal gods

It’s worth highlighting the simple reason Chun used religious language to describe why North Korean soldiers would fight so aggressively: They revere members of the Kim family, who have led the country for decades, as gods.

The first leader was Kim Jong Un’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, who was in power from 1948 to 1994. He is still known today as the “Great Leader” and the “Eternal President,” and monuments glorifying his reign are everywhere in the country.

When Kim died at the age of 82, the Korean Central News Agency, the country’s state-run news organization, published a glowing seven-page announcement that said “he turned our country, where age-old backwardness and poverty had prevailed, into a powerful Socialist country, independent, self-supporting and self-reliant.” He was, as the news agency concluded, the “sun of the nation.”

North Korean propaganda highlights the racial purity of the country and also recalls how it endured under foreign occupation over decades. Songs are written about these themes, and colorful posters make their way even into rural areas hundreds of miles away from the capital.

Since Kim Il Sung’s death in 1994, his son and grandson, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un, respectively, have carried on his legacy. However, the current Kim has made some economic reforms and put much more emphasis on improving the nuclear and missile programs. Still, they purposely demonstrate in their own propaganda how closely they to hew to Kim Il Sung’s style of governance.

Kim Jong Un even goes out of his way to look as much like his grandfather as he possibly can in hopes that he will inspire the same admiration his grandfather did.

`` We will be meeting and we 'll see if anything positive happens , '' he added .
It was unclear if Trump was joking or if formal U.S.-North Korea talks were imminent .
On Sunday , a senior U.S. administration official said Trump did not hear directly from North Korea that the country would like to start talks . The information was relayed to the administration by South Korea , the official said .
`` I wo n't rule out direct talks with Kim Jong Un . I just wo n't , '' Trump said on Saturday , referring to North Korea 's leader .

""Now we are talking and they, by the way, called up a couple of days ago. They said that 'we would like to talk.' And I said 'So would we, but you have to denuke, you have to denuke,'"" Trump told attendees at the annual Gridiron Club dinner.

""We will be meeting and we'll see if anything positive happens,"" he added.

It was unclear if Trump was joking or if formal U.S.-North Korea talks were imminent.

On Sunday, a senior U.S. administration official said Trump did not hear directly from North Korea that the country would like to start talks. The information was relayed to the administration by South Korea, the official said.

""I won't rule out direct talks with Kim Jong Un. I just won't,"" Trump said on Saturday, referring to North Korea's leader.

Trump did, however, make a joke at his own expense.

Haggard: As a result, some of the rhetoric could be driven by domestic politics

March brought us a series of what pundits like to call "" provocations "" by North Korea. On closer inspection, Pyongyang has opted for rhetoric over actual military actions.

While Kim Jong Un's pursuit of nuclear and missile capability remains worrisome, escalating signals of resolve could suggest nervousness as much as strength.

So, is the regime in trouble?

The first round of saber-rattling came as the U.N. Security Council deliberated on a new sanctions resolution after North Korea's satellite launch in December and its third nuclear test in February. The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a party organ dealing with North-South relations began putting out public statements in an effort to chip away at the institutions of the armistice, such as military hot lines and the stationing of a North Korean military mission in Panmunjom.

Is anything really different as a result of this ""re-withdrawal""? It doesn't seem like it.

The U.S. State Department fired back Wednesday , saying the punishment does n't fit the alleged crime .
The sentence against University of Virginia student Otto Frederick Warmbier is `` unduly harsh , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said , calling for his release .
The United States urges North Korea `` to pardon him and to grant him special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds , '' Toner said .
Warmbier had traveled to Pyongyang on a trip organized by Young Pioneer Tours , a China-based travel company . He was arrested on January 2 , 2016 , as he was about to board a plane to leave the country , on the charge of committing a hostile act against the state .
The North Korean government alleged that Warmbier was encouraged to commit the `` hostile act '' by a purported member of a church in his home state of Ohio , a secretive university organization and even the CIA .
In court Wednesday , North Korean officials presented fingerprints , photos of a political banner and surveillance images -- proof , they said , that Warmbier committed crimes against the regime .
`` My brother and my sister need me , '' he said . `` I beg that you see that I am only human , how I have made the worst mistake of my life . ''
Greg Scarlatoui , executive director for the Committee for Humans Rights in North Korea said he may be forced to work in agriculture , which happened with other American prisoners .
`` He may spend his day planting apple trees . It will be fairly grueling forced labor , '' Scarlatoui said .
In an emotional press conference last month , Warmbier admitted to attempting to steal a banner with a political slogan from his hotel in the North Korean capital . It is not known whether Warmbier made the admission under duress .
Appearing to read from a statement , he said : `` I committed the crime of taking down a political slogan from the staff holding area of the Yanggakdo International Hotel . ''
`` I never , never should have allowed myself to be lured by the United States administration to commit a crime in this country , '' he said tearfully as he begged for forgiveness .
`` I wish that the United States administration never manipulate people like myself in the future to commit crimes against foreign countries . I entirely beg you , the people and government of the DPRK , for your forgiveness . Please ! I made the worst mistake of my life ! ''
The tour company he traveled with said on its website it is aware of his sentencing and that it should `` be viewed in similar context of previous cases of Americans being sentenced '' in North Korea .
On Wednesday , the State Department spokesman accused North Korea of politicizing the arrests of U.S. citizens , saying , `` It 's increasingly clear from its very public treatment of these cases . ''
Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller are the most recent American detainees whom North Korea has released .
Both were accused of perpetrating `` hostile acts '' against North Korea ; Miller spent less than a year in custody after being sentenced to six years of hard labor , and Bae , facing a 15-year sentence , was held for nearly two years .
Former New Mexico Gov . Bill Richardson told The New York Times he met with two North Korean diplomats on Tuesday to lobby for Warmbier 's release .
Richardson is a longtime diplomat and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .
Ohio Gov . John Kasich has also been pushing behind the scenes for Warmbier 's release , an aid to the governor told CNN .
Analysts say it 's possible Warmbier will be released at some point , but very likely Kim Jong Un 's regime could use the student as leverage -- and will want a VIP from the United States to travel to North Korea to get him .
Warmbier was on the dean 's list at the University of Virginia , CNN affiliate WCPO-TV reported .
He was also part of a student organization that `` trains young professionals for careers in investment management and other functions within the financial markets , '' according to the group 's website .
Kieren Thomas , a friend of Warmbier 's younger brother , told CNN in January that the detained student was a star soccer player in high school , outgoing and loved to travel to out-of-the-way places .
`` Otto was one of the smartest guys I 've ever met , '' Thomas said . `` I 've never met a person that had a bad thing to say about him . ''

The U.S. State Department fired back Wednesday, saying the punishment doesn't fit the alleged crime.

The sentence against University of Virginia student Otto Frederick Warmbier is ""unduly harsh,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, calling for his release.

The United States urges North Korea ""to pardon him and to grant him special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds,"" Toner said.

Trial reportedly lasted one hour

Warmbier had traveled to Pyongyang on a trip organized by Young Pioneer Tours, a China-based travel company. He was arrested on January 2, 2016 , as he was about to board a plane to leave the country, on the charge of committing a hostile act against the state.

The North Korean government alleged that Warmbier was encouraged to commit the ""hostile act"" by a purported member of a church in his home state of Ohio, a secretive university organization and even the CIA.

In court Wednesday, North Korean officials presented fingerprints, photos of a political banner and surveillance images -- proof, they said, that Warmbier committed crimes against the regime.

The 21-year-old student pleaded for mercy.

""My brother and my sister need me,"" he said. ""I beg that you see that I am only human, how I have made the worst mistake of my life.""

Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor.

Greg Scarlatoui, executive director for the Committee for Humans Rights in North Korea said he may be forced to work in agriculture, which happened with other American prisoners.

""He may spend his day planting apple trees. It will be fairly grueling forced labor,"" Scarlatoui said.

Warmbier's family declined to comment on his case.

Emotional video confession

In an emotional press conference last month, Warmbier admitted to attempting to steal a banner with a political slogan from his hotel in the North Korean capital. It is not known whether Warmbier made the admission under duress.

Appearing to read from a statement, he said: ""I committed the crime of taking down a political slogan from the staff holding area of the Yanggakdo International Hotel.""

Warmbier tearfully confesses to ""hostile acts"" last month.

""I never, never should have allowed myself to be lured by the United States administration to commit a crime in this country,"" he said tearfully as he begged for forgiveness.

""I wish that the United States administration never manipulate people like myself in the future to commit crimes against foreign countries. I entirely beg you, the people and government of the DPRK, for your forgiveness. Please! I made the worst mistake of my life!""

State Department: North Korea is politicizing arrests

The tour company he traveled with said on its website it is aware of his sentencing and that it should ""be viewed in similar context of previous cases of Americans being sentenced"" in North Korea.

On Wednesday, the State Department spokesman accused North Korea of politicizing the arrests of U.S. citizens, saying, ""It's increasingly clear from its very public treatment of these cases.""

Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller are the most recent American detainees whom North Korea has released.

Both were accused of perpetrating ""hostile acts"" against North Korea; Miller spent less than a year in custody after being sentenced to six years of hard labor, and Bae, facing a 15-year sentence, was held for nearly two years.

The pair secured their freedom in late 2014.

Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson told The New York Times he met with two North Korean diplomats on Tuesday to lobby for Warmbier's release.

Richardson is a longtime diplomat and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich has also been pushing behind the scenes for Warmbier's release, an aid to the governor told CNN.

Analysts say it's possible Warmbier will be released at some point, but very likely Kim Jong Un's regime could use the student as leverage -- and will want a VIP from the United States to travel to North Korea to get him.

Dean's list student, star soccer player

Warmbier was on the dean's list at the University of Virginia, CNN affiliate WCPO-TV reported.

He was also part of a student organization that ""trains young professionals for careers in investment management and other functions within the financial markets,"" according to the group's website.

Kieren Thomas, a friend of Warmbier's younger brother, told CNN in January that the detained student was a star soccer player in high school, outgoing and loved to travel to out-of-the-way places.

""Otto was one of the smartest guys I've ever met,"" Thomas said. ""I've never met a person that had a bad thing to say about him.""

Heightened tensions

Tensions have been particularly fraught on the Korean Peninsula in recent weeks.

State media earlier said that the might of the party ""is growing stronger under the seasoned guidance of Marshal Kim Jong Un.""

Kim, 31, who was last seen in public attending a concert on Sept. 3rd, had been seen earlier walking with a limp.

But Reuters reported Friday that Kim was still in firm control of his government, according to a source with access to the secretive North's leadership. That source suggested Kim has been sidelined with a leg injury after taking part in a military drill.

One U.S. official said it is believed any launch this time would be a test .
The activity is consistent with a Musudan missile , the official said .
The Musudan is based on a Soviet-era system and has a 2,500-mile ( 4,000-kilometer ) range that can threaten South Korea , Japan and Southeast Asia , but not U.S. forces based on Guam .
As a vital ally to South Korea since the Korean war in the 1950s , the United States has pledged military backing to Seoul in the event of an attack by North Korea .
In addition , North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons technology , raising concerns of rapid proliferation in the region and even a possible nuclear strike by Pyongyang .
The fraught situation on the Korean Peninsula stems from the North 's latest long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February .
In response , the United States helped bring tougher U.N. sanctions on North Korea and took part in joint military exercises with South Korea , prompting Kim Jong Un 's government to ratchet up its threats in recent weeks .
That caused the United States to display its military strength in the annual drills taking place now , flying B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons , as well as Cold War-era B-52s and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over South Korea .
On Thursday , a North Korean army official warned that `` the moment of explosion is approaching fast . ''
`` No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow , '' said the spokesman for the General Staff of the North 's Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) .
`` The responsibility for this grave situation entirely rests with the U.S. administration and military warmongers keen to encroach upon the DPRK 's sovereignty and bring down its dignified social system with brigandish logic , '' the KPA spokesman added in a statement published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) .
A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said Thursday that the United States continues to closely monitor the situation .
`` Threats and provocative actions will not bring North Korea the security , international respect , and economic development it seeks , '' said the NSC spokeswoman , Caitlin Hayden . `` We will continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama 's call to choose the path of peace and come into compliance with its international obligations .

Earlier , a Defense Department official told CNN that from a communications point of view , `` we are trying to turn the volume down '' on U.S. rhetoric about North Korea . The official , speaking on condition of not being identified , said the change referred to public statements by the Obama administration instead of how U.S. military hardware were being deployed in the region .
According to the official , some Pentagon officials were surprised at how U.S. news releases and statements on North Korea were generating world headlines and therefore provoking a Pyongyang response .
`` We are absolutely trying to ratchet back the rhetoric , '' the official said . `` We become part of the cycle . We allowed that to happen . ''
At the State Department , spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Thursday the United States needed to take the defensive steps it did in view of North Korea 's threats , but she focused on a diplomatic solution available if Pyongyang changed its behavior .
`` It was the ratcheting up of tensions on the DPRK side that caused us to need to shore up our own defense posture . We have done that , '' Nuland said . `` But we have also been saying all the way through that this does not need to get hotter , that we can change course here if the DPRK will begin to come back into compliance with its international obligations , will begin to cool things down , take a pause . ''
To Bill Richardson , the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , the administration 's response so far has been `` appropriate -- cool , calm , but at the same time putting our military resources ready in case there 's an emergency . ''
He told CNN on Thursday that a North Korean military attack on U.S. interests would be `` suicidal , '' adding : `` That 's not going to happen . ''
Diplomacy should be the `` end game '' for the administration 's policy regarding North Korea , said Richardson , one of the few U.S. politicians to have visited the country .
`` I think the administration 's response does make sense in the sense that you do n't want to continue this huge rhetoric and at the same time provoke some kind of incident , '' Richardson said . `` The danger is not a war with the United States or South Korea , I think . The danger is some kind of military altercation in the Yellow Sea , a naval skirmish of some kind . ''
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to travel to South Korea , China and Japan this month to meet with his counterparts there .
Previously , the Obama administration established a `` playbook '' of pre-scripted actions and responses to the last several weeks of North Korean rhetoric and provocations , an administration official said Thursday .
The scripted actions included an increased show of U.S. military force -- such as the flying of B-2 bombers -- during the annual U.S.-South Korea military exercise , the Foal Eagle .
`` Eyebrows started to go up when it was clear Foal Eagle was going to be protected from the budget cuts of sequestration , '' the official said , referring to the forced federal spending cuts that went into effect in March .
The playbook planning began under former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta but was picked up and supported strongly by his successor , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel , the official said .
Details of the playbook were first reported by the Wall Street Journal . The administration official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation .
However , some of the U.S. military 's reactions to Pyongyang 's saber-rattling were not part of the playbook planning .
Instead , they arose from concerns about what North Korea has planned as the U.S.-South Korean exercise conclude , the administration official said .
For example , the deployment of ballistic missile defenses closer to North Korea and a land-based missile-intercept system to Guam were ordered in recent days when U.S. intelligence began to gather information that North Korea might be planning additional missile launches .
U.S. officials have publicly stressed that the American military moves were also meant to assure the South Koreans that they have Washington 's full support .
`` What I can tell you is that our response and the mix of assets we have applied to our responses is prudent , logical and measured , '' Pentagon spokesman George Little said earlier this week .
`` We are in the midst right now of -- of very important annual exercises that we regularly conduct with the South Koreans , and these exercises are about alliance assurance . They 're first and foremost about showing the South Koreans and showing our other allies in the region , including the Japanese , that we are ready to defend them in the wake of threats . ''
When asked by CNN earlier this week about the `` message '' the United States was trying to send to North Korea , Little said it was the North Koreans who are being provocative .
`` The North Koreans -- even before those exercises started -- had undertaken provocative steps , and they 've conducted underground nuclear tests , they 've conducted missile tests outside their international obligations . So they have a track record now over the past few months of provocative behavior , '' he said .
`` We are in the business of ensuring our South Korean allies that we will help defend them in the face of threats , '' Little said in response . `` So I do n't think it 's a contradiction . I think that North Koreans have engaged in certain actions and have said things that are provocative . We are looking for the temperature to be taken down on the Korean Peninsula . ''
Hagel hinted at risks in reacting to North Korea , calling the tensions a `` complicated , combustible situation '' that could `` explode into a worse situation . ''
`` It only takes being wrong once . And I do n't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once . So we will continue to take these threats seriously . I hope the North will ratchet this very dangerous rhetoric down , '' Hagel said Wednesday .
`` But they 've got to be a responsible member of the world community . And you do n't achieve that responsibility and peace and prosperity by making nuclear threats and taking very provocative actions .

A 'complicated, combustible situation'

U.S. officials have publicly stressed that the American military moves were also meant to assure the South Koreans that they have Washington's full support.

""What I can tell you is that our response and the mix of assets we have applied to our responses is prudent, logical and measured,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said earlier this week.

""It only takes being wrong once. And I don't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once. So we will continue to take these threats seriously. I hope the North will ratchet this very dangerous rhetoric down,"" Hagel said Wednesday.

The Washington Post ’ s Shane Harris , Carol D. Leonnig , Greg Jaffe , and David Nakamura broke the news about the top-secret meeting late Tuesday night . Trump had hinted at Pompeo ’ s milestone visit earlier on Tuesday , saying at Mar-a-Lago — where he ’ s hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — that the US was engaging with North Korea at “ directly ” at “ extremely high levels. ” Trump added : “ I really believe there ’ s a lot of goodwill . A lot of good things are happening . ”
Trump ’ s statement was big news , though it was tough to pin down what exactly the president was referring to in his remarks .

The Washington Post’s Shane Harris, Carol D. Leonnig, Greg Jaffe, and David Nakamura broke the news about the top-secret meeting late Tuesday night. Trump had hinted at Pompeo’s milestone visit earlier on Tuesday, saying at Mar-a-Lago — where he’s hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — that the US was engaging with North Korea at “directly” at “extremely high levels.” Trump added: “I really believe there’s a lot of goodwill. A lot of good things are happening.”

Trump’s statement was big news, though it was tough to pin down what exactly the president was referring to in his remarks. As Vox’s Alex Ward wrote, “direct talks at an ‘extremely high level,’ as Trump says are now happening, are rare. That’s why it’s hard to know if the US and North Korea are actually speaking at a higher level than normal, or through an already established channel.”

Three American detainees being released from North Korea

Their release comes as Mr. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un prepare to hold a summit -- possibly within weeks. Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a historic meeting in the Demilitarized Zone on April 27, agreeing to work toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and discussing plans to declare a formal end to the Korean War.

Very little is known about why the three men were actually detained by North Korea, or what conditions they faced in custody. Below is a brief summary of what information was made available on the three men.

Kim Dong Chul

Kim, a South Korean-born U.S. citizen, has been held the longest. The former Virginia resident was sentenced in April 2016 to 10 years in prison with hard labor after being convicted of espionage.

He reportedly ran a trade and hotel service company in Rason, a special economic zone on North Korea's border with Russia.

Kim Hak Song

Kim worked in agricultural development at an experimental farm run by the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. The university is the only privately funded college in North Korea and was founded in 2010 with donations from Christian groups. He was detained last May for alleged anti-state activities.

The North's official Korean Central News Agency announced that Kim was detained and that ""a relevant institution is now conducting detailed investigation into his crimes.""

He worked at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology.

Tony Kim

Tony Kim, 59, who also uses the name Kim Sang-duk, was detained a year ago at the Pyongyang airport. He had been teaching at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, as had Kim Hak Song.

He was accused of committing unspecified criminal acts intended to overthrow the government. The North has not said whether the two cases of staff at the university are connected.

In April 2017, the chancellor of the university said Kim taught accounting at the university for about a month and previously taught at a university in China. He said he was informed that the detention had ""nothing to do"" with Kim's work at the university, but he did not know anything further.

North Korea only officially confirmed the detention of Kim in May 2017.

Kim's son, Sol Kim, told CBS News he was stunned by his father's detention. ""I asked myself why, what happened, what is the reason, lots of different thoughts went through my head. Will I see him again?"" he said. ""Part of me really thought he did not do anything wrong, he won't be held very long.""

Lead up to release

There were unconfirmed reports that the detainees were moved last week from prisons to a hotel in or near the capital, Pyongyang. But asked on May 3 about their possible release, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders hedged, saying it ""would be an incredible sign of goodwill, and certainly a great statement for the North Koreans to make ahead of the summit and the discussions,"" but that she had no announcement at the time.

""We have been asking for the release of these detainees for this administration for 17 months,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. ""We'll talk about it again today. I think it'd be a great gesture if they would choose to do so.""

Pompeo secretly met with Kim in April while he was still director of the CIA. He was confirmed and sworn in as secretary of state on April 26 and quickly departed on his first foreign trip to Europe and the Middle East.

Bae's family has been pushing for his release due to his worsening health. The 46-year-old suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure and has kidney stones.

""My hands are numb and tingling, and it's difficult sleeping at night, and I was working in the field every day,"" Bae said.

U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae but to no avail.

""It is in your power to release my brother. You could do it today. Please do so. He has confessed to the crimes for which he has been charged, and he has served a longer detainment than any other American since the war,"" Chung said.

Miller: 'I deliberately committed my crime'

Dressed in a black turtleneck and often staring at the ground in his interview, Miller said he has admitted his guilt -- even though he won't learn of his charges until he goes to trial.

""But I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here,"" Miller said.

""And I deliberately committed my crime. I have already admitted my guilt and apologized to the government of the DPRK and I have been asking for forgiveness.""

When asked why he reportedly sought asylum in North Korea, Miller said he already discussed his motive during his investigation and that ""for the interview, it is not necessary.""

He expressed frustration that ""there's been no movement from my government.""

""The American government is known for having a strong policy of protecting its citizens, yet for my case there is still no movement,"" he said.

Fowle describes 'desperate situation'

North Korea announced Fowle's detention in June, saying he had violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism.""

""The charges are violations of DPRK law, which stems from me trying to leave a Bible,"" the 56-year-old told Ripley.

""It's a covert act and a violation of tourists rules. I've admitted my guilt to the government and signed a statement to that effect and requested forgiveness from the people and the government of the DPRK.""

The reporter noted that despite Warmbier ’ s brutal death , Trump has called Kim “ my friend ” and repeatedly boasted about their “ great relationship. ” The journalist then asked him , “ Have you in Singapore [ during the first Trump-Kim summit ] or here confronted Kim Jong Un about Otto Warmbier ’ s death , asked him to take responsibility , and what did he say to you ? ”
Trump confirmed that he had — but went on to say he takes Kim ’ s word for it that he had nothing to do with it .

The reporter noted that despite Warmbier’s brutal death, Trump has called Kim “my friend” and repeatedly boasted about their “great relationship.” The journalist then asked him, “Have you in Singapore [during the first Trump-Kim summit] or here confronted Kim Jong Un about Otto Warmbier’s death, asked him to take responsibility, and what did he say to you?”

Trump confirmed that he had — but went on to say he takes Kim’s word for it that he had nothing to do with it.

“I really believe something very bad happened to [Warmbier], and I don’t think that the top leadership knew about it,” Trump said. “I don’t believe that [Kim] would’ve allowed that to happen. It just wasn’t in his advantage to allow that to happen.”

Trump continued:

I did speak to [Kim about Warmbier]. He felt very badly. He knew the case very well, but he knew it later. And, you know, you got a lot of people — big country, lot of people. And in those prisons and those camps, you have a lot of people. And some really bad things happened to Otto. Some really, really bad things.

WOW -- Trump says he doesn't think Kim Jong Un is responsible for Otto Warmbier's death.

Trump, however, wasn’t even willing to go that far.

Trump has a history of believing tyrants

Trump’s comments about believing Kim when he says he had nothing to do with Warmbier’s death echo comments he’s made about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS).

north_korea,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/11/s-korea-n-korea-has-fired-its-long-range-rocket/,North Koreans celebrate launch of long-range rocket,2012-12-11,Hyung-Jin Kim,"PYONGYANG , North Korea ( AP ) — North Koreans danced in the streets of their capital Wednesday after the Pyongyang regime successfully fired a long-range rocket , defying international warnings and taking a big step forward in its quest to develop a nuclear-tipped missile .
The rocket launch will enhance the credentials of 20-something leader Kim Jong Un at home a year after he took power following the death of his father Kim Jong Il . It is also likely to bring fresh sanctions and other punishments from the U.S. and its allies , which were quick to condemn the launch as a test of technology for a missile that could attack the U.S. mainland . Pyongyang says it was merely a peaceful effort to put a satellite into orbit .
The White House called it a “ highly provocative act that threatens regional security . ”
Even China , North Korea ’ s closest ally , expressed “ regret ” that North Korea went ahead with the launch “ in spite of the extensive concerns of international community , ” said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei .
The timing of the launch came as something of a surprise after Pyongyang had indicated technical problems might delay it . That it succeeded after several failed attempts was an even greater surprise .
“ North Korea will now turn its attention to developing bigger rockets with heavier payloads , ” said Chae Yeon-seok , a rocket expert at South Korea ’ s state-run Korea Aerospace Research Institute . “ Its ultimate aim will be putting a nuclear warhead on the tip . ”
The Unha-3 rocket fired just before 10 a.m. local time , and was detected heading south by a South Korean destroyer patrolling the Yellow Sea . Japanese officials said the first rocket stage fell into the Yellow Sea west of the Korean Peninsula ; a second stage fell into the Philippine Sea hundreds of kilometers ( miles ) farther south .
The North American Aerospace Defense Command , or NORAD , later confirmed that “ initial indications are that the missile deployed an object that appeared to achieve orbit . ”
About an hour and a half after the launch , North Korea proclaimed it a success , prompting dancing in the streets of the capital . State media called it a “ momentous event ” in the country ’ s scientific development .
It was a marked contrast to an attempted launch in April , which broke up soon after liftoff . The presence of dozens of foreign journalists invited into the country ahead of that attempt forced the government to make an unusual public admission of failure .
This time , Pyongyang waited , presumably long enough to know the satellite had successfully entered orbit , before making a public pronouncement .
Guests and workers at a hotel bar in Pyongyang applauded as they watched the announcement by a female anchor on a flat-panel television . Vehicles mounted with loudspeakers drove around the capital announcing the news .
Pyongyang resident Ham Myong Son told The Associated Press that he felt “ proud to have been born a Korean , ” and Mun Su Kyong , a dancer dressed in bright traditional clothes , said the launch was something to “ boast to the world . ”
“ How happy would our General have been , ” said Rim Un Hui , another Pyongyang resident , referring to late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , who died one year ago next week and was succeeded by his young son . “ I ’ m confident that our country will be stronger and more prosperous under the leadership of Kim Jong Un . ”
In reality , the launch could leave Pyongyang even more isolated if the U.S. , South Korea and Japan pursue fresh United Nations sanctions against the North . The U.N. Security Council will meet behind closed doors Wednesday to discuss its response to the launch .
The U.N. has already imposed two rounds of sanctions that followed underground nuclear tests , and a 2009 resolution orders the North not to conduct any launches using ballistic missile technology . Wednesday ’ s launch would appear to violate that order .
Still , North Korea under new leader Kim has vowed to continue pursuing its nuclear ambitions unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy .
The timing of the rocket test seems full of symbolism .
It may have been timed to commemorate the first anniversary of Kim Jong Il ’ s Dec. 17 death and the close of his son ’ s first year as supreme leader . It also closely aligns with next week ’ s South Korean presidential election , and parliamentary elections in Japan , another long-time enemy nation . President Barack Obama is due to be inaugurated for his second term next month .
Politically , it also sends a powerful message to the world .
Rocket tests are seen as crucial to advancing North Korea ’ s nuclear ambitions .
Pyongyang is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs , but experts believe it lacks the ability to make a warhead small enough to mount on a missile that could threaten the United States .
North Korea also has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage , long-range rocket capable of carrying such a device . Since ballistic missiles share similar bodies , engines and other technology to rockets used in satellite launches , experts see the North ’ s rocket launches as a thinly veiled cover for its missile program , despite Pyongyang ’ s insistence that it is a peaceful satellite program .
There were four previous attempts at a long-range launch , dating back to 1998 when Pyongyang sent a rocket hurtling over Japan .
The success of this launch “ allows the North Koreans to determine what kind of delivery vehicle they could use for a potential nuclear warhead , ” said retired Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton , a weapons expert and intelligence analyst .
David Wright , a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists , said North Korea showed some technical capability getting the rockets stages to work Wednesday .
“ Politically , however , it will certainly have an impact on the way other countries view North Korea , ” Wright said .
Wednesday ’ s launch , like the one in April , came from a site on the west coast , in the village of Tongchang-ri , about 56 kilometers ( 35 miles ) from the Chinese border city of Dandong . The site is 70 kilometers ( 45 miles ) from the North ’ s main Yongbyon nuclear complex , and is said to have better roads and facilities than previous sites and to allow a southerly flight path meant to keep the rocket from flying over other countries .
The launch , which comes amid high tensions between the rival Koreas , also puts the North a step ahead of South Korea in the race to space . Seoul recently canceled its own attempt to launch its first satellite from its own territory , citing technical problems . Two previous attempts by Seoul in 2009 and 2010 failed .
“ It ’ s really good news , ” Jon Il Gwang , a Pyongyang resident , told the AP . “ It clearly testifies that our country has the capability to enter space . I think our country should continue launching man-made satellites in the future in order to further advance the position of our country as a science and technology power . ”","PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) — North Koreans danced in the streets of their capital Wednesday after the Pyongyang regime successfully fired a long-range rocket, defying international warnings and taking a big step forward in its quest to develop a nuclear-tipped missile.

About an hour and a half after the launch, North Korea proclaimed it a success, prompting dancing in the streets of the capital. State media called it a “momentous event” in the country’s scientific development.

It was a marked contrast to an attempted launch in April, which broke up soon after liftoff. The presence of dozens of foreign journalists invited into the country ahead of that attempt forced the government to make an unusual public admission of failure.

This time, Pyongyang waited, presumably long enough to know the satellite had successfully entered orbit, before making a public pronouncement.

Guests and workers at a hotel bar in Pyongyang applauded as they watched the announcement by a female anchor on a flat-panel television. Vehicles mounted with loudspeakers drove around the capital announcing the news.

Pyongyang resident Ham Myong Son told The Associated Press that he felt “proud to have been born a Korean,” and Mun Su Kyong, a dancer dressed in bright traditional clothes, said the launch was something to “boast to the world.”

“How happy would our General have been,” said Rim Un Hui, another Pyongyang resident, referring to late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, who died one year ago next week and was succeeded by his young son. “I’m confident that our country will be stronger and more prosperous under the leadership of Kim Jong Un.”

In reality, the launch could leave Pyongyang even more isolated if the U.S., South Korea and Japan pursue fresh United Nations sanctions against the North. The U.N. Security Council will meet behind closed doors Wednesday to discuss its response to the launch.

The U.N. has already imposed two rounds of sanctions that followed underground nuclear tests, and a 2009 resolution orders the North not to conduct any launches using ballistic missile technology. Wednesday’s launch would appear to violate that order.

Still, North Korea under new leader Kim has vowed to continue pursuing its nuclear ambitions unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy.

The timing of the rocket test seems full of symbolism.

It may have been timed to commemorate the first anniversary of Kim Jong Il’s Dec. 17 death and the close of his son’s first year as supreme leader. It also closely aligns with next week’s South Korean presidential election, and parliamentary elections in Japan, another long-time enemy nation. President Barack Obama is due to be inaugurated for his second term next month.

Politically, it also sends a powerful message to the world.

Rocket tests are seen as crucial to advancing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.

Pyongyang is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs, but experts believe it lacks the ability to make a warhead small enough to mount on a missile that could threaten the United States.

North Korea also has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage, long-range rocket capable of carrying such a device. Since ballistic missiles share similar bodies, engines and other technology to rockets used in satellite launches, experts see the North’s rocket launches as a thinly veiled cover for its missile program, despite Pyongyang’s insistence that it is a peaceful satellite program.

There were four previous attempts at a long-range launch, dating back to 1998 when Pyongyang sent a rocket hurtling over Japan.

The success of this launch “allows the North Koreans to determine what kind of delivery vehicle they could use for a potential nuclear warhead,” said retired Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton, a weapons expert and intelligence analyst.

David Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said North Korea showed some technical capability getting the rockets stages to work Wednesday.

“Politically, however, it will certainly have an impact on the way other countries view North Korea,” Wright said.

Wednesday’s launch, like the one in April, came from a site on the west coast, in the village of Tongchang-ri, about 56 kilometers (35 miles) from the Chinese border city of Dandong. The site is 70 kilometers (45 miles) from the North’s main Yongbyon nuclear complex, and is said to have better roads and facilities than previous sites and to allow a southerly flight path meant to keep the rocket from flying over other countries.

The launch, which comes amid high tensions between the rival Koreas, also puts the North a step ahead of South Korea in the race to space. Seoul recently canceled its own attempt to launch its first satellite from its own territory, citing technical problems. Two previous attempts by Seoul in 2009 and 2010 failed.

“It’s really good news,” Jon Il Gwang, a Pyongyang resident, told the AP. “It clearly testifies that our country has the capability to enter space. I think our country should continue launching man-made satellites in the future in order to further advance the position of our country as a science and technology power.”

WASHINGTON – President Trump said Monday he plans to declare Kim Jong Un's government a state sponsor of terrorism, as he seeks to ratchet up the pressure on North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.

""The North Korean regime must be lawful. It must end its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile development, and cease all support for international terrorism – which it is not doing,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.

In decrying Kim's ""murderous regime,"" Trump cited the recent death of American citizen Otto Warmbier after he was taken into custody in North Korea. He also appeared to reference North Korea's support of an assassination of Kim's half-brother Kim Jong Nam, a political rival who sustained a nerve agent attack at a Malaysia airport in February.

“In addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation, North Korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism including assassinations on foreign soil,” Trump said.

north_korea,ABC News,0,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-talking-north-korea-directly-rex-tillerson/story?id=50197907,"US talking to North Korea 'directly,' Rex Tillerson says",,,"The Trump administration confirmed Saturday for the first time that it is in direct communication with North Korea over its government 's escalating missile and nuclear programs .
Interested in North Korea ? Add North Korea as an interest to stay up to date on the latest North Korea news , video , and analysis from ███ . Add Interest
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , speaking off-camera with reporters during his trip to China 's capital , acknowledged that the administration is speaking to North Korea `` directly , through our own channels . ''
`` We have lines of communication to Pyongyang . We 're not in a dark situation , a blackout , '' he said from the residence of the U.S. ambassador in Beijing . `` We can talk to them . We do talk to them . ''
Tillerson said the Trump administration has `` three channels '' open with the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .
The top U.S. diplomat also said that broad sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program `` are beginning to have an effect . ''
`` We are seeing from what we can observe , and the Chinese are telling us , that it is having some effect , and [ the Chinese ] have a pretty close view of it , '' Tillerson said . `` But I also think it 's the uniform voice coming from the international community . There is almost no one aligning with North Korea on this nuclear program of theirs . ''
The secretary of state described the situation with Pyongyang right now as `` overheated '' after back-and-forth barbs between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un . Tillerson blamed North Korea for the rising tensions , saying that if it would stop testing missiles , that `` would calm down things a lot . ''
Following Tillerson 's remarks , U.S. Department of State spokesperson Heather Nauert issued a statement Saturday saying there are `` several open channels '' in which the Trump administration `` can communicate '' with the North Korean government , but officials in Pyongyang so far `` have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization . ''
`` U.S. diplomats have several open channels in which we can communicate with officials within the North Korean regime , '' Nauert said in the statement . `` Despite assurances that the United States is not interested in promoting the collapse of the current regime , pursuing regime change , accelerating reunification of the peninsula or mobilizing forces north of the DMZ , North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization . ''
Tillerson 's comments and his visit to Beijing come after North Korea ’ s foreign minister earlier this week accused the U.S. of declaring war .
The foreign minister was responding to Trump 's threat at the United Nations last week to “ totally destroy ” North Korea if the U.S. has to defend itself or its allies from the regime .
`` Our country has every right to make countermeasures , '' Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said Monday , adding that those measures could include `` shoot [ ing ] down United States strategic bombers , even when not inside the airspace border of our country . ''
The day after Ri 's remarks , Trump restated his willingness to take military action against North Korea .

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking off-camera with reporters during his trip to China's capital, acknowledged that the administration is speaking to North Korea ""directly, through our own channels.""

""We have lines of communication to Pyongyang. We're not in a dark situation, a blackout,"" he said from the residence of the U.S. ambassador in Beijing. ""We can talk to them. We do talk to them.""

Tillerson said the Trump administration has ""three channels"" open with the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The top U.S. diplomat also said that broad sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program ""are beginning to have an effect.""

""We are seeing from what we can observe, and the Chinese are telling us, that it is having some effect, and [the Chinese] have a pretty close view of it,"" Tillerson said. ""But I also think it's the uniform voice coming from the international community. There is almost no one aligning with North Korea on this nuclear program of theirs.""

The secretary of state described the situation with Pyongyang right now as ""overheated"" after back-and-forth barbs between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Tillerson blamed North Korea for the rising tensions, saying that if it would stop testing missiles, that ""would calm down things a lot.""

Following Tillerson's remarks, U.S. Department of State spokesperson Heather Nauert issued a statement Saturday saying there are ""several open channels"" in which the Trump administration ""can communicate"" with the North Korean government, but officials in Pyongyang so far ""have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization.""

""U.S. diplomats have several open channels in which we can communicate with officials within the North Korean regime,"" Nauert said in the statement. ""Despite assurances that the United States is not interested in promoting the collapse of the current regime, pursuing regime change, accelerating reunification of the peninsula or mobilizing forces north of the DMZ, North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization.""

Tillerson's comments and his visit to Beijing come after North Korea’s foreign minister earlier this week accused the U.S. of declaring war.

The foreign minister was responding to Trump's threat at the United Nations last week to “totally destroy” North Korea if the U.S. has to defend itself or its allies from the regime.

""Our country has every right to make countermeasures,"" Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said Monday, adding that those measures could include ""shoot[ing] down United States strategic bombers, even when not inside the airspace border of our country.""

The day after Ri's remarks, Trump restated his willingness to take military action against North Korea.

""We are totally prepared for [a military option],"" Trump said at a press conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Tuesday. ""Not a preferred option, but if we take that option, it will be devastating.""

Tillerson reiterated in Beijing on Saturday that a nuclear-armed North Korea will never be acceptable to the U.S. and its allies.

""We have been clear publicly, the region has been clear publicly, that we are not going to accept a nuclear-armed North Korea,"" he said.

That difficult reality already exists, however, and it will be challenging to convince North Korea's leaders to change it. The U.S. calculated over the summer that Kim Jong Un's regime controlled as many as 60 nuclear weapons, according to an assessment by U.S. intelligence officials cited in a Washington Post report in August, although some independent experts think the number is far smaller.

As to the value of negotiating directly with North Korea, U.S. officials as well as America's allies have expressed different opinions.

While Tillerson says the U.S. is ""directly"" talking with the regime, both Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have said now is not the time to engage with the Kim Jong Un's government. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has remained open to such talks.

Mr. Kim and the South ’ s President Moon Jae-in also vowed to pursue a peace treaty formally ending the Korean war after a more than a 60-year stalemate . But it was the “ denuclearization ” statement that reverberated most deeply across the world and in Washington , where the Trump administration has demanded it as a precondition for further talks with Pyongyang .
While the stage is now set for a historic face-to-face summit later this spring between President Trump and Mr. Kim , uncertainty still abounds over the veracity of the North Korean leader ’ s commitment to abandon the nuclear program that Pyongyang has spent decades nefariously building in violation of U.N. sanctions and outrage from the wider international community .
Mr. Trump is under pressure from allies , including Japan , to push hard in the yet-to-be-scheduled summit for a firm timeline , perhaps as early as 2020 , for Mr. Kim to come through with the complete , verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of the nuclear program .
Despite the major breakthroughs on Friday , it remains to be seen whether Mr. Kim will agree to such a deadline .

“ The Trump Administration likes to believe that Kim is willing to come back to the table because of its maximum pressure campaign and its credible military options , ” Mr. Haenle said in comments circulated to reporters Friday . “ However , many Chinese experts believe that Kim Jong-un is coming to the table because he is confident in his rudimentary nuclear deterrence capability . ”

North and South Korea delivered a joint declaration affirming the “mutual goal” of pursuing “complete denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula Friday, signaling the firmest commitment to date by the North’s Kim Jong-un that he may be serious about abandoning the nuclear weapons program his nation has long used to threaten America and its allies.

Mr. Kim and the South’s President Moon Jae-in also vowed to pursue a peace treaty formally ending the Korean war after a more than a 60-year stalemate.

Historic summit

Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim met Friday at the demilitarized zone, known as the DMZ, which has divided the Koreas since the 1953 stalemate that froze the Korean war.

After jovial handshakes and hours of talks, the two signed the Panmujom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula.

According to the South’s semi-official Yonhap News Agency, the document asserts the following:

• “[We] solemnly declared before the 80 million people of our nation and the entire world that there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and a new age of peace has opened.”

• “The South and the North reaffirmed their agreement of non-aggression that they will not use any form of force against each other and agreed to strictly abide by the agreement.”

• “The South and the North agreed to gradually realize arms reduction when their military tension is removed and trust is practically established.”

• “The South and the North affirmed their mutual goal of realizing a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearization.”

In remarks afterward, Mr. Kim, who is just 36 years old, went so far as to say the two Korea’s will be “reunited as one country.”

The North Korean leader also held a joint press conference with Mr. Moon, a development that seemed inconceivable just months ago, when Pyongyang carried out a massive underground nuclear bomb test and a barrage of Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) tests.

The South Korean agency said the two also vowed to push for three-way or four-way talks involving the United States and China to replace the Korean armistice with a peace treaty.

Mr. Trump responded to Friday’s developments with cautious optimism.

“After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!” Mr. Trump tweeted.

“KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!” Mr. Trump tweeted.

Mr. Trump also gave credit to Chinese Xi for helping bring North Korea to the negotiating table.

“Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!” Mr. Trump tweeted, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

On Monday , U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged the regime in Pyongyang to ditch its nuclear program and put a lid on its fiery rhetoric if it wants to hold talks .
`` The United States has made clear many times what the conditions are for our entering talks and they have n't changed , '' Kerry said during an interview with CNN 's Jill Dougherty in Tokyo .
`` The conditions have to be met where the North has to move towards denuclearization , indicate a seriousness in doing so by reducing these threats , stop the testing , and indicate it 's actually prepared to negotiate , '' he said .
Kerry was speaking at the end of a three-day trip that focused on securing fresh commitments from South Korea , China and Japan to try to persuade Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table and renounce nuclear weapons .
His visit followed weeks of dramatic threats by Kim Jong Un 's regime , including that of a nuclear strike on the United States and South Korea .
The White House announced Monday that South Korean President Park Geun-hye will visit President Barack Obama in Washington on May 7 .
`` President Park 's visit underscores the importance of the U.S.-ROK ( Republic of Korea ) alliance as a linchpin of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia Pacific region , and of the central role of alliances in the President 's Asia-Pacific rebalancing effort , '' the White House said in a statement .
There is uncertainty about how advanced the North 's nuclear weapons program is , but Kerry on Monday reiterated the U.S. government view that Pyongyang does n't yet have the capacity to carry out a nuclear attack .
Last month , North Korea scrapped the 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War and said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula .
It also recently pledged to restart a reactor at its main nuclear complex that had been shut down under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks with the United States , South Korea and four other countries .
Kerry said Monday that the United States is concerned that North Korea 's dogged pursuit of its nuclear weapons program could have consequences elsewhere in the world .
`` It is the belief of President Obama , myself and the administration that what happens here also has an impact on perceptions in places like Iran , the Middle East , and elsewhere where we 're engaged in nonproliferation efforts , '' he said .
Pyongyang insists that its nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent because of the threat posed to it by the United States and its allies .
Multilateral talks on North Korea 's nuclear program have ended in failure in the past , and Kerry said the United States is n't interested in going over old ground .
`` We 're not going to go through another cycle of artificial negotiations that are geared to simply attract some kind of aid or lull in events while they continue to pursue their devices ' designs , '' he said .
A U.S. State Department official said Monday there are no plans to move toward direct talks , `` because North Korea has shown no willingness to move in a positive direction . ''
Pyongyang on Sunday rejected a different proposal for dialogue , one by South Korea last week regarding the North 's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate .
A statement via KCNA , the state-run news agency , called the South 's offer a `` crafty trick '' and `` empty words without any content . ''
And a KCNA commentary Monday was titled , `` U.S. is to blame for escalating tension on Korean Peninsula . ''
Kerry 's trip finishes on one of the biggest dates on the North Korean calendar : `` The Day of the Sun , '' when citizens celebrate the birthday of Kim Il Sung , remembered as the `` eternal president . '' He died in 1994 and would have been 101 this year .
Current leader Kim Jong Un paid tribute Monday to Kim Il Sung , his grandfather , as well as his late father , Kim Jong Il , by visiting the halls where both men lie in state . It was believed to be the young leader 's first public appearance in two weeks .
Suspicions remain that the North could carry out a test of a mobile ballistic missile at any time .
Kerry said in Beijing at the weekend that the United States and China are calling on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps -- including any missile launches .
Pyongyang made good on its promise to launch a long-range rocket around the time of Kim Il Sung 's birthday last year ; the rocket broke apart after launch and fell into the sea .
North Korea has made more threats since then . It launched a rocket in December that apparently put a satellite into orbit , and in response , the U.N. Security Council approved broadening sanctions against the country .
Angered by those sanctions , Pyongyang announced in January it was planning its third nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part what it called a new phase of confrontation with the United States .
It carried out an underground nuclear bomb test in February , resulting in even tougher sanctions . Those measures , along with joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises in South Korea , prompted an intensification in the North 's threats .","Story highlights North Korea says it would not give notice before attacking South Korea

On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged the regime in Pyongyang to ditch its nuclear program and put a lid on its fiery rhetoric if it wants to hold talks.

""The United States has made clear many times what the conditions are for our entering talks and they haven't changed,"" Kerry said during an interview with CNN's Jill Dougherty in Tokyo.

""The conditions have to be met where the North has to move towards denuclearization, indicate a seriousness in doing so by reducing these threats, stop the testing, and indicate it's actually prepared to negotiate,"" he said.

Kerry was speaking at the end of a three-day trip that focused on securing fresh commitments from South Korea, China and Japan to try to persuade Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table and renounce nuclear weapons.

His visit followed weeks of dramatic threats by Kim Jong Un's regime, including that of a nuclear strike on the United States and South Korea.

The White House announced Monday that South Korean President Park Geun-hye will visit President Barack Obama in Washington on May 7.

""President Park's visit underscores the importance of the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) alliance as a linchpin of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia Pacific region, and of the central role of alliances in the President's Asia-Pacific rebalancing effort,"" the White House said in a statement.

There is uncertainty about how advanced the North's nuclear weapons program is, but Kerry on Monday reiterated the U.S. government view that Pyongyang doesn't yet have the capacity to carry out a nuclear attack.

Last month, North Korea scrapped the 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War and said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

It also recently pledged to restart a reactor at its main nuclear complex that had been shut down under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks with the United States, South Korea and four other countries.

Kerry said Monday that the United States is concerned that North Korea's dogged pursuit of its nuclear weapons program could have consequences elsewhere in the world.

""It is the belief of President Obama, myself and the administration that what happens here also has an impact on perceptions in places like Iran, the Middle East, and elsewhere where we're engaged in nonproliferation efforts,"" he said.

Pyongyang insists that its nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent because of the threat posed to it by the United States and its allies.

Multilateral talks on North Korea's nuclear program have ended in failure in the past, and Kerry said the United States isn't interested in going over old ground.

""We're not going to go through another cycle of artificial negotiations that are geared to simply attract some kind of aid or lull in events while they continue to pursue their devices' designs,"" he said.

A U.S. State Department official said Monday there are no plans to move toward direct talks, ""because North Korea has shown no willingness to move in a positive direction.""

Pyongyang on Sunday rejected a different proposal for dialogue, one by South Korea last week regarding the North's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate.

A statement via KCNA, the state-run news agency, called the South's offer a ""crafty trick"" and ""empty words without any content.""

And a KCNA commentary Monday was titled, ""U.S. is to blame for escalating tension on Korean Peninsula.""

Kerry's trip finishes on one of the biggest dates on the North Korean calendar: ""The Day of the Sun,"" when citizens celebrate the birthday of Kim Il Sung, remembered as the ""eternal president."" He died in 1994 and would have been 101 this year.

Current leader Kim Jong Un paid tribute Monday to Kim Il Sung, his grandfather, as well as his late father, Kim Jong Il, by visiting the halls where both men lie in state. It was believed to be the young leader's first public appearance in two weeks.

Suspicions remain that the North could carry out a test of a mobile ballistic missile at any time.

Kerry said in Beijing at the weekend that the United States and China are calling on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps -- including any missile launches.

Pyongyang made good on its promise to launch a long-range rocket around the time of Kim Il Sung's birthday last year; the rocket broke apart after launch and fell into the sea.

North Korea has made more threats since then. It launched a rocket in December that apparently put a satellite into orbit, and in response, the U.N. Security Council approved broadening sanctions against the country.

Angered by those sanctions, Pyongyang announced in January it was planning its third nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part what it called a new phase of confrontation with the United States.

It carried out an underground nuclear bomb test in February, resulting in even tougher sanctions. Those measures, along with joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises in South Korea, prompted an intensification in the North's threats.",www.cnn.com,left,4hBpmQwimNSKwHT0

`` Hopefully North Korea will hear our words and recognize that for the future of its people and for the future of stability in the region ... there is a clear course of action they 're invited to take , and they will find in us ready partners , '' he said .
North Korea issued a scathing warning to Japan on Friday , saying Tokyo should `` stop recklessly working for staging a comeback on Korea , depending on its American master , '' state media reported .
Japan 's Transport Ministry has issued a notice requiring its airplanes to report to the U.S. military if they fly near the U.S. military 's Kadena base in Okinawa prefecture , the Kyodo News Agency said .
The notice , made at the request of the U.S. military in Japan , is believed to be part of precautions taken against possible North Korean missile launches .
As Kerry visited the Japanese capital , North Korea responded to South Korea 's call last week for open talks .
`` If they have true intent for dialogue , they should drop the attitude of confrontation to begin with , not getting inveigled in wordplay , '' North Korea 's state-run news agency KCNA reported . `` The possibility of dialogue entirely depends on their attitude . ''
South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se , speaking with Kerry on Friday , urged North Korea to open talks .
`` We urge North Korea to cease its reckless behavior and to stop issuing threats , '' he said .
Kerry said Japan and the United States agreed to make climate change a high priority as countries around the world seek consensus on a new international agreement to take effect in 2020 .
`` The foreign minister and I agreed to raise the initiative above the level that it is today ... because of the urgency of this issue , '' Kerry said . `` We have agreed to engage in a new bilateral dialogue based on three pillars . ''

Those areas of concern and focus are agreeing to a climate change pact for the next decade , lowering carbon emissions to reduce their impact on the climate , and planning new growth so that it has minimal effect on the climate , Kerry said .
In late November nearly 200 delegations gathered in Qatar to advance discussions on a new treaty while moving to extend the Kyoto Protocol , which most countries ratified in 1997 . But not every nation signed on to the pact 's second commitment period , which ends in 2020 .
Kerry also said high-level talks on cybersecurity will take place May 9-10 .
In his first trip to Asia as secretary of state , Kerry visited South Korean and Chinese leaders amid growing tension over North Korea .
Washington wants Beijing to `` stop the money trail into North Korea '' and give Pyongyang a strong message that China wants the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons , two U.S. administration officials said .
On Saturday , Kerry and Chinese leaders said their two nations would work together to press North Korea to tone down its provocations . He met with Chinese President Xi Jinping , Premier Li Keqiang and State Councilor Yang Jiechi .
Kerry told reporters in Beijing that the United States and China are calling on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps -- including any missile launches .
`` China is firmly committed to upholding peace and stability and advancing the denuclearization process on the peninsula , '' Yang said .
He also said Beijing will work with its international partners to help restart the stalled six-party talks on North Korea 's nuclear program and hold it accountable to its international agreements .
Kerry landed in Beijing after leaving Seoul , South Korea , where he pledged unbending U.S. military support against any attack from the North .
During his visit to Seoul on Friday , Kerry said the United States would talk to North Korea , but only if the country gets serious about negotiating the end of its nuclear weapons program .
`` North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power , '' Kerry said in the South Korean capital .
His trip to Seoul came a day after a Pentagon intelligence assessment surfaced suggesting North Korea may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear-tipped missile at its foes .
The Defense Intelligence Agency assessment is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea 's nuclear program .
U.S. officials think North Korea could test-launch a mobile ballistic missile at any time in what would be seen by the international community as a highly provocative move .
But a senior administration official said there 's no indication that any such missiles are armed with nuclear material .
Pentagon spokesman George Little said that `` it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested , developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced '' in the DIA study .
The DIA has been wrong in the past , producing an assessment in 2002 that formed the basis for arguments that Iraq had nuclear weapons -- a view later found to be incorrect .","Story highlights Kerry says Japan, U.S. ready to work with North Korea to resolve tensions

""Hopefully North Korea will hear our words and recognize that for the future of its people and for the future of stability in the region ... there is a clear course of action they're invited to take, and they will find in us ready partners,"" he said.

North Korea issued a scathing warning to Japan on Friday, saying Tokyo should ""stop recklessly working for staging a comeback on Korea, depending on its American master,"" state media reported.

Japan's Transport Ministry has issued a notice requiring its airplanes to report to the U.S. military if they fly near the U.S. military's Kadena base in Okinawa prefecture, the Kyodo News Agency said.

The notice, made at the request of the U.S. military in Japan, is believed to be part of precautions taken against possible North Korean missile launches.

As Kerry visited the Japanese capital, North Korea responded to South Korea's call last week for open talks.

""If they have true intent for dialogue, they should drop the attitude of confrontation to begin with, not getting inveigled in wordplay,"" North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA reported. ""The possibility of dialogue entirely depends on their attitude.""

South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, speaking with Kerry on Friday, urged North Korea to open talks.

""We urge North Korea to cease its reckless behavior and to stop issuing threats,"" he said.

Future talks on climate, cybersecurity

Kerry said Japan and the United States agreed to make climate change a high priority as countries around the world seek consensus on a new international agreement to take effect in 2020.

""The foreign minister and I agreed to raise the initiative above the level that it is today ... because of the urgency of this issue,"" Kerry said. ""We have agreed to engage in a new bilateral dialogue based on three pillars.""

Those areas of concern and focus are agreeing to a climate change pact for the next decade, lowering carbon emissions to reduce their impact on the climate, and planning new growth so that it has minimal effect on the climate, Kerry said.

In late November nearly 200 delegations gathered in Qatar to advance discussions on a new treaty while moving to extend the Kyoto Protocol, which most countries ratified in 1997. But not every nation signed on to the pact's second commitment period, which ends in 2020.

Kerry also said high-level talks on cybersecurity will take place May 9-10.

Visit to Beijing

In his first trip to Asia as secretary of state, Kerry visited South Korean and Chinese leaders amid growing tension over North Korea.

Washington wants Beijing to ""stop the money trail into North Korea"" and give Pyongyang a strong message that China wants the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons, two U.S. administration officials said.

On Saturday, Kerry and Chinese leaders said their two nations would work together to press North Korea to tone down its provocations. He met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and State Councilor Yang Jiechi.

Kerry told reporters in Beijing that the United States and China are calling on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps -- including any missile launches.

Yang said China's position is ""consistent and clear-cut.""

""China is firmly committed to upholding peace and stability and advancing the denuclearization process on the peninsula,"" Yang said.

He also said Beijing will work with its international partners to help restart the stalled six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program and hold it accountable to its international agreements.

Support for Seoul

Kerry landed in Beijing after leaving Seoul, South Korea, where he pledged unbending U.S. military support against any attack from the North.

During his visit to Seoul on Friday, Kerry said the United States would talk to North Korea, but only if the country gets serious about negotiating the end of its nuclear weapons program.

""North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power,"" Kerry said in the South Korean capital.

His trip to Seoul came a day after a Pentagon intelligence assessment surfaced suggesting North Korea may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear-tipped missile at its foes.

The Defense Intelligence Agency assessment is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program.

U.S. officials think North Korea could test-launch a mobile ballistic missile at any time in what would be seen by the international community as a highly provocative move.

But a senior administration official said there's no indication that any such missiles are armed with nuclear material.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced"" in the DIA study.

The DIA has been wrong in the past, producing an assessment in 2002 that formed the basis for arguments that Iraq had nuclear weapons -- a view later found to be incorrect.",www.cnn.com,left,FGDj4LmWb5AHOfnB

How serious are the threats?

It's hard to know how seriously to treat Kim's threats about the Trump meeting, analysts said.

They could be Kim's way of pushing back at perceptions that Trump is seeking more from North Korea than he is willing to give.

north_korea,The Hill,1,http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/346087-trump-maybe-threat-on-north-korea-wasnt-tough-enough,Trump: Maybe threat on North Korea wasn't 'tough enough',2017-08-10,,"President Trump on Thursday ramped up his war of words against North Korea over its nuclear program , saying his warning of “ fire and fury ” against the rogue nation “ may not be tough enough . ”
Even as he underlined his Tuesday statement aimed at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , Trump sought to reassure anxious Americans that he has the situation under control and downplayed the notion that his administration is sending mixed messages about its response .
“ Frankly , the people who were questioning that statement , was it too tough ? Maybe it wasn ’ t tough enough , ” he told reporters at his New Jersey golf club . “ They ’ ve been doing this to our country for a long time , for many years , and it ’ s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries . ”
Trump said that if Pyongyang attacks the U.S. or one of its allies , “ things will happen to them like they never thought possible ” and that should make North Korean leadership “ very nervous . ”
The president refused to say whether he is considering pre-emptive attacks against North Korea or whether he would revisit negotiations with Kim ’ s authoritarian regime , saying he did not want to tip his hand .
The burgeoning nuclear crisis has rattled leaders and citizens at home and abroad who are concerned about the ability of Trump , a political newcomer , to handle a major threat to national security .
“ The people of this country should be very comfortable , and I will tell you this : If North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attack of anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us , they can be very , very nervous , ” Trump said .
Trump huddled with his team on Thursday as he faces criticism over mixed messages from the administration with regards to North Korea .
He spoke to reporters in front of the clubhouse at his secluded golf club in Bedminster , N.J. , where he is spending a 17-day summer vacation .
The North Korea situation has forced the president to respond during his trip . Following his comments , Trump received a security briefing from White House chief of staff John Kelly , national security adviser H.R . McMaster and CIA Director Mike Pompeo Michael ( Mike ) Richard PompeoProtests serve as backdrop to Erdoğan 's visit to White House Chris Wallace : Taylor testimony 'very damaging to President Trump ' ███ 's 12:30 Report : Democrats open televised impeachment hearings MORE .

“ Look , here ’ s the view . I said it yesterday . I don ’ t have to say it again . And I ’ ll tell you this , it may be tougher than I said it , not less , ” he said .","President Trump on Thursday ramped up his war of words against North Korea over its nuclear program, saying his warning of “fire and fury” against the rogue nation “may not be tough enough.”

Even as he underlined his Tuesday statement aimed at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump sought to reassure anxious Americans that he has the situation under control and downplayed the notion that his administration is sending mixed messages about its response.

“Frankly, the people who were questioning that statement, was it too tough? Maybe it wasn’t tough enough,” he told reporters at his New Jersey golf club. “They’ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years, and it’s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries.”

Trump said that if Pyongyang attacks the U.S. or one of its allies, “things will happen to them like they never thought possible” and that should make North Korean leadership “very nervous.”

The president refused to say whether he is considering pre-emptive attacks against North Korea or whether he would revisit negotiations with Kim’s authoritarian regime, saying he did not want to tip his hand.

The burgeoning nuclear crisis has rattled leaders and citizens at home and abroad who are concerned about the ability of Trump, a political newcomer, to handle a major threat to national security.

“The people of this country should be very comfortable, and I will tell you this: If North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attack of anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us, they can be very, very nervous,” Trump said.

Trump huddled with his team on Thursday as he faces criticism over mixed messages from the administration with regards to North Korea.

He spoke to reporters in front of the clubhouse at his secluded golf club in Bedminster, N.J., where he is spending a 17-day summer vacation.

The North Korea situation has forced the president to respond during his trip. Following his comments, Trump received a security briefing from White House chief of staff John Kelly, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and CIA Director Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoProtests serve as backdrop to Erdoğan's visit to White House Chris Wallace: Taylor testimony 'very damaging to President Trump' The Hill's 12:30 Report: Democrats open televised impeachment hearings MORE.

Eight days after canceling the unprecedented summit , citing Pyongyang ’ s “ open hostility , ” Trump welcomed North Korea ’ s former intelligence chief , currently under punitive U.S. sanctions , to the White House Oval Office , afterward exchanging smiles and handshakes , patting his arm in a friendly gesture .
“ Good meeting today . I think it ’ s a great start , ” Trump said after conferring for about 90 minutes with Kim Yong Chol , who became the first North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years and who the U.S. president called “ the second most powerful man in North Korea . ”
Trump said he expected an eventual “ very positive result ” with North Korea but dampened expectations for a breakthrough in Singapore .
“ We ’ re not going to go in and sign something on June 12th , and we never were , ” Trump told reporters on the White House lawn . “ We ’ re going to start a process . And I told them today , ‘ Take your time , we can go fast , we can go slowly , ’ but I think they ’ d like to see something happen . ”
Trump said it could take several meetings to reach an agreement , but he was convinced that Kim Jong Un was committed to denuclearization . “ He ’ d like to see it happen , ” Trump said .
It was an extraordinary change in tone from a president who last year threatened to rain “ fire and fury like the world has never seen ” on North Korea because of the threat its nuclear weapons and missiles posed to the United States .
Trump even backed away from the words “ maximum pressure ” that his administration had used to describe its approach to North Korea , combining the toughest-ever U.S. and international economic sanctions with diplomatic actions and the Republican president ’ s military threats and preparations .
“ We ’ re getting along , so it ’ s not a question of maximum pressure , ” Trump said . “ At some point , hopefully ... for the good of millions of people , a deal will be worked out . ”
Trump said one thing that could come out of the summit is an agreement formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War , which was concluded only with a truce , not a peace treaty .
“ We are going to discuss it prior to the meeting . That ’ s something that could come out of the meeting , ” Trump said when asked if a document ending the war was bring prepared .
South Korea ’ s presidential office said on Saturday that the path to the North Korea-U.S. summit had become “ broader and firmer , ” and it would calmly yet excitedly watch the historic meeting in Singapore .
However , Japan ’ s defense minister , Itsunori Onodera , said it was important not to reward North Korea for only agreeing to talks . He told a security conference in Singapore the only way to bring peace was to ensure North Korea took concrete action to end all nuclear programs and ballistic missiles of all ranges .
The visiting North Korean official , linked by U.S. intelligence to a high-profile cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014 , delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un to Trump . A White House official said Trump had read the letter but did not reveal its contents .
Trump wants North Korea to “ denuclearize , ” meaning to get rid of its nuclear arsenal , in return for relief from economic sanctions . But North Korea ’ s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival and has rejected unilaterally disarming .
A senior member of Trump ’ s Republican Party sounded a note of caution . Speaking in Kentucky , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he expected the North Koreans to make “ every effort they can to get sanctions and other relief and give up as little as possible . ”
“ For these situations to work , you have to not want the deal too much , ” McConnell said . “ You fall in love with the deal and it ’ s too important ( to ) you to get it , and the details become less significant , you could get snookered , ” McConnell said .

North Korea , whose nuclear ambitions have been a source of tension for decades , has made advances in missile technology in recent years but Trump has sworn not to allow it to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the United States .
Wall Street took news of the summit ’ s revival in stride .
While Trump sounded conciliatory toward North Korea , Kim used Cold War-style language about Washington during a televised encounter with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Pyongyang on Thursday , referring to “ U.S . hegemonism. ” Referring to the Lavrov meeting , Trump said he “ didn ’ t like it . ”
Trump abruptly called off the summit on May 24 after North Korea sharply criticized U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Trump ’ s national security adviser , John Bolton . “ I think we ’ re over that , totally over that , ” Trump said on Friday .
While Trump has put great importance on sealing a nuclear deal with North Korea , and secured the return of three Americans detained there , he has bucked traditional U.S. foreign policy and alienated America ’ s European and NATO allies and trading partners .
He snubbed France , Germany and Britain by pulling out of a nuclear agreement with Iran and upset the Europeans , as well as neighbors Canada and Mexico , with protectionist trade policies .
The North Korean envoy , Kim Yong Chol , was the highest-level figure from the reclusive country to hold talks at the White House since a senior envoy visited former President Bill Clinton in 2000 . He is vice chairman of the ruling Workers ’ Party ’ s Central Committee .
Trump said North Korea ’ s human rights record was not discussed at the meeting .
Kim Yong Chol once served as a bodyguard to the current leader ’ s father , Kim Jong Il , and was previously chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau , a North Korean military intelligence agency .
In 2015 , then-U.S. director of national intelligence James Clapper described Kim Yong Chol as “ the guy who ultimately would have to okay the cyber attack against Sony ” in 2014 .

“Good meeting today. I think it’s a great start,” Trump said after conferring for about 90 minutes with Kim Yong Chol, who became the first North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years and who the U.S. president called “the second most powerful man in North Korea.”

It was an extraordinary change in tone from a president who last year threatened to rain “fire and fury like the world has never seen” on North Korea because of the threat its nuclear weapons and missiles posed to the United States.

Trump even backed away from the words “maximum pressure” that his administration had used to describe its approach to North Korea, combining the toughest-ever U.S. and international economic sanctions with diplomatic actions and the Republican president’s military threats and preparations.

‘GETTING ALONG’

“We’re getting along, so it’s not a question of maximum pressure,” Trump said. “At some point, hopefully ... for the good of millions of people, a deal will be worked out.”

Trump said one thing that could come out of the summit is an agreement formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War, which was concluded only with a truce, not a peace treaty.

“We are going to discuss it prior to the meeting. That’s something that could come out of the meeting,” Trump said when asked if a document ending the war was bring prepared.

South Korea’s presidential office said on Saturday that the path to the North Korea-U.S. summit had become “broader and firmer,” and it would calmly yet excitedly watch the historic meeting in Singapore.

However, Japan’s defense minister, Itsunori Onodera, said it was important not to reward North Korea for only agreeing to talks. He told a security conference in Singapore the only way to bring peace was to ensure North Korea took concrete action to end all nuclear programs and ballistic missiles of all ranges.

The visiting North Korean official, linked by U.S. intelligence to a high-profile cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un to Trump. A White House official said Trump had read the letter but did not reveal its contents.

Trump wants North Korea to “denuclearize,” meaning to get rid of its nuclear arsenal, in return for relief from economic sanctions. But North Korea’s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival and has rejected unilaterally disarming.

A senior member of Trump’s Republican Party sounded a note of caution. Speaking in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he expected the North Koreans to make “every effort they can to get sanctions and other relief and give up as little as possible.”

“For these situations to work, you have to not want the deal too much,” McConnell said. “You fall in love with the deal and it’s too important (to) you to get it, and the details become less significant, you could get snookered,” McConnell said.

North Korea, whose nuclear ambitions have been a source of tension for decades, has made advances in missile technology in recent years but Trump has sworn not to allow it to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the United States.

Wall Street took news of the summit’s revival in stride.

While Trump sounded conciliatory toward North Korea, Kim used Cold War-style language about Washington during a televised encounter with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Pyongyang on Thursday, referring to “U.S. hegemonism.” Referring to the Lavrov meeting, Trump said he “didn’t like it.”

‘TOTALLY OVER THAT’

Trump abruptly called off the summit on May 24 after North Korea sharply criticized U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton. “I think we’re over that, totally over that,” Trump said on Friday.

While Trump has put great importance on sealing a nuclear deal with North Korea, and secured the return of three Americans detained there, he has bucked traditional U.S. foreign policy and alienated America’s European and NATO allies and trading partners.

He snubbed France, Germany and Britain by pulling out of a nuclear agreement with Iran and upset the Europeans, as well as neighbors Canada and Mexico, with protectionist trade policies.

The North Korean envoy, Kim Yong Chol, was the highest-level figure from the reclusive country to hold talks at the White House since a senior envoy visited former President Bill Clinton in 2000. He is vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee.

Trump said North Korea’s human rights record was not discussed at the meeting.

Kim Yong Chol once served as a bodyguard to the current leader’s father, Kim Jong Il, and was previously chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, a North Korean military intelligence agency.

In 2015, then-U.S. director of national intelligence James Clapper described Kim Yong Chol as “the guy who ultimately would have to okay the cyber attack against Sony” in 2014.

North Korean hackers allegedly infiltrated Sony’s systems and destroyed computers and laptops, apparently in retaliation for the entertainment company’s comedy movie “The Interview” that parodied North Korea’s leadership.

Kim Yong Chol has featured on lists of North Korean officials targeted by U.S. Treasury sanctions, including for supporting the nuclear and missiles programs and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the cyber attack. He was granted special permission to travel to the United States this week, the State Department said.

He was accused by South Korea of masterminding deadly attacks on a South Korean navy ship and an island in 2010.",www.reuters.com,center,xkSDccWJogdSsIke

It’s insecure, poor, and extremely dangerous.",2017-07-05,"Zack Beauchamp, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer","While Americans were busy enjoying the July Fourth holiday , news broke that North Korea had crossed another military milestone : its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile . This missile , the kind that could theoretically be tipped with a nuclear warhead , could travel far enough to hit Alaska .
That ’ s pretty worrying in and of itself . But the North Korean crisis is even scarier than you think .
That isn ’ t because the country ’ s supreme leader , 33-year-old Kim Jong Un , is totally irrational — a “ crazy fat kid , ” as Sen. John McCain once termed him . Instead , it ’ s that the impoverished North Korean regime is deeply insecure , so worried about its own survival that it is willing to go to dangerously provocative lengths to scare the United States and South Korea out of any potential attack .
When you combine this insecurity with the opaque nature of the North Korean regime , you have a situation that could easily spiral into outright conflict in the event that one of North Korea ’ s frequent military provocations ( like the missile test ) goes awry . Given North Korea ’ s massive conventional military and unknown number of nuclear weapons , conflict on the Korean Peninsula would cost hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of lives .
That ’ s not to say that war between the US and North Korea is likely , even after the new missile test . It isn ’ t . Rather , it ’ s that the risk of a catastrophic conflict is much higher than anyone should feel comfortable with , arguably more likely than anywhere else in the world .
Here at home , many are preoccupied with the fight against ISIS and , before that , the Iranian nuclear program . North Korea gets far less public attention , but it is a literally existential threat to two of America ’ s closest allies , Japan and South Korea . And it doesn ’ t seem like there ’ s any solution in sight .
To understand why North Korea is so unstable , we need to start with something counterintuitive : North Korea is really weak .
Pyongyang is one of the world ’ s poorest countries . Its GDP per capita is estimated at about $ 1,000 , about 1/28th of South Korea ’ s . It faces chronic shortages of food and medical supplies , depending on Chinese aid to meet its citizens ’ basic needs . There ’ s a real risk that the Kim regime collapses under the weight of its own mismanagement .
Nor is the North secure from military attack . While its army is extremely large personnel-wise , with about 1.2 million soldiers , it uses antiquated Cold War technology while its neighbors to the South are equipped with top-of-line modern gear . Moreover , the presence of 23,500 US troops in South Korea means any war between North and South Korea would draw in the world ’ s only superpower , though with potentially enormous American casualties .
Facing the twin dangers of domestic instability and foreign attack , the North has devised a strategy for survival that depends ( somewhat counterintuitively ) on provoking the South and the United States .
The North will do something that it knows will infuriate its enemies , like testing an intercontinental ballistic missile or shelling a South Korean military base . This limit-pushing behavior is designed to show that the North is willing to escalate aggressively in the event of any kind of action from Washington or Seoul that threatens the regime , thus deterring them from making even the slightest move to undermine the Kim regime . It also sends a signal to the North Korean people that they ’ re constantly under threat from foreign invasions , and that they need to support their government unconditionally to survive as a nation .
The problem is that this strategy is inherently unstable . There ’ s always a risk that one of these manufactured crises spirals out of control , leading to a conflict that no one really wants . This is especially risky because the North Korean government is deeply insular : Washington doesn ’ t have the kind of direct line of communication with the North that it had with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War , which was vital in preventing standoffs like the Cuban Missile Crisis from escalating .
Maybe the Trump administration responds too aggressively to a provocation , prompting North Korean retaliation . Maybe North Korea thinks it ’ s about to be invaded by the South , leading it to mount a preemptive strike . Maybe South Korea misreads the North ’ s signals and thinks it is about to launch a war , causing the South to do something wild like try to assassinate Kim Jong Un . That isn ’ t totally hypothetical : Jeffrey Lewis , director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies and a noted North Korean expert , thinks killing Kim is a real option that the South is considering if it thinks war is likely ( mainly to head off a nuclear strike before it starts ) .
These scenarios illustrate that a basic truth : A situation where one side is constantly provoking the other is extremely volatile . There are lots of ways for things to go wrong , all of which stem from the fundamental insecurity of the North Korean regime .
“ In North Korea at least , everything is organized around the fear that they will be invaded , and that Kim Jong Un will end up like Muammar Qaddafi in Libya or Saddam Hussein in Iraq , ” Lewis told ███ in an April interview . “ It ’ s easy to see how things could get out of hand in a hurry . ”
War could cause millions of casualties — even before nukes
Here ’ s what makes this all really worrying : While North Korea is in a weak position relative to its enemies , it is still objectively a relatively strong military . While South Korea and the United States would almost certainly defeat the North in the event of a conflict , the cost of such a war would be incredibly high .
The North Koreans are not stupid : They know they ’ re militarily outclassed by their enemies . So their strategy in the event of an out-and-out war , as far as outside analysts can tell , is to inflict overwhelming pain as quickly as possible : to bombard South Korea , Japan , and any American forces they can find with missiles and artillery to the point where their stronger enemies lose their appetite for a protracted conflict .
The estimates of a conflict involving the North ’ s non-nuclear arsenal alone are hard to fathom . My colleague Alex Ward spells some out :
South Korea ’ s capital city , Seoul , is a so-called “ megacity ” with a whopping 25.6 million residents living in the greater metropolitan area . It also happens to be within direct firing range of thousands of pieces of North Korean artillery already lined up along the border , also known as the demilitarized zone . Around 70 percent of North Korea ’ s ground forces are within 90 miles of the DMZ , presumably ready to move south at a moment ’ s notice . Simulations of a large-scale artillery fight between the North and South produce pretty bleak results . One war game convened by the Atlantic back in 2005 predicted that a North Korean attack would kill 100,000 people in Seoul in the first few days alone . Others put the estimate even higher . A war game mentioned by the National Interest predicted Seoul could “ be hit by over half-a-million shells in under an hour . ”
Here ’ s an even grimmer statistic : A South Korean simulation conducted in 2004 , before the North had developed nuclear weapons , estimated that there could be up to 2 million casualties in the first 24 hours of a conflict .
Obviously , the death toll would be exponentially higher if North Korea used any of its nuclear weapons . Those could potentially destroy Tokyo , Seoul , or other cities in the two countries .
It ’ s not clear how many working nuclear weapons the North has , though estimates suggest around 10 to 16 . We do know that the North ’ s missiles have enough range to reach Tokyo , and that the North has tested a nuclear weapon designed to fit on precisely such a missile .
Best guesses suggest the North would try to nuke US forces in the region , to attempt to limit America ’ s ability to help South Korea in ground combat on the Korean Peninsula . But Pyongyang could also target population centers as well — despite the likelihood that any such attack would invite nuclear retaliation from the United States , which has mutual defense agreements with both Japan and South Korea .
“ Its rhetoric and accelerated pace of missile testing suggests that North Korea would be the first to use nuclear weapons if it believed itself to be under attack , ” Mark Fitzpatrick , the executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies America think tank , writes . “ Its nuclear posture incorporates the ‘ use them or lose them ’ principle . ”
The situation is getting more dangerous and shows no signs of improving
As bad as things are with North Korea right now , the situation will only get worse over time . North Korea ’ s mastery of nuclear technology — meaning both missiles and nuclear devices themselves — is steadily improving .
The country ’ s fifth nuclear test , in 2016 , is estimated to be about 33 percent more powerful than the bomb that leveled Hiroshima . If its missile program continues unabated , North Korea will eventually be able to hit the whole of the United States .
Previously , the North has threatened to “ wipe out Manhattan ” in the event of conflict with the United States . This threat is empty now — but absent some kind of brake on North Korea ’ s nuclear program , it may well become quite serious .
Hence why discussions about North Korea in Washington have taken on such an urgent tone . The United States wants to head off the growth of North Korea ’ s nuclear program before it becomes a threat to the American homeland , but right now it has no clear strategy for doing that .
The best bet so far has been to get China to pressure North Korea economically . While North Korea is exceptionally isolated economically — the US has basically sanctioned the North as much as it can — China remains the North ’ s economic lifeline .
But so far , the Chinese haven ’ t played ball : Trade between China and North Korea actually increased in the first quarter of 2017 , allowing the Kim regime to continue puttering along . The US government can try to punish China , through things like sanctions on Chinese banks that do business with Pyongyang , but there ’ s no guarantee that this will be enough to cause China to reverse its stance .
What ’ s more , any agreement would only head off a threat to the US homeland from North Korean missiles . There ’ s no chance , according to Lewis , that the US could convince the North to give up its nuclear weapons altogether — or end the provocations that create the risk of conflict in the first place .
Absent some kind of agreement with the North , which seems far off , the only way to lessen the threat would be for the regime to collapse . While this is a possibility , it seems pretty remote at the moment . North Korea ’ s economy is growing fast by its standards , which would make a popular rebellion less likely . And there aren ’ t obvious signs of a brewing rebellion from the North Korean elite .
Plus , a regime collapse would create its own challenges : a governance vacuum in an impoverished country of tens of millions . This is a problem in both humanitarian terms — many of these people are already effectively starving — and security ones . How do you prevent the weapons that made up the North Korean government ’ s arsenal , both nuclear and conventional , from falling into the wrong hands ?
The bottom line is that the North Korean situation holds perhaps the greatest risk of a nuclear war of any conflict on earth . The American public is preoccupied with the fight against ISIS and the unending stream of Trump scandals , but we ignore North Korea at our own peril .","While Americans were busy enjoying the July Fourth holiday, news broke that North Korea had crossed another military milestone: its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

The summit is the prize

By Ankit Panda, senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists

These concessions from North Korea have come before the two anticipated summits with the US and South Korea.

One may wonder why Mr Kim should give up so much in advance instead of hanging on to a nuclear test-ban and an ICBM moratorium as aces up his sleeve.

The answer is simple: a summit with a US president is enough of a prize in itself. For Mr Kim, it's something that neither his grandfather nor his father could attain.

What North Korea loses by demolishing its nuclear test site and submitting to a unilateral moratorium on ICBM launches is entirely tolerable compared with what Mr Kim gains by sitting alongside President Trump.

Major North Korean missile tests

North Korea has carried out numerous missile tests. Some of these exploded shortly after launch, but others travelled for hundreds of miles before landing in the sea. Here are some of the major tests reported last year alone:

12 February 2017 - A medium-range ballistic missile launched from Banghyon air base near the west coast. It flew east towards the Sea of Japan for about 500km.

""We will try to keep close communications with the south Korean side from sincere stand and honest attitude, true to the intention of our supreme leadership, and deal with the practical matters related to the dispatch of our delegation,"" KCNA said. It called the talks ""the first meaningful and good step for improved north-south relations.""",www.newsmax.com,right,At3qyuf8i1E57vQk

USA TODAY

President Trump began his journey to Singapore on Saturday by exuding optimism about negotiations with North Korea, but also warning that this is “a one-time shot” for leader Kim Jong Un.

Pledging economic assistance to Kim’s government if he gives up nuclear weapons programs, Trump told reporters, “we really think that North Korea that will be a tremendous place in a very short period of time ... They're really working very well with us.""

Speaking with reporters upon leaving the G-7 summit in Canada, Trump did not spell out what might happen if Kim refuses to take up the “one-time shot” offer.

“I’ll be on a mission of peace,” Trump said.

Trump said he will be able to determine quickly whether Kim is serious. “Within the first minute, I’ll know,” Trump said. “My touch, my feel ... That’s what I do.”

Later in the day Trump echoed his comments on Twitter, pledging the meeting would ""certainly be an exciting day.""

""I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World. It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before,"" Trump tweeted. ""...Create peace and great prosperity for his land. I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!""

Foreign policy analysts have questioned whether Kim would ever give up all nuclear weapons, which he sees as essential to his country’s defense. They also questioned statements by Trump’s team that the United States will not reduce economic sanctions until North Korea completely and verifiably gives up it weapons.

“This ‘all before anything’ sequentialism would effectively eliminate US-NK diplomatic prospects,” tweeted Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Trump, who is feuding with the leaders of the G-7 industrialized nations on trade and other issues, left the summit in Quebec early to get to Singapore. He is expected to complete the long flight Sunday evening in Singapore, Sunday morning Washington time.

Trump said the central goal of the meeting is to build a relationship with Kim.

“So far, so good,” Trump said.

Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un hold a role reversal summit: Meet first, then deal

Singapore officials said the United States and North Korea are pleased with the arrangements, and the final touches are in place.

“Things will start happening within the next 24 hours,"" Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told reporters.

Before leaving for the summit, Trump took part in a contentious meeting with the leaders of the world’s largest industrialized economies. Heading into the G-7 meeting, the president had traded Twitter barbs with Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron over trade.

Trump said he brought up allowing Russia back into the G-7 during the meeting, an idea he floated for the first time at the White House as he departed for Canada on Friday. Trump, who received no commitments from the other countries on the issue, said he believes the group would be more effective with Russia at the table.

""I think it would be good for the world,"" Trump said. ""I think it would be good for the United States.""

The United States and its allies agreed to expel Russia from the group following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Trump blamed the Obama administration for allowing the annexation to take place.

The president indicated that little progress had been made on a major issue facing summit participants: Trade. Heading into the G-7 summit, other leaders openly criticized Trump’s decision to impose steep metal tariffs on the other countries gathering for the summit in Quebec.

The G-7 includes the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

""They are starting to be committed to a much more fair trade situation for the United States,"" Trump said the other leaders at the summit.

Trump downplayed the idea that the meeting was contentious, repeatedly describing his relationship with the other leaders as “a 10.” Trump said he raised the idea of entirely open trade with the other G-7 countries, meaning that all of would lower tariffs and subsidies.

“What was strong was the language that this cannot go on,” he said.

But he also warned the other nations of responding to U.S. tariffs with new trade barriers of their own, which most have threatened to do. “If they retaliate, they’re making a mistake,” Trump said. “The gig is up.”

Nothing good comes from yearning for a Nobel Peace Prize for its own sake .

Nothing good comes from yearning for a Nobel Peace Prize for its own sake.

In the matter of North Korea, the Trump administration deserves credit for departing from Barack Obama’s misbegotten policy of sitting idly by (otherwise known as “strategic patience”) while the DPRK advanced toward its goal of developing nuclear-armed ICBMs. Since Trump took office, he has responded to North Korean malfeasance — the hideous murder of Otto Warmbier, the assorted missile tests — by tightening the screws on the Kim Jong-un regime. The Treasury Department has leveled meaningful economic sanctions against North Korea, as has the United Nations Security Council, in large part thanks to American pressure.

Now the North Koreans want to talk, and chatter about a Nobel Peace Prize is in the air. Yet it is nothing new to get the North Koreans to the negotiating table — and that’s the problem. It is far from clear that there is any sort of fundamental breakthrough on the Korean Peninsula, diplomatic showmanship notwithstanding. Last week, South Korean president Moon Jae-in met Kim at the border between the two countries for a summit, and Trump sounds increasingly optimistic that peace is within reach.

In negotiations with the U.S., the DPRK likely will resort to its usual gamesmanship to get sanctions relief and economic aid as the negotiations are ongoing.

We have seen this particular show before, and nothing good has come of it. North Korea’s diplomatic strategy of the last few decades has been to pretend that it will make major concessions, only to renege on those promises after pocketing economic benefits. Last week, Kim reportedly told Moon that the DPRK would abandon its nuclear program if the U.S. promised not to attack the North. Thirteen years ago, Kim Jong-il said the same thing. The friendly meeting between Kim and Moon at the Demilitarized Zone featured a moment fraught with symbolism when the North Korean leader crossed over into the South, but the summit between the two leaders evoked the summits of 1992, 2000, and 2007: highly touted affairs that, ultimately, went nowhere.

In negotiations with the U.S., the DPRK likely will resort to its usual gamesmanship to get sanctions relief and economic aid as the negotiations are ongoing. As for Kim’s supposed offer to disarm, he of course hedged it by noting that North Korea would give up its nuclear program over a period of years.

There is no reason to believe that Kim has given up on his goal of detaching the U.S. from its alliance with South Korea, toward the strategic end of eventually absorbing the South under Pyongyang’s rule, a core ideological commitment of his regime. If Kim is indeed departing from the long-held orthodoxies of his gangster state, he is at risk of Gorbachev-ing himself and unraveling his totalitarian system.

The President would be wise not to take the North Koreans lightly , even though he is convinced he has superior dealmaking skills well beyond those of his predecessors that will help him size up Kim in an instant .
Former US diplomats who have spent long days locked in negotiations with the North Koreans -- habitually skilled and well-prepared interlocutors -- say the discussions can be deeply frustrating and fraught with attempts by the isolated state to manipulate the process .
Even now , many experts doubt assurances by South Korea and the US that Kim really intends to talk about eliminating his nuclear weapons program and believe he may be bent instead on easing pressure on his impoverished state and retaining as much of his arsenal as possible .
The Trump and Kim meeting -- the first between US and North Korean heads of state -- is a leap into the unknown , since like Trump , Kim is believed to be unpredictable and impulsive -- meaning the risks that the talks wo n't go as well as everyone hopes are considerable .
One of the concerns North Korea experts have about Trump is that his faith in his instincts masks a shallow understanding of the intricacies of nuclear diplomacy . Kim , who is showing increasing strategic sophistication on the other hand , is likely to be sharply focused on the details since his nuclear arsenal is seen in Pyongyang as the guarantor of his dynastic rule .
Trump said on Saturday he would know within seconds of the start of their talks in Singapore on Tuesday if the whole thing is going to work out .
`` The first minute I 'll know -- just my touch , my feel , that 's what I do , '' Trump told reporters at the G7 summit in Canada .
Earlier in the week , Trump said he did n't have to prepare very much for the meeting because it was all about `` attitude . '' Then on Friday , the former real estate tycoon insisted he had actually been preparing for his encounter with Kim `` all my life . ''
Whether Trump is truly winging it or he just wants everyone to think so after days of quiet preparations is unclear .
But the danger of going into the summit undercooked is that Trump could make inadvertent concessions on complicated or historically fraught issues , or adopt positions that are detrimental to allies like South Korea or Japan , or stumble into North Korean negotiating traps .
If the summit goes well , it is likely to lead to the kind of long-term diplomatic engagement with the North Koreans that is familiar from past presidencies that the current administration said it would not permit . It will require intense US focus , endurance and attention to detail to achieve an accounting of Pyongyang 's nuclear arsenal and its verifiable and irreversible termination .
Despite their isolation and the image of North Korea as a backward state , North Korean negotiators are always well-briefed , and a new generation of younger diplomats is savvier about the outside world than their older counterparts .
`` We should n't be fooled by our notion that North Korea is a hermit kingdom , '' said Wendy Sherman , a former senior State Department official who negotiated with North Korea on an ultimately unsuccessful missile deal at the end of the Clinton administration .

Evans Revere served as one of the State Department 's top Asia experts and was often frustrated that his counterparts were unable to make the most crucial decisions .
`` So often we were dealing with people who were posturing , reading talking points , who were engaged in bluster , but at the end of the day , were n't really the people who could resolve the issues we were trying to resolve . There was a lot of gamesmanship , '' Revere said .
`` One of the benefits of what we are doing right now is we are actually talking to the inner circle of the leadership who have the ability to resolve the issues and have the ability to take action . ''
In recent days , Trump has admitted that the summit is only the start of an effort to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and end a state of war between Pyongyang and the US , rolling back more ambitious earlier administration predictions of a much faster process .
That means it could lead to a period of intense and exhausting negotiations with the North Koreans familiar from the Clinton , Bush and Obama administrations .
Former senior US diplomat Christopher Hill , who led negotiations with Pyongyang during the Bush years , described just how frustrating the process could get in his autobiography `` Outpost . ''
`` Whether it is in their manual of negotiation or not , the North Koreans would have an annoying habit of agreeing to something , then coming back and not agreeing to what they had just agreed , '' Hill wrote .
Revere , now with the Albright Stonebridge Group , a global strategic advisory firm , said that despite the North 's isolation and the paranoia it sometimes causes , North Korean negotiating teams are sophisticated , even if there are questions about whether they fully grasp all the intricacies of nuclear strategy .

North Korea has cut its last military hotlines with South Korea and yet again stepped up its rhetoric, rattling nerves in the region.

Thousands of North Koreans rallied in central Pyongyang, chanting ""Death to the U.S. imperialists."" Their leader, Kim Jong Un, has been calling for ""scores to be settled"" with the U.S.

This is just the latest phase in a propaganda war. Pyongyang also released a video showing an invasion of Seoul. In the video, North Korean forces fly across the border to destroy American bases in South Korea. Pyongyang also cancelled the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War. But experts are skeptical about North Korea's threats to attack American bases in Guam, Hawaii and the U.S. mainland.

""I do not think they are capable of launching this type of attack against the United States,"" says Kim Heung-kyu, a professor at Sungshin Women's University in Seoul and an adviser to South Korea's last president, Lee Myung-bak. Kim says provocations are likely against South Korea, but of a different nature.

""They've conducted cyberwar, which really destabilized Korean network systems, causing lots of trouble,"" he says. ""They will target military areas, or some certain scientific facilities, which will cause tremendous trouble. ... This is what I anticipate.""

South Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, has continued to talk about building what she calls ""trustpolitik,"" re-establishing trust while taking a tough line with the North. Pyongyang is trying to pressure her to soften her policies, while gaining direct talks from Washington.

Potential Miscalculations



But now, with communication links severed, the biggest danger is one of miscalculation, according to John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul.

""Both countries are essentially on a kind of war footing. In the South, certainly there's expectation that some provocation could be coming soon, and there's no one on the end of the [hotline] to answer, to clarify,"" he says. ""South Koreans are finger-on-the-trigger ready to do something. That's why it's so dangerous to have no channel whatsoever between the two countries right now.""

North Korea has antagonized China, its traditional ally, with its rocket launch and third nuclear test.

Peking University's Jia Qingguo says Beijing's position is much tougher than before and that China is on board for stiffer U.N. sanctions against its old ally.

""I think this is a turning point. North Korea has decided to pursue what it believes to be its best interests at the expense of the interest of other countries, including China,"" Jia says. ""I think China has put up with it for a long time, and enough is enough.""

But Beijing's prime concern is still stability — and so it's unlikely to abandon Pyongyang at the moment.

And so the propaganda war continues. The escalating threats and the massive rallies leave Pyongyang little place to go. One thing is clear: The new young leader, Kim Jong Un, has learned from his father's playbook — and may yet be more unpredictable.",www.npr.org,center,WnSoSauAkNuSQgRM

The 200-page report , which remains unpublished but was reviewed by the New York Times , documents at least 40 previously unreported shipments from North Korea to Syria from 2012 to 2017 , which included prohibited ballistic-missile parts and materials with both civilian and military uses . The supplies the U.N. suspects are being used to make chemical weapons include acid-resistant tiles , valves , and thermometers . North Korean missile experts have also been seen working at Syrian chemical-weapons and missile facilities .
The report ’ s findings paint a damning picture of the international community ’ s ability to police the global black market in illegal weapons : Both North Korea and Syria are under extremely heavy sanctions from the U.N. , U.S. , EU , and other countries and supranational organizations , yet they have been able to do regular business with each other , helping Syrian president Bashar al-Assad carry out atrocities while also financing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ’ s nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile programs .
While the U.N. panel did not find conclusive evidence of ongoing collaboration between the regimes to manufacture chemical weapons currently , experts told the Times that it laid out in unprecedented detail the sophisticated measures these countries have taken to get around these sanctions . The report describes some of North Korea ’ s methods of sanctions evasion , which include a complex web of shell companies , a network of sympathetic individuals in unnamed foreign countries who provide access to financing , the use of its own diplomats to carry out smuggling , and cyber operations .
The relationship between the Assad and Kim regimes dates back to before the current generation of dictators rose to power , with North Korea aiding Syria in the Arab-Israeli wars of the 1960s and ’ 70s , helping the country develop its own ballistic missiles , and helping it build a plutonium-production facility , which Israel destroyed in 2007 . North Korea has also supported Syria ’ s chemical-weapons program since at least the 1990s .
After being accused of carrying out a sarin-gas attack on a rebel enclave that killed as many as 1,400 people in 2013 , Assad agreed to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy his stockpile under a deal brokered by Russia amid threats of military action from the U.S .
Critics of former president Barack Obama ’ s reticence to intervene in Syria often point to this moment as a crucial misstep . Regardless , nobody thought Assad actually gave up all of his chemical weapons , and his army is believed to have carried out multiple chlorine-gas attacks this year as well as another sarin attack last April . Russia , however , has protected Assad from accountability for these actions , using its veto on the U.N. Security Council in November to scuttle a separate panel investigating the use of chemical weapons by actors on both sides of the Syrian civil war .
For its part , North Korea appears to have gotten sanctions evasion and illegal weapons exports down to a science . Another U.N. report shown to the press in early February said the regime had made $ 200 million from banned commodity exports in 2017 , which included weapons shipments to Syria and Myanmar . That report also found evidence of “ the transfer of items with utility in ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs . ”
In addition to the methods identified by the U.N. panel , North Korea sends its illegal exports on ships flagged by different countries , which acquire new names , new ( fraudulent ) registrations , and new shell-company owners , Bloomberg Politics reports . For example , the ship Jin Teng , which was sanctioned by the U.S. in March 2016 , was later rechristened as the Shen Da 8 and then the Hang Yu 1 to evade detection and continued to ship goods out of North Korea through Chinese ports , according to Kharon , a company that helps banks and companies identify sanctions risks .
The U.N. has accused companies in China and Singapore of helping North Korea conduct international trade in violation of sanctions . Identifying companies with links to Pyongyang and cracking down on them is perhaps the hardest part of the sanctions whack-a-mole game . Criticism of China for not doing enough to interdict North Korean shipping may be justified , but even more robust Chinese enforcement might not catch every illegal transaction .
That North Korea continues to do brisk business with other rogue states despite being subject to perhaps the tightest sanctions regime ever imposed on any country illustrates the limitations , and even downsides , of punishing rogue states by cutting them out of the legitimate global marketplace . Commerce always finds a way , especially when key players like Russia and China are unwilling or unable to enforce embargoes diligently .
Lack of access to licit export markets may even encourage such countries to traffic in highly profitable black-market commodities like illegal weapons and drugs . In addition to helping arm its fellow human-rights violators in Syria and Myanmar , North Korea has a well-documented history of exporting heroin and methamphetamine ; state entities there reportedly ramped up production of these drugs in response to the tightening of sanctions last year .
Sanctions failing to prevent the de facto crime family that runs North Korea from making money is particularly unsurprising if one considers the effects sanctions have had on other misbehaving regimes in the recent past .

A report by U.N. experts finds that North Korea supplied the Syrian government with materials that could have been used to produce chemical weapons on several occasions in the last two years, lending weight to long-standing suspicions that Syria is continuing to use these weapons on its own people.

The 200-page report, which remains unpublished but was reviewed by the New York Times, documents at least 40 previously unreported shipments from North Korea to Syria from 2012 to 2017, which included prohibited ballistic-missile parts and materials with both civilian and military uses. The supplies the U.N. suspects are being used to make chemical weapons include acid-resistant tiles, valves, and thermometers. North Korean missile experts have also been seen working at Syrian chemical-weapons and missile facilities.

The report’s findings paint a damning picture of the international community’s ability to police the global black market in illegal weapons: Both North Korea and Syria are under extremely heavy sanctions from the U.N., U.S., EU, and other countries and supranational organizations, yet they have been able to do regular business with each other, helping Syrian president Bashar al-Assad carry out atrocities while also financing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile programs.

While the U.N. panel did not find conclusive evidence of ongoing collaboration between the regimes to manufacture chemical weapons currently, experts told the Times that it laid out in unprecedented detail the sophisticated measures these countries have taken to get around these sanctions. The report describes some of North Korea’s methods of sanctions evasion, which include a complex web of shell companies, a network of sympathetic individuals in unnamed foreign countries who provide access to financing, the use of its own diplomats to carry out smuggling, and cyber operations.

The relationship between the Assad and Kim regimes dates back to before the current generation of dictators rose to power, with North Korea aiding Syria in the Arab-Israeli wars of the 1960s and ’70s, helping the country develop its own ballistic missiles, and helping it build a plutonium-production facility, which Israel destroyed in 2007. North Korea has also supported Syria’s chemical-weapons program since at least the 1990s.

After being accused of carrying out a sarin-gas attack on a rebel enclave that killed as many as 1,400 people in 2013, Assad agreed to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy his stockpile under a deal brokered by Russia amid threats of military action from the U.S.

Critics of former president Barack Obama’s reticence to intervene in Syria often point to this moment as a crucial misstep. Regardless, nobody thought Assad actually gave up all of his chemical weapons, and his army is believed to have carried out multiple chlorine-gas attacks this year as well as another sarin attack last April. Russia, however, has protected Assad from accountability for these actions, using its veto on the U.N. Security Council in November to scuttle a separate panel investigating the use of chemical weapons by actors on both sides of the Syrian civil war.

For its part, North Korea appears to have gotten sanctions evasion and illegal weapons exports down to a science. Another U.N. report shown to the press in early February said the regime had made $200 million from banned commodity exports in 2017, which included weapons shipments to Syria and Myanmar. That report also found evidence of “the transfer of items with utility in ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs.”

In addition to the methods identified by the U.N. panel, North Korea sends its illegal exports on ships flagged by different countries, which acquire new names, new (fraudulent) registrations, and new shell-company owners, Bloomberg Politics reports. For example, the ship Jin Teng, which was sanctioned by the U.S. in March 2016, was later rechristened as the Shen Da 8 and then the Hang Yu 1 to evade detection and continued to ship goods out of North Korea through Chinese ports, according to Kharon, a company that helps banks and companies identify sanctions risks.

The U.N. has accused companies in China and Singapore of helping North Korea conduct international trade in violation of sanctions. Identifying companies with links to Pyongyang and cracking down on them is perhaps the hardest part of the sanctions whack-a-mole game. Criticism of China for not doing enough to interdict North Korean shipping may be justified, but even more robust Chinese enforcement might not catch every illegal transaction.

That North Korea continues to do brisk business with other rogue states despite being subject to perhaps the tightest sanctions regime ever imposed on any country illustrates the limitations, and even downsides, of punishing rogue states by cutting them out of the legitimate global marketplace. Commerce always finds a way, especially when key players like Russia and China are unwilling or unable to enforce embargoes diligently.

Lack of access to licit export markets may even encourage such countries to traffic in highly profitable black-market commodities like illegal weapons and drugs. In addition to helping arm its fellow human-rights violators in Syria and Myanmar, North Korea has a well-documented history of exporting heroin and methamphetamine; state entities there reportedly ramped up production of these drugs in response to the tightening of sanctions last year.

Sanctions failing to prevent the de facto crime family that runs North Korea from making money is particularly unsurprising if one considers the effects sanctions have had on other misbehaving regimes in the recent past.

Thirteen years of sanctions on Iraq in the years leading up to the 2003 invasion failed to curb Saddam Hussein’s power or his penchant for violating human rights, sanctions on Iran enabled the hard-line Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to consolidate its control over the economy, and sanctions on Russia have barely scratched President Vladimir Putin and his fellow oligarchs — in his words, they’ve actually made him even stronger.

None of this is to say that criminal regimes like Kim’s should be allowed unfettered access to the global economy. The U.N.’s findings, however, should inspire a serious conversation among world leaders about the ease with which sanctions are being evaded in the modern world and the need for more effective enforcement mechanisms, especially when it comes to finance and cyberespionage.

Speaking on several Sunday morning talk shows , Pompeo said the United States would not be willing to invest taxpayer dollars to help the country , but was willing to `` lift sanctions '' to pave the way for private American investment in North Korea ’ s energy , agriculture , and infrastructure sectors .
Pompeo 's comments come ahead of a planned June 12 meeting in Singapore between North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump , the first such meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader .
“ What Chairman Kim will get from America is our finest – our entrepreneurs , our risk takers , our capital providers ... They will get private capital that comes in . North Korea is desperately in need of energy ... for their people . They are in great need of agricultural equipment and technology , ” he said on CBS “ Face the Nation . ”
“ We can create conditions for real economic prosperity for the North Korean people that will rival that of the South , ” he added . “ That is our expectation . It won ’ t be U.S. taxpayers . ”
North Korean state media reported over the weekend that the country has scheduled the dismantlement of its nuclear bomb site for later in May .
Pompeo welcomed the news of the plans when asked about it on Sunday .
`` Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk on the American people that is destroyed , eliminated , dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world , '' he said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''
North Korea said Saturday that it will dismantle its nuclear test site in less than two weeks , in a dramatic event that would set up leader Kim 's summit with Trump next month . Trump welcomed the `` gracious gesture . ''
In a statement carried by state media , North Korea 's Foreign Ministry said all of the tunnels at the country 's northeastern testing ground will be destroyed by explosion , and observation and research facilities and ground-based guard units will also be removed .
Kim had already revealed plans to shut the test site by the end of May during his summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month . Analysts say that while the closure of the site is important , it does n't represent a material step toward full denuclearization .
`` A ceremony for dismantling the nuclear test ground is now scheduled between May 23 and 25 , '' depending on weather , the Foreign Ministry 's statement said , adding that journalists from the United States , South Korea , China , Russia and Britain will be invited to witness the dismantling .
The ministry said the North will continue to `` promote close contacts and dialogue with the neighboring countries and the international society so as to safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and over the globe . ''
Trump , in a tweet Saturday , thanked North Korea for its plan to dismantle the nuclear test site , calling it `` a very smart and gracious gesture ! ''
Following the Moon-Kim meeting , Moon 's office said Kim was willing to disclose the process to international experts , but the North 's statement Saturday did n't address allowing experts on the site .
The North 's announcement comes days after Washington announced that the historic summit between Kim and Trump will be held June 12 in Singapore .
South Korea has said Kim has genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons in return for economic benefits . However , there are lingering doubts about whether Kim would ever agree to fully relinquish the weapons he probably views as his only guarantee of survival .
During their meeting at a border truce village , Moon and Kim vaguely promised to work toward the `` complete denuclearization '' of the Korean Peninsula , but made no references to verification or timetables .
North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of `` denuclearization '' that bears no resemblance to the American definition . The North has been vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its 28,500 troops from South Korea and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan .
Some experts believe Kim may try to drag out the process or seek a deal in which he gives away his intercontinental ballistic missiles but retains some of his shorter-range arsenal in return for a reduced U.S. military presence in the South . This could satisfy Trump but undermine the alliance between Washington and Seoul .
Kim declared his nuclear force as complete in December , following North Korea 's most powerful nuclear test to date in September and three flight tests of ICBMs designed to reach the U.S. mainland .
North Korea announced at a ruling party meeting last month that it was suspending all tests of nuclear devices and ICBMs , as well as the plan to close the nuclear testing ground .
Kim said during the meeting that the nuclear test site 's mission had come `` to an end '' because the North had completed developing nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles , ICBMs and other strike means .
The North also said for the first time at the meeting that it had been conducting `` subcritical '' nuclear tests . These refer to experiments involving a subcritical mass of nuclear materials that allow scientists to examine the performance and safety of weapons without triggering a nuclear chain reaction and explosion .
North Korea 's reference to such activity is designed to communicate that even without underground testing , the country intends to maintain its nuclear arsenal and be a `` responsible '' steward of those weapons at the same time , said Andrea Berger , a senior analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies .
Still , the closure of the underground testing site could be a useful precedent for Washington and Seoul as they proceed with the nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang , analysts say .
`` Now that North Korea has accepted in principle that agreements should be verified , U.S. negotiators should hold them to this standard for any subsequent agreement , '' said Adam Mount , a senior defense analyst at the Federation of American Scientists . `` It will make it more difficult for Kim Jong Un to deny inspections now that he has placed them on the table . ''
North Korea has invited the outside world to witness the dismantling of its nuclear facilities before . In June 2008 , international broadcasters were allowed to show the demolishing of a cooling tower at the Nyongbyon reactor site , a year after the North reached an agreement with the U.S. and four other nations to disable its nuclear facilities in return for an aid package worth about $ 400 million .
But in September 2008 , the North declared that it would resume reprocessing plutonium , complaining that Washington was n't fulfilling its promise to remove the country from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism .
The administration of George W. Bush removed North Korea from the list in October 2008 after the country agreed to continue disabling its nuclear plant . However , a final attempt by Bush to complete an agreement to fully dismantle North Korea 's nuclear weapons program collapsed that December when the North refused to accept U.S.-proposed verification methods .

North Korea has waged a publicity campaign around its attendance, calling on Thursday for “all Koreans at home and abroad” to promote inter-Korean cooperation.

Kim’s regime has also set a new anniversary to mark the formation of its military on Feb. 8 - the day before the start of the Games. Analysts say the nation may observe the day with a large military parade.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who will represent the United States at the Olympics, said on Tuesday he would seek to counter what he described as an effort by North Korea to “hijack” the Games with a propaganda campaign.",www.reuters.com,center,j4x3cLZbRFRYKpb2

Libya Comparison

The comments from Kim Kye Gwan indicated broader dissatisfaction with the U.S. approach to talks, and Bolton’s comparisons to Libya in particular. The national security adviser, who advocated a military strike on North Korea before joining the administration last month, has described a denuclearization deal similar to one in which Libya allowed its weapons to be packed up and shipped to the U.S. in return for sanctions relief.

The comparison only underscores the fears of the Kim regime, which views nuclear weapons as insurance against any U.S.-led military action. Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi was brutally killed by NATO-backed rebels two years after the last remnants of his nuclear program were removed.

“Our country is neither Libya nor Iraq, which have met a miserable fate,” Kim Kye Gwan said. “It is absolutely absurd to dare compare the DPRK, a nuclear weapon state, to Libya, which had been at the initial stage of nuclear development.”

Military Drills

The earlier KCNA report announcing the decision to “indefinitely” suspend talks with South Korea cited the allies’ “Max Thunder” military drills and other “improper acts” by authorities in Seoul. “There is a limit in showing goodwill and offering opportunity,” the report said.

North Korea has in recent weeks issued repeated complaints about Trump administration efforts to maintain its “maximum pressure” campaign against the regime in the run up to the meeting. The KCNA statement specifically cited the deployment of B-52 bombers, which are capable of carrying nuclear bombs, and F-22 fighter jets as evidence of threatening behavior by the U.S.

South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported Wednesday that the U.S. won’t send B-52 bombers for the military drills, citing unidentified local military and government officials. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense said in a text message that the allies would proceed with the exercises as planned.

Colonel Rob Manning, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement that the exercises now underway are annual drills aimed at maintaining “a foundation of military readiness.” He said the drills’ defensive nature “has been clear for many decades and has not changed.”

Security Council is set to implement `` significant '' punitive measures after North Korea 's nuclear test and will begin working on a new resolution `` immediately , '' a statement released by Security Council President Elbio Rosselli says .
After Wednesday 's meeting , the council , which includes China , Russia and the United States , together condemned the test as a `` clear violation of ( past ) resolutions ... and of the nonproliferation regime . ''
Along with `` strongly condemning '' the test , members of the council determined to create a resolution that acts on previous promises to further curb the reclusive state 's ability to further its nuclear weapons program .
The 15-member U.N. Security Council held a closed-door meeting Wednesday geared to preventing Pyongyang from getting more nuclear weapons and punishing it for the test earlier that day .
Past U.N. measures included arms , nonproliferation and luxury good embargoes , a freeze on overseas financial assets and a travel ban . None of them have so far stopped North Korea from continuing its nuclear program
Meanwhile , U.S. President Barack Obama spoke to the leaders of South Korea and Japan , who both joined the President in condemning the act . Obama reaffirmed the United States ' defense commitments to both of its regional allies .
South Korean President Park Geun-hye 's office added that the two leaders agreed `` there should be a corresponding price for this nuclear test . ''
North Korea bragged Wednesday about the `` spectacular success '' of its first hydrogen bomb test , a defiant act that leader Kim Jong Un , in a statement read on state television , said would `` make the world ... look up to our strong nuclear country . ''
The United States does n't think so , with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying , `` The initial analysis is not consistent with the North Korean claims . ''
That analysis is n't definitive , though , with some experts saying it 's possible Pyongyang detonated a different type of hydrogen bomb .
Norsar , a Norway-based group that monitors nuclear tests , noted this fact and estimated , based on the seismic readings , a blast equivalent to less than 10,000 tons of TNT , smaller than those of the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and far less than thermonuclear weapons that typically are as potent as millions of tons of TNT .
The group later added that as this test took place deeper underground , it would be harder to monitor radiation and thus determine the type of weapon tested . The U.S. , South Korea Japan and China are all testing for airborne or ground radiation in the region . So far , the South Korean and Japanese attempts have not found any evidence of radiation .

It is difficult to prove it does not . ''","(CNN) The U.N. Security Council is set to implement ""significant"" punitive measures after North Korea's nuclear test and will begin working on a new resolution ""immediately,"" a statement released by Security Council President Elbio Rosselli says.

After Wednesday's meeting, the council, which includes China, Russia and the United States, together condemned the test as a ""clear violation of (past) resolutions ... and of the nonproliferation regime.""

Along with ""strongly condemning"" the test, members of the council determined to create a resolution that acts on previous promises to further curb the reclusive state's ability to further its nuclear weapons program.

The 15-member U.N. Security Council held a closed-door meeting Wednesday geared to preventing Pyongyang from getting more nuclear weapons and punishing it for the test earlier that day.

Past U.N. measures included arms, nonproliferation and luxury good embargoes, a freeze on overseas financial assets and a travel ban. None of them have so far stopped North Korea from continuing its nuclear program

Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama spoke to the leaders of South Korea and Japan, who both joined the President in condemning the act. Obama reaffirmed the United States' defense commitments to both of its regional allies.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye's office added that the two leaders agreed ""there should be a corresponding price for this nuclear test.""

Claims analyzed

North Korea bragged Wednesday about the ""spectacular success"" of its first hydrogen bomb test, a defiant act that leader Kim Jong Un , in a statement read on state television, said would ""make the world ... look up to our strong nuclear country.""

But did it really happen?

The United States doesn't think so, with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying, ""The initial analysis is not consistent with the North Korean claims.""

That analysis isn't definitive, though, with some experts saying it's possible Pyongyang detonated a different type of hydrogen bomb.

Norsar, a Norway-based group that monitors nuclear tests, noted this fact and estimated, based on the seismic readings, a blast equivalent to less than 10,000 tons of TNT, smaller than those of the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and far less than thermonuclear weapons that typically are as potent as millions of tons of TNT.

The group later added that as this test took place deeper underground, it would be harder to monitor radiation and thus determine the type of weapon tested. The U.S., South Korea Japan and China are all testing for airborne or ground radiation in the region. So far, the South Korean and Japanese attempts have not found any evidence of radiation.

It's possible North Korea has a ""boosted"" weapon, one that uses a small amount of fusion to boost the fission process, but is not a hydrogen bomb, but whether there was a hydrogen element isn't known.

Indeed, given the secrecy surrounding North Korea, it may be difficult to ever know; the last test, in 2013, has experts split over whether the device detonated then was plutonium or uranium.

Even if it wasn't an H-bomb, there's little doubt that North Korea did conduct a new significant nuclear test despite persistent calls not to do so.

'Game changer'

If it was, it would be a game changer, said Mike Chinoy , a fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S.-China Institute.

""But evidence seems to suggest it wasn't a full hydrogen bomb.""

However, he said that with each test North Korean nuclear scientists get more data and as a result closer to being able to miniaturize nuclear weapons, a development that would allow the country to deploy nuclear weapons on long-range missiles.

""Whether it was a full H-bomb or not it is still a worrying development,"" he said.

The underground test, which happened at 10 a.m. (8:30 p.m. ET Tuesday), corresponded with a magnitude-5.1 seismic event centered 12 miles (19 kilometers) east-southeast of Sungjibaegam, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . That's comparable to readings from North Korea's most recent plutonium test in 2013.

Ongoing analysis

""We won't know for another few days or weeks whether this was (a hydrogen bomb),"" said Martin Navias , a military expert at King's College London. ""It doesn't look like one; ... one would have expected it to be greater if it was an H-bomb.""

After being briefed by his nation's military, South Korean lawmaker Shin Kyung-min questioned the credibility of the hydrogen bomb claim. Joo Ho-young, who heard from the nation's intelligence service, told reporters, ""It could be different from a usual hydrogen bomb.""

Whether or not it's a hydrogen bomb, the test did get the world's attention.

""Any kind of nuclear test, like the one that North Korea conducted ... is provocative and a flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions,"" said Earnest.

Will the world stop North Korea?

And that -- sticking it to world and regional powers -- may be Pyongyang's aim.

A heavily militarized state

Expert: Hard to disprove North Korea's claim

North Korea's conventional weaponry is dated, with limited effectiveness. That's one reason, experts speculate, Pyongyang has sought nuclear weapons: to project power internationally.

The possibility of Pyongyang being able to strike the U.S. mainland, even now, can't be ruled out. And there's no doubt that South Korea and Japan, two countries that Washington has long vowed to defend, are within reach.

The two officials confirmed to ███ that the State Department has been involved in diplomatic communications with North Korea , with one official adding that the National Security Council staff had also explored backchannel discussions .
The Associated Press reported earlier on Friday that Joseph Yun , the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy , has been in regular contact with Pak Song Il , a senior North Korean diplomat at the country ’ s mission at the United Nations . The AP report indicated that the discussions had not eased fears of a military confrontation , but could prove a foundation for negotiations going forward .
Yun was known to have been in touch with North Korean counterparts to help secure the release of Otto Warmbier , an American imprisoned in North Korea . Warmbier was delivered to the U.S. in a coma , and he died a few days afterward . Still , according to the AP , Yun has kept up the contacts .
The news of the diplomatic effort , however , came as Trump continued to escalate his rhetoric toward North Korea , warning dictator Kim Jong Un on Friday that U.S. military is `` locked and loaded '' in case his regime acts `` unwisely . ''
It was his latest broadside , after causing alarm worldwide on Tuesday by threatening that North Korea would “ be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen ” if the country did not stop provoking the United States . One White House official described the comment as “ impromptu ” and said other senior aides had no warning that Trump would make such an incendiary statement .
Former officials cautioned that Trump appeared to be undercutting the chances of any diplomatic effort .
The president ’ s public comments `` undermine anyone in Pyongyang who ’ s interested in seeing if there ’ s something to be gained in a dialogue with the United States , '' said former State Department official Joel S. Wit , the founder of 38 North , a website that analyzes North Korea . “ The hardliners in Washington reinforce the hardliners in Pyongyang , who in turn reinforce the hardliners in Washington . ''
North Korea ’ s response to Trump 's rhetoric has been to threaten Guam , where the U.S. has a major military presence . North Korean state media have reported that military leaders are working on a plan to launch missiles into waters near the island .
In remarks to reporters Friday , Trump refused to talk about any backchannel discussions , but he defended his recent rhetoric , saying critics were unfairly targeting him and that there are `` tens of millions of people in this country that are so happy with what I 'm saying , because they 're saying , finally , we have a president that 's sticking up for our nation and frankly sticking up for our friends and our allies . ''
North Korea 's leader , Trump added , `` will not get away with what he 's doing , believe me . And if he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat , which , by the way , he has been uttering for years , and his family has been uttering for years , or if he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that 's an American territory or an American ally , he will truly regret it , and he will regret it fast . ''
Even as Trump continues to ratchet up his threats , Democrats are pushing the administration to give diplomacy a try . More than 60 Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives released a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Thursday urging direct talks with the North Korean government . The letter was spearheaded by Rep. John Conyers ( D-Mich. ) , a veteran of the Korean War .
“ Trump must immediately cease talk of pre-emptive war — which must be authorized by Congress — and commit to the diplomatic path advocated by both American experts and the South Korean government , ” Conyers said in comments accompanying the letter .
Separately , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said the U.S. policy of isolating North Korea “ has not worked . ”
“ The United States must quickly engage North Korea in a high-level dialogue without any preconditions , ” the California Democrat said in a statement . “ In my view , diplomacy is the only sound path forward . ”
Asked earlier this week if any part of the administration is pursuing backchannel talks , a National Security Council spokesman told ███ : `` We have always said that the door to dialogue with North Korea remains open , but North Korea must at the very least cease its provocative missile launches and nuclear tests as a first step towards a more constructive path of stability , security , and peace . ''
Tillerson , too , has in recent days hinted that he is open to dialogue with North Korea , even stating explicitly that the United States is not seeking regime change in Pyongyang . The regime in the impoverished , repressive country is believed to be pursuing greater nuclear and ballistic missile capability because it fears a U.S.-led overthrow .
`` We ’ re trying to convey to the North Koreans we are not your enemy , we are not your threat , but you are presenting an unacceptable threat to us , and we have to respond , '' Tillerson said on Aug. 1 . `` And we hope that at some point , they will begin to understand that and that we would like to sit and have a dialogue with them about the future that will give them the security they seek and the future economic prosperity for North Korea , but that will then promote economic prosperity throughout Northeast Asia . ''
What 's not entirely clear is exactly what sorts of conditions the North Koreans are willing to accept ahead of formal talks .
Tillerson has said there needs to be `` an understanding that a condition of those talks is there is no future where North Korea holds nuclear weapons or the ability to deliver those nuclear weapons to anyone in the region much less to the homeland . '' While not suggesting North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons before the talks begin , even the idea that it ultimately much give up such arms could be a non-starter for Pyongyang .
The Trump administration has done little outreach to Congress regarding its plans . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has had no member-level briefings this week . The administration also has not offered any briefings on the issue to the Senate Armed Services Committee , according to congressional sources .
The Trump administration is also not known for having a consistent voice on foreign policy , with the president frequently undermining Tillerson and other aides through his own remarks . Tillerson this week has offered a more moderate tone , telling reporters en route with him to the island of Guam that “ Americans should sleep well at night ” and that “ I do not believe that there is any imminent threat ” from North Korea . ”
The results of an all-out nuclear battle between the United States and North Korea could be catastrophic , with the potential death of hundreds of thousands , even millions , in a conflict that could draw in U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea .
Analysts say it 's unlikely North Korea would launch a pre-emptive attack on the United States , knowing America would retaliate with a force that would wipe out the regime . But with Trump and others sending so many confusing , and at times aggressive messages , the risk of a misunderstanding or miscalculation that leads to a confrontation is higher than before , they added .
“ I think Tillerson has the right approach , ” said Bill Richardson , the former New Mexico governor who also served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . “ And I think what he is saying between the lines is let ’ s have a dialogue but you have to freeze your missile act for a period of time – at least while we have the talks . ”
“ I have never felt the preemptive military strike is a realistic policy option , ” added Richardson , who has traveled to North Korea on several humanitarian missions and served as an unofficial intermediary between the two nations .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , a hawkish South Carolina Republican , said that even if the U.S. does want a diplomatic solution , North Korea would n't agree if it felt the Americans looked weak .
`` Without a credible threat of military force you 'll never end this through diplomacy , '' Graham told the WLTX 19 news channel on Thursday . `` I 'm hoping and praying that diplomacy works , and the only way that will work is if the North Koreans believe we 're serious about protecting our homeland . ''
There are some hopes that China , North Korea 's neighbor and largest trading partner , can step in and help defuse tensions . According to media reports , a Chinese state-owned news outlet , likely reflecting the Chinese government 's policy , warned Friday that Beijing would not come to Pyongyang 's aid if it attacks the U.S. first .

Trump and Kim have exchanged insults ever since Trump took office, with Trump repeatedly calling Kim “rocket man” for testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

Earlier this week Trump dismissed Kim’s taunt that the North Korean leader has a nuclear button on his desk, saying he has a bigger button.

The talks between North Korea and South Korea are expected to cover the Winter Olympics, to be held in South Korea next month, and inter-Korean relations.

Trump suggested the talks might lead to an easing of tensions and took credit for the diplomatic breakthrough, saying it was a result of his steady pressure.

“Look, right now they’re talking Olympics. It’s a start, it’s big start. If I weren’t involved they wouldn’t be talking at all right now,” he said.

Kim “knows I’m not messing around. I’m not messing around. Not even a little bit, not even one percent. He understands that,” said Trump.

“If something can come out of those talks, that would be a great thing for all of humanity, that would be a great thing for the world,” he said.

On Sunday, North Korea announced a list of five officials who will represent Pyongyang, a day after South Korea confirmed its representatives, the South’s unification ministry said.

Korea to abandon nuclear weapons,2013-04-13,Guy Taylor,"BEIJING — After a day of diplomatic talks with Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Saturday , Chinese authorities claimed they are committed to working “ peacefully ” toward the goal of getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons .
“ We maintain that the issue should be handled and resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultation , ” China ’ s State Councilor Yang Jiechi said on Saturday evening in Beijing while sitting beside Mr. Kerry at a restaurant in the Chinese Capitol .
“ To promptly address the Korean nuclear issue serves the common interests of all parties , ” said Mr. Yang . “ It is also the shared responsibility of all parties . ”
The remarks created the appearance of fresh unity between Beijing and Washington , where the Obama administration hoped that Mr. Kerry would be able to convince Chinese leaders to take a more active role in encouraging North Korea to tone down its recent nuclear threats .
Mr. Yang , however , took care to avoid making any specific commitments with regard to actions China is willing to take to pressure the North Korean military or the nation ’ s 28-year-old leader Kim Jong-un to give up the nation ’ s nuclear arsenal and back away from the recent wave of antagonistic posturing .
Instead , Mr. Yang said China is committed to “ advancing the de-nuclearization process on the peninsula ” and to working with “ relevant parties , including the United States ” toward promoting a new round of so-called “ six party talks ” on North Korea .
SEE ALSO : Kerry lands in Beijing to pressure China on North Korea
The multi-nation talks , which included representatives from China , the United States , Japan , Russia and North Korea have broken down during recent years amidst North Korean belligerence over its nuclear program .
In appearing with Mr. Kerry Saturday , Mr. Yang said China remains committed to goals set out in the landmark Sept. 19 , 2005 joint statement of the six party talks , which asserted outright that North Korea had “ committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs . ”
Mr. Yang made the comments moments after Mr. Kerry said Washington also desires to see through the “ goal ” of the 2005 statement . The secretary of state said China and the United States had agreed Saturday to “ have further discussions , to bear down very quickly , with great specificity on exactly how we will accomplish this goal . ”
Later on Saturday night , Mr. Kerry said he believed it had been an “ extremely constructive and positive day ” of meetings in Beijing .
But it was not entirely clear whether Chinese authorities had actually agreed to do anything truly new with regard to their posture toward North Korea and the possibility that Pyongyang may move to make either a test or targeted missile launch .
Asked for specifics , Mr. Kerry asserted firmly that China and the U.S. “ both called on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps and that obviously includes any further missile shoot . ”
“ We don ’ t want to get into … some kind of confrontational language here , ” he said . “ There ’ s been enough of that . ”
“ China and the United States today recommitted ourselves to find a peaceful solution and we say to Kim Jong-un and to the government of [ North Korea ] that they have an obvious choice here , which is to join us in the effort to try to find a negotiated resolution . ”
Foreign policy insiders say China ’ s potential leverage over Pyongyang is rooted in trade and military ties that Beijing has quietly maintained with its smaller neighbor — all while the international community has sought to isolate North Korea through the imposition of U.N. sanctions aimed at containing its nuclear threat .
The effort by U.S. leaders to push on China to pressure Pyongyang to tone down it ’ s rhetoric and come back to the international negotiating table is not new .
Last year , President Obama urged former Chinese President Hu Jintao to call on North Korea to abandon plans it had at the time to carry out a rocket lunch .
Under newly appointed Chinese President Xi Jingping , who replaced Mr. Hu this year , there have been signs that Beijing may now be more ready to work with Washington on North Korea — particularly in light of the recent escalation in tensions .
While he did not mention the nation by name , during a speech last week Mr. Xi appeared to be speaking of North Korea when he said that “ no one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains . ”
Ahead of Saturday ’ s talks , analysts told The ███ that Mr. Kerry ’ s best strategy may be to attempt to build on that momentum along with China ’ s decision to side with Washington last month in supporting the most recent U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea .
A key point in the sanctions call on U.N. member countries — including China , which shares an 880-mile border with North Korea — to “ inspect all cargo ” exiting or entering the nation if there are “ reasonable grounds to believe ” the cargo contains military equipment or materials the could be used to make nuclear weapons .
The question on the minds of some foreign policy experts in Washington is the extent to which China is actually enforcing such measures .
Asked specifically on Saturday whether he believed Pyongyang could have achieved its current nuclear capability without a flow of materials and transactions across the North Korea-China border , Mr. Kerry responded that he did not “ want to get into any classified information . ”
He went on to say there was no “ insinuation that it is China ” who has helped North Korean obtain its nuclear capability . “ There are plenty of places in the world where we know proliferation is taking place , ” Mr. Kerry added , citing Pakistan and Iran and two possibilities .
“ I think it ’ s inappropriate for me to speak for China and I think the Chinese over time will speak as they deem it necessary and appropriate , ” the secretary of state said . “ It ’ s up to them to tell you what and when and how , but there ’ s no question in my mind that China is very serious , very serious , about denuclearizing ” the Korean Peninsula .","BEIJING — After a day of diplomatic talks with Secretary of State John F.

north_korea,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/11/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-meeting-brings-skepticism/,No word from North Korea on Kim’s proposed meeting with Trump,2018-03-11,Guy Taylor,"A meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un could be the diplomatic breakthrough of the century , but high-level U.S. sources , including two with experience in direct talks with Pyongyang , say huge doubts remain over the veracity of North Korea ’ s reported offer to discuss abandoning its nuclear arsenal and to halt all weapons tests while such discussions play out .
“ There ’ s a great deal of uncertainty and skepticism right now , ” Joseph R. DeTrani , a former CIA official who served as special envoy to talks with Pyongyang before they broke down in 2009 , told The ███ on Sunday .
He noted that , despite South Korean assurances that Mr. Kim made the offer in a private meeting with them last week , the North Korean leader has not commented on the matter publicly .
While North Korea ’ s ambassador to the United Nations has reportedly confirmed the sincerity of Mr. Kim ’ s offer , four days have passed since Mr. Trump said he would accept a direct meeting with the North Korean leader and there has been no mention of the situation by officials in Pyongyang or by North Korea ’ s state-controlled Korean Central News Agency .
It ’ s a radio silence that prompted some uncomfortable moments over the weekend for administration officials defending Mr. Trump ’ s announcement that he believes a meeting could happen by the end of May .
CIA Director Mike Pompeo was guarded Sunday when asked whether Pyongyang has responded to the president ’ s announcement privately — or whether there is any direct communication between the administration and the Kim government .
“ I don ’ t want to get into the conversations that may or may not be taking place , ” Mr. Pompeo told CBS News .
“ The president has indicated he is prepared to go have an initial discussion on this incredibly important topic , and we are preparing for that time , ” he said in comments that seemed aimed at tamping down concerns that the diplomatic momentum could be quickly derailed should Mr. Kim suddenly issue a statement contradicting South Korea ’ s claim about his willingness to discuss denuclearization with Mr. Trump .
With that as a backdrop , Mr. DeTrani told The Times that Washington is “ in uncharted waters with Kim Jong-un right now . ”
“ There needs to be much greater clarity on what he means , ” the former envoy said . “ The South Korean delegation that met with him said the North Koreans indicated they ’ re prepared to talk denuclearization if they ’ re given certain security assurances . ”
“ Well , what are they ? ” Mr. DeTrani said . “ Define it . Is it a peace treaty ? Is it ultimately dialogue toward normalization with the United States ? Is it the removal of American troops from South Korea ? What do you mean , Kim Jong-un , when you speak about ‘ security assurances ’ ? ”
Mr. DeTrani made the comments after another former official with direct experience negotiating with Pyongyang sharply criticized Mr. Trump for racing into the idea of a face-to-face meeting without demanding a definitive statement from Pyongyang clarifying its position on denuclearization .
Ambassador Christopher R. Hill , who served from 2005 into 2009 as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs when President George W. Bush ’ s diplomacy efforts with North Korea failed , warned Saturday that the administration has “ already made a major concession . ”
While Mr. Trump has said he won ’ t meet Mr. Kim if the North Korean leader conducts any more missile tests , Mr. Hill said the president should have a much harder posture .
A moratorium on testing is “ a nice thing , ” Mr. Hill told MSNBC , “ but when you send your president into a situation like this , you should be looking for something a lot more . You should be looking for North Korea to fulfill its obligation to denuclearize , an obligation it made in 2005 . ”
Mr. Hill made the assessment after the conservative-leaning National Review magazine published an editorial criticizing Mr. Trump on Friday for engaging in “ stunning improvisatory diplomacy ” toward the “ very bad idea ” of a direct meeting with Mr. Kim .
“ What has Kim done to deserve this honor ? Over the last nine months or so , he murdered Otto Warmbier , threatened Guam and launched multiple missile tests , including two that flew over Japan , ” the editorial said .
The magazine added that the North Korean leader has offered only “ hazy assurances he is willing to discuss denuclearization ” in a move “ straight from the regime ’ s playbook ” of buying time to get sanctions relief , while “ continuing to pursue its core strategic goal of developing nuclear weapons . ”
But Mr. Trump said Saturday that he believes the overall North Korea issue “ is going very well , ” noting via Twitter that Pyongyang has not conducted a missile test since November and expressing optimism about the prospects of a direct meeting .
Other administration officials asserted Sunday that Mr. Trump is completely clear-eyed about the situation .
“ The president has been very clear in what the objective is here , and that is to get rid of nuclear weapons on the [ Korean ] Peninsula , ” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told NBC , adding that he finds it amusing that Mr. Trump “ has been criticized over the last year for being too aggressive . ”
“ Now we have a situation where the president is using diplomacy , but we ’ re not removing the maximum pressure campaign . That ’ s the big difference here , ” Mr. Mnuchin said . “ The sanctions are staying on , the defense posture is staying the same as it is , so the president is going to sit down and see if he can cut a deal . ”
Deputy White House spokesman Raj Shah told ABC on Sunday that the administration will impose no additional conditions on North Korea in order for the Trump-Kim meeting to occur , beyond stipulating that Pyongyang carry out no more missile or nuclear tests and refrain from publicly objecting to “ U.S.-South Korea planned military exercises . ”
Mr. Shah credited increased economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations , and pushed by Washington , with helping to bring the Kim regime to the brink of negotiations .
“ Our policy is pressure , is pressure from our partners and allies around the world , pressure to the United Nations , pressure through China , these have had an impact , ” he said . “ It ’ s impacted Kim Jong-un ’ s behavior . It ’ s impacted his conduct . ”
While many Republicans and some Democrats have openly credited Mr. Trump with success in ratcheting up pressure on Pyongyang while keeping the door open for talks , administration critics and some members of Congress worry that Mr. Trump acted too impulsively in agreeing to meet with Mr. Kim .
Sen. Jeff Flake , Arizona Republican and a frequent Trump critic , told NBC on Sunday that “ the important thing is the diplomatic work that has to go in before such a meeting . ”
“ A meeting like that would be kind of an afterthought after things are negotiated , ” said Mr. Flake . “ Here it looks as if , you know , that ’ s kind of the opening gambit , and that ’ s a little worrisome . ”
“ This is a Hail Mary pass by Donald Trump , ” said Srinivasan Sitaraman , a political science professor at Clark University in Massachusetts , who went so far over the weekend as to argue that the president may be using the issue as a “ Wag the Dog ” tactic to divert media attention away from accusations relating to pornography star Stormy Daniels .
“ Mr . Trump might very well play into the hands of the North Koreans , ” Mr. Sitaraman said . “ Trump is validating Kim Jong-un and providing a platform for him to be treated as an equal , something North Korea has sought all along . However , such validation is no guarantee that this will lead to reduced tensions in the peninsula or result in denuclearization . ”
Others say the impending resumption of joint U.S.-South Korean military drills , which were postponed during the Winter Olympics in South Korea last month , could be the first major tests to the durability of the diplomatic push .
The drills are traditionally held each year in April and always draw threatening criticism from Pyongyang . But no official announcement has been made on when they will take place this year .
In an interview en route to the Middle East over the weekend , Defense Secretary James Mattis declined to discuss the timing and scale of the exercises .
According to The Associated Press , Mr. Mattis refused to talk at all about the diplomatic push over North Korea ’ s nuclear program beyond saying , “ When you get in a position like this , the potential for misunderstanding remains very high . ”
The defense secretary was among the tight circle of Trump advisers at the White House on Thursday when Mr. Trump announced his willingness to accept Mr. Kim ’ s reported offer to meet in late May . The offer was relayed by a South Korean delegation that briefed the president on their own meeting with Mr. Kim last week in Pyongyang .
While there still has been no public confirmation of the offer from Pyongyang , The Washington Post reported Friday that it had received an email from Pak Song-iI , North Korea ’ s ambassador to the United Nations in New York , saying the invitation was the result of Mr. Kim ’ s “ broad minded and resolute decision ” to contribute to peace and security of the Korean Peninsula .","A meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un could be the diplomatic breakthrough of the century, but high-level U.S. sources, including two with experience in direct talks with Pyongyang, say huge doubts remain over the veracity of North Korea’s reported offer to discuss abandoning its nuclear arsenal and to halt all weapons tests while such discussions play out.

“The president has indicated he is prepared to go have an initial discussion on this incredibly important topic, and we are preparing for that time,” he said in comments that seemed aimed at tamping down concerns that the diplomatic momentum could be quickly derailed should Mr. Kim suddenly issue a statement contradicting South Korea’s claim about his willingness to discuss denuclearization with Mr. Trump.

‘Uncharted waters’

With that as a backdrop, Mr. DeTrani told The Times that Washington is “in uncharted waters with Kim Jong-un right now.”

“There needs to be much greater clarity on what he means,” the former envoy said. “The South Korean delegation that met with him said the North Koreans indicated they’re prepared to talk denuclearization if they’re given certain security assurances.”

“Well, what are they?” Mr. DeTrani said. “Define it. Is it a peace treaty? Is it ultimately dialogue toward normalization with the United States? Is it the removal of American troops from South Korea? What do you mean, Kim Jong-un, when you speak about ‘security assurances’?”

Mr. DeTrani made the comments after another former official with direct experience negotiating with Pyongyang sharply criticized Mr. Trump for racing into the idea of a face-to-face meeting without demanding a definitive statement from Pyongyang clarifying its position on denuclearization.

Ambassador Christopher R. Hill, who served from 2005 into 2009 as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs when President George W. Bush’s diplomacy efforts with North Korea failed, warned Saturday that the administration has “already made a major concession.”

While Mr. Trump has said he won’t meet Mr. Kim if the North Korean leader conducts any more missile tests, Mr. Hill said the president should have a much harder posture.

A moratorium on testing is “a nice thing,” Mr. Hill told MSNBC, “but when you send your president into a situation like this, you should be looking for something a lot more. You should be looking for North Korea to fulfill its obligation to denuclearize, an obligation it made in 2005.”

Mr. Hill made the assessment after the conservative-leaning National Review magazine published an editorial criticizing Mr. Trump on Friday for engaging in “stunning improvisatory diplomacy” toward the “very bad idea” of a direct meeting with Mr. Kim.

“What has Kim done to deserve this honor? Over the last nine months or so, he murdered Otto Warmbier, threatened Guam and launched multiple missile tests, including two that flew over Japan,” the editorial said.

The magazine added that the North Korean leader has offered only “hazy assurances he is willing to discuss denuclearization” in a move “straight from the regime’s playbook” of buying time to get sanctions relief, while “continuing to pursue its core strategic goal of developing nuclear weapons.”

‘No additional conditions’

But Mr. Trump said Saturday that he believes the overall North Korea issue “is going very well,” noting via Twitter that Pyongyang has not conducted a missile test since November and expressing optimism about the prospects of a direct meeting.

Other administration officials asserted Sunday that Mr. Trump is completely clear-eyed about the situation.

“The president has been very clear in what the objective is here, and that is to get rid of nuclear weapons on the [Korean] Peninsula,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told NBC, adding that he finds it amusing that Mr. Trump “has been criticized over the last year for being too aggressive.”

“Now we have a situation where the president is using diplomacy, but we’re not removing the maximum pressure campaign. That’s the big difference here,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “The sanctions are staying on, the defense posture is staying the same as it is, so the president is going to sit down and see if he can cut a deal.”

Deputy White House spokesman Raj Shah told ABC on Sunday that the administration will impose no additional conditions on North Korea in order for the Trump-Kim meeting to occur, beyond stipulating that Pyongyang carry out no more missile or nuclear tests and refrain from publicly objecting to “U.S.-South Korea planned military exercises.”

Mr. Shah credited increased economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, and pushed by Washington, with helping to bring the Kim regime to the brink of negotiations.

“Our policy is pressure, is pressure from our partners and allies around the world, pressure to the United Nations, pressure through China, these have had an impact,” he said. “It’s impacted Kim Jong-un’s behavior. It’s impacted his conduct.”

While many Republicans and some Democrats have openly credited Mr. Trump with success in ratcheting up pressure on Pyongyang while keeping the door open for talks, administration critics and some members of Congress worry that Mr. Trump acted too impulsively in agreeing to meet with Mr. Kim.

Sen. Jeff Flake, Arizona Republican and a frequent Trump critic, told NBC on Sunday that “the important thing is the diplomatic work that has to go in before such a meeting.”

“A meeting like that would be kind of an afterthought after things are negotiated,” said Mr. Flake. “Here it looks as if, you know, that’s kind of the opening gambit, and that’s a little worrisome.”

Others were more harsh.

“This is a Hail Mary pass by Donald Trump,” said Srinivasan Sitaraman, a political science professor at Clark University in Massachusetts, who went so far over the weekend as to argue that the president may be using the issue as a “Wag the Dog” tactic to divert media attention away from accusations relating to pornography star Stormy Daniels.

“Mr. Trump might very well play into the hands of the North Koreans,” Mr. Sitaraman said. “Trump is validating Kim Jong-un and providing a platform for him to be treated as an equal, something North Korea has sought all along. However, such validation is no guarantee that this will lead to reduced tensions in the peninsula or result in denuclearization.”

Military drills loom

Others say the impending resumption of joint U.S.-South Korean military drills, which were postponed during the Winter Olympics in South Korea last month, could be the first major tests to the durability of the diplomatic push.

The drills are traditionally held each year in April and always draw threatening criticism from Pyongyang. But no official announcement has been made on when they will take place this year.

In an interview en route to the Middle East over the weekend, Defense Secretary James Mattis declined to discuss the timing and scale of the exercises.

According to The Associated Press, Mr. Mattis refused to talk at all about the diplomatic push over North Korea’s nuclear program beyond saying, “When you get in a position like this, the potential for misunderstanding remains very high.”

The defense secretary was among the tight circle of Trump advisers at the White House on Thursday when Mr. Trump announced his willingness to accept Mr. Kim’s reported offer to meet in late May. The offer was relayed by a South Korean delegation that briefed the president on their own meeting with Mr. Kim last week in Pyongyang.

While there still has been no public confirmation of the offer from Pyongyang, The Washington Post reported Friday that it had received an email from Pak Song-iI, North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations in New York, saying the invitation was the result of Mr. Kim’s “broad minded and resolute decision” to contribute to peace and security of the Korean Peninsula.

This has deterred North Korean adventurism and kept the peace for over 50 years. But as technology has advanced, it has made for a hair-triggered tripwire.

The Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas is about the width of New York’s Central Park. A North Korean missile can reach South Korea’s capital in about a minute. Seoul’s sprawling suburbs are nearly at the North Korean border. If someone does miscalculate, the situation would escalate within hours.

That’s the bad news.

The good news is the Obama administration is taking the threat seriously. So far, they’ve walked the fine line between demonstrating our resolve and not fanning the flames.

They’ve showed our South Korean and Japanese allies that we stand with them, by continuing with the planned military exercises with some of America’s most advanced weapons.

They’re putting missile defense systems in place of the Korean coast. But they’ve not traded tit-for-tat in response to Kim Jong Un’s extreme sabre rattling.

For the first time, China has real incentives for resolving the annual North Korean crisis. There are indications at the United Nations and elsewhere that China is losing patience with North Korea.

It is time for the U.S. and China to reopen a strategic dialogue to deal with a host of issues, especially how to deal with North Korea.

Mao once told my former boss Henry Kissinger, that without the lips the teeth grow cold. He meant that North Korea provided a buffer for Japan and South Korea. Those teeth would grow very cold indeed if the annual Korean crisis is not resolved peacefully.

Even so, no one knows how this will turn out.

We will not negotiate our way out of this one. On the other hand, sanctions and pressure have not deterred the North from its nuclear weapons path. Is the North Korea problem unsolvable? No. But U.S. policy must be based on realistic assessments of five factors: the North's intentions, the danger involved, the efficacy of dialogue, the approach to China, and the role of our alliances.

1) What does North Korea want?

Michael Green

Christopher Johnson

Victor Cha

This answer should not be so hard to figure out. The North's highest national priority is the capability to threaten the United States, our Pacific bases and our allies with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. Almost nothing will knock it off this path.

Do the leaders want respect, aid, lifting of sanctions and legitimacy? Of course: But the regime has determined that these come from owning nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The North's outrageous threats are designed to elicit compromise and restraint from the other powers in the region -- to frighten us away from imposing U.N. Security Council sanctions for the latest nuclear and missile tests.

Pyongyang wants first to establish itself undeniably as the world's newest nuclear weapons power. The regime may then freeze one part of its program temporarily, or promise a moratorium to receive food, energy and money, but the pattern has been consistent in later breaking away from whatever agreement was reached. If nuclear weapons were just about deterring the United States, then a nonaggression pact or peace treaty might have some possibility.

U.S. administrations, from those of Barack Obama to George H.W. Bush, have offered North Korea security assurances more than 33 times. But the regime needs these weapons to deter China, to keep its army loyal and to juxtapose its weapons status against rival South Korea's enormous successes on the international stage. In the regime's view, the weapons are indispensable to its survival.

2) What is the danger?

North Korea can be deterred. The young Kim's use of nuclear weapons would destroy the regime. The North Koreans might have everything to lose, but we -- as rich and comfortable societies -- have much more to lose. That is the leverage the North seeks to exploit.

Pyongyang's increasingly brazen threats could reflect the exuberance and inexperience of a young untested leader, but may also reflect the belief that threats can be made with greater impunity when backed by a handful of nuclear weapons. If the North is beginning to produce nuclear weapons not only from plutonium harvested from its Yongbyon reactor, but also from uranium, then it may soon be able to produce more than one nuclear device, if not weapon, a year. This could lead to even more dangerous threats and demands -- including a possible repeat of the threat to transfer nuclear know-how to other countries.

The other danger stems from the North's brinkmanship strategy itself. For five decades, the North has mastered the art of manufacturing crises and then pulling back from the brink. A CSIS study found that within two months of a rupture in negotiations, North Korea ratchets up another crisis with a provocation -- only to be rewarded with regional powers' diplomacy efforts within five to six months.

With increasing confidence in its nuclear and missile programs, will Pyongyang come closer to that line? Will Kim Jong Un feel pressure not to back down in order to prove his credentials as a marshall of the DPRK? Will he pick the wrong targets and invite a South Korean retaliatory strike?

3) The efficacy of dialogue

The history of this torrid cycle of crisis diplomacy suggests that sooner or later, the Obama administration will be back at the negotiating table to rent a temporary cessation of North Korean belligerence, just as previous administrations have done.

But the definition of madness is to do the same thing over and over hoping that the outcome will be different. It won't. That is why the main track now has to be pressure. Not war, but serious and sustained pressure by all parties that constrains weapons development and proliferation.

4) The China calculus

Of course, sustained pressure is impossible without China's involvement. For the first time in years, there is reason to hope China may be more helpful. Beijing is clearly exasperated with the North. The new Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, is more decisive than his predecessor. His new foreign policy team views Pyongyang with a jaundiced eye after years of mopping up the diplomatic messes. Even sacrosanct assumptions, such as the North's role as a vital strategic buffer for China, are being hotly debated in Beijing.

But we should not expect China to coerce its troublesome client. Beijing remains preoccupied with maintaining stability. Xi cannot push through the economic package he hopes to table in the fall without support from regime conservatives, especially in the military, who favor the status quo on the Korean Peninsula.

Party chieftains administering the Chinese provinces bordering North Korea are critical to meaningful enforcement of tightened sanctions, but they care more about the flourishing border trade and investment opportunities in the North than implementing the will of the U.N. Security Council. Such constraints make it difficult for the senior leadership to -- as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry put it last week -- ""bear down"" on Pyongyang.

This means the United States must avoid the temptation to make cooperation on North Korea a litmus test for U.S.-China ties. Doing so will only stiffen Chinese resistance and result in disappointment and increased bilateral friction. It also risks increasing U.S. ownership of the problem at a time when we want China to do more.

Instead, we need to persuade China to drop its parochial approach in favor of cooperation that is strategic, farsighted and genuine, and part of the overall framework of our long-term security relationship. We must convince China that North Korea's actions are creating what Beijing most fears — greater U.S. military presence in the region and enhanced trilateral cooperation with Japan and South Korea.

5) Allies matter

A failure to stop North Korea's nuclear programs will irreparably damage our alliances in Asia. Not so much because it will lead to a nuclear Japan or South Korea, but because it will raise doubts about U.S. staying power and ability to provide security to the region.

Any U.S. outreach to China about development of a long-term strategy for Korea must be grounded in deep trilateral planning and coordination with America's allies, South Korea and Japan. Indeed, all eyes will be on the new South Korean President Park Geun-hye as she lays out her vision to President Obama when they meet next month.

Her brain trust has talked about quietly reaching out to change Beijing's view of its strategic equities on the peninsula. This argument will be more persuasive only if it is grounded in unprecedented levels of U.S.-Japan-South Korea cooperation on missile defense, intelligence sharing, military exercises,and missile defense collaboration in response to the North Korean threat.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted in an interview with CNN just this week that the outlines of the deal are a lot fuzzier than the president stated, saying that there’s no timeline for North Korea to take action on the denuclearization front. “I am not going to put a timeline on it, whether that’s two months, six months, we are committed to moving forward in an expeditious moment to see if we can achieve what both leaders set out to do,” Pompeo said.

And Trump’s administration still views North Korea as an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” at least according to the letter they sent Congress renewing longstanding sanctions on the country.",www.vox.com,left,T5adoJ5JGrhRHU8c

North Korea's Internet service, which was out for almost 10 hours on Monday, went down two more times Tuesday, including a 31-minute stretch, according to Dyn Research.

The Manchester, N.H., company that tracks internet traffic and performance said ""connectivity problems continue.""

The initial instability emerged Sunday followed by the full shutdown for nine and a half hours Monday. The two outages Tuesday included one that lasted from 10:41 a.m. ET to 11:12 a.m. ET.

SHOW TIME: Some theaters to screen 'The Interview' on Christmas

The disruption inside the hermit kingdom comes as tensions grow with the United States over North Korea's alleged computer hack attack on Sony Pictures, and the studio's unreleased movie, The Interview, about a fictional attempt to kill the leader of the Pyongyang regime, Kim Jong Un.

After initially removing the film from distribution, Sony now plans to screen it in some theaters beginning Christmas Day.

Kyle York, of Dyn Research, tells USA TODAY that he expects to see more outages from the North Korean system in the coming days.

""If they are having this prolonged a blackout, then something is up, something is broken and not allowing a quick fix,"" York said.

He noted North Korea has a ""very basic Internet"" with few redundancies, only one server inside the country and one connection through China.

Given such a highly vulnerable system, York said, the possible cause of the outages ranges from malicious activity to a ""fat finger"" inside the country to weather dynamics. He said it could even be as basic as ""some kid in his parents' basement"" jamming up the system.

After the initial disruptions, U.S. officials on Monday declined to say if the United States was responsible for the outage.

On Friday, President Obama said he would ""respond proportionately"" to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which the FBI confirmed was launched by North Korea.

On Sunday, however, Obama said the hacking was not an act of war. Speaking on CNN's State of the Union, he said, ""I think it was an act of cyber vandalism that was very costly, very expensive. We take it very seriously. We will respond proportionately.""

APPARENT WAIVER FOR NORTH KOREAN

The United States and South Korea blacklisted Kim Yong Chol

for supporting the North’s nuclear and missile programs in 2010 and 2016, respectively. But he was granted special permission for official travel to the United States, said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert.

During his tenure as a senior intelligence official, Kim was accused by South Korea of masterminding deadly attacks on a South Korean navy ship and an island in 2010. He was linked by U.S intelligence to a cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014.

North Korea denied any involvement in both attacks.

South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told a parliamentary committee Monday that North Korea still appears poised to launch a missile from its east coast . To further coordinate a response , South Korea ’ s new president , Park Geun-hye , will meet with Mr. Obama on May 7 at the White House .
State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the United States is open to dialogue with North Korea but only if Pyongyang proves itself to be trustworthy .
“ The burden remains on Pyongyang , ” Mr. Ventrell said . “ They need to take meaningful steps to show that they ’ ll honor their commitments . We need to see them be serious about denuclearization , indicate their seriousness , and start to reduce the threats and stop provocations . ”","North Korea intensified its threats of an imminent attack against the South Tuesday, while President Obama said the United States does not believe the communist regime has the ability to launch a nuclear weapon.

Ministers in Pyongyang demanded that South Korea apologize for its anti-North protests on Monday or face devastating attacks. Military officials promised to rain “sledgehammer blows” for the South’s protests, which came during the North’s celebration of the 101st birthday of its founder. Effigies of Kim Il-sung and his late son and successor, Kim Jong-il, were burned in Seoul.

“Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,” North Korea’s state-run media reported, citing military leaders. “The military demonstration of the [North’s] revolutionary armed forces will be powerful sledgehammer blows at all hostile forces hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership.”

Joint military drills by the U.S. and South Korea are scheduled to end April 30. On Tuesday, a Marine CH-53E helicopter with 21 personnel aboard made a “hard landing” during the exercises. All aboard were taken to a hospital, and 15 were released. The remaining six were in stable condition.

“The nuclear test and the intercontinental ballistic missile test will be discontinued,” the Korean Central News Agency reported Friday, delivering a clear message from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “North Korea’s nuclear test center will be discarded in order to ensure the transparency of the suspension of the nuclear test.”

North Korea is closing the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, where North Korea has tested a total of six nuclear weapons, including a thermonuclear bomb, the country is apparently announcing to the world.

The U.S. and North Korea are already in direct talks in preparation for a meeting between Trump and Kim — an unprecedented summit. CIA Director Mike Pompeo recently made a secret trip to North Korea to meet with Kim himself.

North Korea has reportedly agreed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, pleasing the Trump administration, but there may be a disconnect when it comes to what exactly this means, North Korean state media reports indicate.

“We will never use nuclear weapons unless there is a nuclear threat or nuclear provocation to our country, and in any case, we will not transfer nuclear weapons and nuclear technology,” KCNA reported, suggesting the North intends to remain a nuclear weapons state but act responsibly.

In the report, Kim expressed the need for “global nuclear disarmament” — a possible reference to past statements indicating North Korea would only completely disarm when the U.S. agrees to do the same.

North Korea’s decision to suspend nuclear testing could signal Pyongyang is satisfied with the state of its nuclear capabilities, which could mean the North is much more capable than previously acknowledged, some Korea watchers are noting.

United States becomes convinced that North Korea is about to strike ( or that , somehow , the magic math is finally right ) and launches an initial attack described as “ a defensive move . ”

north_korea,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/3/north-korea-missiles-can-defeat-us-defense-systems/,North Korea tests missiles designed to defeat U.S. THAAD defense system,2017-05-03,Rowan Scarborough,"North Korea has tailored its spate of ballistic missile tests to defeat the U.S.-stationed defense systems ready to protect the South and Japan from descending warheads , a report to Congress says .
The bellicose North regularly flight-tests a panoply of ballistic missiles that could , in war , be capped with miniaturized nuclear warheads and strike its two democratic neighbors and U.S. allies .
The U.S. military has matched this threat by first stationing Patriot anti-missile batteries and then announcing that the wider-range , mobile THAAD system is now in place to shoot down incoming warheads .
The Congressional Research Service reported that the regime launched test missiles last year in flights precisely designed to avoid interception by rocketing them into much higher altitudes . The result : The re-entry warhead will descend at a steeper angle and faster speed , “ making it potentially more difficult to intercept with a missile defense system , ” the CRS said .
In another maneuver , the CRS said , “ North Korea has also demonstrated an ability to launch a salvo attack with more than one missile launched in relatively short order . ”
“ This is consistent with a possible goal of being able to conduct large ballistic missile attacks with large raid sizes , a capability that could make it more challenging for a missile defense system to destroy each incoming warhead , ” the report said .
In a third tactic , North Korea has tested submarine-launched ballistic missiles — the first in 2015 — that could be targeted at South Korea from outside THAAD ’ s radar field .
Lockheed Martin , the maker of THAAD ( Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense ) , says its system is “ designed to counter mass raids ” by launching up to 72 interceptors from one battery against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles to protect troops as well as cities . The U.S. military positioned the battery and radars 135 miles south of the capital of Seoul on an abandoned golf course .
The CRS says the North ’ s periodic test launches are not just for show . They “ may be intended to increase the reliability , effectiveness and survivability of their ballistic missile force , ” said analysts Steven A. Hildreth and Mary Beth D. Nikitin .
The country ’ s last two missile tests , including one on Saturday , failed . That prompted speculation that a Pentagon cyberwar on North Korea quickly disrupted the flight .
North Korea has made significant advances in producing fissile material — weapons-grade plutonium and enriched uranium . It has conducted underground explosive tests to refine warhead designs and yields , and is building families of reliable ballistic missiles .
The Institute for Science and International Security , led by nuclear physicist David Albright , estimates that the North may own 30 nuclear weapons today and will have 60 by 2020 . The Defense Intelligence Agency said North Korea owned just one or two such weapons in 1999 .
In other words , North Korea , with erratic leader Kim Jong-un , is becoming a nuclear power .
“ The last several years have witnessed a dramatic and overt buildup in North Korean ’ s nuclear capabilities , ” Mr. Albright said in a briefing .
The Trump administration has been sending a combination of signals to Mr. Kim — an iron fist in the buildup of naval forces and an olive branch in President Trump ’ s remark that he would be honored to meet the Stalinist-type leader if conditions are met .
White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the North must commit to dismantling its nuclear arsenal . It made such a commitment to freeze its weapons research under the Agreed Framework with the Clinton administration .
During six-party negotiations , the George W. Bush administration found the regime to be cheating . All international inspections stopped in 2009 .
Mr. Albright told The ███ that the North accelerated its nuclear weapons development at the end of each agreement , especially since 2009 .
The North also has made threats about testing a long-range ballistic missile capable of hitting the continental United States . Such a provocation could prompt Mr. Trump ’ s national security team of former and current generals to recommend a pre-emptive airstrike to destroy Mr. Kim ’ s nuclear arsenal .
The CRS report said : “ The intelligence community believes that North Korea has an ICBM capability , but that it has not been tested and that neither North Korea nor the United States knows whether that capability will work . ”
The problem air war planners would face is that North Korea is suspected of operating secret , underground sites where fissile material is stored and where warheads are researched , developed and assembled , nuclear analysts say .
“ North Korea ’ s numbers of weapons , based on fissile material estimates , are relatively large and growing , ” Mr. Albright said .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations ’ nuclear watchdog , filed its latest report on North Korea in August . It noted that the North ’ s test of a nuclear device the previous January was a “ flagrant disregard ” of U.N. resolutions . The report said the IAEA ’ s knowledge is waning as the Kim regime keeps its experts outside the country .
The CRS report sums up the North ’ s fast progress : “ Taken together , North Korea ’ s progress in nuclear testing , its declared standardization of warhead designs and potential to put those warheads on medium-range missiles , increased confidence in the reliability of its short-range missile forces , and efforts seemingly designed to degrade regional ballistic missile defense systems suggest that North Korea may be building a credible regional nuclear warfighting capability . Such an approach would reinforce their deterrent strategy by lending more credibility to its growing capabilities . ”","North Korea has tailored its spate of ballistic missile tests to defeat the U.S.-stationed defense systems ready to protect the South and Japan from descending warheads, a report to Congress says.

north_korea,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/28/trump-warns-major-major-conflict-with-north-korea.html,"Trump warns of 'major, major conflict' with North Korea",2017-04-28,President Trump,"President Trump warned a `` major , major conflict '' with North Korea could result from the ongoing standoff over its nuclear and missile programs , but he said he hoped diplomacy would prevail .
In an exclusive Oval Office interview with Reuters ahead of the 100-day benchmark in his administration , Trump candidly acknowledged that the international situation could go off the rails .
`` There is a chance that we could end up having a major , major conflict with North Korea . Absolutely , '' Trump said .
`` There is a chance that we could end up having a major , major conflict with North Korea . '' — President Trump
`` We 'd love to solve things diplomatically , but it 's very difficult , '' he added .
Trump also said South Korea should pay for the $ 1 billion U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) anti-missile defense system in place to protect it from an attack from the north .
The wide-ranging interview also included Trump 's plan to defeat the Islamic State terror network .
`` I have to say , there is an end . And it has to be humiliation , '' he said , when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism .
But talk was dominated by the North Korea situation , which has vexed past presidents , but seems to have reached a fever pitch amid repeated threats and new tests of missiles by Kim Jong-un .
`` He 's 27 years old . His father dies , took over a regime . So say what you want , but that is not easy , especially at that age , '' Trump said . `` I 'm not giving him credit or not giving him credit , I 'm just saying that 's a very hard thing to do . As to whether or not he 's rational , I have no opinion on it . I hope he 's rational , '' he said .
Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping is helping to mitigate the issue .
`` I believe he is trying very hard . He certainly doesn ’ t want to see turmoil and death . He doesn ’ t want to see it . He is a good man . He is a very good man , and I got to know him very well . ''
Trump spoke just a day after he and his top national security advisers briefed U.S. lawmakers on the North Korean threat and one day before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will press the United Nations Security Council on sanctions to further isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs .
The Trump administration on Wednesday declared North Korea `` an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority .

In an exclusive Oval Office interview with Reuters ahead of the 100-day benchmark in his administration, Trump candidly acknowledged that the international situation could go off the rails.

""There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,"" Trump said.

""There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea."" — President Trump

""We'd love to solve things diplomatically, but it's very difficult,"" he added.

Trump also said South Korea should pay for the $1 billion U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile defense system in place to protect it from an attack from the north.

The wide-ranging interview also included Trump's plan to defeat the Islamic State terror network.

""I have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation,"" he said, when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism.

But talk was dominated by the North Korea situation, which has vexed past presidents, but seems to have reached a fever pitch amid repeated threats and new tests of missiles by Kim Jong-un.

""He's 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want, but that is not easy, especially at that age,"" Trump said. ""I'm not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I'm just saying that's a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he's rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he's rational,"" he said.

Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping is helping to mitigate the issue.

""I believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesn’t want to see turmoil and death. He doesn’t want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man, and I got to know him very well.""

Trump spoke just a day after he and his top national security advisers briefed U.S. lawmakers on the North Korean threat and one day before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will press the United Nations Security Council on sanctions to further isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.

The Trump administration on Wednesday declared North Korea ""an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority."" It said it was focusing on economic and diplomatic pressure, including Chinese cooperation in containing its defiant neighbor and ally, and would remain open to negotiations.

U.S. officials said military strikes remained an option, but played down the prospect, though the administration has sent an aircraft carrier and a nuclear-powered submarine to the region in a show of force.

Any direct U.S. military action would run the risk of massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea, and among U.S. forces in both countries.

Most observers say the North is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile . U.S. officials have said they see no unusual military movements across the Demilitarized Zone that splits the Korean Peninsula , despite weeks of bombastic rhetoric from Pyongyang , and many analysts say the increasingly belligerent talk is aimed at cementing the authority of the country 's young leader , Kim Jong Un .
But the North does have plenty of conventional military firepower , including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles . And U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Wednesday that the North Korean threats to Guam , Hawaii and the U.S. mainland have to be taken seriously .
`` It only takes being wrong once , and I do n't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once , '' Hagel told an audience at Washington 's National Defense University .
But Hagel also said there was still a `` responsible '' path for the North to take .
`` I hope the North will ratchet this very dangerous rhetoric down , '' Hagel said . `` There is a pathway that is responsible for the North to get on a path to peace working with their neighbors . There are many , many benefits to their people that could come . But they have got to be a responsible member of the world community , and you do n't achieve that responsibility and peace and prosperity by making nuclear threats and taking very provocative actions . ''
The United States has in turn made a show of its military strength in the annual drills , flying B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons , Cold War-era B-52s and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over South Korea .
KCNA blamed the U.S. and its South Korean allies for the situation , however .
`` We formally inform the White House and Pentagon that the ever-escalating U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its reckless nuclear threat will be smashed by the strong will of all the united service personnel and people and cutting-edge smaller , lighter and diversified nuclear strike means of the DPRK and that the merciless operation of its revolutionary armed forces in this regard has been finally examined and ratified , '' it said . `` The U.S. had better ponder over the prevailing grave situation . ''
Caitlin Hayden , National Security Council spokeswoman , slammed North Korea 's statement as `` unhelpful and unconstructive . ''
`` It is yet another offering in a long line of provocative statements that only serve to further isolate North Korea from the rest of the international community and undermine its goal of economic development . North Korea should stop its provocative threats and instead concentrate on abiding by its international obligations , '' she said .
Robert Carlin , a North Korea expert at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University in California , told CNN that the rhetoric is still `` too hot . It needs to be cooled down . '' But he added , `` If we say that we do n't see any actions yet from them , I have to assume that the U.S. military still thinks the situation is under control . ''
North Korea 's Wednesday decision to prevent South Korean workers and managers from entering the Kaesong Industrial Complex , which sits on the North 's side of the border but houses operations of scores of South Korean companies , is a tangible sign of the tensions between the two sides .
North Korea has demanded the withdrawal of South Korean workers by April 10 from the complex , South Korean semi-official news agency Yonhap said Thursday . But South Korea 's ministry of unification denied the report .
It 's a move that could end up hurting Pyongyang financially , since Kaesong is considered to be an important source of hard currency for Kim 's government . More than 50,000 North Koreans work in the zone , producing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods each year .
Those workers earn on average $ 134 a month , of which North Korean authorities take about 45 % in various taxes .
The North had threatened over the weekend to shut down the industrial complex . North Korea has yet to grant permission for South Koreans to enter the complex , South Korea 's ministry of unification said Thursday . The nearly 800 South Koreans remaining inside the complex are still able to leave , the ministry said .

`` But if they did , the costs would be higher for the North than for the South , '' Haggard wrote in the article for the Peterson Institute for International Economics , a Washington-based research organization .
Seoul said it `` deeply regrets '' the North 's decision to stop South Koreans from entering Kaesong .
`` North Korea 's action creates a barrier to the stable operation '' of the complex , the South Korean Unification Ministry said in a statement , urging its neighbor to `` immediately normalize '' the entry and exit process .
And South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin said military action could be taken if the safety of the South Koreans in the zone were to come under threat .
`` If there is a serious situation , we are fully ready , including military measures , '' he said at a meeting of lawmakers , the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap reported .
The North has blocked the crossing into Kaesong before . In March 2009 , also during joint U.S.-South Korean military drills that it said were a threat , Pyongyang shut the border , temporarily trapping hundreds of South Korean workers in the industrial complex .
It allowed many of the stranded workers to return to South Korea the next day , and fully reopened the border about a week later without explaining its reversal . It was unclear whether the latest drama over Kaesong would play out in similar fashion .
At the start of the day , when the North informed the South that it would prevent new entries to the complex , there were 861 South Korean workers in there , according to the Unification Ministry . The North said it would continue to let people leave the zone .
Hundreds of workers rotate in and out of Kaesong each day in a series of scheduled entries and exits . Many of them stay there for several nights .
During the late morning and early afternoon exit windows , only a trickle of workers was seen returning to South Korea from Kaesong , far fewer than the scores who were registered to leave at those times . South Korean authorities did n't immediately provide an explanation for the discrepancy , saying the individual companies decide when to send workers back .
Kim Kyong-sin , the manager of a textile manufacturing company in Kaesong who came back into South Korea on Wednesday , said some people were staying in the complex because `` they are worried they might not be able to come back in . ''
During the March 2009 crisis , many South Korean companies with operations in the zone chose to keep more workers there to compensate for those not being allowed in . Kim said he was scheduled to go back into Kaesong on Thursday , but was n't optimistic .
`` I think if this continues there , business will be affected , '' Kim said . `` I think the damage will be serious . ''
U.S. and South Korean officials have kept up their criticism of the North 's actions in recent days .
John Kerry , the U.S. secretary of state , warned Tuesday that the United States will not accept North Korea as a `` nuclear state . ''
`` The bottom line is simply that what Kim Jong Un is choosing to do is provocative . It is dangerous , reckless , '' Kerry said during a joint briefing in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se .
`` And I reiterate again the United States will do what is necessary to defend ourselves and defend our allies , Korea and Japan , '' Kerry added . `` We are fully prepared and capable of doing so , and I think the DPRK understands that . ''

north_korea,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/23/politics/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-stakes/index.html,OPINION: Trump's North Korea summit was a history-making gamble. Now it may not happen.,2018-05-23,Analysis Stephen Collinson,"Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump 's spur-of-the-moment decision to agree to a face-to-face meeting with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un represented an unprecedented opportunity , but also a huge risk , most recently highlighted by a case of cold feet on both sides .
Anticipation about the June 12 meeting in Singapore is turning to pessimism , as the complexity of the initiative , the stark divides between Washington and Pyongyang , and inconsistencies in the White House 's approach to the meeting all become clear .
First , the Kim government threatened to pull out , blaming the `` repugnance '' of national security adviser John Bolton and his nuclear disarmament schemes .
Now Trump has switched from dreaming of Nobel prizes to warning that there is a `` very substantial chance '' that the meeting will not happen next month .
Trump is also speculating that China 's President Xi Jinping , who he called a `` world class poker player '' on Tuesday , may be behind Kim 's new hard line .
The atmosphere has soured from the euphoric optimism with which Trump welcomed home three US prisoners from North Korea two weeks ago to doubt and uncertainty .
There seems a good chance that the challenge coins minted by the White House Communications Agency to commemorate the summit may get left on the shelf .
`` If it does n't happen , maybe it 'll happen later . Maybe it 'll happen at a different time , but we will see , '' Trump said , alongside South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House on Tuesday .
So what is behind the sudden outburst of pessimism about what would be the most spectacular diplomatic summit in decades ?
One explanation is that both the United States and North Korea , as they get past the initial wave of enthusiasm after Trump agreed to meet Kim , are being reminded of just how intricate their differences are .
The idea that Kim would give up a nuclear arsenal his country has spent decades acquiring and that he sees as the guarantor of his dynastic rule always struck many people who have dealt with the North Koreans as farfetched .
The fact that goal seems so distant and could take years of painstaking negotiations to achieve after a Kim-Trump summit may be what is fueling rising skepticism among some White House officials that the summit will take place .
It 's conceivable that Kim may be realizing , as North Korea invited journalists to watch the destruction of a nuclear test site Tuesday , exactly what the kind of aggressive verification measures the US is demanding would mean for his country .
`` There is a whole lot of sites that are going to have to be shut down ( and ) inspected . This is going to take months and years , '' Michael Anton , Trump 's former National Security Council spokesman , said on CNN 's `` Erin Burnett OutFront . ''
JUST WATCHED Trump : Kim changed attitude after chat with Xi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump : Kim changed attitude after chat with Xi 01:02
The first sign of trouble came when Kim made an unexpected visit to China earlier this month to meet Xi and said he was aiming for a `` phased and synchronous '' process that would offer North Korea step-by-step rewards for renouncing its nuclear program .
That is exactly the approach that Trump says failed for previous administrations . This White House is telling the North Koreans they will get a bonanza of US private-sector investment only once the nuclear program is completely dismantled .
Then last week , Bolton went on television to tout his vision for a Libya-style export by North Korea of its nuclear weapons program -- without upfront incentives .
But when Kim hears Libya he thinks of the assassination of its longtime dictator , Moammar Gadhafi , after a NATO-led air operation in 2011 that may not have happened had he not previously given away a nuclear program that was far more rudimentary than North Korea 's .
In a bid to keep the summit on track , Trump hurriedly said last week that he was not contemplating using a Libya model for North Korea .
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that he was pressing ahead with plans for the summit -- and was not looking at any date other than June 12 .
`` We 're driving on . ... I am optimistic , but again this could be something that comes right to the end and does n't happen , '' Pompeo said .
The run-in to the summit is also being clouded by uncertainty over the shape of the administration 's position . Bolton 's comments have , for instance , sparked a backlash in the media and among experts in South Korea .
The confusion is bearing out warnings by former officials that the Trump administration should have gotten its ducks in a row before agreeing to a summit .
`` We are bumbling into this summit where there is no agreement even among the members of the US administration about where this is going and what are our goals , '' Jamie Metzl , who served on President Bill Clinton 's National Security Council , told CNN 's Jake Tapper on `` The Lead . ''
JUST WATCHED Haley : Trump 's unpredictability helped with NK Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Haley : Trump 's unpredictability helped with NK 01:32
Tough talk from Trump and other members of the administration on what will happen to Kim if he does n't toe the US line may also risk alienating the North Koreans .
`` This will only end like the Libyan model ended if Kim Jong Un does n't make a deal , '' Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News on Monday .
Michael Green , who served as the top White House East Asia hand in the George W. Bush administration , said such rhetoric could play poorly in Pyongyang .
`` The rhetoric matters , and we know the North Koreans are very sensitive and very insecure about any narrative about assassination , '' Green told CNN 's Brian Todd .
Some analysts believe that the summit is so politically valuable to Trump that he will do almost anything to keep it on the schedule . Indeed , on Tuesday , he guaranteed Kim 's safety if he gives up nuclear arms . The President has described Kim as `` open '' and `` very honorable '' in recent weeks , an outburst of flattery apparently designed to bring him to the table .
The President relishes dramatic made-for-television occasions that capture the world 's attention . The administration has also argued that his North Korea diplomacy is one reason why he should not be distracted by Robert Mueller 's special counsel probe . And Republicans hope to use the summit to shape a `` peace and prosperity '' campaign in tough midterm elections in November .
By expressing public doubts about the summit actually taking place , Trump could also be following his customary habit of building suspense ahead of a big show .
`` Whether the deal gets made or not , who knows . It 's a deal . Who knows . You never know about deals . You go into deals that are 100 % certain , it does n't happen . You go into deals that have no chance , and it happens , and sometimes happens easily , '' Trump told reporters Tuesday .
Alternatively , by playing down expectations that the summit will happen the President could be preparing a face-saving exit for himself -- or indulging in a bit of pre-summit negotiating -- on television where Kim can see exactly what he is saying .
Whatever the motivations of the key players , though , the risks of the diplomatic process crashing to a halt are grave , given that a return to the `` fire and fury '' rhetoric of last year could take the US and North Korea back to the brink of what would be a disastrous war for everyone .","Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's spur-of-the-moment decision to agree to a face-to-face meeting with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un represented an unprecedented opportunity, but also a huge risk, most recently highlighted by a case of cold feet on both sides.

It's conceivable that Kim may be realizing, as North Korea invited journalists to watch the destruction of a nuclear test site Tuesday, exactly what the kind of aggressive verification measures the US is demanding would mean for his country.

""There is a whole lot of sites that are going to have to be shut down (and) inspected. This is going to take months and years,"" Michael Anton, Trump's former National Security Council spokesman, said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront.""

Trouble

The first sign of trouble came when Kim made an unexpected visit to China earlier this month to meet Xi and said he was aiming for a ""phased and synchronous"" process that would offer North Korea step-by-step rewards for renouncing its nuclear program.

That is exactly the approach that Trump says failed for previous administrations. This White House is telling the North Koreans they will get a bonanza of US private-sector investment only once the nuclear program is completely dismantled.

Then last week, Bolton went on television to tout his vision for a Libya-style export by North Korea of its nuclear weapons program -- without upfront incentives.

But when Kim hears Libya he thinks of the assassination of its longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, after a NATO-led air operation in 2011 that may not have happened had he not previously given away a nuclear program that was far more rudimentary than North Korea's.

In a bid to keep the summit on track, Trump hurriedly said last week that he was not contemplating using a Libya model for North Korea.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that he was pressing ahead with plans for the summit -- and was not looking at any date other than June 12.

""We're driving on. ... I am optimistic, but again this could be something that comes right to the end and doesn't happen,"" Pompeo said.

The run-in to the summit is also being clouded by uncertainty over the shape of the administration's position. Bolton's comments have, for instance, sparked a backlash in the media and among experts in South Korea.

The confusion is bearing out warnings by former officials that the Trump administration should have gotten its ducks in a row before agreeing to a summit.

""We are bumbling into this summit where there is no agreement even among the members of the US administration about where this is going and what are our goals,"" Jamie Metzl, who served on President Bill Clinton's National Security Council, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead.""

Tough talk

Tough talk from Trump and other members of the administration on what will happen to Kim if he doesn't toe the US line may also risk alienating the North Koreans.

""This will only end like the Libyan model ended if Kim Jong Un doesn't make a deal,"" Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News on Monday.

Michael Green, who served as the top White House East Asia hand in the George W. Bush administration, said such rhetoric could play poorly in Pyongyang.

""The rhetoric matters, and we know the North Koreans are very sensitive and very insecure about any narrative about assassination,"" Green told CNN's Brian Todd.

Some analysts believe that the summit is so politically valuable to Trump that he will do almost anything to keep it on the schedule. Indeed, on Tuesday, he guaranteed Kim's safety if he gives up nuclear arms. The President has described Kim as ""open"" and ""very honorable"" in recent weeks, an outburst of flattery apparently designed to bring him to the table.

The President relishes dramatic made-for-television occasions that capture the world's attention. The administration has also argued that his North Korea diplomacy is one reason why he should not be distracted by Robert Mueller's special counsel probe. And Republicans hope to use the summit to shape a ""peace and prosperity"" campaign in tough midterm elections in November.

By expressing public doubts about the summit actually taking place, Trump could also be following his customary habit of building suspense ahead of a big show.

""Whether the deal gets made or not, who knows. It's a deal. Who knows. You never know about deals. You go into deals that are 100% certain, it doesn't happen. You go into deals that have no chance, and it happens, and sometimes happens easily,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday.

Alternatively, by playing down expectations that the summit will happen the President could be preparing a face-saving exit for himself -- or indulging in a bit of pre-summit negotiating -- on television where Kim can see exactly what he is saying.

Whatever the motivations of the key players, though, the risks of the diplomatic process crashing to a halt are grave, given that a return to the ""fire and fury"" rhetoric of last year could take the US and North Korea back to the brink of what would be a disastrous war for everyone.",www.cnn.com,left,xAXTj7JW8JdXEP01

north_korea,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/10/14/north-korea-leader-kim-jong-un-reappears-with-cane/,Kim Jong Un mystery: Health questions remain as leader resurfaces with cane,2014-10-14,,"After vanishing from the public eye for nearly six weeks , North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is back , ending rumors that he was gravely ill , deposed or worse .
Now , a new , albeit smaller , mystery has emerged : Why the cane ?
Kim , who was last seen publicly at a Sept. 3 concert , appeared in images released by state media Tuesday smiling broadly and supporting himself with a walking stick while touring the newly built Wisong Scientists Residential District and another new institute in Pyongyang , part of his regular `` field guidance '' tours . The North did n't say when the visit happened , nor did it address the leader 's health .
Kim 's appearance allowed the country 's massive propaganda apparatus to continue doing what it does best — glorify the third generation of Kim family rule . And it will tamp down , at least for the moment , rampant rumors of a coup and serious health problems .
Before Tuesday , Kim missed several high-profile events that he normally attends and was described in an official documentary last month as experiencing `` discomfort . ''
Archive footage from August showed him overweight and limping , prompting the South Korean media to speculate he had undergone surgery on his ankles . Some experts thought he was suffering from gout or diabetes .
A South Korean analyst said Kim probably broke his media silence to dispel outside speculation that he was n't in control and to win sympathy from a domestic audience by creating the image of a leader who works through pain .
The appearance may be a form of `` emotional politics meant to appeal to the North Korean people 's sympathy , '' said Cheong Seong-chang , at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea .
It was the first time a North Korean leader allowed himself to be seen relying on a cane or crutch , South Korean officials said . Kim 's father , Kim Jong Il , who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008 before dying of a heart attack in late 2011 , was seen limping but never with a walking stick , nor was the country 's founder and Kim Jong Un 's grandfather , Kim Il Sung , said Lim Byeong Cheol , a spokesman from Seoul 's Unification Ministry .

Kim `` appears to want to show people that he 's doing fine , though he 's indeed still having some discomfort . If he had n't done so , excessive speculation would have continued to flare up and anxiety among North Korean residents would have grown and calls by outsiders for contingency plans on dealing with North Korea would have gotten momentum , '' Cheong said .
The South Korean government has all along seen no signals of any major problems .
In deciding to resume his public activity before fully recovering from his condition , Kim was looking to quickly quell rumors that his health problems were serious enough to threaten his status as North Korean leader , said Lim , the government spokesman .
`` The cane aside , he looked to be in good health , '' Lim said .
The recent absence was , in part , `` probably an attention-getting device — and it certainly works , '' Bruce Cumings , an expert on Korea at the University of Chicago , said in an email .
`` The North has been on a diplomatic offensive in Europe and elsewhere , it feels isolated — and is , if we 're talking about relations with Washington , '' he wrote . `` All this puts them back on the front page . ''","After vanishing from the public eye for nearly six weeks, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is back, ending rumors that he was gravely ill, deposed or worse.

Now, a new, albeit smaller, mystery has emerged: Why the cane?

Kim, who was last seen publicly at a Sept. 3 concert, appeared in images released by state media Tuesday smiling broadly and supporting himself with a walking stick while touring the newly built Wisong Scientists Residential District and another new institute in Pyongyang, part of his regular ""field guidance"" tours. The North didn't say when the visit happened, nor did it address the leader's health.

Kim's appearance allowed the country's massive propaganda apparatus to continue doing what it does best — glorify the third generation of Kim family rule. And it will tamp down, at least for the moment, rampant rumors of a coup and serious health problems.

Before Tuesday, Kim missed several high-profile events that he normally attends and was described in an official documentary last month as experiencing ""discomfort.""

Archive footage from August showed him overweight and limping, prompting the South Korean media to speculate he had undergone surgery on his ankles. Some experts thought he was suffering from gout or diabetes.

A South Korean analyst said Kim probably broke his media silence to dispel outside speculation that he wasn't in control and to win sympathy from a domestic audience by creating the image of a leader who works through pain.

The appearance may be a form of ""emotional politics meant to appeal to the North Korean people's sympathy,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.

It was the first time a North Korean leader allowed himself to be seen relying on a cane or crutch, South Korean officials said. Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008 before dying of a heart attack in late 2011, was seen limping but never with a walking stick, nor was the country's founder and Kim Jong Un's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, said Lim Byeong Cheol, a spokesman from Seoul's Unification Ministry.

Cheong said Kim appeared in the recently released images to have lost about 22 pounds compared to pictures from May. He speculated that since Kim was holding a cane on his left side he may have had surgery on his left ankle.

Kim ""appears to want to show people that he's doing fine, though he's indeed still having some discomfort. If he hadn't done so, excessive speculation would have continued to flare up and anxiety among North Korean residents would have grown and calls by outsiders for contingency plans on dealing with North Korea would have gotten momentum,"" Cheong said.

The South Korean government has all along seen no signals of any major problems.

China has said it is ""irresponsible"" of President Trump to suggest it was not putting enough pressure on North Korea over its nuclear programme.

Mr Trump had tweeted that China was ""not helping"" because of trade tensions with the US.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said this was ""contrary to basic facts"" and China was ""seriously concerned"".

On Thursday Mr Trump called off US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's planned trip to North Korea.

He said that insufficient progress was being made in dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear programme.

After his summit with the North Korean leader in June, Mr Trump said the country was no longer a nuclear threat.

But since then there have been several reports that it is failing to dismantle its nuclear facilities.

One of the most recent warnings came from unnamed US officials, who told the Washington Post that North Korea appeared to be building new intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The UN's nuclear agency (IAEA) has also said North Korea is continuing with its nuclear programme.

Meanwhile the second in a new series of family reunions for North and South Koreans separated by the war 65 years ago has taken place in a North Korean tourist resort.

Some 326 South Koreans from 81 families met their long-lost relatives, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.

What is the US-China trade issue?

Beijing is Pyongyang's only significant ally and Washington's most powerful long-term strategic rival in the region.

The two powers are currently embroiled in a tit-for-tat tariff war after Mr Trump complained about the size of the US trade deficit with China and what Washington sees as other unfair trade practices.

Each side has now imposed 25% tariffs on a total of $50bn of one another's goods.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has visited Chinese leader Xi Jinping several times this year, including a visit shortly after his summit with Mr Trump.

What is Mr Trump's latest line?

Mr Pompeo was due to head to Pyongyang next week with his newly appointed special envoy for North Korea - Stephen Biegun, a retiring Ford executive.

It would have been the secretary of state's fourth trip, though he was not expected to meet Mr Kim.

Mr Pompeo might still make another trip though.

How much of a shift is this?

""There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea,"" Mr Trump tweeted on arriving back in the US from the June summit with Mr Kim in Singapore.

""Everybody can feel much safer,"" he said.

After the optimism of Singapore, the latest development might seem like quite a change.

That 's according to South Korea 's intelligence service ( NIS ) , which has a history of exaggerating reports about North Korea that make the country look bad . Indeed , while South Korean lawmakers at first described the NIS as categorically stating that Hyon had definitely been executed , the NIS later told the press that they were certain Hyon had been purged , and that they believed with confidence that he had been executed , but were still working to verify the latter .
In any case , there 's reason to believe this could have actually happened — and that it could speak volumes about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un 's hold on power .

( You can bet the truth is probably closer to second-guessing , or outright insubordination , than it is to unauthorized napping . ) On April 30 , Hyon was stood before an anti-aircraft gun — which is essentially a mobile platform of four machine guns large and powerful enough to shoot down an airplane — and executed .

These executions appear to be much more common under his rule than they were under his father or grandfather . The uncle who was rumored to have been killed by dogs , for example , turned out to have more likely been executed by anti-aircraft gun .

'
President Donald Trump welcomed home three Americans formerly imprisoned by North Korea on Thursday , greeting them in a dramatic scene that played out in the early morning hours on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews .
The three released prisoners landed Thursday at the Maryland military facility , the home base for Air Force One , at 2:42 a.m. , where they were greeted by President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence and their respective wives . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , who had secured the release of the men on a Wednesday trip to North Korea and arrived at Andrews minutes earlier on his own plane , also greeted the men .
“ We want to thank Kim Jong Un , ” Trump said after emerging from the medical plane that transported the three prisoners , which he and his wife had boarded to greet the men . “ We very much appreciate that he allowed them to go before the meeting . He was nice in letting them go before the meeting … That was a big thing , very important to me . ”
Andrews was decorated for the occasion with a massive American flag hanging from the ladders of two fire trucks . Trump joked with reporters that the event “ probably broke the all time in history television rating for three o ’ clock in the morning . ”
After arriving , the prisoners were taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland , for further evaluation and medical treatment . The three men are Korean-Americans Kim Dong Chul , Kim Sang-duk ( also known as Tony Kim ) , and Kim Hak-song . North Korea accused them of anti-state activities .

Pompeo , who flew the three prisoners out of North Korea on his plane Wednesday to Yokota Air Base outside Tokyo , told reporters then that the three men were in good health considering what they had been through and had been able to board the plane in Pyongyang without assistance . In Japan , the former detainees boarded a separate plane that offered better medical facilities , trailing Pompeo first to Anchorage , Alaska , for refueling and then to Andrews .
The release is seen as a further sign of thawing relations between the U.S. and North Korea , after Kim last month pledged to suspend missile tests and close a nuclear test site . But it also comes amid renewed uncertainty around how the summit will pan out , after Trump ’ s decision earlier this week to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal .
Pompeo ’ s trip to Pyongyang was scheduled to coincide with the president ’ s decision to remove the U.S. from the Iran agreement , a move intended to signal progress on one foreign policy front even as the administration withdrew from one of the signature diplomatic deals struck by former President Barack Obama .
Plans for a meeting between Trump and Kim mark a dramatic shift in the relationship between the two men , who spent weeks last summer hurling threats and insults at one another across the Pacific Ocean . A meeting between a sitting U.S. president and the leader of North Korea would be a historic first , and Pompeo ’ s first visit to North Korea over Easter weekend marked the first known meeting between a U.S. official and a North Korean leader since then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong Il , Kim Jong Un ’ s father , in 2000 .
“ My proudest achievement will be when we denuclearize that entire peninsula , ” Trump said . “ This is what people have been waiting a long time for . I ’ m very honored to free the three folks . The true honor is going to be if we have a victory in getting rid of nuclear weapons . ”
Trump predicted that his planned meeting with Kim would be “ a very big success ” and suggested that his relationship with the North Korean leader is “ starting off on a new footing. ” Asked if he might visit North Korea , Trump responded “ it could happen . ”
“ I really think he wants to do something . I think he did this because I really think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world . I really believe that , ” Trump said .
The ex-detainees thanked Trump for securing their freedom in a statement released by the State Department on their behalf and one spoke briefly with reporters through a translator . The man said the three prisoners “ were treated in many different ways ” and that he had been forced to do hard labor but also received medical treatment when he was sick . Their release , he said , is “ like a dream we are very , very happy , ” he said .
“ We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government , President Trump , Secretary Pompeo , and the people of the United States for bringing us home , ” the former prisoners said in their statement . “ We thank God , and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return . God Bless America , the greatest nation in the world . ”","Trump thanks Kim Jong Un as he welcomes home detainees from North Korea The president also jokes that the event 'probably broke the all time in history television rating for three o’clock in the morning.'

The three released prisoners landed Thursday at the Maryland military facility, the home base for Air Force One, at 2:42 a.m., where they were greeted by President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their respective wives. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had secured the release of the men on a Wednesday trip to North Korea and arrived at Andrews minutes earlier on his own plane, also greeted the men.

“We want to thank Kim Jong Un,” Trump said after emerging from the medical plane that transported the three prisoners, which he and his wife had boarded to greet the men. “We very much appreciate that he allowed them to go before the meeting. He was nice in letting them go before the meeting … That was a big thing, very important to me.”

Andrews was decorated for the occasion with a massive American flag hanging from the ladders of two fire trucks. Trump joked with reporters that the event “probably broke the all time in history television rating for three o’clock in the morning.”

After arriving, the prisoners were taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for further evaluation and medical treatment. The three men are Korean-Americans Kim Dong Chul, Kim Sang-duk (also known as Tony Kim), and Kim Hak-song. North Korea accused them of anti-state activities.

Pompeo, who flew the three prisoners out of North Korea on his plane Wednesday to Yokota Air Base outside Tokyo, told reporters then that the three men were in good health considering what they had been through and had been able to board the plane in Pyongyang without assistance. In Japan, the former detainees boarded a separate plane that offered better medical facilities, trailing Pompeo first to Anchorage, Alaska, for refueling and then to Andrews.

The release is seen as a further sign of thawing relations between the U.S. and North Korea, after Kim last month pledged to suspend missile tests and close a nuclear test site. But it also comes amid renewed uncertainty around how the summit will pan out, after Trump’s decision earlier this week to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Pompeo’s trip to Pyongyang was scheduled to coincide with the president’s decision to remove the U.S. from the Iran agreement, a move intended to signal progress on one foreign policy front even as the administration withdrew from one of the signature diplomatic deals struck by former President Barack Obama.

Plans for a meeting between Trump and Kim mark a dramatic shift in the relationship between the two men, who spent weeks last summer hurling threats and insults at one another across the Pacific Ocean. A meeting between a sitting U.S. president and the leader of North Korea would be a historic first, and Pompeo’s first visit to North Korea over Easter weekend marked the first known meeting between a U.S. official and a North Korean leader since then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un’s father, in 2000.

“My proudest achievement will be when we denuclearize that entire peninsula,” Trump said. “This is what people have been waiting a long time for. I’m very honored to free the three folks. The true honor is going to be if we have a victory in getting rid of nuclear weapons.”

Trump predicted that his planned meeting with Kim would be “a very big success” and suggested that his relationship with the North Korean leader is “starting off on a new footing.” Asked if he might visit North Korea, Trump responded “it could happen.”

“I really think he wants to do something. I think he did this because I really think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world. I really believe that,” Trump said.

The ex-detainees thanked Trump for securing their freedom in a statement released by the State Department on their behalf and one spoke briefly with reporters through a translator. The man said the three prisoners “were treated in many different ways” and that he had been forced to do hard labor but also received medical treatment when he was sick. Their release, he said, is “like a dream we are very, very happy,” he said.

“We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,” the former prisoners said in their statement. “We thank God, and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return. God Bless America, the greatest nation in the world.”",www.politico.com,left,pYGFpIghfWzbv3F7

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Hours before flying to Vietnam for another face-to-face meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, President Donald Trump raised the possibility that the reclusive state could reap economic benefits from working with the United States on denuclearization.

Trump has maintained punishing economic sanctions on North Korea, even as he has touted his ""very good relationship"" with Kim. But the president has also held out what he describes as the economic benefits for North Korea if it chooses to denuclearize.

""I think he’ll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy,"" Trump told governors at the White House who are gathered in Washington for an annual meeting.""We want denuclearization,""

Kim has shown little sign he intends to take concrete steps toward denuclearization. Members of Trump's administration – including Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence – have said Kim views his nuclear arsenal as critical for survival.

Trump-Kim summit:North Korea must do something 'meaningful' for sanctions relief

Trump, who leaves for Vietnam Monday afternoon, has lowered expectations for the summit's success, saying he's ""in no rush"" for North Korea denuclearize as long as the country continues to hold off on testing of nuclear weapons and missiles. North Korea last tested a missile in November, an ICBM that experts said could reach the United States. He said Monday he expected a ""tremendous"" summit with the North Korean leader.

Trump departs later on Monday for Hanoi to participate in two days of meetings with Kim, a sequel to their historic first meeting last June in Singapore.

The president has previously said he would not lift sanctions unless the country agrees to denuclearize. Kim and other North Korea officials, however, said they want the United States to first lift at least some of the sanctions that are crippling their economy.

That standoff is likely to dominate the proceedings in Vietnam.

North Korea's nuclear chest-beating has achieved the seemingly impossible by aligning the concerns of South Korea, Japan and even China, three Asian neighbors that have a long history of strained ties.

SOUTH KOREA

North Korea's saber-rattling is heard loudest just south of the Demilitarized Zone. Memories of the the Korean War are never far from the surface, and are periodically refreshed by events such as a 2010 torpedo attack on a South Korean ship that killed 46 sailors. Pyongyang followed up that attack by shelling the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong.

A South Korean military official told the Yonhap news agency that the North Korean vessel retreated northward after the warning shots were fired into the water . However , the incident underscores the heightened hostilities between the two Koreas .
The brief encounter came hours after the United Nations Security Council condemned North Korea 's launch of a long-range rocket that world leaders described as a banned test of ballistic missile technology and South Korea 's president called another `` intolerable provocation . ''
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un went ahead with the launch just two hours after an eight-day window opened early Sunday , and a month after the country 's fourth nuclear test . He ignored an appeal from China , its neighbor and important ally , not to proceed , and , in another slap to Beijing , he chose to launch the rocket on the eve of Chinese New Year , the country 's most important holiday .
China and the United States have been negotiating the text of a new Security Council sanctions resolution since Pyongyang 's Jan. 6 nuclear test , which it claimed was a hydrogen bomb . That claim has been met with outside skepticism .
The U.S. , backed by Japan and South Korea , wants tough U.N. sanctions reflecting Kim 's defiance of the Security Council . But diplomats say China , the North 's key protector in the council , is reluctant to impose economic measures that could cause North Korea 's economy to collapse — and a flight of North Koreans into China across their shared border .
The 15-member Security Council strongly condemned the launch and pledged to `` expeditiously '' adopt a new resolution with `` further significant measures '' — U.N. code for sanctions . The word `` robust '' referring to the measures was in an initial draft , but was dropped in the final statement .
U.S . Ambassador Samantha Power told reporters that `` it can not be business as usual '' after two successive North Korean acts that are `` hostile and illegal . ''
`` What 's important is that the Security Council unites , '' Power said . `` China is a critical player . ... We are hopeful that China , like all council members , will see the grave threat to regional and international peace and security , see the importance of adopting tough , unprecedented measures , breaking new ground here , exceeding the expectations of Kim Jong Un . ''
However , China 's U.N. ambassador , Liu Jieyi , made clear that unprecedented sanctions are n't Beijing 's priority .
He said a new resolution should `` do the work of reducing tension , of working toward denuclearization ( of the Korean peninsula ) , of maintaining peace and stability , and of encouraging a negotiated solution . ''
`` I believe the council needs to work together for a new resolution , '' Liu added , indicating that China may want negotiations with the United States to be widened .
Russia 's U.N. ambassador , Vitaly Churkin , whose country is also a North Korean ally , said : `` It has to be a weighty resolution , but it also has to be a reasonable resolution '' that does n't lead to North Korea 's economic or humanitarian collapse , or further heighten tensions .
Russia 's goal is to see six-party talks aimed at denuclearization resume , he said , but in the current atmosphere that 's unlikely because the North Koreans `` have been very unreasonable '' and are challenging the entire international community .
`` We think this is wrong for their national interests ... for the Korean Peninsula ... for the region , '' Churkin said .
North Korea , which calls its launches part of a peaceful space program , said it had successfully put a new Earth observation satellite , the Kwangmyongsong 4 , or Shining Star 4 , into orbit less than 10 minutes after liftoff , and vowed more such launches . A U.S. official said it might take days to assess whether the launch was a success .
But in Pyongyang , North Koreans celebrated the launch with an official fireworks display Monday night , state broadcaster KCTV reported , according to CNN .
Japan 's U.N. ambassador , Motohide Yoshikawa , told reporters the missile , which went over Japan and landed near the Philippines , was `` a clear threat to the lives of many people . ''
The Security Council underscored that launches using ballistic missile technology , `` even if characterized as a satellite launch or space launch vehicle '' contribute to North Korea 's development of systems to deliver nuclear weapons and violate four Security Council resolutions dating back to the North 's first nuclear test in 2006 .
North Korea under Kim Jong Un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy meant to collapse Kim 's government .
In a development that will worry both Pyongyang and Beijing , a senior South Korean Defense Ministry official , Yoo Jeh Seung , told reporters that Seoul and Washington have agreed to begin talks on a possible deployment of the THAAD missile-defense system in South Korea . North Korea has long decried the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea , and Beijing would see a South Korean deployment of THAAD , which is one of the world 's most advanced missile-defense systems , as a threat to its interests in the region .
In a statement , North Korea 's National Aerospace Development Administration , in typical propaganda-laden language , praised `` the fascinating vapor of Juche satellite trailing in the clear and blue sky in spring of February on the threshold of the Day of the Shining Star . ''
Juche is a North Korean philosophy focusing on self-reliance ; the Day of the Shining Star refers to the Feb. 16 birthday of Kim Jong Un 's father , former dictator Kim Jong Il . North Korea has previously staged rocket launches to mark important anniversaries .","A South Korean naval vessel fired five shots as a warning to a North Korean patrol boat that briefly moved south of the countries' disputed boundary line in the Yellow Sea, Seoul's defense ministry said Monday.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un went ahead with the launch just two hours after an eight-day window opened early Sunday, and a month after the country's fourth nuclear test. He ignored an appeal from China, its neighbor and important ally, not to proceed, and, in another slap to Beijing, he chose to launch the rocket on the eve of Chinese New Year, the country's most important holiday.

China and the United States have been negotiating the text of a new Security Council sanctions resolution since Pyongyang's Jan. 6 nuclear test, which it claimed was a hydrogen bomb. That claim has been met with outside skepticism.

The U.S., backed by Japan and South Korea, wants tough U.N. sanctions reflecting Kim's defiance of the Security Council. But diplomats say China, the North's key protector in the council, is reluctant to impose economic measures that could cause North Korea's economy to collapse — and a flight of North Koreans into China across their shared border.

The 15-member Security Council strongly condemned the launch and pledged to ""expeditiously"" adopt a new resolution with ""further significant measures"" — U.N. code for sanctions. The word ""robust"" referring to the measures was in an initial draft, but was dropped in the final statement.

U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told reporters that ""it cannot be business as usual"" after two successive North Korean acts that are ""hostile and illegal.""

""What's important is that the Security Council unites,"" Power said. ""China is a critical player. ... We are hopeful that China, like all council members, will see the grave threat to regional and international peace and security, see the importance of adopting tough, unprecedented measures, breaking new ground here, exceeding the expectations of Kim Jong Un.""

However, China's U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, made clear that unprecedented sanctions aren't Beijing's priority.

He said a new resolution should ""do the work of reducing tension, of working toward denuclearization (of the Korean peninsula), of maintaining peace and stability, and of encouraging a negotiated solution.""

""I believe the council needs to work together for a new resolution,"" Liu added, indicating that China may want negotiations with the United States to be widened.

Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, whose country is also a North Korean ally, said: ""It has to be a weighty resolution, but it also has to be a reasonable resolution"" that doesn't lead to North Korea's economic or humanitarian collapse, or further heighten tensions.

Russia's goal is to see six-party talks aimed at denuclearization resume, he said, but in the current atmosphere that's unlikely because the North Koreans ""have been very unreasonable"" and are challenging the entire international community.

""We think this is wrong for their national interests ... for the Korean Peninsula ... for the region,"" Churkin said.

North Korea, which calls its launches part of a peaceful space program, said it had successfully put a new Earth observation satellite, the Kwangmyongsong 4, or Shining Star 4, into orbit less than 10 minutes after liftoff, and vowed more such launches. A U.S. official said it might take days to assess whether the launch was a success.

But in Pyongyang, North Koreans celebrated the launch with an official fireworks display Monday night, state broadcaster KCTV reported, according to CNN.

Japan's U.N. ambassador, Motohide Yoshikawa, told reporters the missile, which went over Japan and landed near the Philippines, was ""a clear threat to the lives of many people.""

The Security Council underscored that launches using ballistic missile technology, ""even if characterized as a satellite launch or space launch vehicle"" contribute to North Korea's development of systems to deliver nuclear weapons and violate four Security Council resolutions dating back to the North's first nuclear test in 2006.

North Korea under Kim Jong Un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy meant to collapse Kim's government.

In a development that will worry both Pyongyang and Beijing, a senior South Korean Defense Ministry official, Yoo Jeh Seung, told reporters that Seoul and Washington have agreed to begin talks on a possible deployment of the THAAD missile-defense system in South Korea. North Korea has long decried the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, and Beijing would see a South Korean deployment of THAAD, which is one of the world's most advanced missile-defense systems, as a threat to its interests in the region.

In a statement, North Korea's National Aerospace Development Administration, in typical propaganda-laden language, praised ""the fascinating vapor of Juche satellite trailing in the clear and blue sky in spring of February on the threshold of the Day of the Shining Star.""

Juche is a North Korean philosophy focusing on self-reliance; the Day of the Shining Star refers to the Feb. 16 birthday of Kim Jong Un's father, former dictator Kim Jong Il. North Korea has previously staged rocket launches to mark important anniversaries.

Following a historic meeting between North Korea 's Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in , the leaders appeared side by side to make an extraordinary announcement : The two nations — technically in a state of war for more than six decades — would work toward a permanent peace treaty and the elimination of nuclear weapons from the peninsula .
`` I am very proud to say that I pay tribute to the bold and courageous decision taken by Chairman Kim , '' Moon said , saying the two sides had agreed to a peace treaty and the `` complete denuclearization '' of the Korean Peninsula .
`` We have long hoped for this moment to arrive , '' Kim , standing next to Moon , said .
`` We are not people who should be confronting each other , '' the North Korean leader said . `` We should be living in unity . ''
While the agreement contains lofty language , it will be up to diplomats , bureaucrats and militaries on both sides to work through specific steps to reach those goals . And the effort will require detailed negotiation between both Koreas and the United States , which could take months , if not years , to conclude .
For now , the agreement mentions denuclearization but does n't offer specific steps , which will lead to a lot of skepticism about how committed the North is given its past abandonment of denuclearization agreements .
The day began with a handshake that symbolized hope that two Koreas could create a lasting rapprochement .
Kim , flanked by bodyguards in matching black suits , stepped out of a building on the northern side of the village of Panmunjom , where the two sides ended the Korean War in 1953 with a simple truce , but no broader peace treaty . Notably absent in this shared security zone were the dozens of armed soldiers who typically stand guard near the military demarcation line .
Two previous summits , in 2000 and 2007 , were unable to make progress on the most pressing issue — the North 's pursuit of nuclear weapons .
The nuclear question looms even larger this time around — in the past year , Pyongyang has not only demonstrated its ability to produce such weapons but also the potential to deliver them via long-range ballistic missiles that can reach as far as the continental United States .
The Blue House , South Korea 's presidential residence , said the two leaders had a `` frank discussion '' in a morning session , which included the subject of denuclearization .
A year of especially serious tensions leading up to Friday was followed by a sudden thaw and an offer by Kim in recent weeks to meet with President Trump . Mere months ago , the two leaders were trading insults and threatening to wage war . However , the White House appears to be taking Kim 's offer seriously and the two men could meet as soon as next month .
Moon , on the south side of the border , walked over to meet Kim so that their handshake could be photographed at the symbolic military demarcation line that divides the North from South .
In the meticulously choreographed ceremony , hands clasped and Moon invited Kim over an ankle-high concrete barrier that divides the two countries — the first time the North Korean leader — or any North Korean leader — had ever set foot in the South .
Then Kim gestured to Moon to take a step into the North , which the South Korean leader did . The presidential office later said that the unscripted moment came after Moon said he wanted to visit North Korea someday . Kim reacted quickly by offering to have him step right over to the northern side for a few moments , before they crossed back over to the South , hand in hand .
They walked side by side down a red carpet , observed a brightly-colored traditional Korean honor guard ceremony , before proceeding into the three-story Peace House for their summit .
Entering the Peace House , Kim wrote in the guest book : `` New history starts from now , at the historic starting point of an era of peace . ''
The pair posed for photos in front of a picture of North Korea 's Mount Geumgangsan , which has special significance for all Koreans dating to before the Middle Ages .
Kim Yong Chol , the head of North Korea 's national intelligence service , began clapping and others from both sides joined in .
`` It feels embarrassing to be applauded just for shaking hands , '' the North Korean leader said , but acknowledged , `` The norms are changing . ''
`` Did that make for a good picture ? '' he asked as journalists and others laughed .
Once seated inside , Kim quipped that he brought Pyongyang 's famous naengmyeon , cold noodles , `` from far away , '' then corrected himself to say it was n't so far away at all .
The two leaders and their wives were expected to attend a dinner banquet Friday evening , featuring the noodles brought from the North .
Even with the outward appearance of geniality , however , lingering suspicions were evident : After Moon stepped out of Peace House , two North Korean security guards swept into the lobby , sprayed the chair at the guestbook signing desk with sanitizer and wiped it down . They also cleaned the guestbook and pen with sanitizer — twice . Then the guards used electronic gear to scan the chair and signing desk .
The reason ? A South Korean security guard told reporters that their North Korean counterparts were checking for explosives and recording devices .
After separate lunches , the two leaders commemorated the summit by shoveling soil around a pine tree and then sprinkling it with water from South Korea 's Han River and North Korea 's Taedong River .
Moon and Kim then walked away from the cameras and microphones and sat at a bench to have a conversation without their aides . For much of that lengthy discussion , Kim could be seen listening intently to Moon , smiling and laughing at times .

""We have long hoped for this moment to arrive,"" Kim, standing next to Moon, said.

""We are not people who should be confronting each other,"" the North Korean leader said. ""We should be living in unity.""

While the agreement contains lofty language, it will be up to diplomats, bureaucrats and militaries on both sides to work through specific steps to reach those goals. And the effort will require detailed negotiation between both Koreas and the United States, which could take months, if not years, to conclude.

For now, the agreement mentions denuclearization but doesn't offer specific steps, which will lead to a lot of skepticism about how committed the North is given its past abandonment of denuclearization agreements.

The day began with a handshake that symbolized hope that two Koreas could create a lasting rapprochement.

Kim, flanked by bodyguards in matching black suits, stepped out of a building on the northern side of the village of Panmunjom, where the two sides ended the Korean War in 1953 with a simple truce, but no broader peace treaty. Notably absent in this shared security zone were the dozens of armed soldiers who typically stand guard near the military demarcation line.

Two previous summits, in 2000 and 2007, were unable to make progress on the most pressing issue — the North's pursuit of nuclear weapons.

The nuclear question looms even larger this time around — in the past year, Pyongyang has not only demonstrated its ability to produce such weapons but also the potential to deliver them via long-range ballistic missiles that can reach as far as the continental United States.

The Blue House, South Korea's presidential residence, said the two leaders had a ""frank discussion"" in a morning session, which included the subject of denuclearization.

A year of especially serious tensions leading up to Friday was followed by a sudden thaw and an offer by Kim in recent weeks to meet with President Trump. Mere months ago, the two leaders were trading insults and threatening to wage war. However, the White House appears to be taking Kim's offer seriously and the two men could meet as soon as next month.

At Panmunjom, Kim and Moon smiled and exchanged greetings.

Moon, on the south side of the border, walked over to meet Kim so that their handshake could be photographed at the symbolic military demarcation line that divides the North from South.

In the meticulously choreographed ceremony, hands clasped and Moon invited Kim over an ankle-high concrete barrier that divides the two countries — the first time the North Korean leader — or any North Korean leader — had ever set foot in the South.

Then Kim gestured to Moon to take a step into the North, which the South Korean leader did. The presidential office later said that the unscripted moment came after Moon said he wanted to visit North Korea someday. Kim reacted quickly by offering to have him step right over to the northern side for a few moments, before they crossed back over to the South, hand in hand.

They walked side by side down a red carpet, observed a brightly-colored traditional Korean honor guard ceremony, before proceeding into the three-story Peace House for their summit.

Entering the Peace House, Kim wrote in the guest book: ""New history starts from now, at the historic starting point of an era of peace.""

The pair posed for photos in front of a picture of North Korea's Mount Geumgangsan, which has special significance for all Koreans dating to before the Middle Ages.

Kim Yong Chol, the head of North Korea's national intelligence service, began clapping and others from both sides joined in.

""It feels embarrassing to be applauded just for shaking hands,"" the North Korean leader said, but acknowledged, ""The norms are changing.""

""Did that make for a good picture?"" he asked as journalists and others laughed.

Once seated inside, Kim quipped that he brought Pyongyang's famous naengmyeon, cold noodles, ""from far away,"" then corrected himself to say it wasn't so far away at all.

The two leaders and their wives were expected to attend a dinner banquet Friday evening, featuring the noodles brought from the North.

Even with the outward appearance of geniality, however, lingering suspicions were evident: After Moon stepped out of Peace House, two North Korean security guards swept into the lobby, sprayed the chair at the guestbook signing desk with sanitizer and wiped it down. They also cleaned the guestbook and pen with sanitizer — twice. Then the guards used electronic gear to scan the chair and signing desk.

The reason? A South Korean security guard told reporters that their North Korean counterparts were checking for explosives and recording devices.

After separate lunches, the two leaders commemorated the summit by shoveling soil around a pine tree and then sprinkling it with water from South Korea's Han River and North Korea's Taedong River.

Moon and Kim then walked away from the cameras and microphones and sat at a bench to have a conversation without their aides. For much of that lengthy discussion, Kim could be seen listening intently to Moon, smiling and laughing at times.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

A boy with his first gun can be as deadly as a sharpshooter with a fruit salad of ribbons across his chest, and President Obama and his generals are treating North Korean crackpottery as a genuine threat to peace and good order. But they’re within their rights to get a kick out of Kim Jong-un’s little-boy tantrums, too.

Mr. Kim, even with a large inventory of rusty sabers to rattle, still looks at 29 or 30 like a boy in his first pair of long pants, and with all their wealth and pelf the Kims — grandfather, father and son — should find either a better barber or a bigger bowl. It’s hard for anyone to take seriously a kid with a haircut that bad. (When the satirical newspaper The Onion called him “the sexiest man alive,” thousands cheered.)

The North Koreans have a talent for making deadly mischief, blowing up civilian airliners, capturing gunboats, shelling South Korean offshore islands and once, in 1983, dispatching agents to Burma to plant three bombs that exploded and killed 17 visiting South Koreans, including four Cabinet ministers. Their actual target, then-President Chun Doo-hwan, might have been killed, too, but his motorcade was delayed in traffic and he missed laying a ceremonial wreath. So the little dictator with the jarhead haircut is probably capable of starting a war.

Just what’s in the mind of the North Koreans is hard for outsiders to fathom. Tall tales and wild threats — Pyongyang regularly vows to turn South Korea into “a sea of fire” — seem to be the work of geeks and nuts, but the terror administered from the top is so pervasive that even officials who know better are afraid to let on that they’re skeptical of the nine foolish things they have to repeat before breakfast. When Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, picked up golf clubs for the first time, he shot 11 holes-in-one. His spokesman said he hoped to get the other seven holes on the next outing. Kim Jong-il was not the first golfer to take an occasional mulligan and turn in an exaggerated scorecard, and no one in Pyongyang thought the story fanciful.

Tall tales, brash bloviation and idiotic insults, in fact, are Pyongyang’s only exports. Several years ago, I was invited to take several editors and correspondents from The Washington Times to Pyongyang for an 11-day tour. We were entertained at a lavish dinner, with several choice cuts of mystery meat, on our last night in town. When it was time for the ritual exchange of toasts, our host, the foreign minister, delivered a 25-minute diatribe against the U.S., laced with insult, contempt, disdain, calumny, scorn, insolence and taunt.

Amid smiles and diplomatic niceties, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart exchanged barbs and accusations Saturday in Singapore.

Washington warned no sanctions would be lifted until North Korea fully denuclearizes and Pyongyang countered it would not be bullied.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — U.S. officials viewed North Korea's unexpected release Tuesday of a detained American as a welcome development — even as it was accompanied by brash North Korean rhetoric over its nuclear ambitions.

Jeffrey Fowle, one of three Americans held captive, was on an Air Force plane heading back to his home state of Ohio — released after being detained for nearly six months. Two other Americans, Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae, continue to be held in North Korea.

Fowle, 56, a city worker from Miamisburg, Ohio, traveled to North Korea in April on a tourist visa and was detained by state police in May after allegedly leaving a Bible at a nightclub.

In rarely permitted interviews last month with CNN and the Associated Press, the three captives urged U.S. officials to come to North Korea to make a direct appeal. North Korea is in a dispute with the United States over its nuclear weapons program.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf declined to comment on the negotiations behind the release, saying two Americans remained in captivity, and ""obviously, we want to preserve our ability to get them home as well.""

She said U.S. officials ""remain deeply concerned about the ongoing, systematic and widespread human rights violations"" in North Korea, and ""our goal is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.""

Even as it released Fowle, North Korea pushed back on both those issues. Monday, North Korea's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Jang Il Hun, told Voice of America that nuclear talks were pointless as long as ""America continues to press us on the human rights issue."" In a statement through the official state news agency, KCNA, the regime called its nuclear program a ""treasured sword of justice protecting the nation from the U.S. nuclear blackmail.""

Fowle's release ""is a slight opening in a still hostile relationship,"" said Bill Richardson, a former U.N. ambassador and New Mexico governor who has negotiated with North Korea over prisoner releases.



""The message is that they're ready to start a dialog with the United States. The fact that they did not require a special envoy or a price for this release is a good sign,"" he told USA TODAY. ""The way I see it, they are starting to realize that their hard-line tactics, their excessive rhetoric, is not working.""

White House spokesman Josh Earnest credited Sweden for the ""tireless efforts of their embassy in Pyongyang"" in helping to facilitate the release. The Swedish Embassy represents Americans' interests in the North Korean capital because the United States has no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea.

As a condition of the release, North Korea asked the U.S. government to pick up Fowle immediately, and the Department of Defense flew a jet to North Korea on its timetable, Earnest said. The Associated Press, whose journalists spotted the American jet in Pyongyang on Tuesday, first reported the release.

That jet departed for Guam, Harf said. ""He has been evaluated by a doctor and appears to be in good health,"" she said.

A lawyer for the Fowle family, Timothy N. Tepe of Lebanon, Ohio,confirmed that Fowle was on his way back to Ohio on Tuesday.

north_korea,CNBC,1,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/09/trump-just-set-his-own-uncrossable-red-line--and-north-korea-crossed-it-instantly.html,"Trump just set his own, uncrossable 'red line' — and North Korea crossed it instantly",2017-08-09,Nyshka Chandran,"President Donald Trump appears to have painted himself into a corner : He must now follow up on his pledge of hitting North Korea with `` fire and fury , '' or he risks further blowing U.S. credibility . Kim Jong-un 's regime said late on Tuesday that it may strike Guam . That came shortly after Trump warned Pyongyang it would face `` power , the likes of which this world has never seen before '' if the renegade state continued to threaten the U.S. `` If the red line he drew today was 'North Korea can not threaten the U.S. anymore , ' that line was crossed within an hour of him making that statement , '' said John Delury , associate professor of Chinese studies at Seoul-based Yonsei University . The episode draws parallels to President Barack Obama 's own geopolitical red line . In 2013 , the former leader said the use of chemical weapons in Syria 's civil war would trigger an American military response . But when it happened , Obama failed to follow up on his promise — a move that critics , including Trump , said weakened Washington 's position as a superpower . `` Trump is drawing a decisive red line for himself , we all think back to Obama 's red line in Syria , which ultimately became an embarrassment for him , '' Peter Jennings , Australia 's former deputy secretary in defense , told ███ .
A U.S. offensive on North Korea is n't likely anytime soon , experts said , which means Trump just made the same mistake as his predecessor .
`` Certainly , the president can not back up a red line , '' said Delury , who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society . Defense secretary James Mattis and new chief of staff John Kelly are unlikely to sign off on any military action , so this may just be yet another example of `` Trump being Trump and firing off his mouth , '' added Robert Kelly , associate professor at Pusan National University . The Republican has certainly chalked up a lengthy track record of unsupported statements .

The episode draws parallels to President Barack Obama's own geopolitical red line. In 2013, the former leader said the use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war would trigger an American military response. But when it happened, Obama failed to follow up on his promise — a move that critics, including Trump, said weakened Washington's position as a superpower. ""Trump is drawing a decisive red line for himself, we all think back to Obama's red line in Syria, which ultimately became an embarrassment for him,"" Peter Jennings, Australia's former deputy secretary in defense, told CNBC.

So, will Trump attack?

A U.S. offensive on North Korea isn't likely anytime soon, experts said, which means Trump just made the same mistake as his predecessor.

""Certainly, the president cannot back up a red line,"" said Delury, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society. Defense secretary James Mattis and new chief of staff John Kelly are unlikely to sign off on any military action, so this may just be yet another example of ""Trump being Trump and firing off his mouth,"" added Robert Kelly, associate professor at Pusan National University. The Republican has certainly chalked up a lengthy track record of unsupported statements. For one, his administration said in April that an aircraft carrier strike group was headed toward North Korea when the vessel was actually in Indonesian waters. Instead of interpreting Trump's remark as a red line, the president may be playing the role of the madman, in a ruse to pressure the Chinese to get tough on Kim, Kelly continued. Trump's ultimatum of ""fire and fury"" came after a Washington Post report said the pariah state was capable of building a miniaturized nuclear weapon.

It will be an act of last resort but looks like we're heading in that right direction.""

US image dented

Trump's use of such incendiary rhetoric is seen further undermining the image of the world's largest economy. ""The more he doesn't follow-up on promises, the weaker America's image gets overseas...Trump is gaining a reputation for not being truthful,"" said Kelly.

In a series of tweets , President Trump threatened to halt all trade with countries doing business with the North , a veiled warning to China , and faulted South Korea for what he called `` talk of appeasement . ''
South Korea 's military said its live-fire exercise was meant to `` strongly warn '' Pyongyang . The drill involved F-15 fighter jets and the country 's land-based `` Hyunmoo '' ballistic missiles firing into the Sea of Japan .

north_korea,The Hill,1,http://thehill.com/policy/defense/385260-historic-korean-summit-sets-high-bar-for-trump,Historic Korean summit sets high bar for Trump,2018-04-28,,"Bitter foes for more than six decades , North and South Korea agreed Friday to “ denuclearize ” the Korean Peninsula — but the hard part is being left to President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Warren goes local in race to build 2020 movement 2020 Democrats make play for veterans ' votes MORE .
Trump touted the inter-Korea summit on Twitter , saying that “ good things are happening ” but that “ only time will tell . ”
“ KOREAN WAR TO END ! The United States , and all of its GREAT people , should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea ! ” he wrote in a second tweet .
But the declaration from South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had no details on how denuclearization will be achieved , leaving it to Trump to negotiate the finer points of an agreement when he meets with Kim in May or June .
“ This is step one of a thousand , ” Harry Kazianis , director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest , said of the inter-Korea summit . “ It ’ s a good step one , don ’ t get me wrong , but it ’ s just a first step . ”
The Kim-Moon summit Friday was filled with pomp , circumstance and images that would have been unfathomable just a year ago when the peninsula seemed on the brink of war .
Kim became the first North Korean leader to step foot on South Korean soil since the Korean War when he stepped over the raised military demarcation line to arrive at the summit . Moon also briefly entered North Korean territory when Kim invited him to step over the border for a moment .
The highly choreographed meeting even included a few jokes , with Kim telling Moon he wouldn ’ t interrupt his early morning sleep anymore , a reference to North Korea ’ s barrage of early morning missile tests last year .
The summit ended with a joint declaration that the two countries are committed to “ the common goal of realizing , through complete denuclearization , a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula ” and would pursue meetings with the United States and China “ with a view to declaring an end to the [ Korean ] War and establishing a permanent and solid peace regime . ”
“ The two leaders solemnly declared before the 80 million Korean people and the whole world that there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun , ” the declaration said .
With one summit down , the pressure is on for the next historic meeting .
“ This summit sets a high bar for Kim ’ s meeting with President Trump , ” Abraham Denmark , director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars , said in a statement . “ Our Korean allies have high hopes , and expectations for a positive summit will be very high . And the fundamental question remains : whatever deal is struck , how do we implement and verify that North Korea is holding up its end ? ”
North Korea has made promises of denuclearization before . North and South Korea signed a joint declaration of denuclearization in 1992 , and in 1994 , North Korea signed the Agreed Framework with the United States . North Korea also tentatively agreed to give up its nuclear program as part of the Six Party talks in 2005 .
Two previous inter-Korea summits in 2000 and 2007 also failed to make progress on the nuclear issue .
“ It ’ s not clear why the results of this summit will be any different from the other two summits , which had zero consequences on peace and denuclearization , ” said Robert Manning , a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council .
Trump insisted Friday he won ’ t get tricked by North Korea .
“ The United States has been played beautifully , like a fiddle , because you had a different kind of a leader , ” Trump said during a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House . “ We 're not going to be played , OK ? We ’ re going to hopefully make a deal . If we don ’ t , that ’ s fine . ”
Moon is expected to brief Trump on the results of the inter-Korea summit ahead of Trump ’ s own meeting with Kim .

Trump touted the inter-Korea summit on Twitter, saying that “good things are happening” but that “only time will tell.”

“KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!” he wrote in a second tweet.



But the declaration from South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had no details on how denuclearization will be achieved, leaving it to Trump to negotiate the finer points of an agreement when he meets with Kim in May or June.



“This is step one of a thousand,” Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, said of the inter-Korea summit. “It’s a good step one, don’t get me wrong, but it’s just a first step.”

The Kim-Moon summit Friday was filled with pomp, circumstance and images that would have been unfathomable just a year ago when the peninsula seemed on the brink of war.



Kim became the first North Korean leader to step foot on South Korean soil since the Korean War when he stepped over the raised military demarcation line to arrive at the summit. Moon also briefly entered North Korean territory when Kim invited him to step over the border for a moment.



The highly choreographed meeting even included a few jokes, with Kim telling Moon he wouldn’t interrupt his early morning sleep anymore, a reference to North Korea’s barrage of early morning missile tests last year.



The summit ended with a joint declaration that the two countries are committed to “the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula” and would pursue meetings with the United States and China “with a view to declaring an end to the [Korean] War and establishing a permanent and solid peace regime.”



“The two leaders solemnly declared before the 80 million Korean people and the whole world that there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun,” the declaration said.



With one summit down, the pressure is on for the next historic meeting.



“This summit sets a high bar for Kim’s meeting with President Trump,” Abraham Denmark, director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said in a statement. “Our Korean allies have high hopes, and expectations for a positive summit will be very high. And the fundamental question remains: whatever deal is struck, how do we implement and verify that North Korea is holding up its end?”



North Korea has made promises of denuclearization before. North and South Korea signed a joint declaration of denuclearization in 1992, and in 1994, North Korea signed the Agreed Framework with the United States. North Korea also tentatively agreed to give up its nuclear program as part of the Six Party talks in 2005.



Two previous inter-Korea summits in 2000 and 2007 also failed to make progress on the nuclear issue.



“It’s not clear why the results of this summit will be any different from the other two summits, which had zero consequences on peace and denuclearization,” said Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.



Trump insisted Friday he won’t get tricked by North Korea.



“The United States has been played beautifully, like a fiddle, because you had a different kind of a leader,” Trump said during a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House. “We're not going to be played, OK? We’re going to hopefully make a deal. If we don’t, that’s fine.”



Moon is expected to brief Trump on the results of the inter-Korea summit ahead of Trump’s own meeting with Kim.



With the Korea summit failing to end in concrete deliverables, Kazianis said the Trump administration will need to reach out to Pyongyang to establish concrete steps on denuclearization, such as agreeing to intrusive nuclear inspections, ahead of Trump’s summit with Kim.



“Trump has to decide if there was enough progress to go forward with his summit,” Kazianis said of the results of the Korea summit. Without preconditions, “you’re just going to give Kim Jong Un the biggest photo-op of all time, and that’s not worth it on our side.”

Tough questions

Strategically, Tuesday's missile test left Washington with tough questions.

For instance, the nighttime dispatch of the missile at short notice might have been calculated to show the US that North Korea's forces could outwit any future American attempts to hit a nuclear missile on the launchpad.

It appears to dampen several hopeful interpretations of the recent pause in Pyongyang's missile tests, including the suggestion that Kim was sending a signal he was ready to negotiate with the US.

The talks would be the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader and will take place by May , according to South Korea 's national security adviser , Chung Eui-yong , who delivered the invitation to Trump after a visit by his delegation to Pyongyang earlier this week . Chung said Kim had offered to put Pyongyang 's nuclear and missile program on the table .
The White House said Trump had agreed to the encounter . `` He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined , '' said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders .
Trump 's decision , after a year in which the two have repeatedly traded insults , is a remarkable breakthrough . It brings the North Korean regime close to its long-desired aim of recognition on the international stage , and offers Trump the tantalizing prospect of a historic diplomatic victory . But the consequences of such a high-stakes gamble remain hard to predict .
The South Korean delegation , which landed in Washington , D.C. for a debriefing Thursday on the North-South talks , was careful to praise Trump 's influence over the developments . Chung said the US President 's `` leadership '' and his administration 's pressure on the North Korean regime had `` brought us to this juncture . ''
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump `` greatly appreciates the nice words '' of the delegation and South Korean President Moon Jae-in .
`` He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined . We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea . In the meantime , all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain . ''
Trump tweeted that `` great progress '' had been made but there would be no prospect of lifting sanctions until a deal was reached .
South Korea 's President Moon described the announcement as `` historic '' and thanked both leaders for seeking a diplomatic solution to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula .
`` This is an almost miraculous event ; my administration will prepare toward the May meeting with utmost diligence , '' he said in remarks read out in Seoul by a Blue House spokesman .
Geng Shuang , a spokesman at China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said the development was positive , and it was a moment to show `` political courage . '' But he stressed that China would continue to maintain sanctions on North Korea until a political settlement was reached .
Other regional powers reacted cautiously . Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe talked to President Donald Trump on the phone to reiterate the necessity of maintaining pressure on North Korea .
Abe , briefing reporters after the call , said that the US and Japan had agreed to `` keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearization . ''
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said her government welcomed `` any dialogue with North Korea '' but warned that `` North Korea has a history of making agreements and then failing to honor them . ''
Bishop said that , during any talks , Pyongyang must abide by its United Nations obligations to refrain from nuclear and missile tests .
The stunning announcement was the culmination of a diplomatic whirlwind that began with the invitation of a North Korean delegation to attend the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang , South Korea . That event became the venue for a series of carefully orchestrated diplomatic overtures , which were reciprocated with a visit by a South Korean delegation to Pyongyang .
During the visit , Kim reportedly joked over dinners of Korean hotpot and cold noodles . At one meeting , he said previous missile tests had caused Moon to schedule early morning national security meetings . `` I decided today ( to freeze the tests ) so he will not lose sleep anymore , '' he said , according to a South Korean presidential official .
Kim and the officials shared several bottles of wine , liquor made of ginseng and Pyongyang soju , the official said . `` The bottles kept coming , '' said another administrative source who had official knowledge of the meeting .
The alcohol-fueled diplomacy ended in dramatic fashion at the White House on Thursday .
Chung , the South Korean national security adviser , arrived at the White House shortly before 2:30 p.m. to meet with his US counterpart , H.R . McMaster .
Just minutes after 5 p.m. , Trump poked his head in the White House briefing room to tell reporters South Korea would be making a `` major announcement . ''
Chung 's delegation appeared outside the West Wing about two hours later . In a brief statement to reporters , Chung said Kim `` expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible . ''
The North Korean leader had told the South Koreans `` he is committed to denuclearization '' and pledged that North Korea would `` refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests , '' Chung said . Kim also told the South Koreans he understands that the US and South Korea would move forward with their joint military exercises later this year .
Moments later , the White House confirmed that Trump had accepted Kim 's invitation to meet
There are many details to be ironed out before any meeting could take place , not least the location . The Panmunjom truce village in the Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) , one possible venue , hosted meetings between North and South Korea in the run-up to the Winter Olympics .
Since Trump came into office , the US has leveled some of its most significant and far-reaching sanctions against North Korea and has also succeeded in pressuring China to further isolate the regime . That pressure would not abate as the US heads toward the historic talks , the White House said .
Trump reiterated the US stance on sanctions . `` Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives , not just a freeze , '' he tweeted . `` Also , no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time . Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached . Meeting being planned ! ''

A host of questions lingered over Trump 's remarkable decision , which signaled a break with the administration 's thinking just days -- even hours -- earlier .
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters traveling with him in Ethiopia earlier on Thursday that the US was `` a long way from negotiations . ''
`` In terms of direct talks with the United States , and you asked negotiations , we 're a long way from negotiations . We just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it , '' Tillerson said .
Trump 's approach to North Korea has wavered between bellicose rhetoric and expressions of openness to diplomacy -- with the President saying one day that the US would rain `` fire and fury '' on North Korea and then saying he would consider speaking directly with the country 's leader under the right circumstances .
On the campaign trail he signaled more than once that he would be open to direct talks , but more recently belittled Tillerson 's attempts to bring Kim to the negotiating table .
`` I told Rex Tillerson , our wonderful Secretary of State , that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man , '' he tweeted in October , using his disparaging nickname for the North Korean leader .
The White House did not say why it had changed its calculus toward North Korea by agreeing to talks without `` concrete steps toward denuclearization . ''
But a senior administration official said Trump had accepted Kim 's invitation to meet because `` it makes sense to accept an invitation to meet with the one person who can actually make decisions , '' even though past US-North Korea talks have taken place at a lower level .
`` President Trump was elected in part because he is willing to do -- take approaches very , very different from past approaches and past presidents . That could n't be better exemplified in his North Korea policy , '' the official said Thursday evening .
The official added that `` President Trump has made his reputation on making deals '' and Kim `` is the one person who is able to make decisions under their authoritarian -- or totalitarian -- system . ''","(CNN) President Donald Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the White House announced, setting the scene for an unprecedented encounter between two nations that only recently threatened to wipe each other out.

That event became the venue for a series of carefully orchestrated diplomatic overtures, which were reciprocated with a visit by a South Korean delegation to Pyongyang.

During the visit, Kim reportedly joked over dinners of Korean hotpot and cold noodles. At one meeting, he said previous missile tests had caused Moon to schedule early morning national security meetings. ""I decided today (to freeze the tests) so he will not lose sleep anymore,"" he said, according to a South Korean presidential official.

Kim and the officials shared several bottles of wine, liquor made of ginseng and Pyongyang soju, the official said. ""The bottles kept coming,"" said another administrative source who had official knowledge of the meeting.

The alcohol-fueled diplomacy ended in dramatic fashion at the White House on Thursday.

Chung, the South Korean national security adviser, arrived at the White House shortly before 2:30 p.m. to meet with his US counterpart, H.R. McMaster.

Just minutes after 5 p.m., Trump poked his head in the White House briefing room to tell reporters South Korea would be making a ""major announcement.""

Chung's delegation appeared outside the West Wing about two hours later. In a brief statement to reporters, Chung said Kim ""expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible.""

The North Korean leader had told the South Koreans ""he is committed to denuclearization"" and pledged that North Korea would ""refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests,"" Chung said. Kim also told the South Koreans he understands that the US and South Korea would move forward with their joint military exercises later this year.

Moments later, the White House confirmed that Trump had accepted Kim's invitation to meet

There are many details to be ironed out before any meeting could take place, not least the location. The Panmunjom truce village in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), one possible venue, hosted meetings between North and South Korea in the run-up to the Winter Olympics.

Sanctions to remain in place

Since Trump came into office, the US has leveled some of its most significant and far-reaching sanctions against North Korea and has also succeeded in pressuring China to further isolate the regime. That pressure would not abate as the US heads toward the historic talks, the White House said.

Trump reiterated the US stance on sanctions. ""Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze,"" he tweeted. ""Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!""

A host of questions lingered over Trump's remarkable decision, which signaled a break with the administration's thinking just days -- even hours -- earlier.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters traveling with him in Ethiopia earlier on Thursday that the US was ""a long way from negotiations.""

""In terms of direct talks with the United States, and you asked negotiations, we're a long way from negotiations. We just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it,"" Tillerson said.

Trump's approach to North Korea has wavered between bellicose rhetoric and expressions of openness to diplomacy -- with the President saying one day that the US would rain ""fire and fury"" on North Korea and then saying he would consider speaking directly with the country's leader under the right circumstances.

On the campaign trail he signaled more than once that he would be open to direct talks, but more recently belittled Tillerson's attempts to bring Kim to the negotiating table.

""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,"" he tweeted in October, using his disparaging nickname for the North Korean leader.

The White House did not say why it had changed its calculus toward North Korea by agreeing to talks without ""concrete steps toward denuclearization.""

But a senior administration official said Trump had accepted Kim's invitation to meet because ""it makes sense to accept an invitation to meet with the one person who can actually make decisions,"" even though past US-North Korea talks have taken place at a lower level.

""President Trump was elected in part because he is willing to do -- take approaches very, very different from past approaches and past presidents. That couldn't be better exemplified in his North Korea policy,"" the official said Thursday evening.

The official added that ""President Trump has made his reputation on making deals"" and Kim ""is the one person who is able to make decisions under their authoritarian -- or totalitarian -- system.""",www.cnn.com,left,TNznDFKPGGkqT1bt

The rogue regime fired the long-range rocket into space Wednesday , defying international warnings and taking a major step forward in its quest to develop a nuclear missile . While the stated purpose was to put a weather satellite into orbit , the three-stage rocket 's deployment also demonstrates the nation 's ability to send a nuclear warhead as far as California , and raises the stakes in the international standoff over North Korea 's expanding atomic arsenal .
`` The satellite has entered the planned orbit , '' a North Korean television news reader announced , after which the station played patriotic songs with the lyrics `` Chosun ( Korea ) does what it says . ''
The North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) later confirmed that the nation had `` deployed an object that appeared to achieve orbit . ''
Video and photos released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency showed the launch from snowy terrain and its fiery flight skyward , mission control workers in a monitoring room , jubilant government workers and citizens and stern-looking government officials huddled around a conference table . The photos appear to have been intended as a follow-up to the launch itself - a defiant thumb in the eye of the world .
North Korea is banned from developing nuclear and missile-related technology under U.N. resolutions . But its defiance continues under Kim Jong-un , who rose to power a year ago after the death of his father , Kim Jong-Il .
The White House called the launch a `` highly provocative act that threatens regional security , '' and even the North 's most important ally , China , expressed regret . The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday condemned North Korea 's successful rocket launch , saying it violated a 2009 council resolution banning `` any launch using ballistic missile technology . '' The U.N. 's most powerful body said in a brief statement after closed consultations that it will consider `` an appropriate response . ''
In Pyongyang , however , pride over the scientific advancement outweighed the fear of greater international isolation and punishment . North Korea , though struggling to feed its people , is now one of the few countries to have successfully launched a working satellite into space from its own soil ; bitter rival South Korea is not on the list , though it has tried .
`` It 's really good news , '' North Korean citizen Jon Il Gwang told The Associated Press as he and scores of other Pyongyang residents poured into the streets after a noon announcement to celebrate the launch by dancing in the snow . `` It clearly testifies that our country has the capability to enter into space . ''
Wednesday 's launch was North Korea 's fourth bid since 1998 . An April launch failed in the first of three stages , raising doubts among outside observers whether North Korea could fix what was wrong in just eight months , but those doubts were erased Wednesday .
The Unha rocket , named after the Korean word for `` galaxy , '' blasted off from the Sohae launch pad in Tongchang-ri , northwest of Pyongyang , shortly before 10 a.m. , just three days after North Korea indicated that technical problems might delay the launch .
A South Korean destroyer patrolling the waters west of the Korean Peninsula immediately detected the launch . Japanese officials said the first rocket stage fell into the Yellow Sea and a second stage fell into the Philippine Sea hundreds of kilometers ( miles ) farther south .
The North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed that `` initial indications are that the missile deployed an object that appeared to achieve orbit . ''
In an indication that North Korea 's leadership was worried about the success of the launch , the plan was kept quiet inside North Korea until a special noon broadcast on state TV declared the launch a success . Pyongyang was much more open during its last attempt in April , and even took the unusual step of inviting scores of foreign journalists for the occasion , but that rocket splintered shortly after takeoff .
At one hotel bar Wednesday , North Koreans watched raptly , cheering and applauding at the close of the brief broadcast . As vans mounted with loudspeakers drove around the capital announcing the news , North Koreans bundled up in parkas ran outside to celebrate .
Pyongyang did not immediately release images of the launch , but hours later Associated Press reporters at the Pyongyang satellite command center viewed a playback showing the rocket blasting off against a snowy backdrop in the northwest . The white rocket was emblazoned with the name `` Unha-3 '' and the North Korean flag .
Director Kim Hye Jin said the satellite was broadcasting `` Song of Gen. Kim Il Sung '' and `` Song of Gen. Kim Jong Il '' in space . He reiterated North Korea 's intention to keep launching satellites in the future .
Space officials say the rocket is meant to send a satellite into orbit to study crops and weather patterns .
But the launch could leave Pyongyang even more isolated and cut off from much-needed aid and trade .
The U.N. imposed two rounds of sanctions following nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and ordered the North not to conduct any launches using ballistic missile technology . Pyongyang maintains its right to develop a civilian space program , saying the satellite will send back crucial scientific data .
The White House condemned what National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor called `` yet another example of North Korea 's pattern of irresponsible behavior . ''
`` The United States remains vigilant in the face of North Korean provocations and fully committed to the security of our allies in the region , '' Vietor said in a statement . `` Given this current threat to regional security , the United States will strengthen and increase our close coordination with allies and partners . ''
Vietor said the international community must `` send a clear message that its violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions have consequences . ''
China expressed its unhappiness but called for a moderate response from the United Nations .
`` We express regret at ( North Korea 's ) launch in spite of the extensive concerns of the international community , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters . He added that China `` believes U.N. Security Council reaction should be prudent and moderate and conducive to maintaining stability and avoiding escalation of the situation . ''
North Korea 's Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of overreacting to the launch `` out of hostile feelings . ''
`` We hope that all countries concerned will use reason and remain cool so as to prevent the situation from developing to undesirable direction , '' the official Korean Central News Agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying . The spokesman said the country will `` continue to exercise our legitimate right to launch satellites . ''
But North Korea also defends its need to build nuclear weapons , citing the U.S. military threat in the region , and rocket tests are seen as crucial to advancing its technology .
Pyongyang is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs . It followed up a failed 2009 launch with a nuclear test , and announced it would begin enriching uranium , which would provide a second source of atomic material .
Experts believe the North lacks the ability to make a warhead small enough to mount on a missile that could threaten the United States , but Wednesday 's launch marks a milestone in its decades-long effort to perfect a multistage , long-range rocket capable of carrying such a device .
This launch will help the North Koreans map out what kind of delivery vehicle they would need for a nuclear warhead , said retired Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton , a weapons expert and intelligence analyst .
There are concerns as well that Pyongyang may sell its technology to other nations such as Iran , which has rockets bearing a striking similarity to those made by North Korea , according to the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies .
A senior Iranian military commander , Brig . Gen. Massoud Jazzayeri , congratulated North Korea on the successful launch on Wednesday , according to the semiofficial Fars News Agency .
Chae Yeon-seok , a rocket expert at South Korea 's state-run Korea Aerospace Research Institute , said North Korea is now likely to focus on developing bigger rockets with heavier payloads . `` Its ultimate aim will be putting a nuclear warhead on the tip . ''
For North Koreans , Wednesday 's launch caps a heady year of milestones : the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung , the nation 's founder , and the inaugural year of leadership under his grandson , Kim Jong Un . And on Dec. 17 , North Korea will mark the anniversary of the death of leader Kim Jong Il .

One of the more memorable times when someone openly talked about assassinating North Korea’s leader, it was a joke.

In the 2014 comedy, ""The Interview,"" Seth Rogen and James Franco play journalists who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong-un instead of interviewing him.

North Korea was not happy about it — Pyongyang even threatened military action against the U.S.

Now, it looks like South Korea is stepping into the fray.

A few days after North Korea tested its sixth nuclear missile, South Korea announced its plans to create a special military “decapitation unit” with the goal of assassinating Kim Jong Un.

Deterrence strategy

Killing a foreign leader is obviously a covert operation — so why would South Korea reveal its plans so publicly?

It’s a form of deterrence that doesn’t involve nuclear weapons, says Isaac Stone Fish, a journalist and Asia Society fellow.

“It's a way for South Korea to say to North Korea, ‘Hey, we really mean business here.’”

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in was elected in May on a platform of diplomacy and engaging with the North. This shift in policy could be a sign that South Korea believes that U.S. President Trump’s increasingly aggressive “fire-and-fury” rhetoric isn’t deterring North Korea from its weapons testing.

How real is the threat?

South Korea’s threat to form a hit squad plays on North Korean leaders’ well-known paranoia, and their shared histories. Both countries tried — and failed — to assassinate each other’s leaders in the late 1960s.

But it’s likely that real threats to Kim Jong Un come from within, says Stone Fish. Pyongyang is no stranger to plotting and intrigue — Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong Un's elder half-brother, was killed by North Korean operatives earlier this year.

“Dictatorships are so inherently unstable,” said Stone Fish. “I think it's much more likely that one of his trusted associates slits his throat than that a South Korean agent can get access to (Kim Jong Un).”

North Korea’s reaction

South Korea’s threat could succeed in pressuring North Korea to pause its missile testing and begin talks.

But Stone Fish says it’s more likely that this will give the country ammunition to double down on its missile programs and propaganda.

“I think that this, to them, justifies the way they see the world,” said Stone Fish. “The idea that they are really alone — North Korea against the world.”

North Korea has hailed as a success its latest test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), describing it as a ""stern warning"" for the US.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said the test proved that the entire US was within striking range, state media reported.

However, experts say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets.

Pyongyang said the launch had ""successfully tested re-entry capabilities"" of the missile.

The statement said that the rocket was a Hwasong-14, the same model North Korea tested on 3 July.

The North has repeatedly tested missiles in breach of UN resolutions.

ICBMs can reach altitudes well outside the earth's atmosphere. Using sharp trajectories with high altitudes allows North Korea to avoid firing over neighbouring countries.

North Korea's latest ICBM test went farther and higher than its previous 3 July test, meaning that it may be able to strike even deeper into the heartland of the United States than initially assessed.

Within minutes of the launch, South Korean, Japanese and US officials reported data about the location, range, apogee, and flight time of the missile. While full analysis has not been finalised yet, several points stand out.

First, the data available indicates that the missile may have a range of approximately 10,400km. Since this missile is road-mobile, a launch from the north-eastern city of Rason would put New York City in range of the ICBM.

Second, the US reported that North Korea launched the ICBM from Mupyong-ni, North Korea. This location was different from many press accounts leading up to the launch which predicted a Kusong launch. The missile launched at 23:11 local time, an unusual time for North Korea's tests as well. It is possible that North Korea is already experimenting with deploying the missile under the cover of night or setting up multiple launch sites to confuse observers.

Reports on Friday said the missile had come down in the sea off northern Japan.

In response, the US and South Korean military conducted a live-firing exercise using surface-to-surface missiles, a US defence official said.

The missiles were fired into the ""territorial waters of South Korea along the east coast,"" a US military statement said.

South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo said the country would prepare independent measures to curb the North Korea threat, speeding up the deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) provided by the US.

In 2011, Amnesty reported that around 50,000 people were imprisoned there, though it said 39 housing blocks have since been demolished with only six new blocks built. While Amnesty conceded this might indicate a reduction in prisoner numbers, it said significant industrial activity was visible in the area, including logging.

Amnesty said its analysis of the images pointed to tight security at both sites with perimeter fences and security points clearly marked. ""Movement appears to be restricted and controlled through secured entrance gates, guard towers and internal check-points,"" its report read.

New witnesses

Amnesty also published previously unheard testimony from witnesses in its new report. A former security official, identified only as Mr. Lee, who was at Camp 16 in the 1980s until the mid 1990s described the methods used to execute prisoners in an interview with Amnesty last month. He said detainees were forced to dig their own graves and were then killed with hammer blows to their necks. He also witnessed prison officers strangling detainees and then beating them to death with wooden sticks.

According to Mr. Lee, women were ""disappeared"" after being raped: ""After a night of 'servicing' the officials, the women had to die because the secret could not get out. This happens at most of the political prison camps.""

Kim Young-soon, a former detainee in Camp 15 in the 1980s, described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees caught attempting to escape: ""They were brought to a stage after they were badly beaten. The prisoners were tied to wooden stakes and shot three times in their head, chest and feet,"" she recalled.

In September this year, a United Nations inquiry into human rights abuses in North Korea highlighted the ""unspeakable"" and ""widespread"" atrocities being carried out in camps that required an international response, including a mother forced to drown her own baby and a prison camp inmate compelled to eat rodents and lizards just to survive.

Miller,"President Trump put North Korea back on the U.S. government ’ s list of state sponsors of terrorism Monday , as the administration increased pressure on Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs .
The designation will be followed by new economic sanctions against the already heavily sanctioned communist country , said Mr. Trump , who has made confronting dictator Kim Jong-un a top foreign policy priority .
“ It should have happened a long time ago . It should have happened years ago , ” the president said when announcing the terrorist designation for Mr. Kim ’ s “ murderous regime . ”
“ The North Korean regime must be lawful , ” he said . “ It must end its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile development , and cease all support for international terrorism — which it is not doing . ”

The designation will be followed by new economic sanctions against the already heavily sanctioned communist country, said Mr. Trump, who has made confronting dictator Kim Jong-un a top foreign policy priority.

“It should have happened a long time ago. It should have happened years ago,” the president said when announcing the terrorist designation for Mr. Kim’s “murderous regime.”

“The North Korean regime must be lawful,” he said. “It must end its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile development, and cease all support for international terrorism — which it is not doing.”

After several hours of uncertainty, Chinese and South Korean monitors concluded Saturday that seismic activity in North Korea was a natural event, and not a nuclear test.

South Korea’s weather agency reported a magnitude 3.0 earthquake in an area of North Korea where the country recently conducted a nuclear test, but assessed the seismic activity as natural.

Reasons to be cheerful

The mood of the summit appeared genuinely optimistic and the two leaders seemed to strike up a convivial relationship from the start. The first sign was Kim Jong-un’s unscripted invitation for Moon Jae-in to step over to the North when they first met, apparently in response to Moon’s question: “When do I get to visit the North?” They chatted throughout their walk to the House of Peace and were all smiles and handshakes inside as they got down to business.

2. ‘No more tests’

Kim is reported to have promised Moon that there would be no more nuclear missile tests. “I heard that you had early morning sleep disturbed many times because you had to attend the national security council meetings because of us,” he told his counterpart from the South. “I will make sure that your morning sleep won’t be disturbed,” he added in an apparent promise to stop the tests. It repeated a pledge he made when officials from the South visited Pyongyang earlier this year but it remains to be seen how firm the promise will turn out to be.

Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, was by his side throughout as formalities were conducted at the House of Peace. She handed him a pen to sign a guestbook, she took the schoolchildren’s flowers from his hand and sat next to him scribbling notes at the start of the talks with Moon.

4. The voice

Although we’ve heard Kim’s speaking voice a few times in speeches, we’ve never heard him in conversation until today. Kyung Bok-cho, a Bloomberg journalist, said Kim didn’t sound like he had much of an accent and “wouldn’t sound that out of place in the middle of Seoul”. Kim’s smiling swagger as he walked towards Moon at the border also spoke volumes.

5. Tension remains

Despite the upbeat feel, there’s still a great deal of scepticism about what it all means for peace on the peninsula. Robert Kelly of Pusan national university in South Korea warned that Pyongyang “hasn’t really changed, and it hasn’t offered a meaningful concession yet”, adding there were still “huge” strategic and political divisions between the North on one hand, and the South and the US on the other. “We have had false dawns before on the Korean peninsula,” Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull warned rather gloomily.

President Trump was briefed on the latest test, the White House said in a terse statement acknowledging the missile test.

The last North Korean missile launch, which happened earlier this month, ended in failure when the missile blew up almost immediately.

Reports say the latest missile was a KN-17, a single stage, liquid-fueled, mobile-launched missile that has a short to medium range. It’s the same type of missile Pyongyang tried to launch earlier this month that blew up almost immediately.

That test came during North Korea’s celebration of the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder and was considered an embarrassment for leader Kim Jong Un.

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have skyrocketed in recent weeks. The commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. Harry Harris, said earlier this week that it’s the “worst [he’s] seen.”

Satellite imagery has indicated North Korea is ready to conduct its sixth nuclear test, while U.S. officials have pushed Pyongyang to limit its nuclear and missile program amid the showdown.

Trump told Reuters on Thursday that a “major, major” conflict with North Korea is possible. A U.S. carrier strike group is also headed toward the Korean Peninsula, and a guided missile sub made a port visit in South Korea this week in a show of force.

A U.S. missile defense system deployed to South Korea is also set to be operational “very soon,” the Pentagon said Friday.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday also chaired a United Nations Security Council meeting on North Korea, where he warned that failure to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs could lead to “catastrophic consequences.”

( KCNA/via Reuters )
After the Olympics , South Korean envoys met directly with Kim Jong-un in North Korea — itself a small diplomatic breakthrough — to head off increasing tensions over joint American–South Korean military exercises scheduled for April . Kim surprised them by proposing talks with the United States and putting North Korea ’ s nuclear program on the table , backing this up with a promise to suspend nuclear and missile testing while the negotiations go on .
That ’ s big . Not that we should take Kim at his word — I doubt North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons — but his openness to diplomacy is a positive development , especially when accompanied by a voluntary testing freeze .
The United States should take this unexpected opportunity to think outside the box , perhaps making a grand proposal of its own .
Why would North Korea negotiate now ? One possibility is that Trump ’ s version of Nixon ’ s “ madman theory ” yielded some success .
As many analysts have noted , the costs of attacking North Korea are prohibitively high : There would be thousands of South Korean fatalities within minutes , before U.S. air power could stop them , followed by a prolonged confrontation with potentially millions more casualties ; at worst , a great power such as China might come to the North ’ s defense . The U.S. wouldn ’ t shy away if North Korea started a war , but these risks are sufficient to deter America from firing first . The Kim regime knows all this , which reduces its incentives to acquiesce to demands . It has been under sanction for years , but has managed to stay in power while advancing its missile and nuclear capabilities .
But if Trump could convince North Korea ( and China ) that he might be crazy enough to attack , Kim would be more willing to make concessions . Trump has issued a series of threats , on Twitter and elsewhere , that go far beyond what his predecessors did . He ’ s ordered additional forces to the region , such as three carrier groups conducting exercises in the waters between South Korea and Japan in November 2017 , in a powerful show of force . And in January 2018 , Trump interviewed North Korea expert Victor Cha for U.S. ambassador to South Korea — but the nomination fell through over Cha ’ s opposition to a preemptive strike .
This heightened risk of American attack gives Kim motivation to negotiate . But North Korea is nonetheless proposing these talks from a position of strength . It has tested six nuclear weapons , including two tests in 2016 and another in 2017 . That last explosion was about three times larger than previous blasts , indicating a more advanced design boosted by hydrogen . Last year , North Korea conducted 16 ballistic-missile tests , all in violation of international law . One flew over Japan . And the most recent test demonstrated that the North has an intercontinental ballistic missile that can probably reach major American cities .
South Korean president Moon Jae-in favors peaceful reunification , and he ran in the May 2017 election promising to talk to North Korea . Trump ’ s threats suggest an indifference to South Korean casualties . Whether that ’ s an expression of his America First philosophy , part of a strategic madman routine , or just impulse , it made the South nervous , increasing Moon ’ s incentive to negotiate . Put these together , and Kim probably believes it ’ s a good time to try to win concessions .
Seen in this light , North Korea ’ s strategy appears quite clever : Demonstrate advanced weaponry , including the ability to directly threaten Japan and the United States . Go on a charm offensive at the Winter Olympics in South Korea , sending athletes , telegenic cheerleaders , and the Supreme Leader ’ s sister Kim Yo-jong , all of whom got positive press coverage . Then surprise South Korea and the United States by proposing talks over the nuclear program .
Still , North Korea remains burdened by sanctions and afraid that the United States will attempt forceful regime change . Like many others , the North doesn ’ t really know what to make of Trump . This gives the American president an opportunity for a major foreign-policy achievement . The president says he will meet with Kim by May of this year . Here are three out-of-the-box options he should consider , heading into negotiations .
One : Withdraw from South Korea . Nuclear weapons are the best way to deter foreign invasion , and Kim is unlikely to give them up . But denuclearizing North Korea would be an amazing accomplishment , stabilizing northeast Asia and solidifying the non-proliferation regime . However , to get something that big , the U.S. would need to give something big in return . Sanctions relief won ’ t cut it .
The U.S. currently has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea . On their own , those forces wouldn ’ t make the difference in a second Korean war . But they signal a strong commitment to South Korea , cultivate relationships with the South Korean military , and provide a forward position in the event of conflict .
The Korean War ended with an armistice , not a peace treaty , but when the North asks for security guarantees , it ’ s talking about more than a treaty and some promises . In exchange for North Korea ’ s giving up its nuclear and advanced ballistic-missile capabilities — and accepting invasive inspections to verify compliance — the U.S. could normalize relations , get the world to lift sanctions , and remove all American forces from the Korean peninsula .
There ’ s some geopolitical downside for the U.S. in withdrawing from bases near China , but that ’ s also a reason the deal could work : China would support it . While the Chinese don ’ t like North Korea ’ s belligerence , they ’ re especially wary of anything that could lead to peaceful reunification , which would bring a capitalist , American-allied country to their border . U.S. withdrawal from the Korean peninsula — and the threat that the United States would return if the agreement fell apart — would make China a strong proponent , pressuring North Korea to follow through . ( And the U.S. would remain a presence in the region owing to its alliance with Japan . )
Two : Accept a nuclear North Korea . America ’ s position , under Trump and previous presidents , is that North Korea can not have nuclear weapons . But it does . And seeing the historical success of nuclear deterrence , along with how the U.S. deposed non-nuclear regimes in Iraq and Libya , the North might never give them up .
That might not be so bad . Deterrence worked with the Soviet Union . It works today with Russia and China . Considering America ’ s military superiority , and Kim Jong-un ’ s obvious interest in having a country to rule , deterrence could work with North Korea as well .
Accepting North Korea as a de facto nuclear-weapons state and normalizing relations could bring numerous benefits , reducing the risk of war on the Korean peninsula . Using China as a model , Kim could open up the North Korean economy and join the international community without having to give up power . That would increase South Korea ’ s influence over the North , help address the humanitarian crisis plaguing average North Koreans , and reduce North Korea ’ s incentive to trade on the black market .
As one of the 21st century ’ s two big nonproliferation cases , North Korea is often compared to Iran , but the situations are very different . Iran is an expansionist power in a volatile region , while North Korea is boxed in by South Korea , China , and Russia . If Iran got the bomb , that could lead to a nuclear cascade , prompting Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and perhaps Egypt to acquire their own . That would increase the risk that accidents or miscalculations lead to a nuclear confrontation , and increase the danger of terrorists ’ acquiring a nuclear weapon or radioactive material for a dirty bomb . But China and Russia are already stable nuclear powers , and South Korea and Japan remain under America ’ s nuclear umbrella .
Critics of the Iran nuclear deal argue that lifting sanctions gave Iran funds to fuel its regional ambitions . Since signing the agreement in 2015 , Iran has provided arms to Hezbollah , supported Houthi rebels in Yemen , conducted operations in Syria in support of Bashar Assad ’ s government , and continued developing ballistic missiles in violation of international law . The Iranians were doing all this before the nuclear deal , but the economic benefits increased their capabilities . In contrast , North Korea aims for survival rather than regional domination . The North would like to take over South Korea , but probably recognizes that that ’ s not going to happen . There are no insurgencies in neighboring countries for North Korea to support , and there ’ s no chance it ’ ll take territory from Russia or China .
When North Korea has helped other international rogues — for instance , by providing the Syrian government with equipment to make chemical weapons — its primary motivation was money , not geopolitics . Removing sanctions would make North Korea less , not more , likely to engage in destabilizing behavior .
Accepting North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons would be a major concession , and in return the United States and South Korea could ask for :
a peace treaty under which the North reduces its conventional military threat to the South and accepts American deployments on the peninsula ;
a freeze on further nuclear development , verified by regular inspections ;
full disclosure of black-market activity , including weapons proliferation to Syria and elsewhere ( with the understanding that North Korea would not face punishment for past actions ) ; and
changes in North Korean education that maintain veneration of the Kims — let ’ s be realistic — but stop demonizing the United States .
Some hawks would denounce this as appeasement , but if anyone can sell it , it ’ s Trump . Drawing on his reputation as a deal-maker , his harsh criticism of the Iran deal , and his strong support among Republicans , he could convince his party that he drove a hard bargain and will make sure North Korea follows through . And many Democrats would probably welcome reduced tensions , even if achieved by a president they dislike .
Additionally , unlike the case of the Iran-sanctions regime — which was fraying before the nuclear deal and would be hard to snap back — it would be easy to reimpose sanctions against North Korea . While Russia , China , the U.K. , France , and Germany all wanted a deal with Iran and believe that Iran has honored it , the international community remains united against North Korean belligerence .
Three : Live with the status quo . The North Korean situation is nerve-racking , but relatively stable . Both sides know a war would be costly , and neither wants to start one . The Kims have managed two successions and , while it ’ s hard to know what ’ s going on inside North Korea , it appears Kim Jong-un ’ s regime is in no danger of collapse . Sanctions have global support and keep North Korea under pressure .
It ’ s a problem , but not an urgent one . If Trump can not win significant concessions , there ’ s no need to cut a deal .
If Trump can not win significant concessions , there ’ s no need to cut a deal .
In 1994 , Bill Clinton and Kim Jong-il — Kim Jong-un ’ s father — reached a deal called the Agreed Framework , freezing North Korea ’ s nuclear-weapons program in exchange for assistance with peaceful nuclear technology and shipments of heavy oil . The inspections regime was flawed , and neither side fully followed through . In 2002 , George W.

How to make the best of upcoming talks

After the Olympics, South Korean envoys met directly with Kim Jong-un in North Korea — itself a small diplomatic breakthrough — to head off increasing tensions over joint American–South Korean military exercises scheduled for April. Kim surprised them by proposing talks with the United States and putting North Korea’s nuclear program on the table, backing this up with a promise to suspend nuclear and missile testing while the negotiations go on.

That’s big. Not that we should take Kim at his word — I doubt North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons — but his openness to diplomacy is a positive development, especially when accompanied by a voluntary testing freeze.

The United States should take this unexpected opportunity to think outside the box, perhaps making a grand proposal of its own.

Why would North Korea negotiate now? One possibility is that Trump’s version of Nixon’s “madman theory” yielded some success.

As many analysts have noted, the costs of attacking North Korea are prohibitively high: There would be thousands of South Korean fatalities within minutes, before U.S. air power could stop them, followed by a prolonged confrontation with potentially millions more casualties; at worst, a great power such as China might come to the North’s defense. The U.S. wouldn’t shy away if North Korea started a war, but these risks are sufficient to deter America from firing first. The Kim regime knows all this, which reduces its incentives to acquiesce to demands. It has been under sanction for years, but has managed to stay in power while advancing its missile and nuclear capabilities.

But if Trump could convince North Korea (and China) that he might be crazy enough to attack, Kim would be more willing to make concessions. Trump has issued a series of threats, on Twitter and elsewhere, that go far beyond what his predecessors did. He’s ordered additional forces to the region, such as three carrier groups conducting exercises in the waters between South Korea and Japan in November 2017, in a powerful show of force. And in January 2018, Trump interviewed North Korea expert Victor Cha for U.S. ambassador to South Korea — but the nomination fell through over Cha’s opposition to a preemptive strike.

This heightened risk of American attack gives Kim motivation to negotiate. But North Korea is nonetheless proposing these talks from a position of strength. It has tested six nuclear weapons, including two tests in 2016 and another in 2017. That last explosion was about three times larger than previous blasts, indicating a more advanced design boosted by hydrogen. Last year, North Korea conducted 16 ballistic-missile tests, all in violation of international law. One flew over Japan. And the most recent test demonstrated that the North has an intercontinental ballistic missile that can probably reach major American cities.

South Korean president Moon Jae-in favors peaceful reunification, and he ran in the May 2017 election promising to talk to North Korea. Trump’s threats suggest an indifference to South Korean casualties. Whether that’s an expression of his America First philosophy, part of a strategic madman routine, or just impulse, it made the South nervous, increasing Moon’s incentive to negotiate. Put these together, and Kim probably believes it’s a good time to try to win concessions.

Seen in this light, North Korea’s strategy appears quite clever: Demonstrate advanced weaponry, including the ability to directly threaten Japan and the United States. Go on a charm offensive at the Winter Olympics in South Korea, sending athletes, telegenic cheerleaders, and the Supreme Leader’s sister Kim Yo-jong, all of whom got positive press coverage. Then surprise South Korea and the United States by proposing talks over the nuclear program.

Still, North Korea remains burdened by sanctions and afraid that the United States will attempt forceful regime change. Like many others, the North doesn’t really know what to make of Trump. This gives the American president an opportunity for a major foreign-policy achievement. The president says he will meet with Kim by May of this year. Here are three out-of-the-box options he should consider, heading into negotiations.

One: Withdraw from South Korea. Nuclear weapons are the best way to deter foreign invasion, and Kim is unlikely to give them up. But denuclearizing North Korea would be an amazing accomplishment, stabilizing northeast Asia and solidifying the non-proliferation regime. However, to get something that big, the U.S. would need to give something big in return. Sanctions relief won’t cut it.

The U.S. currently has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea. On their own, those forces wouldn’t make the difference in a second Korean war. But they signal a strong commitment to South Korea, cultivate relationships with the South Korean military, and provide a forward position in the event of conflict.

The Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, but when the North asks for security guarantees, it’s talking about more than a treaty and some promises. In exchange for North Korea’s giving up its nuclear and advanced ballistic-missile capabilities — and accepting invasive inspections to verify compliance — the U.S. could normalize relations, get the world to lift sanctions, and remove all American forces from the Korean peninsula.

There’s some geopolitical downside for the U.S. in withdrawing from bases near China, but that’s also a reason the deal could work: China would support it. While the Chinese don’t like North Korea’s belligerence, they’re especially wary of anything that could lead to peaceful reunification, which would bring a capitalist, American-allied country to their border. U.S. withdrawal from the Korean peninsula — and the threat that the United States would return if the agreement fell apart — would make China a strong proponent, pressuring North Korea to follow through. (And the U.S. would remain a presence in the region owing to its alliance with Japan.)

Two: Accept a nuclear North Korea. America’s position, under Trump and previous presidents, is that North Korea cannot have nuclear weapons. But it does. And seeing the historical success of nuclear deterrence , along with how the U.S. deposed non-nuclear regimes in Iraq and Libya , the North might never give them up.

That might not be so bad. Deterrence worked with the Soviet Union. It works today with Russia and China. Considering America’s military superiority, and Kim Jong-un’s obvious interest in having a country to rule, deterrence could work with North Korea as well.

Accepting North Korea as a de facto nuclear-weapons state and normalizing relations could bring numerous benefits, reducing the risk of war on the Korean peninsula. Using China as a model, Kim could open up the North Korean economy and join the international community without having to give up power. That would increase South Korea’s influence over the North, help address the humanitarian crisis plaguing average North Koreans, and reduce North Korea’s incentive to trade on the black market.

As one of the 21st century’s two big nonproliferation cases, North Korea is often compared to Iran, but the situations are very different. Iran is an expansionist power in a volatile region, while North Korea is boxed in by South Korea, China, and Russia. If Iran got the bomb, that could lead to a nuclear cascade, prompting Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and perhaps Egypt to acquire their own. That would increase the risk that accidents or miscalculations lead to a nuclear confrontation, and increase the danger of terrorists’ acquiring a nuclear weapon or radioactive material for a dirty bomb. But China and Russia are already stable nuclear powers, and South Korea and Japan remain under America’s nuclear umbrella.

Critics of the Iran nuclear deal argue that lifting sanctions gave Iran funds to fuel its regional ambitions. Since signing the agreement in 2015, Iran has provided arms to Hezbollah, supported Houthi rebels in Yemen, conducted operations in Syria in support of Bashar Assad’s government, and continued developing ballistic missiles in violation of international law. The Iranians were doing all this before the nuclear deal, but the economic benefits increased their capabilities. In contrast, North Korea aims for survival rather than regional domination. The North would like to take over South Korea, but probably recognizes that that’s not going to happen. There are no insurgencies in neighboring countries for North Korea to support, and there’s no chance it’ll take territory from Russia or China.

When North Korea has helped other international rogues — for instance, by providing the Syrian government with equipment to make chemical weapons — its primary motivation was money, not geopolitics. Removing sanctions would make North Korea less, not more, likely to engage in destabilizing behavior.

Accepting North Korea’s nuclear weapons would be a major concession, and in return the United States and South Korea could ask for:

a peace treaty under which the North reduces its conventional military threat to the South and accepts American deployments on the peninsula;

a freeze on further nuclear development, verified by regular inspections;

full disclosure of black-market activity, including weapons proliferation to Syria and elsewhere (with the understanding that North Korea would not face punishment for past actions); and

changes in North Korean education that maintain veneration of the Kims — let’s be realistic — but stop demonizing the United States.

Some hawks would denounce this as appeasement, but if anyone can sell it, it’s Trump. Drawing on his reputation as a deal-maker, his harsh criticism of the Iran deal, and his strong support among Republicans, he could convince his party that he drove a hard bargain and will make sure North Korea follows through. And many Democrats would probably welcome reduced tensions, even if achieved by a president they dislike.

Additionally, unlike the case of the Iran-sanctions regime — which was fraying before the nuclear deal and would be hard to snap back — it would be easy to reimpose sanctions against North Korea. While Russia, China, the U.K., France, and Germany all wanted a deal with Iran and believe that Iran has honored it, the international community remains united against North Korean belligerence.

Three: Live with the status quo. The North Korean situation is nerve-racking, but relatively stable. Both sides know a war would be costly, and neither wants to start one. The Kims have managed two successions and, while it’s hard to know what’s going on inside North Korea, it appears Kim Jong-un’s regime is in no danger of collapse. Sanctions have global support and keep North Korea under pressure.

It’s a problem, but not an urgent one. If Trump cannot win significant concessions, there’s no need to cut a deal.

If Trump cannot win significant concessions, there’s no need to cut a deal.

In 1994, Bill Clinton and Kim Jong-il — Kim Jong-un’s father — reached a deal called the Agreed Framework, freezing North Korea’s nuclear-weapons program in exchange for assistance with peaceful nuclear technology and shipments of heavy oil. The inspections regime was flawed, and neither side fully followed through. In 2002, George W. Bush labeled North Korea part of the Axis of Evil and the U.S. accused the North of secretly enriching uranium, and in 2003 the agreement broke down.

Bush later initiated the Six-Party Talks, bringing in South Korea, Japan, Russia, and China, in addition to the U.S. and North Korea. The first four rounds failed, and North Korea tested its first nuclear bomb in 2006. A fifth round yielded a trade of fuel for a partial nuclear freeze — sort of a smaller version of the Agreed Framework — but it ultimately went nowhere as the U.S. and North Korea again accused each other of failing to follow through.

This history casts doubt on the value of small agreements that give North Korea economic aid in exchange for promises to halt nuclear development.

In the upcoming talks, it will be tempting to reach another small deal. But if Trump can’t achieve a major breakthrough, he should walk away.

“ Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea . For the first time in many years , a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned . The World is watching and waiting ! May be false hope , but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction ! ” Trump tweeted .
The Hermit Kingdom added that it ’ s willing to give up its nuclear weapons if military threats against North Korea subsides , Chung said hours after leaving Pyongyang .
`` The North side clearly affirmed its commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and said it would have no reason to possess nuclear weapons should the safety of its regime be guaranteed and military threats against North Korea removed , '' Chung said in a statement , according to Yonhap News Agency .
WHAT KIM JONG UN ’ S SISTER REALLY MEANS WHEN CALLING FOR NORTH AND SOUTH ‘ UNIFICATION ’
Chung , who led a 10-member South Korean delegation to Pyongyang for the two-day visit , said the North is ready to have “ heart-to-heart ” talks with the U.S. about the regime ’ s potential denuclearization and normalization between the countries .
`` [ North Korea ] made it clear that while dialogue is continuing , it will not attempt any strategic provocations , such as nuclear and ballistic missile tests . '' — Chung Eui-yong , national security director of South Korea
“ It made it clear that while dialogue is continuing , it will not attempt any strategic provocations , such as nuclear and ballistic missile tests , ” the statement continued .
North and South Korea agreed to hold summit talks in April at the border . The leaders will establish a “ hotline ” communication channel to lower military tensions , Chung added .
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday called for countries to further isolate North Korea despite the Hermit Kingdom 's offer to discuss denuclearization .
“ North Korea threatens the entire global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities , including its arms exports to Africa . It doesn ’ t just involve our allies in Europe or Asia . It doesn ’ t just include countries with longstanding ties to [ North Korea ] like China and Russia . This is and must be a global effort , '' Tillerson said in a speech at George Mason University .
The comments mark a major change in tone after months of bombastic threats by the rogue regime to keep developing its nuclear and missile program .
Chung-in Moon , the foreign policy adviser to Moon , told Fox News : “ I think Kim Jong Un ’ s proposal is real and authentic . It is now up to President Trump as to how he responds . The devil is in the details . ”
Last month ’ s Pyeongchang Olympics sparked the first talks between the two Koreas that followed a flurry of cooperative steps taken to ease tensions during the Winter Games .
North Korea sent a delegation of athletes , cheerleaders , art troupe members and officials to Pyeongchang for the Olympics . Kim ’ s sister , Kim Yo Jong attended the opening ceremony and met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in over a three-day visit . At one point , she even wrote of her “ wishes ” for closer ties in a guest book at South Korea ’ s presidential office .
`` I expect Pyongyang and Seoul to get closer in the hearts of our [ Korean ] people and the future of unification and prosperity will be advanced , '' Kim wrote in Korean in the guest book , according to Yonhap News Agency .
KIM JONG UN 'S HARD CURRENCY EXPECTED TO RUN DRY BY OCTOBER , SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER SAYS
But the “ future of unification ” phrase means something far more sinister for the Kim family and his regime . North Korea has touted unification as a “ final victory ” to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953 . In Pyongyang ’ s view , `` unification '' means Kim ’ s brutal dictatorship would overcome the South ’ s government .
There have been two summits , one in 2000 and another in 2007 , held between Kim 's late father , Kim Jong Il , and two liberal South Korean presidents . They resulted in a series of cooperative projects between the Koreas that were scuttled during subsequent conservative administrations in South Korea .
Kim ’ s apparent olive branch to South Korea and the U.S. comes after months of mounting sanctions against the volatile regime . Kang Seok-ho , of the Liberty Korea Party , previously said the despot is scrambling to keep his regime afloat because the international sanctions was crippling its economy .
`` I received an analysis that , if international sanctions against the North continue like this , all of North Korea 's foreign currency earnings and overseas assets will be frozen , and its dollar [ reserves ] will dry up around October , '' Kang said .
Tillerson also said in mid-January there was “ a lot of evidence that these sanctions are starting to hurt ” North Korea .","President Trump said on Tuesday said ""the world is watching"" North Korea after the regime promised not to use nuclear or conventional weapons against Seoul and expressed a willingness to hold talks with the United States on denuclearization.

""The North side clearly affirmed its commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and said it would have no reason to possess nuclear weapons should the safety of its regime be guaranteed and military threats against North Korea removed,"" Chung said in a statement, according to Yonhap News Agency.

WHAT KIM JONG UN’S SISTER REALLY MEANS WHEN CALLING FOR NORTH AND SOUTH ‘UNIFICATION’

Chung, who led a 10-member South Korean delegation to Pyongyang for the two-day visit, said the North is ready to have “heart-to-heart” talks with the U.S. about the regime’s potential denuclearization and normalization between the countries.

""[North Korea] made it clear that while dialogue is continuing, it will not attempt any strategic provocations, such as nuclear and ballistic missile tests."" — Chung Eui-yong, national security director of South Korea

“It made it clear that while dialogue is continuing, it will not attempt any strategic provocations, such as nuclear and ballistic missile tests,” the statement continued.

North and South Korea agreed to hold summit talks in April at the border. The leaders will establish a “hotline” communication channel to lower military tensions, Chung added.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday called for countries to further isolate North Korea despite the Hermit Kingdom's offer to discuss denuclearization.

“North Korea threatens the entire global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities, including its arms exports to Africa. It doesn’t just involve our allies in Europe or Asia. It doesn’t just include countries with longstanding ties to [North Korea] like China and Russia. This is and must be a global effort,"" Tillerson said in a speech at George Mason University.

The comments mark a major change in tone after months of bombastic threats by the rogue regime to keep developing its nuclear and missile program.

Chung-in Moon, the foreign policy adviser to Moon, told Fox News: “I think Kim Jong Un’s proposal is real and authentic. It is now up to President Trump as to how he responds. The devil is in the details.”

Last month’s Pyeongchang Olympics sparked the first talks between the two Koreas that followed a flurry of cooperative steps taken to ease tensions during the Winter Games.

North Korea sent a delegation of athletes, cheerleaders, art troupe members and officials to Pyeongchang for the Olympics. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong attended the opening ceremony and met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in over a three-day visit. At one point, she even wrote of her “wishes” for closer ties in a guest book at South Korea’s presidential office.

""I expect Pyongyang and Seoul to get closer in the hearts of our [Korean] people and the future of unification and prosperity will be advanced,"" Kim wrote in Korean in the guest book, according to Yonhap News Agency.

KIM JONG UN'S HARD CURRENCY EXPECTED TO RUN DRY BY OCTOBER, SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER SAYS

But the “future of unification” phrase means something far more sinister for the Kim family and his regime. North Korea has touted unification as a “final victory” to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953. In Pyongyang’s view, ""unification"" means Kim’s brutal dictatorship would overcome the South’s government.

There have been two summits, one in 2000 and another in 2007, held between Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, and two liberal South Korean presidents. They resulted in a series of cooperative projects between the Koreas that were scuttled during subsequent conservative administrations in South Korea.

Kim’s apparent olive branch to South Korea and the U.S. comes after months of mounting sanctions against the volatile regime. Kang Seok-ho, of the Liberty Korea Party, previously said the despot is scrambling to keep his regime afloat because the international sanctions was crippling its economy.

""I received an analysis that, if international sanctions against the North continue like this, all of North Korea's foreign currency earnings and overseas assets will be frozen, and its dollar [reserves] will dry up around October,"" Kang said.

Tillerson also said in mid-January there was “a lot of evidence that these sanctions are starting to hurt” North Korea.

Trump tweeted in response on Friday : “ Kim Jong Un of North Korea , who is obviously a madman who doesn ’ t mind starving or killing his people , will be tested like never before ! ”
Itsunori Onodera , the Japanese defence minister , warned such a test could involve a nuclear device mounted on a medium-range or intercontinental ballistic missile being flown over Japan . “ We can not deny the possibility it may fly over our country , ” he said .

McMaster said Saturday that the threat of war with North Korea was `` increasing every day '' — and he doubted whether dictator Kim Jong Un would have a `` Grinch moment '' to end his nuclear ambitions without stronger U.S. sanctions or other actions .
`` The prospects now for any dramatic change in his behavior , without some significant new actions , ''
`` He 's not going to have a Grinch moment , I do n't think , with his heart growing two sizes larger — and we see him change his behavior , '' McMaster told Fox News host Bret Baier at the Reagan National Defense Forum .
Baier interviewed McMaster after he spoke at the forum , in its fifth year , at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley , Calif .
On the prospects of a military showdown with Pyongyang , `` it 's increasing every day , which means that we are in a race , '' McMaster said .
`` Really , we are in a race to be able to solve this problem — not just us , but the United States , our allies and partners .
`` We know China has tremendous coercive economic power over North Korea , '' he added . `` You ca n't shoot a missile without fuel , right ?
`` There are ways to address this problem , short of conflict , but it is a race because he 's getting closer and closer — and there 's not much time left . ''
North Korea successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile Wednesday — and Kim declared that his country had achieved full nuclear statehood .
The White House immediately responded that the regime would be `` utterly destroyed '' if its long-range nuclear missile arsenal efforts provoked a military clash .
McMaster told Baier that the Trump administration was assessing North Korea 's latest launch , `` but what is clear is that every time he conducts a missile launch and nuclear test , he gets better .
`` Whether it 's a success or failure is n't as important as understanding that over the years , he 's been learning from failures — improving and , thereby , increasing his threat to all of us . ''
Pyongyang 's efforts are further uniting the U.S. and its allies , including China , McMaster said .
`` China agreed that this is a threat to everyone , '' he said . `` This is a global threat .
`` China is committed to the complete denuclearization of North Korea , '' McMaster said , referring to President Donald Trump 's talks with President Xi Jinping during his Asia trip last month .
He added that perhaps the greatest change with Beijing is that it `` recognizes that it does have tremendous economic power over North Korea .
`` We are asking China to act — in China 's interest , as they should — and we believe increasingly that it 's in China 's urgent interest to do more , to do more beyond U.N. Security Council resolutions . ''
However , despite the unease on the Korean Peninsula , McMaster said that Americans can feel safe attending the Winter Olympics in South Korea , in February .
`` We have an extraordinarily ready and capable military , '' he told Baier .
`` That military is getting stronger every day , based on the president 's priority to address what had been deferred military modernization , strengthening all of our services and their capabilities .
Turning to Syria , McMaster said that he did not believe that Russia has cemented President Bashar Assad 's power by helping his government chase Islamic State terrorists from their remaining strongholds on the border with Iraq .
`` What 's needed is a political transition that allows all Syrians to have a say in the future of that government so they can get out of this horible humanitarian crisis , '' he told Baier .
`` Somebody who has committed mass murder of his own people ? '' McMaster posed . `` How does that work ?
`` What 's needed in Syria is a consolidation of gains over ISIS and consolidation in such a way that it can bridge into a political process and deliver enduring security . ''
Damascus has become , he said , `` a destructive cycle of violence '' that has also made them vulnerable to al-Qaida , Iran and other rogue entities .
`` They take advantage of weak states to make them dependent on them for support , '' McMaster said .
He also slammed previous U.S. policies toward Tehran , saying that `` the focus on trying to accommodate Iran has empowered Iran across the whole region .
`` What we have in place now is a comprehensive strategy for Iran — and denying Iran all access to a nuclear weapon is one part of that strategy , '' McMaster added . `` Countering behavior is another critical part of the strategy . ''
On Russian sanctions , the national security adviser said that `` it takes time '' to implement those Congress approved in July , because the administration wanted `` to make sure we are doing it right .
`` Sanctions are relevant to countering Russia 's destabilizing behavior — and we are moving on that as fast as we can . ''
He noted that the Treasury Department is also acting to `` increase the economic isolation and pressure on the North Korean regime .
`` It 's also going to sanction Iran 's behavior associated with their missile development in violation of U.N. Council resolutions and to sanction behavior based on support for terrorist organizations and their proxies .
`` If you look at Venezuela and the victimization of the Venezuelan people , we are doing everything we can in support with our allies and partners to communicate to [ President Nicolás Maduro ] that he has to restore his citizens ' constitutional rights — and that has to do with sanctions .
`` Nobody 's taking any days off these days in the Treasury Department . ''
In his speech , McMaster told the gathering that the Trump administration 's national security strategy was based on `` principled realism '' that `` adapts a realistic view of security environments '' around the world .
`` For this reason , we do not base national security decisions on rigid ideology but instead out of core national interests and clearly defined objectives derived from those interests .
`` We have been clear eyed about the more obvious threat from North Korea 's nuclear weapons and missile developments .
`` The president is committed to the total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula , '' McMaster said .
`` He has no allusions about the North Korean dictator 's intentions — and we will not repeat the failed efforts of the past . ''","National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said Saturday that the threat of war with North Korea was ""increasing every day"" — and he doubted whether dictator Kim Jong Un would have a ""Grinch moment"" to end his nuclear ambitions without stronger U.S. sanctions or other actions.

McMaster told Baier that the Trump administration was assessing North Korea's latest launch, ""but what is clear is that every time he conducts a missile launch and nuclear test, he gets better.

""Whether it's a success or failure isn't as important as understanding that over the years, he's been learning from failures — improving and, thereby, increasing his threat to all of us.""

Pyongyang's efforts are further uniting the U.S. and its allies, including China, McMaster said.

""China agreed that this is a threat to everyone,"" he said. ""This is a global threat.

""China is committed to the complete denuclearization of North Korea,"" McMaster said, referring to President Donald Trump's talks with President Xi Jinping during his Asia trip last month.

""China is wholly committed.""

He added that perhaps the greatest change with Beijing is that it ""recognizes that it does have tremendous economic power over North Korea.

""We are asking China to act — in China's interest, as they should — and we believe increasingly that it's in China's urgent interest to do more, to do more beyond U.N. Security Council resolutions.""

However, despite the unease on the Korean Peninsula, McMaster said that Americans can feel safe attending the Winter Olympics in South Korea, in February.

""We have an extraordinarily ready and capable military,"" he told Baier.

""That military is getting stronger every day, based on the president's priority to address what had been deferred military modernization, strengthening all of our services and their capabilities.

""I think that's pretty apparent.""

Turning to Syria, McMaster said that he did not believe that Russia has cemented President Bashar Assad's power by helping his government chase Islamic State terrorists from their remaining strongholds on the border with Iraq.

""What's needed is a political transition that allows all Syrians to have a say in the future of that government so they can get out of this horible humanitarian crisis,"" he told Baier.

Assad has no place in that government, however.

""Somebody who has committed mass murder of his own people?"" McMaster posed. ""How does that work?

""What's needed in Syria is a consolidation of gains over ISIS and consolidation in such a way that it can bridge into a political process and deliver enduring security.""

Damascus has become, he said, ""a destructive cycle of violence"" that has also made them vulnerable to al-Qaida, Iran and other rogue entities.

""They take advantage of weak states to make them dependent on them for support,"" McMaster said.

He also slammed previous U.S. policies toward Tehran, saying that ""the focus on trying to accommodate Iran has empowered Iran across the whole region.

""What we have in place now is a comprehensive strategy for Iran — and denying Iran all access to a nuclear weapon is one part of that strategy,"" McMaster added. ""Countering behavior is another critical part of the strategy.""

On Russian sanctions, the national security adviser said that ""it takes time"" to implement those Congress approved in July, because the administration wanted ""to make sure we are doing it right.

""To make sure we sanction the right entities.

""Sanctions are relevant to countering Russia's destabilizing behavior — and we are moving on that as fast as we can.""

He noted that the Treasury Department is also acting to ""increase the economic isolation and pressure on the North Korean regime.

""It's also going to sanction Iran's behavior associated with their missile development in violation of U.N. Council resolutions and to sanction behavior based on support for terrorist organizations and their proxies.

""If you look at Venezuela and the victimization of the Venezuelan people, we are doing everything we can in support with our allies and partners to communicate to [President Nicolás Maduro] that he has to restore his citizens' constitutional rights — and that has to do with sanctions.

""Nobody's taking any days off these days in the Treasury Department.""

In his speech, McMaster told the gathering that the Trump administration's national security strategy was based on ""principled realism"" that ""adapts a realistic view of security environments"" around the world.

""For this reason, we do not base national security decisions on rigid ideology but instead out of core national interests and clearly defined objectives derived from those interests.

""We have been clear eyed about the more obvious threat from North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile developments.

""The president is committed to the total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"" McMaster said.

""He has no allusions about the North Korean dictator's intentions — and we will not repeat the failed efforts of the past.""",www.newsmax.com,right,cCh8bGam0BxgbXmB

The dictatorship 's official KCNA news agency described the recent sanctions as `` crimes '' that were a `` violent violation of our sovereignty '' and a `` heinous plot to isolate and stifle '' the communist country .
North Korea , which consistently threatens to send `` gift packages '' to the U.S. , vowed to take `` righteous actions '' that would make America pay `` thousands of times . ''
The fiery response from the nation came in the face of the sanctions and as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson demanded the rogue nation halt its missile tests so the U.S. and North Korea could start negotiations .
Tillerson made the comments at a regional security meeting in Manilla , Philippines , and offered his most specific outline to date of what preconditions the U.S. has for talks with Pyongyang . He said stopping the launches would be the `` first and strongest signal . ''
He added the caveat that it would not be as simple as The Hermit Kingdom simply stopping launches for a few days or weeks , saying that he would not give a concrete timeframe but that the U.S. will “ know it when we see it . ”
The secretary of state also praised the most recent sanctions imposed on North Korea over their recent intercontinental ballistic missile tests , saying that it leaves no doubt in anyone ’ s mind whether there is a common view on the matter among the international community .
The sanctions against the communist nation include a ban on coal and other exports worth more than $ 1 billion -- a huge bite in its total exports , valued at $ 3 billion last year .
The comments come after President Trump tweeted late Sunday that he spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae-In and was “ very happy and impressed ” with the United Nations Security Council 's 15-0 vote to hit Kim Jong Un 's regime with the tough new sanctions .
The White House added that Trump and Moon “ committed to fully implement all relevant resolutions and to urge the international community to do so as well . ”
U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called the resolution “ the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime ” and `` the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation . ”
Haley told Fox News ' “ Sunday Morning Futures , ” “ What we basically did was kicked them in the stomach , told them to stop and told them they are not going to put up with it anymore and the ball is now in North Korea ’ s court . They have a big decision to make . They can either respond by pulling back and said that they ’ re not going to be part of this reckless activity anymore , or they can see where it goes and we ’ ll continue to keep up the strength and keep up the activity to make sure that we stop them . ”
The sharp new U.N. sanctions also received a welcome boost on Sunday from China , North Korea ’ s economic lifeline , as Beijing called on its neighbor to halt its missile and nuclear tests .
For the U.S. , it was a long-awaited sign of progress for Trump 's strategy of trying to enlist Beijing 's help to squeeze North Korea diplomatically and economically . Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi , meeting with North Korea 's top diplomat during the gathering in Manila , urged the North to `` maintain calm '' despite the U.N. vote .
`` Do not violate the U.N. 's decision or provoke international society 's goodwill by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests , '' Wang said , in an unusually direct admonition .

It also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Security Council to further cuts if North Korea conducts another nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile test.

Ship tracking data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that the Lighthouse Winmore has mainly been doing supply runs between China and Taiwan since August.

Prior to that, it was active between India and the United Arab Emirates. In October, when it allegedly transferred petroleum products to the North Korean ship, the Lighthouse Winmore had its tracking transponder switched off.

South Korea’s customs service concluded that the Lighthouse Winmore had loaded about 14,000 tons of Japanese refined petroleum products in South Korea on Oct. 11, reportedly bound for Taiwan, the South Korea official said.

“It’s unclear how much oil the ship had transferred to North Korea for how long and on how many occasions, but it clearly showed North Korea is engaged in evading the sanctions,” the official told Reuters.

It was not immediately possible to find contact information for the Taiwanese charter company.

The Hong Kong government said it was “liaising with the Korean parties concerned to obtain further information about the incident, and will take appropriate actions as necessary”.

It 's important to recognize that—however much one dislikes the president and his foreign policy ideas—Donald Trump has been very consistent about two things when it comes to a nuclearizing North Korea : 1 ) It is primarily a problem for North Korea 's immediate neighbors , and 2 ) the U.S. will be happy to threaten maximum force/craziness as necessary to prod NoKo & Co. to the negotiating table .

Two bombing expeditions last spring—the `` Mother of All Bombs '' dropped over Afghanistan , and the missile attack on a Syrian airfield—were , by many reports , part of a deliberate campaign of `` strategic unpredictability '' designed above all to influence the decision-making process in Korea .
This approach certainly has its drawbacks . Threatening `` fire and fury '' on North Korea , as Trump did last August , not only incentivizes the Hermit Kingdom to speed up its own nukes , but it whips the American public into a war-frenzy . It 's not hard to see how such a gambit could go horribly wrong , particularly given a political class in which respected statesmen such as Sen.
