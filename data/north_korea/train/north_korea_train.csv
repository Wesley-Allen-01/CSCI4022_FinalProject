The announcement , which could not immediately be confirmed by outside sources , was made by a state television anchor who read a typically propaganda-heavy statement calling the test a `` perfect success '' that elevated the country 's `` nuclear might to the next level '' and provided it with a weapon to defend itself against the United States and other enemies .
The United Nations Security Council quickly announced an emergency meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning .
However , Andrei Lankov , a North Korea expert based in Seoul , South Korea , told Fox News he was `` seriously skeptical '' that Pyongyang had tested a hydrogen bomb . According to Lankov , North Korea would have needed to divert a large amount of scarce funds to construct such a device , saying it would have been `` mission overkill . ''
`` I believe it did not have the 'signature ' of a Hydrogen bomb , '' said Lankov , who added that he had `` absolutely no doubt '' the blast was an atomic test , the fourth carried out since 2006 in definance of international and United Nations sanctions .
The reports fueled bipartisan calls on Capitol Hill for tightened sanctions and more pressure on North Korea .
“ North Korea ’ s nuclear detonation claims are a grave provocation and threat to international peace and security , and must be met with firm action and a clear effort to halt Pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions , ” Sen. Bob Menendez , D-N.J. , said in a statement . “ I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass my legislation to tighten sanctions since it ’ s obvious the sanctions we have in place are all-too-often ignored and North Korea continues to get away with bad behavior . ”
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce , R-Calif. , said “ the answer to North Korea ’ s threats is more pressure , not less . ”
South Korean lawmaker Lee Cheol Woo told the Associated Press that the country 's National Intelligence Service had expressed in a private briefing that they believed North Korea had tested an atomic bomb , not a hydrogen bomb .
According to Lee , intelligence officials said that an estimated explosive yield of six kilotons and a magnitude-4.8 earthquake were detected Wednesday , a smaller blast than the estimated explosive yield of 7.9 kilotons and magnitude-4.9 quake that were reported after a February 2013 nuclear test by North Korea , and only a fraction of a typical successful hydrogen bomb test 's explosive yield of hundreds of kilotons .
Lee says the agency told him that even a failed hydrogen bomb detonation typically yields tens of kilotons .
The United Kingdom also reacted with outrage . `` If a nuclear device has been detonated by North Korea , this is a grave breach of UN Security Council resolutions and a provocation which I condemn without reservation , '' British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said in a statement . `` It underlines the very real threat that North Korea represents to regional and international security . ''
It could take weeks before the true nature of the test is confirmed by outside experts — if they are able to do so at all . North Korea goes to great lengths to conceal its tests by conducting them underground and tightly sealing off tunnels or any other vents though which radioactive residue and blast-related noble gases could escape into the atmosphere .
The U.S. Air Force has aircraft designed to detect the evidence of a nuclear test , and such aircraft could be deployed from a U.S. base on the Japanese island of Okinawa to search for clues . Japanese media said Tokyo has also mobilized its own reconnaissance aircraft for sorties over the Sea of Japan to try to collect atmospheric data .
The doubts did n't stop jubilation and pride in Pyongyang , where crowds dressed in thick winter coats gathered outside a large video screen near a train station to cheer and take video and photos on their mobile phones as the statement was delivered .
In Washington , State Department spokesman John Kirby warned `` we condemn any violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions and again call on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments '' , later adding `` we have consistently made clear that we will not accept [ North Korea ] as a nuclear state . ''
In Seoul and elsewhere there was high-level worry . South Korean President Park Geun-hye ordered her military to bolster its combined defense posture with U.S. forces and called the test a `` grave provocation '' and `` an act that threatens our lives and future . '' Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said , `` We absolutely can not allow this . ''
`` This is indeed a wakeup call , '' Lassina Zerbo , the head of the Vienna-based U.N. Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization , which has a worldwide network of monitoring stations to detect nuclear testing , told AP by phone . `` I am convinced it will have repercussions on North Korea and international peace and stability . ''
Washington and nuclear experts have been skeptical about past North Korean claims about H-bombs , which are much more powerful and much more difficult to make , than atomic bombs . A confirmed test would further worsen already abysmal relations between Pyongyang and its neighbors and lead to a strong push for tougher sanctions on North Korea at the United Nations .
Whatever the type of the test , North Korea 's fourth nuclear explosion will likely push Pyongyang 's scientists and engineers closer to their goal of building a bomb small enough to place on a missile that can reach the U.S. mainland .
A successful H-bomb test would be a big new step for the North . Fusion is the main principle behind the hydrogen bomb , which can be hundreds of times more powerful than atomic bombs that use fission . In a hydrogen bomb , radiation from a nuclear fission explosion sets off a fusion reaction responsible for a powerful blast and radioactivity .
Some analysts say the North has n't likely achieved the technology needed to manufacture a miniaturized warhead that could fit on a long-range missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland . But there is a growing debate on just how far the North has advanced in its secretive nuclear and missile programs .
Last month , Kim Jong Un said his country was `` ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation '' . The comments were met with skepticism by North Korea watchers , who said it was unlikely that Pyongyang possesed the technology to develop such a weapon .
But nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website , `` The North has now had a nuclear weapons program for more than 20 years . This program has yielded three nuclear tests . North Korean nuclear scientists have access to their counterparts in Pakistan , possibly Iran and maybe a few other places . We should not expect that they will test the same fission device over and over again . ''
North Korea 's previous nuclear test was in early 2013 , and Kim Jong Un did not mention nuclear weapons in his annual New Year 's speech . Some outside analysts speculated Kim was worried about deteriorating ties with China , the North 's last major ally , which has shown greater frustration at provocations and a possible willingness to allow stronger U.N. sanctions .","The world reacted with outrage and skepticism Wednesday after North Korea claimed that it had successfully tested a ""miniaturized"" hydrogen bomb.

Actions not words

By Jonathan Marcus, BBC News diplomatic correspondent

The rhetoric on both sides may have got out of hand already but the real question is what practical consequences might ensue from the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang?

It should be remembered that the Korean peninsula is not at peace - the Korean conflict of the 1950s was only brought to a halt by an armistice, not a peace treaty.

But it is actions that are likely to provoke renewed fighting, not just words.

The latest North Korean threat to shoot down US warplanes comes in the wake of a recent US patrol that took its B1-B Lancer bombers and their accompanying F-15 fighter escorts over waters to the east of North Korea - the furthest north US warplanes have flown for several months, albeit still outside Pyongyang's airspace.

US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have arrived in Singapore for their historic summit.

Mr Trump flew in aboard Air Force One, a few hours after Mr Kim touched down with his entourage.

The two men are staying in separate hotels, not far from each other, and are preparing for Tuesday's meeting on the resort island of Sentosa.

Mr Kim told Singapore's PM ""the entire world is watching"". Mr Trump has called it a ""one-time shot"" at peace.

The US hopes the summit will kick-start a process that eventually sees Mr Kim give up nuclear weapons.

The two leaders have had an extraordinary up-and-down relationship over the past 18 months, trading insults and threatening war before abruptly changing tack and moving towards a face-to-face meeting.

How has the day unfolded?

Because so little is known about the reclusive North Korean leader, even the plane he would be flying in from Pyongyang to Singapore became the subject of speculation.

The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes said three aircraft took off from Pyongyang - an Ilyushin transport plane carrying Mr Kim's armoured limousine, then an Air China 747 which normally carries the Chinese president, and lastly Mr Kim's personal jet, a Soviet-era Ilyushin 62.

It eventually became apparent that he had arrived in the Air China plane after Singapore's foreign minister posted a photo of him greeting Mr Kim on Instagram.

Secrecy surrounded the five-star St Regis hotel where he is staying too. Only North Korean media workers, dressed in identical black suits, were able to move freely around the building and tourists taking photos in communal areas were accosted by guards, Reuters news agency reported.

Mr Trump landed in Singapore later in the evening having flown from a contentious G7 meeting in Canada. He told a reporter he felt ""very good"" about the summit before heading to his hotel, the Shangri La, about half a mile from Mr Kim's.

How did we get here?

Mr Trump's first year in office was marked by bitter exchanges with Mr Kim as North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of international warnings.

The US president vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" if Pyongyang kept threatening the US. He also referred to Mr Kim as ""little rocket man"".

In return, Mr Kim called him ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"".

Despite the White House's ""maximum pressure"" campaign, the North remained defiant and carried out its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. Soon after, Mr Kim declared that his country had achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state, with missiles that could reach the US.

But in early 2018, North Korea began attempts to improve relations with South Korea by sending a team and delegates to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

In March, Mr Trump surprised the world by accepting an invitation from Mr Kim - delivered via Seoul - to meet in person.

Since then, the path to the summit has been rocky, with Mr Trump at one point calling it off completely. But after some diplomatic scrambling, the two leaders will now sit down together.

Singapore is only the third country Mr Kim has visited since he became leader in 2011.

What do the two sides want?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The three things North Korea wants

The US wants North Korea to get rid of its nuclear weapons in an irreversible manner that can be verified internationally. Only when steps begin to be taken in that direction will it ""receive relief"" from the grip of UN sanctions, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis recently said.

But this does not mean the US is expecting to get a final deal in Singapore. President Trump has described it as a ""get-to-know-you situation"" and said: ""It's going to be a process.""

Analysts say that Mr Kim, by winning the prestige of a meeting with the world's most powerful leader, has already gained a victory. They also question why he would give up his nuclear weapons after pushing so hard to get them.

Some say he would never do it, unless everyone else on the Korean peninsula disarmed too - including the US.

However, Mr Kim has also said he now wants to focus on building the North Korean economy - and thus wants sanctions relief and international investment.

The question is what concessions he is willing to make, and whether he will stick to any promises. Pledges to scrap the nuclear programme have been made before by his predecessors.

What could actually happen?

It's hard to say, but Mr Trump has signalled that they could sign an agreement to formally end the Korean War, which ended in a truce in 1953. Doing that would probably be ""the easy part"", he said.

The US president has also said that if he thinks things are going badly, he will walk out of the meeting, but if things go well, Mr Kim could receive an invitation to the White House.

North Korea ’ s state publication , the Rodong Sinmun , also published a story Friday accusing China , and particularly state media outlets Global Times and The People ’ s Daily , of agitating for war against North Korea to appease the United States .
“ The Central Intelligence Agency of the U.S. and the Intelligence Service ( IS ) of South Korea , hotbed of evils in the world , hatched a vicious plot to hurt the supreme leadership of the DPRK and those acts have been put into the extremely serious phase of implementation after crossing the threshold of the DPRK , ” The Korean Central News Agency said in a report published Friday , according to Reuters . “ A hideous terrorists ’ group , which the CIA and the IS infiltrated into the DPRK on the basis of covert and meticulous preparations to commit state-sponsored terrorism against the supreme leadership of the DPRK by use of bio-chemical substance , has been recently detected . ”
The South Korean news agency Yonhap notes that the article also included threats to both countries . “ We will ferret out and mercilessly destroy to the last one the terrorists of the U.S. CIA , ” the article warned . “ Korean-style anti-terrorist attack will be commenced from this moment to sweep away the intelligence and plot-breeding organizations of the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique . ”
“ Criminals going hell-bent to realize such a pipe dream can not survive on this land even a moment , ” the article vowed .
The article alleged that a North Korean named “ Kim ” had accepted money to become “ a terrorist full of repugnance and revenge against the supreme leadership of the DPRK. ” This “ human scum Kim ” agreed to commit “ assassination by use of biochemical substances including radioactive substance and nano poisonous substance. ” The report did not specify whom he was paid to assassinate .
The attack resembles theories surrounding the death of Kim Jong-nam , the brother of dictator Kim Jong-un , who an assassin killed in Kuala Lumpur this year using VX nerve agent , a weapon of mass destruction , according to Malaysian authorities . While police in that country have found ties between the murder suspects and the North Korean government , Pyongyang has denied involvement and denounced a U.S.-led conspiracy to frame the Kim government for the killing .
North Korean media did not stop at antagonizing America and South Korea . The state newspaper Rodong Sinmun published a scathing editorial against its counterparts in China , directly addressing the Global Times and People ’ s Daily and condemning their “ absurd and reckless remarks . ”
“ China should no longer try to test the limits of the DPRK ’ s patience . China had better ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless act of chopping down the pillar of the DPRK-China relations , ” the newspaper demanded .
While belligerence against the United States is common in the pages of the Rodong Sinmun , direct challenges to China are a recent development . In February , North Korean state media accused a “ neighboring country ” of a nominally friendly disposition of acting as a “ U.S . vassal state ” as the Chinese government worked to adhere to United Nations sanctions against the country , for decades standing accused of some of the world ’ s most outrageous human rights atrocities .
The Times had recently published a column suggesting that China would need to cooperate more closely with the United States due to the volatile nature of the North Korean regime and , perhaps the highest insult of all , suggesting North Korea is more of a threat to China than Washington .
“ [ C ] ompared to the potential impairment brought about by the US ’ geopolitical containment of China , the danger of potential nuclear contamination of China ’ s northeast is more urgent , ” the article notes .
President Donald Trump has told media that he is willing to negotiate to China ’ s advantage on trade if such a deal results in the complete nuclear disarmament of Korea . “ You want to make a great deal ?

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States would work with the U.N. Security Council on `` significant measures '' to hold North Korea to account for what he called a flagrant violation of U.N. resolutions on North Korea 's use of ballistic missile technology .
South Korea 's navy retrieved what it believes to be a fairing used to protect the satellite on its journey into a space , a sign that it is looking for parts of the discarded rocket for clues into the isolated North 's rocket programme , which it did following the previous launch .
China expressed regret over the launch and called on all sides to act cautiously and refrain from steps that might raise tension . China 's Foreign Ministry said late on Sunday that it had summoned the North Korean ambassador to `` make representations and make clear China 's principled position '' .
China is North Korea 's main ally , but it disapproves of its nuclear weapons programme .
Russia , which has in recent years forged closer ties with North Korea , said the launch could not but provoke a `` decisive protest '' , adding Pyongyang had once again demonstrated a disregard for norms of international law .
`` We strongly recommend the leadership of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea think about whether a policy of opposing the entire international community meets the interests of the country , '' Russia 's foreign ministry said in a statement .

North Korea is believed to be working on miniaturising a nuclear warhead to put on a missile , but many experts say it is some way from perfecting such technology .

China expressed regret over the launch and called on all sides to act cautiously and refrain from steps that might raise tension. China's Foreign Ministry said late on Sunday that it had summoned the North Korean ambassador to ""make representations and make clear China's principled position"".

China is North Korea's main ally, but it disapproves of its nuclear weapons programme.

Russia, which has in recent years forged closer ties with North Korea, said the launch could not but provoke a ""decisive protest"", adding Pyongyang had once again demonstrated a disregard for norms of international law.

""We strongly recommend the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea think about whether a policy of opposing the entire international community meets the interests of the country,"" Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the launch and urged North Korea to ""halt its provocative actions"".

South Korean President Park Geun-hye said it was an unforgivable act of provocation.

Australia condemned what it called North Korea's dangerous conduct while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the launch was ""absolutely unacceptable"", especially after the North's nuclear test last month.

North Korea has said that its fourth nuclear test was of a hydrogen bomb. The United States and other governments have expressed doubt over that claim.

North Korea is believed to be working on miniaturising a nuclear warhead to put on a missile, but many experts say it is some way from perfecting such technology.

It has shown off two versions of a ballistic missile resembling a type that could reach the U.S. West Coast, but there is no evidence the missiles have been tested.",www.newsmax.com,right,8l9T34evn1F8k4xf

The North Korean delegation , in Pyeongchang for the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics , met at an undisclosed location with South Korean President Moon Jae-in , and expressed a willingness to meet with the United States , Moon ’ s office said in a statement .
The Pyongyang delegation said developments in relations between the two Koreas and between North Korea and the United States should go hand in hand , according to the statement .
The Olympics gave a boost to recent engagement between the two Koreas after more than a year of sharply rising tensions over the North ’ s missile program and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. sanctions .
The United States announced on Friday it was imposing its largest package of sanctions aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs .
On Sunday , North Korean state media accused the United States of provoking confrontation on the Korean peninsula with the sanctions .
“ We will see if Pyongyang ’ s message today , that it is willing to hold talks , represents the first steps along the path to denuclearization , ” the White House said in a statement .
“ In the meantime , the United States and the world must continue to make clear that North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile programs are a dead end , ” it said .
Moon , the North Korean delegation , and Ivanka Trump , U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s daughter , were among dignitaries who attended the Olympics closing ceremony on Sunday .
Ivanka Trump , a senior White House adviser , did not interact with the North Korean delegation , a senior U.S. administration official said . She met Moon on Friday as part of a weekend trip leading the U.S. delegation to the closing ceremony .
North Korea sent former military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol , an official accused of being behind a deadly 2010 attack on a South Korean warship , to lead its delegation .
The decision enraged the families of 46 sailors killed in the torpedo attack and threatened the mood of rapprochement that Seoul sought to create at what it called the “ Peace Games . ”

Moon met Kim in Pyeongchang , where the Olympics were held , before the closing ceremony , the South Korean government said .
Earlier , about 100 conservative South Korean lawmakers and activists staged a sit-in near the border with North Korea , to protest Kim ’ s arrival and facing off against about 2,500 South Korean police .
The North ’ s delegation took a different route , prompting the opposition Korea Liberty Party to accuse Moon ’ s administration of “ abuse of power and an act of treason ” by rerouting the motorcade to shield it from the protest .
The North sent Kim Yo Jong , the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , to the opening ceremony .
She was the center of a frenzy of attention , especially when she appeared at the opening ceremony and was only a few feet from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence . They did not speak .
Kim Yo Jong and the North ’ s nominal head of state were the most senior North Korean officials to visit the South in more than a decade . The North Korean leader later said he wanted to create a “ warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue . ”
The U.S. president , in announcing the new sanctions on Friday , warned of a “ phase two ” that could be “ very , very unfortunate for the world ” if the sanctions did not work .

The North Korean delegation, in Pyeongchang for the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics, met at an undisclosed location with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and expressed a willingness to meet with the United States, Moon’s office said in a statement.

The Pyongyang delegation said developments in relations between the two Koreas and between North Korea and the United States should go hand in hand, according to the statement.

The Olympics gave a boost to recent engagement between the two Koreas after more than a year of sharply rising tensions over the North’s missile program and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. sanctions.

The United States announced on Friday it was imposing its largest package of sanctions aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs.

On Sunday, North Korean state media accused the United States of provoking confrontation on the Korean peninsula with the sanctions.

The White House said its sanctions would continue.

“We will see if Pyongyang’s message today, that it is willing to hold talks, represents the first steps along the path to denuclearization,” the White House said in a statement.

“In the meantime, the United States and the world must continue to make clear that North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs are a dead end,” it said.

NO INTERACTION WITH IVANKA TRUMP

Moon, the North Korean delegation, and Ivanka Trump, U.S. President Donald Trump’s daughter, were among dignitaries who attended the Olympics closing ceremony on Sunday.

Ivanka Trump, a senior White House adviser, did not interact with the North Korean delegation, a senior U.S. administration official said. She met Moon on Friday as part of a weekend trip leading the U.S. delegation to the closing ceremony.

North Korea sent former military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, an official accused of being behind a deadly 2010 attack on a South Korean warship, to lead its delegation.

The decision enraged the families of 46 sailors killed in the torpedo attack and threatened the mood of rapprochement that Seoul sought to create at what it called the “Peace Games.”

North Korea has denied its involvement in the sinking.

Moon met Kim in Pyeongchang, where the Olympics were held, before the closing ceremony, the South Korean government said.

Earlier, about 100 conservative South Korean lawmakers and activists staged a sit-in near the border with North Korea, to protest Kim’s arrival and facing off against about 2,500 South Korean police.

The North’s delegation took a different route, prompting the opposition Korea Liberty Party to accuse Moon’s administration of “abuse of power and an act of treason” by rerouting the motorcade to shield it from the protest.

TRUMP WARNING

The North sent Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, to the opening ceremony.

She was the center of a frenzy of attention, especially when she appeared at the opening ceremony and was only a few feet from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. They did not speak.

Kim Yo Jong and the North’s nominal head of state were the most senior North Korean officials to visit the South in more than a decade. The North Korean leader later said he wanted to create a “warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue.”

Special to USA TODAY

SEOUL — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Sunday that Kim Jong Un expressed a firm commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and that the North Korean leader still wants to meet with President Trump.

Moon briefed reporters on his surprise Saturday meeting with Kim, which took place on the North Korean side of the Panmunjom border village inside the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula.

In what Moon described as a “candid, heart-to-heart conversation,” he said Kim “made clear once again his intentions to completely denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,” and expressed a willingness “to put an end to the history of war and confrontation through the success of the North Korea-United States summit.”

Meanwhile, an American delegation met with North Koreans officials Sunday in the DMZ, as planning seemed to move ahead for the Trump-Kim summit.

Saturday's unannounced meeting between the two Korean leaders came a month after their first summit, held April 27 on the South Korean side of Panmunjom.

Moon said Kim on Friday had requested to meet him “without any formality,” and the casual nature of the second meeting was “like a normal routine between friends.”

The meeting seemed to push momentum toward a summit between Trump and Kim to take place, which would be the first time a sitting U.S. president would meet with a North Korean leader.

Trump on Thursday abruptly called off the meeting, which was scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, with a letter to Kim citing the “tremendous anger and open hostility” of recent communications from Pyongyang.

Trump changed course less than 24 hours later, tweeting on Friday that Washington was having “very productive talks"" with North Korea about reinstating the summit, possibly on the same date and location.

Trump repeated that position Saturday night. ""We're looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn't changed,"" Trump said in the Oval Office as he welcomed freed American Joshua Holt after his release from Venezuela.

Moon said that during his meeting with Kim, he delivered the message that Trump still has “a firm resolve to put an end to hostility against North Korea and work for economic cooperation with the North” if Pyongyang completely denuclearizes.

“I emphasized that it is necessary for the two sides to engage in direct talks to eliminate misunderstandings and have sufficient preliminary, working-level negotiations concerning the agenda that needs to be agreed upon at the summit,” Moon said, adding that Kim agreed.

The South Korean president said the U.S. and North Korea would hold the working-level talks very soon to determine whether the summit would go forward. If the summit is successfully held, Moon said he hoped to follow up with a three-way meeting with the two Koreas and the U.S. to “formally end the (Korean) War.”

The Korean War ceased in 1953 with an armistice but not a peace treaty.

North Korea’s official state news agency also expressed Kim’s desire to meet with Trump. In a statement released Sunday, Kim “expressed his fixed will” to hold the summit with Trump, the Korean Central News Agency said.",www.usatoday.com,center,RRqD14yDMIgl1Lmx
north_korea,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44074257,Trump-Kim summit set for Singapore,,,"US President Donald Trump will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June , he has said .
`` We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace ! '' the US leader tweeted .
In March , Mr Trump stunned the world by accepting an invitation to meet Mr Kim for an unprecedented sit-down .
The pair had previously exchanged insults and threats . The breakthrough came after landmark talks between North and South Korea .
Mr Trump 's announcement came hours after he welcomed home three US detainees released by North Korea .
Their release came during a visit to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to arrange details of the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim .
No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader . The White House said the American trio were freed as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the summit , which Mr Trump earlier said he thought would be a `` big success '' .
`` I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful , '' he said .
The key issue expected to be discussed is North Korea 's nuclear weapons programme - over which Mr Trump and Mr Kim furiously sparred in 2017 .
The communist North has carried out six nuclear tests since 2006 , despite international condemnation and sanctions , saying it needs the weapons for its own security .
The US wants Pyongyang to give up its weapons programme completely and irreversibly .
Ahead of the meeting , Mr Kim has pledged to stop nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches , and also to shut down a nuclear test site .
But analysts caution that Mr Kim is unlikely to easily abandon nuclear weapons that he has pushed so hard to obtain , and that `` denuclearisation '' means something quite different to both sides .

US President Donald Trump will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June, he has said.

""We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!"" the US leader tweeted.

In March, Mr Trump stunned the world by accepting an invitation to meet Mr Kim for an unprecedented sit-down.

The pair had previously exchanged insults and threats. The breakthrough came after landmark talks between North and South Korea.

Mr Trump's announcement came hours after he welcomed home three US detainees released by North Korea.

Their release came during a visit to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to arrange details of the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim.

No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. The White House said the American trio were freed as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the summit, which Mr Trump earlier said he thought would be a ""big success"".

""I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful,"" he said.

The big question at the centre of the talks

Image copyright KCNA/Reuters

The key issue expected to be discussed is North Korea's nuclear weapons programme - over which Mr Trump and Mr Kim furiously sparred in 2017.

The communist North has carried out six nuclear tests since 2006, despite international condemnation and sanctions, saying it needs the weapons for its own security.

The US wants Pyongyang to give up its weapons programme completely and irreversibly.

Ahead of the meeting, Mr Kim has pledged to stop nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches, and also to shut down a nuclear test site.

But analysts caution that Mr Kim is unlikely to easily abandon nuclear weapons that he has pushed so hard to obtain, and that ""denuclearisation"" means something quite different to both sides.

There has been no word from Pyongyang on what it might specifically offer at the summit, but key issues for the North will be the presence of 30,000 US military personnel in South Korea, and the lifting of sanctions that are choking the economy.

At a summit in April, Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons, although the means of achieving this were not detailed and previous such pledges have been abandoned.

Still, the dramatic meeting - which saw a North Korean leader setting foot on South Korean soil for the first time since the end of the 1953 Korean War - marked a historic breakthrough between the two countries.

Why Singapore?

Singapore, a small and highly prosperous island nation, has been used before for high-profile diplomatic occasions.

In 2015, the leaders of China and Taiwan held historic talks in the South East Asian city-state, their first in more than 60 years.

It had been seen by top US officials as a good, neutral choice for the Trump-Kim talks.

The US and Singapore have a close relationship. Singapore has diplomatic ties with North Korea but suspended all trade with the country in November last year as international sanctions were tightened.

Brakes tapped

Analysis by the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington

The optimistic build-up to the summit gave way to a reality check that was bound to happen sooner or later.

With Kim Jong-un tapping the brakes and refusing to accept ""unilateral demands"" to disarm, President Trump also took a step back. He set his own conditions, although he didn't say what they were.

He did stress that it would be worth it for the North Korean leader to risk denuclearisation, throwing the ball back into Mr Kim's court.

The build-up to the summit has been shaped by an unusual degree of public showmanship by both leaders, a diplomatic version of their hostile exchanges last year. But while the threats and insults worked at the rhetorical level, this is about substantive issues where the detail matters.

President Moon Jae-in also has his spin. He really wants to seize this opportunity for South Korea's sake and continues to be determined in his optimism, leaving some here wondering whether he's been overstating Kim Jong-un's willingness to deal.

How did the mood sour last week?

North Korea cancelled high-level talks with South Korea, saying the South's joint military exercises with the US - which it had previously said it would tolerate - were a ""provocation"".

Why does the Singapore summit matter so much?

It would be historic as no sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader.

Mr Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for direct talks after more than a year of heated rhetoric and with global concern that hostilities might escalate into military confrontation.

The New York Times reported on Sunday that Mr Trump was asking aides and advisers whether the meeting should go ahead.

North Korea conducted several nuclear tests over the past few years and developed long-distance missiles which, it says, can carry nuclear bombs as far as the US mainland.

Even then, is a deal likely?

Many observers had argued before Mr Trump met Mr Moon that there was too much at stake for Washington and Pyongyang not to proceed with the Singapore summit.

However, Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament.

Journey to North Korea's nuclear heart

A group of Western, Russian and Chinese journalists have been invited by the North to its remote Punggye-ri nuclear test site ahead of its demolition.

They were flown into the North Korean port city of Wonsan but their onward journey was postponed by bad weather, Tom Cheshire from the UK's Sky News tweets.

The site, in the mountainous north-east, is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility and the only active nuclear testing site in the world.

Opinion contributor

President Trump’s decision to participate in a summit with North Korean despot Kim Jong Un is a dangerous idea. If it works, and Trump actually succeeds in beginning the denuclearization of North Korea, he will be far worthier of the Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama ever was. The chances of this are roughly zero, but it’s not impossible. More likely is that this will all end in diplomatic disaster.

Before thinking about all the ways this summit could go wrong, the president’s critics owe it to him to try to consider the few ways it could go right. At the least, this decision forestalls war for the moment. Another day of peace on the Korean Peninsula is a worthy goal and a far better approach than the childish taunts that have characterized the president’s approach so far.

Denuclearization is almost certain to fall off the table quickly, but one positive outcome would be if North Korea tries a bait-and-switch, in which they backtrack from denuclearization but agree to halt, indefinitely, all testing and production of an intercontinental ballistic missile in exchange for sanctions relief. If the president manages even this much, his gamble might pay off, at least for a while.

Most likely, however, is that the White House is about to walk right into a trap the North Koreans have been laying for American presidents since the 1990s. A one-on-one summit between a U.S. president and one of the world’s weirdest and most irresponsible leaders would be a huge reward for a regime that has long chided other rogues and dictators for their weakness in dealing with the United States.

Such a meeting would legitimize not only Kim’s regime but also his methods. No matter how the White House spins it, the North Koreans will claim a huge victory in getting Trump to bend to their will.

This isn’t to say that direct meetings are not a good idea. Sanctions are biting deeply in North Korea, and China is clearly fed up with its bizarre ally. Even so, a summit should be a reward for months, even years, of careful work and actual progress. Meetings at lower levels should progress to more senior principals, and then to the heads of state.

Instead, we have yet another decision, much like the recent and incoherent announcement of tariffs, that looks like sheer impulse from a commander in chief who seems frustrated that his advisers keep telling him that nuclear diplomacy is more complicated than running a hotel or a golf course.

Worse yet, the short run-up for a meeting in May — And why the hurry? — means that this will be a summit without an agenda and with no time to devise one, which always increases the chances of a diplomatic train wreck. There is no evidence that this move was given any kind of serious analysis by military or diplomatic advisers. The Pentagon seems to be in the dark, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made clear just hours before the announcement that no such meeting was even on the horizon.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Given North Korea’s track record, here is what is more likely to happen. Kim and Trump will meet, and Kim’s regime will reap hours of footage of an American president shaking the hand of the ""supreme leader"" that will run forever in North Korea and go viral around the world. Kim will play the gracious host and agree to everything, knowing that this kind of flattery will trigger a torrent of praise from Trump and perhaps even elicit reckless talk about lifting sanctions. (The North Koreans will surely have done their homework on the president’s psyche, which is on display all day, every day, on social media.)

After the summit, Pyongyang will then dig in on further negotiations. When those talks fail, Kim will blame Trump, leaving the president bewildered and angry. Trump will go back to his insulting ways, which will pave the way for Kim to exit any preliminary agreements. The whole business will fall apart, and North Korea will look like the sure winner: the co-equal of a U.S. president who has been humbled in front of America’s allies and embarrassed in front of its enemies. The unveiling of a functional, nuclear-armed North Korean ICBM will follow.

I hope I’m wrong. Talking to the North Koreans is certainly a far better idea than war. Trump and Kim could surprise us all and begin the process of removing nuclear weapons from North Korea. But it’s far too early to think about any calls to Oslo just yet.

north_korea,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/may/15/north-korea-cancels-talks-south-threatens-pull-out/,"North Korea cancels talks with South, threatens to pull out of U.S. summit",2018-05-15,Guy Taylor,"North Korea sent shock waves through the Trump administration ’ s hope for a history-making summit with Kim Jong-un , angrily canceling a planned meeting with South Korean officials Wednesday to protest joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises and calling into doubt President Trump ’ s announced meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore in less than a month .
The threat was issued via the North ’ s state-controlled news service despite assurances from Pyongyang that it did not object to the military drill and included a blast of old-style North Korean rhetoric denouncing “ U.S . imperialist aggressor forces ” and the “ madcap North-targeted war and confrontation racket being kicked up ” by Seoul .
The harsh rhetoric continued Wednesday morning in Korea , with the North saying via its official Korean Central News Agency that it will never engage in trade with the U.S. , a carrot Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had dangled at the weekend , and may reconsider its denuclearization pledges . KCNA also said Mr. Trump would become known as a failed leader if he follows in the footsteps of previous U.S. presidents .
The announcements were jolting after two visits to the North by Mr. Pompeo to meet with Mr. Kim and a string of goodwill gestures on both sides that included the release last week of three Korean-Americans held in North Korean prisons .

• Dave Boyer , Carlo Muñoz and Ben Wolfgang contributed to this article .","North Korea sent shock waves through the Trump administration’s hope for a history-making summit with Kim Jong-un, angrily canceling a planned meeting with South Korean officials Wednesday to protest joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises and calling into doubt President Trump’s announced meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore in less than a month.

The threat was issued via the North’s state-controlled news service despite assurances from Pyongyang that it did not object to the military drill and included a blast of old-style North Korean rhetoric denouncing “U.S. imperialist aggressor forces” and the “madcap North-targeted war and confrontation racket being kicked up” by Seoul.

The harsh rhetoric continued Wednesday morning in Korea, with the North saying via its official Korean Central News Agency that it will never engage in trade with the U.S., a carrot Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had dangled at the weekend, and may reconsider its denuclearization pledges. KCNA also said Mr. Trump would become known as a failed leader if he follows in the footsteps of previous U.S. presidents.

The announcements were jolting after two visits to the North by Mr. Pompeo to meet with Mr. Kim and a string of goodwill gestures on both sides that included the release last week of three Korean-Americans held in North Korean prisons. Analysts were divided over whether the move was a shift in strategy, a negotiating ploy by Mr. Kim or an expression of genuine unhappiness.

“If the U.S. and the South Korean authorities regard the phase of improving inter-Korean ties and the [North Korean]-U.S. dialogue provided by the proactive and broadminded efforts and measures of [North Korea] as something allowed any time and any hour, then they are sadly mistaken,” the statement warned.

The administration believes a test launch could happen without North Korea issuing a standard notice to commercial aviation and maritime shipping warning them to stay away from the missile 's path , according to the official , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information .

He said the launch could be `` imminent , '' but also cautioned that the United States `` simply does n't know . ''
The official , along with a Pentagon official , said that the United States has been able to keep satellites over the suspected launch area for most of the past week .
The United States thinks the missiles remain at a point about halfway down the eastern coast of North Korea and are about 10 miles inland .
Imagery has been impeded by some bad weather , which means there is less than perfect knowledge about what is happening on the ground . But based on what the United States has seen , the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch .
After any launch , U.S. satellites and radars in the region would be able to calculate the trajectory of missiles within minutes and quickly conclude whether they are on a test path headed for open ocean or potentially headed for land areas such as Japan .
The United States and Japan would then have to decide whether to try to shoot the missiles down , the officials said .

`` North Korea 's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs , its illicit sales of conventional arms , and its ongoing proliferation activities remain a threat to regional stability and underscore the requirement for effective missile defense , '' he said .
The admiral was asked whether there 's ever been a time of greater tension among North Korea , South Korea and the United States since the end of the Korean War in the 1950s .
`` I would agree in my recollection , I do n't know a greater time , '' he said .

`` If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wanted to get the attention of the American public , his strategy is starting to work , '' Holland said .
North Korea 's unnerving message advising foreigners to secure shelter or evacuate in case of hostilities came as Japan set up missile defenses in Tokyo and North Korean workers failed to turn up for work in the industrial complex jointly operated by North and South Korea .
In the statement published by state-run media Tuesday , the North 's Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee reiterated accusations that Washington and Seoul are seeking to provoke a war with Pyongyang .

North Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea in recent weeks , including that of a possible nuclear strike . But many analysts have cautioned that much of what Kim 's regime is saying is bluster , noting that it is believed to still be years away from developing an operational nuclear missile .
A more likely scenario , they say , is a localized provocative move .
Amid the fiery words from Pyongyang and annual military training exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces in the region , government officials in Washington and Seoul say they are taking the North Korean threat seriously .
In the days before North Korea 's latest round of threats and provocations , U.S. and North Korean officials met in New York , although nothing came of the meeting , said a source familiar with what happened .

Clifford Hart , the U.S. envoy for six-party talks aimed at North Korean denuclearization , met with North Korea 's Deputy UN Ambassador Han Song-ryol in mid-March , according to the source .

On Tuesday , Japan said it had deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo amid expectations that the North could carry out a missile test in the coming days .
The Japanese government is making `` every possible effort to protect the Japanese people and ensure their safety , '' said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe .
South Korean government officials have said they think North Korea could conduct the test launch of a missile as soon as Wednesday , following reports that the North had loaded as many as two medium-range missiles onto mobile launchers on its east coast .
The United States had previously said it was moving missile defense systems to Guam , a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases . North Korea has cited those bases when listing possible targets for missile attacks .
The souring situation on the Korean Peninsula was in evidence in the failure of more than 50,000 North Korean workers to show up for work Tuesday morning at the Kaesong Industrial Complex , the manufacturing zone shared by the two Koreas that had operated without such an interruption for eight years .
The North had declared Monday that it would pull out its workers and temporarily suspend activities at the complex , which sits on its side of the heavily fortified border but houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies .
On Tuesday , the South Korean Unification Ministry said the North Korean workers had n't reported for work in the district , which is the last major symbol of cooperation between the two Koreas .
Analysts had expressed skepticism that Pyongyang would follow through on previous threats to shut down the complex , noting that it is an important source of hard currency to Kim 's regime .
The move also is likely to put pressure on the city of Kaesong itself , where the North Korean workers and their families live . With an estimated population of between 200,000 and 300,000 people , it is one of the impoverished country 's largest cities .","Story highlights U.S. and North Korean officials met in New York last month, a source says

South Korean government officials have said they think North Korea could conduct the test launch of a missile as soon as Wednesday, following reports that the North had loaded as many as two medium-range missiles onto mobile launchers on its east coast.

The United States had previously said it was moving missile defense systems to Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases. North Korea has cited those bases when listing possible targets for missile attacks.

A symbol of cooperation at risk

The souring situation on the Korean Peninsula was in evidence in the failure of more than 50,000 North Korean workers to show up for work Tuesday morning at the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the manufacturing zone shared by the two Koreas that had operated without such an interruption for eight years.

The North had declared Monday that it would pull out its workers and temporarily suspend activities at the complex, which sits on its side of the heavily fortified border but houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies.

On Tuesday, the South Korean Unification Ministry said the North Korean workers hadn't reported for work in the district, which is the last major symbol of cooperation between the two Koreas.

Analysts had expressed skepticism that Pyongyang would follow through on previous threats to shut down the complex, noting that it is an important source of hard currency to Kim's regime.

The move also is likely to put pressure on the city of Kaesong itself, where the North Korean workers and their families live. With an estimated population of between 200,000 and 300,000 people, it is one of the impoverished country's largest cities.",www.cnn.com,left,TIRSUMVxDDbajLqP

This week was a very good week for peace in the Pacific.

There is no need to overstate what was accomplished.

North Korea’s reclusive leader Kim Jong-un traveled to Singapore to meet with President Trump.

The product of that meeting was a signed statement where North Korea pledges its commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. is willing to consider lifting sanctions against North Korea and has agreed to end “war games” in the South Pacific. Additionally, North Korea will begin taking concrete steps to ending its nuclear program.

In the meantime, the U.S. will consult with South Korea and Japan, and then begin principals-level negotiations on the specifics.

This is all positive. If the standard for success at the Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore this week was solving a problem spanning three decades in a three-hour meeting, then no one could have been successful.

Let us remember several key facts.

President Obama told President-elect Trump that the single most difficult challenge he will face is North Korea.

The North Korean regime has continued to build its nuclear program, with failed deterrence from the past three American presidents.

President Trump and his administration successfully negotiated several concessions ahead of the summit. North Korea ended ballistic missile tests and nuclear tests. North Korea reopened diplomatic discussions with South Korea with an eye toward formally ending the Korean War. North Korea released three American hostages.

President Trump has been more successful dealing with North Korea in one year than the U.S. has been in the last 30 years.

The summit is only an important first step.

But we must remember that six months ago, nuclear war seemed plausible, as the threats and rhetoric escalated. Those days now seem to be behind us.

The U.S. must continue to protect its own security, and our strong allies South Korea and Japan, and that requires steadfast leadership in holding the line on economic sanctions and U.S. troop deployment until the nuclear threat is verifiably and irreversibly neutralized.

The first step is for North Korea to inventory its entire nuclear program. Without this step, inspections are meaningless. Once that inventory is offered, the U.S. needs a system of snap inspections, with no sites exempted. As North Korea takes these meaningful steps, with South Korea also moving on a timeline toward denuclearization, the U.S. can commit to removing sanctions over time, considering scaling down U.S. troops in South Korea, and starting formal diplomatic relations with North Korea.

There are other important issues. Their medium range ballistic missile capability worries Japan. Japan has dozens of hostages being held in North Korea. Tens of thousands of North Koreans are held in prison camps, making it one of the worst human rights abusers in the world. Every one of these issues is important.

But the Trump administration is wise to focus their full and immediate attention on ending the nuclear threat.

The two sides are now publicly talking to each other. Wars are less likely when both sides are talking.

It took Ronald Reagan several years and five meetings with Mikhail Gorbachev to strike a deal with the Soviet Union.

A comprehensive agreement is complicated, and relationships take time to build.

While establishment analysts and bureaucrats have criticized President Trump at every step, the result up to this point should be reassuring to all Americans.

There is much work still to be done. The details here matter greatly.

But President Trump deserves credit for overseeing the maximum pressure campaign, which forced Chairman Kim to the table. Now that they have met, Mr. Trump has the kind of opportunity he relishes more than any other: Striking a deal.

The Lighthouse Winmore is one of the 10 ships proposed to be blacklisted. The KOTI does not seem to be included on the list.

On Thursday, China blocked a U.S. effort at the United Nations to blacklist six foreign-flagged ships, a U.N. Security Council diplomat said.

China’s Foreign Ministry, responding to a question from Reuters on the blocking, said Beijing always fully and strictly implemented Security Council resolutions.

“At the same time, any measures taken by the Security Council must have a basis in conclusive and actual proof. China will continue to participate in the work of the relevant Security Council sanctions committee on this principle,” it said in a short statement, without elaborating.

China also denied reports it had been illicitly selling oil products to North Korea in defiance of U.N. sanctions, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unhappy that China had allowed oil to reach the isolated nation.

north_korea,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/04/02/north-korea-vows-to-restart-nuclear-facilities-amid-tensions/,North Korea vows to restart nuke plant after U.S. sends destroyer to region,2013-04-02,,"North Korea vowed Tuesday to restart a nuclear reactor that can make one bomb 's worth of plutonium a year , escalating tensions already raised by near daily warlike threats against the U.S. and South Korea .
The plutonium reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of international nuclear disarmament talks that have since stalled . The declaration of a resumption of plutonium production -- the most common fuel in nuclear weapons -- and other facilities at the main Nyongbyon nuclear complex will boost fears in Washington and among its allies about North Korea 's timetable for building a nuclear-tipped missile that can reach the mainland U.S. , technology it is not currently believed to have .
The announcement came as the near-daily saber rattling from the communist dictatorship continued , with new footage of North Korean troops firing at what appears to by target cutouts of U.S. soldiers . Pyongyang has previously released footage showing air strikes on American cities and last week released a photo of Kim Jong Un signing papers authorizing rockets to be aims at cities including Washington , Los Angeles and Austin , Texas . The threats have been building since a new round of U.N. and U.S. sanctions followed North Korea 's Feb. 12 underground nuclear test .
The U.S. has responded to the increasing threats from North Korea , sending F-22 stealth fighter jets to take part in war games with South Korea and , this week , dispatching the USS John S. McCain , a guided missile cruiser , to the region in what White House spokesman Jay Carney said was an effort to reduce the `` chance of miscalculation and provocation '' by Pyonyang . The McCain , named for both the father and grandfather of Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , is outfitted with 90 missiles , including Tomahawk and anti-aircraft and is one of the U.S. Navy 's most powerful destroyers
Restarting the reactor is potentially the boldest step yet by North Korea in the ongoing escalation . According to estimates from the Institute for Science and International Security from late 2012 , North could have enough weapons grade uranium for 21-32 nuclear weapons by 2016 if it used one centrifuge at the plant to enrich uranium to weapons-grade . It was not clear how long it would take to restart the reactor , whose cooling tower was blown up in a made-for-TV event in 2008 .
A spokesman for the North 's General Department of Atomic Energy said that scientists will begin work at a uranium enrichment plant and a graphite-moderated 5 megawatt reactor , which generates spent fuel rods laced with plutonium and is the core of the Nyongbyon nuclear complex .
The unidentified spokesman said the measure is part of efforts to resolve the country 's acute electricity shortage but also for `` bolstering up the nuclear armed force both in quality and quantity , '' according to a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency .
North Korea has declared that the armistice ending the Korean War in 1953 is void , threatened to launch nuclear and rocket strikes on the United States and , most recently , declared at a high-level government assembly that making nuclear arms and a stronger economy are the nation 's top priorities .
The threats are seen as efforts to force policy changes in Seoul and Washington and increase domestic loyalty to young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by portraying him as a powerful military force .
`` North Korea is keeping tension and crisis alive to raise stakes ahead of possible future talks with the United States , '' said Hwang Jihwan , a North Korea expert at the University of Seoul . `` North Korea is asking the world , ` What are you going to do about this ? '' '
North Korea added the 5-megawatt , graphite-moderated reactor to its nuclear complex at Nyongbyon in 1986 after seven years of construction . The country began building a 50-megawatt and a 200 megawatt reactor in 1984 , but construction was suspended under a 1994 nuclear deal with Washington .
North Korea says the facility is aimed at generating electricity . It takes about 8,000 fuel rods to run the reactor . Reprocessing the spent fuel rods after a year of reactor operation could yield about 7 kilograms of plutonium -- enough to make at least one nuclear bomb , experts say .
Nuclear bombs can be produced with highly enriched uranium or with plutonium . North Korea is believed to have exploded plutonium devices in its first two nuclear tests , in 2006 and 2009 .
In 2010 , the North unveiled a long-suspected uranium enrichment program , which would give it another potential route to make bomb fuel . Uranium worries outsiders because the technology needed to make highly enriched uranium bombs is much easier to hide than huge plutonium facilities .
But experts say plutonium is considered better for building small warheads , which North Korea needs if it is going to put them on missiles . Analysts say they do n't believe North Korea currently has mastered such miniaturization technology .
Scientist and nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker has estimated that Pyongyang has 24 to 42 kilograms of plutonium -- enough for perhaps four to eight rudimentary bombs similar to the plutonium weapon used on Nagasaki in World War II .
It 's not known whether the North 's latest atomic test , in February , used highly enriched uranium or plutonium stockpiles . South Korea and other countries have so far failed to detect radioactive elements that may have leaked from the test and which could determine what kind of device was used .
`` North Korea is dispelling any remaining uncertainties about its intention for developing nuclear arms . It is making it clear that its nuclear arms program is the essence of its national security and that it 's not negotiable , '' said Sohn Yong-woo , a professor at the Graduate School of National Defense Strategy of Hannam University in South Korea .
`` North Korea is more confident about itself than ever after the third nuclear test , '' Sohn said . `` That confidence is driving the leadership toward more aggressive nuclear development . ''","North Korea vowed Tuesday to restart a nuclear reactor that can make one bomb's worth of plutonium a year, escalating tensions already raised by near daily warlike threats against the U.S. and South Korea.

Nuclear bombs can be produced with highly enriched uranium or with plutonium. North Korea is believed to have exploded plutonium devices in its first two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009.

In 2010, the North unveiled a long-suspected uranium enrichment program, which would give it another potential route to make bomb fuel. Uranium worries outsiders because the technology needed to make highly enriched uranium bombs is much easier to hide than huge plutonium facilities.

But experts say plutonium is considered better for building small warheads, which North Korea needs if it is going to put them on missiles. Analysts say they don't believe North Korea currently has mastered such miniaturization technology.

Scientist and nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker has estimated that Pyongyang has 24 to 42 kilograms of plutonium -- enough for perhaps four to eight rudimentary bombs similar to the plutonium weapon used on Nagasaki in World War II.

It's not known whether the North's latest atomic test, in February, used highly enriched uranium or plutonium stockpiles. South Korea and other countries have so far failed to detect radioactive elements that may have leaked from the test and which could determine what kind of device was used.

""North Korea is dispelling any remaining uncertainties about its intention for developing nuclear arms. It is making it clear that its nuclear arms program is the essence of its national security and that it's not negotiable,"" said Sohn Yong-woo, a professor at the Graduate School of National Defense Strategy of Hannam University in South Korea.

""North Korea is more confident about itself than ever after the third nuclear test,"" Sohn said. ""That confidence is driving the leadership toward more aggressive nuclear development.""",www.foxnews.com,right,OAqU19ZXZ8R6wljm

South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who, during his presidential campaign, said he wanted to be the leader ""who built a peaceful relationship"" between the two Koreas, will face a quandary of catastrophic proportions should a member of the North Korean contingent decide to defect to the South.

""The position that would put Moon in: Am I going to send that person back? That's what the Chinese do. Or do I allow them to stay and suffer the wrath of the North?"" Maxwell from Georgetown University hypothesized. ""North Korea would have an excuse to scuttle any agreement, withdraw from the Olympics, accuse the South of kidnapping.""

Siracusa says the South is already on high alert. It has thousands of security forces providing protection for the Games. ""They're worried about an act of terrorism. They're worried about a drone. They're preparing. They're looking for something to happen,"" he told CNN. The South has mobilized at least 60,000 policemen, military and other forces to maintain security during the Games. A spokesperson for the Games told CNN that number also included 600 firefighters and 2,400 private security officers.

Parry, riposte

The stage for the next two weeks is set for more moments of one-upmanship. Pence initiated his own propaganda push while he visits South Korea for the Games. He brought along the father of Otto Warmbier , the American student who was jailed in North Korea and died upon his return to the US last year after suffering extensive brain damage. On Friday the pair met with North Korean defectors including Ji Seong-ho. Pence told the group that ""we ourselves have stood and looked across that demilitarized zone, that line across which you fled. You fled to freedom."" He called Fred Warmbier ""a great champion"" for the freedom of the people in North Korea.

And US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka is scheduled to attend the closing ceremony , bringing her own quotient of glamor and celebrity to the proceedings.

N.Korea has not fully developed nuclear capabilities mentioned in report , Pentagon says
A missile was raised to an upright firing position , then lowered
The Pentagon 's intelligence arm has assessed with `` moderate confidence '' that North Korea has the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile , though the reliability is believed to be `` low . ''
Disclosed first by a congressman at a hearing on Thursday and then confirmed to CNN by the Defense Department , the assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea 's nuclear program .
The surprise development comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula .
North Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea in recent weeks , including that of a possible nuclear strike .
The Obama administration calculates a test launch of mobile ballistic missiles could come at any time . But a senior administration official said there is no indication that missiles believed being readied for tests have been armed with any nuclear material .
Pentagon spokesman George Little said later Thursday , `` It would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested , developed , or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage '' of the DIA study .
That stance was echoed by James R. Clapper , director of U.S. national intelligence , who said the statement read by Rep. Doug Lamborn `` is not an intelligence community assessment . Moreover , North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile . ''
Lamborn , R-Colorado , read from a declassified version of the DIA assessment at a House Armed Services Committee hearing .
`` DIA assess with moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles , however , the reliability will be low . ''

Reliability is apparently a reference to the accuracy of the missiles .
Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey , who was testifying before the House committee , appeared to be caught off guard when asked by Lamborn whether he agreed with the DIA assessment .
`` Well , I have n't seen it , '' Dempsey replied . `` And you said it 's not publicly released , so I -- I choose not to comment on it . ''
It is was not clear whether other U.S. intelligence agencies , such as the CIA , agree with the defense analysis .
The U.S. intelligence about North Korea revealed Thursday was `` mistakenly '' marked as declassified , according to an administration and a defense source .
But Lamborn told CNN 's `` AC360 '' he acted properly , reciting declassified information .
`` Whether it was a mistake or not , I ca n't answer that , '' Lamborn said of the information release . `` Given the seriousness of the threat , this is something that I think people do need to know about . ''
A House Armed Services Committee aide said staffers checked with the DIA to confirm the passage was not classified before Lamborn read it .
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , `` We do not have any independent information to verify '' the DIA study 's assessment .
Is North Korea serious about military action or is it just testing the world ?
A missile had been briefly raised to an upright firing position , stoking concerns that a launch was imminent , a U.S. official told CNN on Thursday . Later , another U.S. official said it had been tucked back into its launcher .
In more tough talk from Pyongyang , a government agency was quoted by the state-run media as saying that `` war can break out any moment . ''
After meeting privately with Ban in the Oval Office , President Barack Obama called on North Korea to tone down the rhetoric .
`` We agree now is the time for North Korea to end the kind of belligerent approach they have been taking and try to lower temperatures , '' Obama said during a photo opportunity . `` No one wants to see a conflict on the Korean Peninsula . ''

Ban called on Chinese diplomats to `` exercise their leadership and influence '' with North Korea to reduce tensions .
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry , during an upcoming visit , will tell Chinese leaders that Pyongyang is , as one senior administration official said , `` putting China 's own interests at risk . ''
The United States wants Beijing to `` stop the money trail into North Korea '' and to carry a strong message to the North that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is China 's goal , said the official and a senior State Department official .
The latest move by the North could signify that a much-feared launch is less imminent . It could also mean the government was testing the equipment .
The first U.S. official cautioned that the raising of the missile could have been just a trial run to ensure the equipment works or an effort to `` mess '' with the United States and the allies that are watching for a launch at any time .
So far , South Koreans -- who 've heard the cross-border bombast before -- are taking the swagger in stride . Washington regards much of the North 's saber rattling as bluster .
But no one is taking any chances as the daily clamor of threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un 's government shows no sign of letting up .
The official declined to specify what type of intelligence led the United States to conclude the medium-range missile -- a Musudan -- was in a firing position .
The Musudan is an untested weapon that South Korea says has a range as far as 2,175 miles ( 3,500 kilometers ) .
It could reach as far as Guam , a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases , and where the United States recently said it was placing missile defense systems .
The United States and South Korean militaries have been monitoring the movements of mobile ballistic missiles on the east coast of North Korea . Japan has deployed defense systems .

Ballistic missiles may be able to carry nukes, defense intelligence assessment says

N.Korea has not fully developed nuclear capabilities mentioned in report, Pentagon says

A missile was raised to an upright firing position, then lowered

The Pentagon's intelligence arm has assessed with ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea has the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile, though the reliability is believed to be ""low.""

Disclosed first by a congressman at a hearing on Thursday and then confirmed to CNN by the Defense Department, the assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program.

The surprise development comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

North Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea in recent weeks, including that of a possible nuclear strike.

The Obama administration calculates a test launch of mobile ballistic missiles could come at any time. But a senior administration official said there is no indication that missiles believed being readied for tests have been armed with any nuclear material.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said later Thursday, ""It would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed, or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage"" of the DIA study.

That stance was echoed by James R. Clapper, director of U.S. national intelligence, who said the statement read by Rep. Doug Lamborn ""is not an intelligence community assessment. Moreover, North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile.""

Lamborn, R-Colorado, read from a declassified version of the DIA assessment at a House Armed Services Committee hearing.

""DIA assess with moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles, however, the reliability will be low.""

Reliability is apparently a reference to the accuracy of the missiles.

Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, who was testifying before the House committee, appeared to be caught off guard when asked by Lamborn whether he agreed with the DIA assessment.

""Well, I haven't seen it,"" Dempsey replied. ""And you said it's not publicly released, so I -- I choose not to comment on it.""

It is was not clear whether other U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA, agree with the defense analysis.

The U.S. intelligence about North Korea revealed Thursday was ""mistakenly"" marked as declassified, according to an administration and a defense source.

But Lamborn told CNN's ""AC360"" he acted properly, reciting declassified information.

""Whether it was a mistake or not, I can't answer that,"" Lamborn said of the information release. ""Given the seriousness of the threat, this is something that I think people do need to know about.""

A House Armed Services Committee aide said staffers checked with the DIA to confirm the passage was not classified before Lamborn read it.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""We do not have any independent information to verify"" the DIA study's assessment.

Tough talk, raising a missile

Is North Korea serious about military action or is it just testing the world?

A missile had been briefly raised to an upright firing position, stoking concerns that a launch was imminent, a U.S. official told CNN on Thursday. Later, another U.S. official said it had been tucked back into its launcher.

In more tough talk from Pyongyang, a government agency was quoted by the state-run media as saying that ""war can break out any moment.""

After meeting privately with Ban in the Oval Office, President Barack Obama called on North Korea to tone down the rhetoric.

""We agree now is the time for North Korea to end the kind of belligerent approach they have been taking and try to lower temperatures,"" Obama said during a photo opportunity. ""No one wants to see a conflict on the Korean Peninsula.""

Ban called on Chinese diplomats to ""exercise their leadership and influence"" with North Korea to reduce tensions.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, during an upcoming visit, will tell Chinese leaders that Pyongyang is, as one senior administration official said, ""putting China's own interests at risk.""

The United States wants Beijing to ""stop the money trail into North Korea"" and to carry a strong message to the North that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is China's goal, said the official and a senior State Department official.

The latest move by the North could signify that a much-feared launch is less imminent. It could also mean the government was testing the equipment.

The first U.S. official cautioned that the raising of the missile could have been just a trial run to ensure the equipment works or an effort to ""mess"" with the United States and the allies that are watching for a launch at any time.

So far, South Koreans -- who've heard the cross-border bombast before -- are taking the swagger in stride. Washington regards much of the North's saber rattling as bluster.

But no one is taking any chances as the daily clamor of threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's government shows no sign of letting up.

The official declined to specify what type of intelligence led the United States to conclude the medium-range missile -- a Musudan -- was in a firing position.

The Musudan is an untested weapon that South Korea says has a range as far as 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers).

It could reach as far as Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases, and where the United States recently said it was placing missile defense systems.

The United States and South Korean militaries have been monitoring the movements of mobile ballistic missiles on the east coast of North Korea. Japan has deployed defense systems.

Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Thursday that Kim is using rhetoric to solidify his base within his country and its military.

""North Korea is one of those countries that's an army with a country, not a country with an army,"" said Rogers.

The mood in South Korea? 'Very ordinary'

Life is generally continuing as normal in the region, however, despite the North's barrage of recent threats, which have included warnings to foreigners on the peninsula about their safety in the event of conflict.

South Koreans, who have experienced decades of North Korean rage and posturing -- and occasional localized attacks -- have gone about their daily business without alarm.

""South Korea has been living under such threats from the past, and we are always prepared for it,"" South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae told CNN Wednesday. He called the current climate ""a very ordinary situation.""

South urges dialogue over industrial zone

The difficulties at the Kaesong industrial zone, a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, are among the few tangible signs of the tensions.

Pyongyang repeated a threat to permanently close the industrial zone, which it jointly operates with the South, accusing South Korean President Park Geun-hye of putting the manufacturing complex at risk.

The South Korean government, meanwhile, urged Pyongyang to work to resolve the situation through dialogue.

""Pyongyang should come to the bargaining table immediately,"" Ryoo said.

North Korea has pulled its more than 50,000 workers out of the complex, which is on the northern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the two Koreas, and blocked personnel and supply trucks from entering it from South Korea.

In a statement reported Thursday by state-run media, the North Korean government said that what happens at the complex in the coming days ""entirely depends on the attitude of the South Korean authorities.""

U.S. intelligence cites direct threats

The dangers posed by North Korea came up Thursday at a separate House Intelligence Committee hearing about worldwide threats.

Clapper said the United States believes the primary objective of Kim's bellicose rhetoric is to ""consolidate and affirm his power"" and to show he is ""in control of North Korea.""

Clapper said he doesn't think Kim ""has much of an endgame"" other than to get recognition from the world as a nuclear power which ""entitles him to negotiation, accommodation and, presumably, aid.""

But in a statement for the record before the committee, Clapper reiterated that the nation's ""nuclear weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the United States and to the security environment in East Asia.""

Its most recent nuclear test, in February, resulted in tougher U.N. sanctions, which infuriated Pyongyang, prompting it to sharpen its threats.

North Korea fired what appeared to be a ballistic missile from a submarine toward the East Sea on Saturday, but the projectile sputtered and fell into the ocean after only a few minutes, the South's Yonhap News Agency reported, quoting the South Korean military.

The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea fired the missile around 6:30 p.m. local time, according to the Yonhap news agency, and that it flew for about 18 miles, well short of the minimum range of 180 miles for a submarine-launched ballistic missile, or SLBM.

A South Korean government source said the missile's engine ignited after it was fired from a 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine but that it only traveled a short distance,Yonhap reported.

The government source told the agency that the projectile was only airborne for a couple of minutes.

North's Korean Central News Agency said leader Kim Jong Un observed from a test facility as the ballistic missile surged from a submarine and spewed out a ""massive stream of flames"" as it soared into the sky, the Associated Press reported.

The KCNA report said that after the test Kim declared that the North now has another strong nuclear strike method and also the ability to stick a ""dagger of destruction"" into the heads of its enemies, South Korea and the United States, at any time.

The development comes amid reports in South Korean media that Pyongyang could be preparing for a nuclear test or the launch of another ballistic missile to mark the anniversary of the Korean People's Army on April 25.

Two weeks ago, the North failed in its launch of a Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile from a mobile launcher to celebrate the birthday of Kim Il Sung, the country's founder and grandfather of the current North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The South Korean newspaper Donga Ilbo quotes unnamed South Korean military sources as saying North Korea appears to have completed all preparations for its fifth nuclear test.

While Yonhap and other South Korea news outlets play down the prospect of an imminent nuclear test, the U.S. and Japan have expressed concerns over the prospects of the fifth such test since October 2006. The most recent test took place in January.

The latest nuclear and missile tests prompted strong sanctions against North Korea.

A top US. diplomat for the Asia-Pacific region said this week that a fifth nuclear test by North Korea could prompt even harsher sanctions against Pyongyang, including severely cutting off its access to hard currency.

""Like a regimen of medicine, the dosage can be upped when the effects fall short of what's required,"" Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Danny Russel said, according to Reuters.

North Korea's foreign minister Ri Su Yong said Saturday in an interview with The Associated Press that his country is ready to halt its nuclear tests if the United States suspends its annual military exercises with South Korea.

He also defended the country's right to maintain a nuclear deterrent and held firm to Pyongyang's longstanding position that the U.S. drove his country to develop nuclear weapons as an act of self-defense.

""If we continue on this path of confrontation, this will lead to very catastrophic results, not only for the two countries but for the whole entire world as well,"" Ri told the AP, speaking in Korean through an interpreter.

According to Japan's Asahi Shimbun, the U.S., South Korea and Japan agreed this week in Seoul to push for the complete ban on crude oil exports to the North in retaliation if another nuclear test is launched.

Mr Kim has indicated he wants a phased approach, with his steps met by reciprocal ones from the US and the South - mainly on sanctions but also easing of the US military presence in South Korea.

Mr Trump has not ruled out such an approach.

North Korea has been subjected to numerous rounds of international sanctions since 2006, which has cut off most of its exports and capped its imports of oil.

The North also wants assurances that its survival as a state would never be in question.

North Korean parliamentary session shifts tone,2013-04-01,Arthur Bright,"• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
North Korea began its annual spring parliamentary session on Monday amid ongoing tensions in the region between Pyongyang , Seoul , and Washington . But in a sign that North Korea might be taking a more realistic approach than its belligerence would suggest , the ruling party declared that a stronger economy remained a top goal of the country , along with expanding its nuclear arsenal .
In recent weeks , North Korea has kept up a steady stream of threats against the United States and South Korea , including plans to `` cut off '' hot lines to the South and to launch military strikes against the US mainland . Pyongyang has also proclaimed that it would never yield its nuclear weapons under any circumstances . But the parliamentary focus on economic reform suggests that the North may not be as obsessed with its own paranoia as its propaganda suggests .
The Associated Press writes that `` there has been a noticeable shift in North Korea 's rhetoric to a message that seeks to balance efforts to turn around a moribund economy with nuclear development . ''
`` There was a danger that this was getting to the point ... of a permanent war footing , '' said John Delury , a North Korea analyst at Seoul 's Yonsei University . `` In the midst of this tension and militant rhetoric and posturing , Kim Jong-un is saying , Look , we 're still focused on the economy , but we 're doing it with our nuclear deterrent intact . ''
As further evidence to that end , the North has not yet followed through on its threat to close the Kaesong Industrial Complex , a site inside North Korea where South Korean companies and managers oversee manufacturing performed by North Korean workers . South Korea 's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reports that the site remained open on Monday , despite Pyongyang 's threat on Saturday that it `` will be mercilessly shut down '' unless South Korea stops `` damaging our dignity . ''
Chosun Ilbo notes that while a North Korean spokesman said shuttering the complex would most injure South Korean businesses , in fact the complex is a critical lifeline for the North .
[ If the complex were closed , ] the regime would have to relinquish some $ 87 million a year it makes from the wages of 54,000 North Korean workers there . A worker makes an average of $ 134 a month , but most of it goes straight into the regime 's coffers . And the families of North Korean workers as well as some 250,000-300,000 residents in Kaesong and surrounding areas would be heavily affected . `` If the water that is pumped into the city via the industrial complex is shut off , the locals will have to start digging wells , '' said a government official here .
The North Korean moves – or lack thereof – come as both the US and South Korea have appeared to be upping their shows of strength in the region .
DailyNK reports that South Korean President Park Geun-hye Monday told senior officials that `` If any provocations happen to our people and our country , it should respond powerfully in the early stage without any political consideration . ''
`` As commander in chief of the armed forces , I will trust the military 's judgment on abrupt and surprise provocations by North Korea , as it is the one that directly faces off against them , '' she added . `` Please carry out your duty of guarding the safety of the people without the slightest distraction . ''

Reuters also notes that the South has changed its military policies to allow a quicker and more retributive response to North Korean aggression :
The South has changed its rules of engagement to allow local units to respond immediately to attacks , rather than waiting for permission from Seoul . Stung by criticism that its response to the shelling of a South Korean island in 2010 was tardy and weak , Seoul has also threatened to target North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and to destroy statues of the ruling Kim dynasty in the event of any new attack , a plan that has outraged Pyongyang .
And the US sent a squadron of F-22 fighters to the region in the latest apparent display of aerial military technology amid ongoing Seoul-Washington war games in the region – war games that have provoked strong protests from the North . Time writes that `` It ’ s almost as if the U.S. Air Force has moved a branch of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to South Korea , '' as in recent weeks the US Air Force has flown `` Eisenhower-era B-52s , '' `` Reagan-era B-2s '' and `` George W. Bush-era F-22s '' over the Korean Peninsula .","• A daily summary of global reports on security issues.

But the parliamentary focus on economic reform suggests that the North may not be as obsessed with its own paranoia as its propaganda suggests.

The Associated Press writes that ""there has been a noticeable shift in North Korea's rhetoric to a message that seeks to balance efforts to turn around a moribund economy with nuclear development.""

""There was a danger that this was getting to the point ... of a permanent war footing,"" said John Delury, a North Korea analyst at Seoul's Yonsei University. ""In the midst of this tension and militant rhetoric and posturing, Kim Jong-un is saying, Look, we're still focused on the economy, but we're doing it with our nuclear deterrent intact.""

As further evidence to that end, the North has not yet followed through on its threat to close the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a site inside North Korea where South Korean companies and managers oversee manufacturing performed by North Korean workers. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reports that the site remained open on Monday, despite Pyongyang's threat on Saturday that it ""will be mercilessly shut down"" unless South Korea stops ""damaging our dignity.""

Chosun Ilbo notes that while a North Korean spokesman said shuttering the complex would most injure South Korean businesses, in fact the complex is a critical lifeline for the North.

[If the complex were closed,] the regime would have to relinquish some $87 million a year it makes from the wages of 54,000 North Korean workers there. A worker makes an average of $134 a month, but most of it goes straight into the regime's coffers. And the families of North Korean workers as well as some 250,000-300,000 residents in Kaesong and surrounding areas would be heavily affected. ""If the water that is pumped into the city via the industrial complex is shut off, the locals will have to start digging wells,"" said a government official here.

The North Korean moves – or lack thereof – come as both the US and South Korea have appeared to be upping their shows of strength in the region.

DailyNK reports that South Korean President Park Geun-hye Monday told senior officials that ""If any provocations happen to our people and our country, it should respond powerfully in the early stage without any political consideration.""

""As commander in chief of the armed forces, I will trust the military's judgment on abrupt and surprise provocations by North Korea, as it is the one that directly faces off against them,"" she added. ""Please carry out your duty of guarding the safety of the people without the slightest distraction.""

Reuters also notes that the South has changed its military policies to allow a quicker and more retributive response to North Korean aggression:

The South has changed its rules of engagement to allow local units to respond immediately to attacks, rather than waiting for permission from Seoul. Stung by criticism that its response to the shelling of a South Korean island in 2010 was tardy and weak, Seoul has also threatened to target North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and to destroy statues of the ruling Kim dynasty in the event of any new attack, a plan that has outraged Pyongyang.

And the US sent a squadron of F-22 fighters to the region in the latest apparent display of aerial military technology amid ongoing Seoul-Washington war games in the region – war games that have provoked strong protests from the North. Time writes that ""It’s almost as if the U.S. Air Force has moved a branch of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to South Korea,"" as in recent weeks the US Air Force has flown ""Eisenhower-era B-52s,"" ""Reagan-era B-2s"" and ""George W. Bush-era F-22s"" over the Korean Peninsula.",www.csmonitor.com,center,FbIvzCTLOoOy5D9c

north_korea,Newsmax,2,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/north-korea-missile-launch/2013/04/04/id/497821,North Korea Moves Missile to Coast for Possible Launch,2013-04-04,,"SEOUL , South Korea — North Korea has moved a missile with `` considerable range '' to its east coast , South Korea 's defense minister said Thursday , but he added that there are no signs that the North is preparing for a full-scale conflict.Yet CNN reported early Thursday that a U.S. official says that the regime may be readying a missile launch.Communications intercepts in recent days indicated that Pyongyang could be planning to launch a mobile ballistic missile in the coming days or weeks , the official told CNN . It 's unknown whether it would be a test or a strike.South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told a parliamentary committee in Seoul that the North has moved a medium-range missile to its east coast for an imminent test firing or military drill.The missile does n't appear to be aimed at the U.S. mainland , Kim said , according to the semi-official South Korean news agency Yonhap.The report came hours after North Korea 's military warned that it has been authorized to attack the U.S. using `` smaller , lighter and diversified '' nuclear weapons . It was the North 's latest war cry against America in recent weeks . The reference to smaller weapons could be a claim that North Korea has improved its nuclear technology , or a bluff.The North is not believed to have mastered the technology needed to miniaturize nuclear bombs enough to mount them on long-range missiles.South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin said he did not know the reasons behind the North 's missile movement , and that it `` could be for testing or drills . `` He dismissed reports in Japanese media that the missile could be a KN-08 , which is believed to be a long-range missile that if operable could hit the United States.Kim told lawmakers at a parliamentary committee meeting that the missile has `` considerable range '' but not enough to hit the U.S. mainland.The range he described could refer to a mobile North Korean missile known as the Musudan , believed to have a range of 3,000 kilometers ( 1,800 miles ) . That would make Japan and South Korea potential targets — along with U.S. bases in both countries — but there are doubts about the missile 's accuracy.The Pentagon announced that it will hasten the deployment of a missile defense system to the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam to strengthen regional protection against a possible attack.Experts say North Korea has not demonstrated that it has accurate long-range missiles . Some suspect that an apparent long-range missile unveiled by the North at a parade last year was actually a mockup . `` From what we know of its existing inventory , North Korea has short- and medium-range missiles that could complicate a situation on the Korean Peninsula ( and perhaps reach Japan ) , but we have not seen any evidence that it has long-range missiles that could strike the continental U.S. , Guam or Hawaii , '' James Hardy , Asia Pacific editor of IHS Jane 's Defence Weekly , wrote in a recent analysis.Kim , the South Korean defense minister , said that if North Korea were preparing for a full-scale conflict , there would be signs such as the mobilization of a number of units , including supply and rear troops , but South Korean military officials have found no such preparations . `` ( North Korea 's recent threats ) are rhetorical threats . I believe the odds of a full-scale provocation are small , '' he said . But he added that North Korea might mount a small-scale provocation such as its 2010 shelling of a South Korean island , an attack that killed four people.North Korea has been railing against joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises that are taking place in South Korea and has expressed anger over tightened U.N. sanctions for its February nuclear test . Many of the threats come in the middle of the night in Asia — daytime for the U.S. audience.Analysts say the threats are probably efforts to provoke softer policies from South Korea , to win diplomatic talks with Washington and to solidify the image of young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.At times , North Korea has gone beyond rhetoric.On Tuesday , it announced it would restart a plutonium reactor it had shut down in 2007 . A U.S. research institute said Wednesday that satellite imagery shows that construction needed for the restart has already begun.For a second day Thursday , North Korean border authorities denied entry to South Koreans who manage jointly run factories in the North Korean city of Kaesong . South Koreans already at the plant were being allowed to return home.South Korea has prepared a military contingency plan should North Korea hold South Korean workers hostage in Kaesong , Defense Minister Kim said . He would n't elaborate.Outraged over comments in the South about possible hostage-taking and a military response from Seoul , a North Korean government-run committee threatened to pull North Korean workers out of Kaesong as well.North Korea 's military statement Thursday , from an unnamed spokesman from the General Bureau of the Korean People 's Army , said its troops had been authorized to counter U.S. `` aggression '' with `` powerful practical military counteractions , '' including nuclear weapons.It said America 's `` hostile policy '' and `` nuclear threat '' against North Korea `` will be smashed by the strong will of all the united service personnel and people and cutting-edge smaller , lighter and diversified nuclear strike means. '' U.S . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Washington is doing all it can to defuse the situation . `` Some of the actions they 've taken over the last few weeks present a real and clear danger and threat '' to the U.S. and its allies , Hagel said Wednesday.South Korea 's Defense Ministry said its military is ready to deal with any provocation by North Korea . `` I can say we have no problem in crisis management , '' deputy ministry spokesman Wee Yong-sub told reporters.The defense minister , however , was criticized by lawmakers over a North Korean defector who stole a South Korean fishing boat Wednesday night and fled back to North Korea across the western sea border.Kim said South Korean radar had a `` blind spot '' in the area and South Korean troops were unaware the defector was fleeing until he almost reached the North Korean side . Lawmakers questioned his military 's readiness to detect and counter enemy troops who might use similar blind spots.This spring 's annual U.S.-South Korea drills have incorporated fighter jets and nuclear-capable stealth bombers . The allies insist they are routine exercises . North Korea calls them rehearsals for a northward invasion and says it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself.On Sunday , Kim Jong Un led a high-level meeting of party officials who declared building the economy and `` nuclear armed forces '' as the nation 's priorities.North Korea is believed to be working toward building an atomic bomb small enough to mount on a long-range missile .

Was Harry Reid right to Reject It?

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has moved a missile with ""considerable range"" to its east coast, South Korea's defense minister said Thursday, but he added that there are no signs that the North is preparing for a full-scale conflict.Yet CNN reported early Thursday that a U.S. official says that the regime may be readying a missile launch.Communications intercepts in recent days indicated that Pyongyang could be planning to launch a mobile ballistic missile in the coming days or weeks, the official told CNN. It's unknown whether it would be a test or a strike.South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told a parliamentary committee in Seoul that the North has moved a medium-range missile to its east coast for an imminent test firing or military drill.The missile doesn't appear to be aimed at the U.S. mainland, Kim said, according to the semi-official South Korean news agency Yonhap.The report came hours after North Korea's military warned that it has been authorized to attack the U.S. using ""smaller, lighter and diversified"" nuclear weapons. It was the North's latest war cry against America in recent weeks. The reference to smaller weapons could be a claim that North Korea has improved its nuclear technology, or a bluff.The North is not believed to have mastered the technology needed to miniaturize nuclear bombs enough to mount them on long-range missiles.South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin said he did not know the reasons behind the North's missile movement, and that it ""could be for testing or drills.""He dismissed reports in Japanese media that the missile could be a KN-08, which is believed to be a long-range missile that if operable could hit the United States.Kim told lawmakers at a parliamentary committee meeting that the missile has ""considerable range"" but not enough to hit the U.S. mainland.The range he described could refer to a mobile North Korean missile known as the Musudan, believed to have a range of 3,000 kilometers (1,800 miles). That would make Japan and South Korea potential targets — along with U.S. bases in both countries — but there are doubts about the missile's accuracy.The Pentagon announced that it will hasten the deployment of a missile defense system to the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam to strengthen regional protection against a possible attack.Experts say North Korea has not demonstrated that it has accurate long-range missiles. Some suspect that an apparent long-range missile unveiled by the North at a parade last year was actually a mockup.""From what we know of its existing inventory, North Korea has short- and medium-range missiles that could complicate a situation on the Korean Peninsula (and perhaps reach Japan), but we have not seen any evidence that it has long-range missiles that could strike the continental U.S., Guam or Hawaii,"" James Hardy, Asia Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, wrote in a recent analysis.Kim, the South Korean defense minister, said that if North Korea were preparing for a full-scale conflict, there would be signs such as the mobilization of a number of units, including supply and rear troops, but South Korean military officials have found no such preparations.""(North Korea's recent threats) are rhetorical threats. I believe the odds of a full-scale provocation are small,"" he said. But he added that North Korea might mount a small-scale provocation such as its 2010 shelling of a South Korean island, an attack that killed four people.North Korea has been railing against joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises that are taking place in South Korea and has expressed anger over tightened U.N. sanctions for its February nuclear test. Many of the threats come in the middle of the night in Asia — daytime for the U.S. audience.Analysts say the threats are probably efforts to provoke softer policies from South Korea, to win diplomatic talks with Washington and to solidify the image of young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.At times, North Korea has gone beyond rhetoric.On Tuesday, it announced it would restart a plutonium reactor it had shut down in 2007. A U.S. research institute said Wednesday that satellite imagery shows that construction needed for the restart has already begun.For a second day Thursday, North Korean border authorities denied entry to South Koreans who manage jointly run factories in the North Korean city of Kaesong. South Koreans already at the plant were being allowed to return home.South Korea has prepared a military contingency plan should North Korea hold South Korean workers hostage in Kaesong, Defense Minister Kim said. He wouldn't elaborate.Outraged over comments in the South about possible hostage-taking and a military response from Seoul, a North Korean government-run committee threatened to pull North Korean workers out of Kaesong as well.North Korea's military statement Thursday, from an unnamed spokesman from the General Bureau of the Korean People's Army, said its troops had been authorized to counter U.S. ""aggression"" with ""powerful practical military counteractions,"" including nuclear weapons.It said America's ""hostile policy"" and ""nuclear threat"" against North Korea ""will be smashed by the strong will of all the united service personnel and people and cutting-edge smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear strike means.""U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Washington is doing all it can to defuse the situation.""Some of the actions they've taken over the last few weeks present a real and clear danger and threat"" to the U.S. and its allies, Hagel said Wednesday.South Korea's Defense Ministry said its military is ready to deal with any provocation by North Korea. ""I can say we have no problem in crisis management,"" deputy ministry spokesman Wee Yong-sub told reporters.The defense minister, however, was criticized by lawmakers over a North Korean defector who stole a South Korean fishing boat Wednesday night and fled back to North Korea across the western sea border.Kim said South Korean radar had a ""blind spot"" in the area and South Korean troops were unaware the defector was fleeing until he almost reached the North Korean side. Lawmakers questioned his military's readiness to detect and counter enemy troops who might use similar blind spots.This spring's annual U.S.-South Korea drills have incorporated fighter jets and nuclear-capable stealth bombers. The allies insist they are routine exercises. North Korea calls them rehearsals for a northward invasion and says it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself.On Sunday, Kim Jong Un led a high-level meeting of party officials who declared building the economy and ""nuclear armed forces"" as the nation's priorities.North Korea is believed to be working toward building an atomic bomb small enough to mount on a long-range missile. Long-range rocket launches designed to send satellites into space in 2009 and 2012 were widely considered covert tests of missile technology, and North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests.""I don't believe North Korea has the capacity to attack the United States with nuclear weapons mounted on missiles, and won't for many years.

Related Coverage South Korea's Moon calls for more impromptu talks with North Korea

The United States has struggled to slow the isolated country’s weapons programs, which have become a security priority for Washington given Pyongyang’s promise to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

A U.S. official told Reuters that Sung Kim, the former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, would lead an American delegation to meet North Korean officials at the border. Pentagon official Randall Schriver was part of the U.S. team, the official said.

The Washington Post first reported that the team, which also included Allison Hooker, the Korea expert on the White House National Security Council, met with Choe Son Hui, the North Korean vice foreign minister.

The Post said the talks at the border would continue on Monday and Tuesday at Tongilgak, the North’s building in Panmunjom, where the truce suspending the 1950-53 Korean War was signed.

In their meeting on Saturday, Kim reaffirmed his commitment to “complete” denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to a planned summit with Trump, Moon told reporters in Seoul.

“Chairman Kim and I have agreed that the June 12 summit should be held successfully, and that our quest for the Korean Peninsula’s denuclearization and a perpetual peace regime should not be halted,” Moon said.

Moon acknowledged Pyongyang and Washington may have differing expectations of what denuclearization means and he urged both sides to hold working-level talks to resolve their differences.

The United States has demanded the “complete, verifiable, and irreversible” dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Pyongyang has rejected unilateral disarmament and has always couched its language in terms of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

In previous, failed talks, North Korea said it could consider giving up its arsenal if Washington removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.

North Korea has tested dozens of missiles of various types in the past two years, including one launch of its largest-ever intercontinental ballistic missile, which is theoretically capable of hitting anywhere in the United States, on Nov. 29.

MISTRUST ON BOTH SIDES

American officials are skeptical that Kim will ever fully abandon his nuclear arsenal. Moon said North Korea was not convinced it could trust security guarantees from the United States.

“However, during the U.S.-South Korea summit, President Trump clearly emphasized that we may see not only the end of hostile relations but also economic cooperation if North Korea denuclearizes,” Moon said.

Moon met Trump in Washington on Tuesday in an effort to keep the U.S.-North Korea summit on track.

A senior South Korean official said later the two Koreas were discussing a possible non-aggression pledge and the start of peace treaty talks as a way of addressing Pyongyang’s security concerns before U.S.-North Korean negotiations.

A statement from North Korea’s state news agency, KCNA, said Kim expressed “his fixed will” on the possibility of meeting Trump as previously planned.

Trump on Thursday scrapped the summit after repeated threats by North Korea to pull out over what it saw as confrontational remarks by U.S. officials demanding unilateral disarmament.

On May 16, North Korea criticized U.S. national security adviser John Bolton, who had called for North Korea to quickly give up its nuclear arsenal in a deal that would mirror Libya’s abandonment of its program for weapons of mass destruction.

Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed by NATO-backed militants in 2011 after halting his nascent nuclear program.

Trump dismissed the so-called Libya model. Sanders, his spokeswoman, told Fox News on May 15: “This is the President Trump model. He’s going to run this the way he sees fit.”

Kim had requested a meeting with Moon to clarify what the “Trump model” meant, Yonhap news agency of South Korea reported, citing an unidentified foreign affairs source.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — North Korea's latest test launch Sunday was a medium-range ballistic missile that has a shorter range than others fired by the communist regime in recent months, the White House said.

The South Korean military said the projectile was launched Sunday afternoon Korean time from the vicinity of Pukchang, an area north of the capital Pyongyang most notable for its hard-labor camp for political prisoners.

The rocket flew eastward about 310 miles, South Korea said. U.S. Pacific Command tracked the missile before it landed in the Sea of Japan, said the spokesman, Cmdr. David Benham. He said the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) assessed that the launch did not pose a threat to North America, but emphasized that U.S. officials were watching closely to protect allies in the region.

""U.S. Pacific Command stands behind our ironclad commitment to the security of our allies in the Republic of Korea and Japan,"" Benham said.

News of the latest missile test came as President Trump was on his first foreign trip as president, meeting with Arab leaders in Riyadh. Among other issues, Trump was trying to reassure moderate Muslim leaders that the U.S. would not tolerate similarly provocative missile tests by Iran.

The launch came a week after North Korea successfully tested a new midrange missile that it said could carry a heavy nuclear warhead.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Fox News Sunday that it was too early to determine whether economic and diplomatic pressures being placed on North Korea have had an impact yet.

“Hopefully they will get the message that the path of continuing their nuclear arms program is not a pathway to security or certainly prosperity. The ongoing testing is disappointing. It’s disturbing,” Tillerson said.

North Korea has been stepping up its provocative test-launches in recent months, attempting to develop a missile with the range and payload capacity to reach the United States with a nuclear warhead. The tests have led the Trump administration to seek closer ties with China in order to counter the threat.

""We're all aware of the provocative actions they've taken, and there have been cautions given them by nations from around the world. They clearly aren't listening,"" Defense Secretary James Mattis said Friday. ""If this goes to a military solution, it is going to be tragic on an unbelievable scale, and so our effort is to work with the U.N., work with China, work with Japan, work with South Korea to try to find a way out of this situation.""

The United Nations Security Council will hold a closed-door session Tuesday to discuss Sunday's rocket test, the Associated Press reported.

In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called Sunday's launch a “challenge to the world” that tramples international efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear and missile problems peacefully, and vowed to bring up the issue as the “main agenda” of this week’s G-7 summit of world leaders in Italy.

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the North’s latest launch “throws cold water” on the expectations by the government of South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, to “stabilize peace and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.”

Moon, a liberal who took office on May 10, had said he wanted to reach out to the North, so the missile test could present a challenge for him.

“Our government is open to the possibility of dialogue with North Korea, but will also maintain a stance of firmly responding to provocations,” the foreign ministry said.

Ruben Navarrette says those who live on the U.S. west coast are particularly concerned
He says the fear is that Kim Jong Un backs himself into a corner
You know a global scenario is serious when even Darth Vader seems scared .
Developments in and around North Korea are so worrisome that they appear to have frightened Dick Cheney . The 72-year-old former vice president stopped by to visit with GOP lawmakers Tuesday and wound up talking about unpredictable , and perhaps unstable , North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . According to sources present at the meeting , Cheney offered this blunt assessment of the crisis in the Korean peninsula : `` We 're in deep doo doo . ''
Oh , that 's just terrific . It 's spring , and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in the nation 's capital . And so naturally our thoughts turn to ... the threat of thermonuclear war ?
We interrupt the politically driven debates in Washington over gun control and immigration control to bring you an important message about a world leader who may be out-of-control .
Welcome to the North Korean missile crisis . subtitled : The Missiles of April .
It 's time to think the unthinkable . In fact , if you live in Hawaii , Guam , the Pacific Islands or , as I do , on the West Coast of the United States -- or , for that matter , anywhere else within range of this bad neighborhood -- it 's probably long past time .
`` The Obama administration now calculates it is likely North Korea may test fire mobile ballistic missiles at any time based on the most recent U.S. intelligence showing it is likely the North Koreans have completed all launch preparations . ''
The official confirmed that U.S. satellites are monitoring the Korean peninsula and 'the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch . ' ''
`` Countries in northeast Asia remained on edge Wednesday amid warnings from U.S. and South Korean officials that North Korea could carry out a missile test at any time . ''
Japan has deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo , some Chinese tour groups have canceled visits to North Korea and U.S. radars and satellites are trained on an area of the Korean east coast where Kim Jong Un 's regime is believed to have prepared mobile ballistic missiles for a possible test launch .

JUST WATCHED Is N. Korea a nuclear threat or not ? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is N. Korea a nuclear threat or not ? 03:07
Adm. Samuel J. Locklear , commander of the U.S. Pacific Command , did n't mince words when -- in remarks at a Senate Armed Services hearing this week -- he characterized the crisis as `` a clear and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and stability . ''
OK , Pyongyang , you have America 's attention -- and , for that matter , the world 's . What are you going to do now ? Think very carefully about how you answer that question .
It seems that there is not much that U.S. leaders can do now but wait for Kim Jong Un to make the next move . But that 's a high-stakes game , since he seems to be running out of moves that do n't involve a missile launch . As experts on the region have been saying all week , perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this crisis is that the North Korean leader does n't appear to have left himself an exit door .
If , after all this huffing and puffing and rattling of missiles , Kim Jong Un simply backs down and goes back to fiddling with his Play Station and making vacation plans with Dennis Rodman , could his own military see that as a sign of weakness and stage a coup ? And so , the 30-year-old despot may feel as if he has no choice but to finish the game .
Given the volatility of the situation , President Obama and his security team have to be ready -- in the event of a missile launch -- to immediately respond forcefully . A clear and unequivocal message that goes beyond diplomacy would have to be sent . The response has to leave no doubt that this administration is n't playing games -- and that it means business .
That was the message that the heroic members of Seal Team 6 delivered in tracking down and killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan last year .

Ruben Navarrette says those who live on the U.S. west coast are particularly concerned

He says the fear is that Kim Jong Un backs himself into a corner

You know a global scenario is serious when even Darth Vader seems scared.

Developments in and around North Korea are so worrisome that they appear to have frightened Dick Cheney. The 72-year-old former vice president stopped by to visit with GOP lawmakers Tuesday and wound up talking about unpredictable, and perhaps unstable, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. According to sources present at the meeting, Cheney offered this blunt assessment of the crisis in the Korean peninsula: ""We're in deep doo doo.""

Oh, that's just terrific. It's spring, and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in the nation's capital. And so naturally our thoughts turn to... the threat of thermonuclear war?

We interrupt the politically driven debates in Washington over gun control and immigration control to bring you an important message about a world leader who may be out-of-control.

Ruben Navarrette Jr.

Welcome to the North Korean missile crisis. subtitled: The Missiles of April.

It's time to think the unthinkable. In fact, if you live in Hawaii, Guam, the Pacific Islands or, as I do, on the West Coast of the United States -- or, for that matter, anywhere else within range of this bad neighborhood -- it's probably long past time.

Just this week, CNN reported this

""The Obama administration now calculates it is likely North Korea may test fire mobile ballistic missiles at any time based on the most recent U.S. intelligence showing it is likely the North Koreans have completed all launch preparations.""

And this:

The official confirmed that U.S. satellites are monitoring the Korean peninsula and 'the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch.'""

And, a day later, it followed up with this

""Countries in northeast Asia remained on edge Wednesday amid warnings from U.S. and South Korean officials that North Korea could carry out a missile test at any time.""

Japan has deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo, some Chinese tour groups have canceled visits to North Korea and U.S. radars and satellites are trained on an area of the Korean east coast where Kim Jong Un's regime is believed to have prepared mobile ballistic missiles for a possible test launch.

Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, didn't mince words when -- in remarks at a Senate Armed Services hearing this week -- he characterized the crisis as ""a clear and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and stability.""

OK, Pyongyang, you have America's attention -- and, for that matter, the world's. What are you going to do now? Think very carefully about how you answer that question.

It seems that there is not much that U.S. leaders can do now but wait for Kim Jong Un to make the next move. But that's a high-stakes game, since he seems to be running out of moves that don't involve a missile launch. As experts on the region have been saying all week, perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this crisis is that the North Korean leader doesn't appear to have left himself an exit door.

If, after all this huffing and puffing and rattling of missiles, Kim Jong Un simply backs down and goes back to fiddling with his Play Station and making vacation plans with Dennis Rodman, could his own military see that as a sign of weakness and stage a coup? And so, the 30-year-old despot may feel as if he has no choice but to finish the game.

Given the volatility of the situation, President Obama and his security team have to be ready -- in the event of a missile launch -- to immediately respond forcefully. A clear and unequivocal message that goes beyond diplomacy would have to be sent. The response has to leave no doubt that this administration isn't playing games -- and that it means business.

That was the message that the heroic members of Seal Team 6 delivered in tracking down and killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan last year. Obama's liberal base was overjoyed at the use of military force in dispatching bin Laden to the other world just before a presidential election. How could it object in this case, when once again Americans -- and our allies -- are being threatened?

That's the question. If there's an answer, let's hear it. And for the sake of those of us who are closest to the doo doo, let's hope we hear it soon.

North Korea today urged all foreign visitors and businessmen in South Korea to leave the peninsula , saying the two nations are on the verge of war . This is the latest in a series of threats from the North , each one raising questions over the secretive nation ’ s intent and capabilities .
`` The situation on the Korean Peninsula is inching close to a thermonuclear war due to the evermore undisguised hostile actions of the United States and the South Korean puppet warmongers and their moves for a war against '' the North , said the North Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee , a North Korean state agency .
There have been no signs that Pyongyang ’ s Army is preparing itself for war . And despite threats of an impending “ merciless , sacred , retaliatory war , ” the Monitor reports that most people in South Korea do n't seem to take them seriously . South Korea 's capital , Seoul , was bustling today with traffic and people , according to Reuters . Analysts see an attack on Seoul as “ extremely unlikely ” according to the Associated Press .

North Korea today urged all foreign visitors and businessmen in South Korea to leave the peninsula, saying the two nations are on the verge of war. This is the latest in a series of threats from the North, each one raising questions over the secretive nation’s intent and capabilities.

""The situation on the Korean Peninsula is inching close to a thermonuclear war due to the evermore undisguised hostile actions of the United States and the South Korean puppet warmongers and their moves for a war against"" the North, said the North Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, a North Korean state agency.

There have been no signs that Pyongyang’s Army is preparing itself for war. And despite threats of an impending “merciless, sacred, retaliatory war,” the Monitor reports that most people in South Korea don't seem to take them seriously. South Korea's capital, Seoul, was bustling today with traffic and people, according to Reuters. Analysts see an attack on Seoul as “extremely unlikely” according to the Associated Press.

Today’s threat comes on the heels of a series of others: advising embassies in North Korea to evacuate before April 10, stating plans to restart a long-unused nuclear reactor, and announcing the removal of North Korean workers from the Kaesong Industrial Complex, an important “symbol of hope” for cooperation on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang has also threatened to target US military bases in Hawaii and Guam.

Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters today that “The government is making utmost efforts to protect our people's lives and ensure their safety.” Japan deployed Patriot missiles in it capital early this morning. Agence France-Presse reports Japan’s response has been largely low key, with today’s stationing of surface-to-air missile launchers the most extreme step it has taken thus far.

""As North Korea keeps making provocative comments, Japan, co-operating with relevant countries, will do what we have to do,” Mr. Abe said.

`` No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier , not two Million Dollars , not anything else , '' Trump tweeted .
The president made the claim the day after The Washington Post reported
North Korea sent a $ 2 million bill for Warmbier 's medical treatment after it released him from prison in 2017 . Warmbier was released to the U.S. in a coma from a massive brain injury .
Warmbier , 21 , died shortly after being returned to his family in Ohio .
The Washington Post reported Thursday that North Korea presented a U.S. envoy with a $ 2 million bill for Warmbier 's hospital care , a brazen request from a regime that sentenced the college student to hard labor for removing a poster from a hotel .

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Friday his administration did not pay a $2 million medical bill demanded by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the release of hostage Otto Warmbier.

""No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else,"" Trump tweeted.

The president made the claim the day after The Washington Post reported

North Korea sent a $2 million bill for Warmbier's medical treatment after it released him from prison in 2017. Warmbier was released to the U.S. in a coma from a massive brain injury.

Warmbier, 21, died shortly after being returned to his family in Ohio.

The Washington Post reported Thursday that North Korea presented a U.S. envoy with a $2 million bill for Warmbier's hospital care, a brazen request from a regime that sentenced the college student to hard labor for removing a poster from a hotel.

A Family Envoy

After the unfortunate optics from Mr. Pence’s visit and what some viewed as a missed opportunity, Mr. Trump sent his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to the closing ceremony of the Games. She had dinner with Mr. Moon at the Blue House and briefed him on new sanctions her father would impose on North Korea, then made a public statement to reporters reaffirming the American strategy of “maximum pressure.”

All Smiles in the North

With the Olympics over, it was time for Mr. Moon to make his move. Last week, he sent two trusted aides on a two-day trip to Pyongyang: Mr. Chung, his national security adviser, and Suh Hoon, his National Intelligence Service director.
