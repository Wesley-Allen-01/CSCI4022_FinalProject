Lockhart, David Roberts, Ian Millhiser, Constance Grady, Nicole Hemmer, Kelsey Piper","The following article was first published on April 4 , 2018 on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. ’ s assassination .
On April 4 , 1968 , Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis , Tennessee . In the decades since , his name has become synonymous with the civil rights movement of the 1960s .
But the King that America remembers ( and uses to sell pickup trucks ) and the man that actually lived are very different .
Jeanne Theoharis , a professor of political science at Brooklyn College-City University of New York , argues that the story of King ’ s activism has been watered down , obscuring his complexity and controversial aspects in favor of something far less complicated .
“ There ’ s a desire to say , ‘ We embrace Dr. King , we ’ re with Dr. King , ’ and not really reckon with what he stood for , ” Theoharis told me .
In her book A More Beautiful and Terrible History : The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History , Theoharis seeks to expand the conversation about King and the fight for civil rights in the US as a whole . She focuses on the people and histories that have been condensed or completely omitted , revealing a movement that is broader and far more complicated than the one students read about in textbooks .
I spoke with Theoharis about Martin Luther King ’ s legacy , Black Lives Matter , and why the fight against racial injustice is far from over , 50 years after his death .
In your book , you speak of the “ national fable ” that has been built around the civil rights movement . What does that mean ?
When I talk about the national fable , it ’ s useful to think of President Ronald Reagan . Reagan comes into office in 1981 not supporting the idea of a holiday for Martin Luther King at all . But he came to see it as a way to signal his racial sensitivity .
In Reagan ’ s arguments for Martin Luther King Jr. Day , we see what are going to become the key elements of the national fable .
The first is the focus on courageous individuals , not movements . The second is the idea that King and figures like Rosa Parks shone a light on injustice , and [ said injustice ] has since been eradicated . The third is the act of putting the movement and the problem of racism in the past . And the fourth is the idea of American exceptionalism — the belief that the civil rights movement demonstrates the power of American democracy .
So the Dr. King that we celebrate on the third Monday of January keeps getting smaller and smaller .
Another example is the King memorial in Washington , DC . Part of the memorial showcases quotes from King , and none of the quotes that were chosen include the words “ segregation ” or “ racism. ” It ’ s extraordinary — we have a monument to Dr. King that doesn ’ t speak to race .
We also don ’ t think about how many people opposed Dr. King when he was alive . That ’ s a much more uncomfortable history .
For example , most Americans did not support the March on Washington . In 1966 , three-quarters of Americans did not agree with Martin Luther King . But because of the power of the movements that King was a part of , there ’ s a desire now across the political spectrum to say , “ We embrace Dr. King , we ’ re with Dr. King , ” and not really reckon with what he stood for .
You argue that this focus on individuals like King obscures how large the black freedom struggle is and how long the fight has been going on . Can you explain what you mean ?
Part of our fable of Dr. King has him doing everything , everywhere . There are many people in Montgomery , or Harlem , or Brooklyn , or Boston , or Los Angeles that were also doing things . When we learn about the civil rights movement , it seems like we have these exceptional individuals , they shine a light — and the problem is fixed . It makes work in the present seem less righteous , or feeble , because the things being highlighted now aren ’ t being fixed .
King and Rosa Parks are well known . But , what we actually know about them is a far cry from who they were and what they did .
We focus very heavily on the South , but King and others are adamant that racism is not a regional problem . Even in the early 1960s , King is traveling across the country to raise money for the Southern movement , but he ’ s also making speeches on the importance of housing desegregation , school desegregation , and police accountability , and reforms outside of the South .
While you were writing this book , what were some of the things you learned about King that people wouldn ’ t necessarily know ?
There ’ s this myth that King discovers the North after the Watts Uprising of 1965 . And yet when you look at what King was doing from 1960 to 1965 , it becomes clear how much he ’ s aware of , thinking about , and participating in [ the fight for civil rights in ] Northern cities .
He ’ s talking and thinking about issues that are very present for us today , like police brutality .
In one letter that King wrote two months after Watts , he talks about the horror and outrage against police brutality in the South , and the complete inattention and unconcern with police brutality in the North . That ’ s really interesting — it ’ s a King that speaks to our present , a King that is calling out Northern liberals and his Northern liberal allies for not working on the problems at home .
At the end of King ’ s life , he started talking about Vietnam and economics , and for some people , that ’ s when King becomes controversial ; that ’ s when King becomes radical .
There ’ s a certain truth to that , but that narrative leaves out the fact that King was controversial much earlier .
Today , King is often framed as someone who just wanted black and white people to get along , rather than as a person who condemned white moderates who called his actions “ untimely , ” fought for economic justice , and critiqued the Vietnam War . What ’ s one idea of his that would make people uncomfortable ?

I ’ m hoping that this isn ’ t seen as just a ceremonial week , but a week of recommitment , of using the 50th anniversary of his death to sharpen our attention toward ongoing injustice in the United States .","The following article was first published on April 4, 2018 on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.

On April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. In the decades since, his name has become synonymous with the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

But the King that America remembers (and uses to sell pickup trucks) and the man that actually lived are very different.

Jeanne Theoharis, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College-City University of New York, argues that the story of King’s activism has been watered down, obscuring his complexity and controversial aspects in favor of something far less complicated.

“There’s a desire to say, ‘We embrace Dr. King, we’re with Dr. King,’ and not really reckon with what he stood for,” Theoharis told me.

In her book A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History, Theoharis seeks to expand the conversation about King and the fight for civil rights in the US as a whole. She focuses on the people and histories that have been condensed or completely omitted, revealing a movement that is broader and far more complicated than the one students read about in textbooks.

I spoke with Theoharis about Martin Luther King’s legacy, Black Lives Matter, and why the fight against racial injustice is far from over, 50 years after his death.

Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

P.R. Lockhart

In your book, you speak of the “national fable” that has been built around the civil rights movement. What does that mean?

Jeanne Theoharis

When I talk about the national fable, it’s useful to think of President Ronald Reagan. Reagan comes into office in 1981 not supporting the idea of a holiday for Martin Luther King at all. But he came to see it as a way to signal his racial sensitivity.

In Reagan’s arguments for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we see what are going to become the key elements of the national fable.

The first is the focus on courageous individuals, not movements. The second is the idea that King and figures like Rosa Parks shone a light on injustice, and [said injustice] has since been eradicated. The third is the act of putting the movement and the problem of racism in the past. And the fourth is the idea of American exceptionalism — the belief that the civil rights movement demonstrates the power of American democracy.

So the Dr. King that we celebrate on the third Monday of January keeps getting smaller and smaller.

Another example is the King memorial in Washington, DC. Part of the memorial showcases quotes from King, and none of the quotes that were chosen include the words “segregation” or “racism.” It’s extraordinary — we have a monument to Dr. King that doesn’t speak to race.

We also don’t think about how many people opposed Dr. King when he was alive. That’s a much more uncomfortable history.

For example, most Americans did not support the March on Washington. In 1966, three-quarters of Americans did not agree with Martin Luther King. But because of the power of the movements that King was a part of, there’s a desire now across the political spectrum to say, “We embrace Dr. King, we’re with Dr. King,” and not really reckon with what he stood for.

P.R. Lockhart

You argue that this focus on individuals like King obscures how large the black freedom struggle is and how long the fight has been going on. Can you explain what you mean?

Jeanne Theoharis

Part of our fable of Dr. King has him doing everything, everywhere. There are many people in Montgomery, or Harlem, or Brooklyn, or Boston, or Los Angeles that were also doing things. When we learn about the civil rights movement, it seems like we have these exceptional individuals, they shine a light — and the problem is fixed. It makes work in the present seem less righteous, or feeble, because the things being highlighted now aren’t being fixed.

King and Rosa Parks are well known. But, what we actually know about them is a far cry from who they were and what they did.

We focus very heavily on the South, but King and others are adamant that racism is not a regional problem. Even in the early 1960s, King is traveling across the country to raise money for the Southern movement, but he’s also making speeches on the importance of housing desegregation, school desegregation, and police accountability, and reforms outside of the South.

P.R. Lockhart

While you were writing this book, what were some of the things you learned about King that people wouldn’t necessarily know?

Jeanne Theoharis

There’s this myth that King discovers the North after the Watts Uprising of 1965. And yet when you look at what King was doing from 1960 to 1965, it becomes clear how much he’s aware of, thinking about, and participating in [the fight for civil rights in] Northern cities.

He’s talking and thinking about issues that are very present for us today, like police brutality.

In one letter that King wrote two months after Watts, he talks about the horror and outrage against police brutality in the South, and the complete inattention and unconcern with police brutality in the North. That’s really interesting — it’s a King that speaks to our present, a King that is calling out Northern liberals and his Northern liberal allies for not working on the problems at home.

At the end of King’s life, he started talking about Vietnam and economics, and for some people, that’s when King becomes controversial; that’s when King becomes radical.

There’s a certain truth to that, but that narrative leaves out the fact that King was controversial much earlier.

P.R. Lockhart

Today, King is often framed as someone who just wanted black and white people to get along, rather than as a person who condemned white moderates who called his actions “untimely,” fought for economic justice, and critiqued the Vietnam War. What’s one idea of his that would make people uncomfortable?

Jeanne Theoharis

There are so many! Here’s one example. When the Movement for Black Lives linked the situation of black people in the United States to other international human rights issues, like the Palestinians, people were like, “Don’t say that, that’s inappropriate!” They said: “Be more like Martin Luther King!”

Are you kidding me? These are the exact same criticisms raised against him when he was alive.

There’s also this idea that we have Colin Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter kids over here, and King in his hallowed chamber over there. For example, in 2014, Mike Huckabee wrote a blog post calling on Black Lives Matter to be more like Martin Luther King. (The post has been deleted, but Huckabee made similar comments in 2015.)

When he made that comment, I wrote an article saying a) they are being like King, and b) be careful what you wish for!

There’s this notion that King and the civil rights movement were embraced when things started in Montgomery. They weren’t. They were called un-American. King was constantly called a communist or a communist sympathizer.

In Montgomery, the NAACP helped on the legal side, but they actually kept some distance from the bus boycott at first because they weren’t sure about the tactics used.

There’s always been disagreements and different understandings of what appropriate protest looks like. And the fact that some of the criticism of Black Lives Matter comes from black leaders — it wasn’t all that different 50 to 60 years ago. The day after King spoke about the Vietnam War, the NAACP came out against him.

The disruptiveness of the movement has also been airbrushed. After the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile led to a standoff between police and protesters looking to march onto the highway in Atlanta, then-Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said, “King would never take a freeway.”

Of course he did! They don’t look like freeways in Atlanta do now, but King wanted to stop business as usual.

P.R. Lockhart

In your book, you discuss how Coretta Scott King has largely been forgotten in discussions of the movement and King’s legacy.

Jeanne Theoharis

As we see more articles come out ahead of the anniversary, I’ve become increasingly dismayed that Coretta Scott King is seen as a side note.

Most people, if they have a sense of what Coretta Scott King did — it’s about protecting her husband’s legacy. And I think that misses the point. Coretta Scott King is a lifelong freedom fighter herself. She’s more political than King when they meet, she certainly influences his politics, particularly his growing internationalism and his stance on the Vietnam War. And then she continues, for decades after his death, [to fight for] issues that they had been committed to.

She takes the Poor People’s Campaign forward. She’s one of the people opposing the Vietnam War. The FBI surveilled Coretta Scott King for years after MLK’s death because they feared she was turning the civil rights movement into an antiwar movement. There’s something sobering about the fact that the FBI took her leadership more seriously than our historical memory has.

P.R. Lockhart

Jeanne Theoharis

While King’s assassination is devastating, how we think about the assassination places the movement in the past.

",2016-01-26,Michael Martinez,"( CNN ) The contamination of drinking water in Flint , Michigan , has so outraged community advocates that they now pose a powerful question : Was the city neglected because it is mostly black and about 40 % poor ?
Several advocates say yes . They charge that Flint residents are victims of `` environmental racism '' -- that is , race and poverty factored into how Flint was n't adequately protected and how its water became contaminated with lead , making the tap water undrinkable .
`` Would more have been done , and at a much faster pace , if nearly 40 percent of Flint residents were not living below the poverty line ? The answer is unequivocally yes , '' the NAACP said in a statement .
`` While it might not be intentional , there 's this implicit bias against older cities -- particularly older cities with poverty ( and ) majority-minority communities , '' said Democratic U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee , who represents the Flint area .
`` It 's hard for me to imagine the indifference that we 've seen exhibited if this had happened in a much more affluent community , '' he said .
For the record , Flint is 57 % black , 37 % white , 4 % Latino and 4 % mixed race ; more than 41 % of its residents live below the poverty level , according to the U.S. Census
NAACP President and CEO Cornell Brooks drew a direct connection between Flint 's socioeconomic factors and the toxic drinking water .
`` Environmental Racism + Indifference = Lead in the Water & Blood , '' he tweeted .
Environmental Racism + Indifference = Lead in the Water & Blood ... The Poisoning of Flint 's Water https : //t.co/bruzkWy5w0 # FlintWaterCrisis — Cornell Brooks ( @ CornellWBrooks ) January 24 , 2016
`` We 're trying to take action that is specific , that 's focused , that 's urgent and speaks to the people 's needs , '' he said . `` Talking with a deadline that has dollar symbols represents action , and that 's what we 're trying to do . ''
In an interview with CNN 's Poppy Harlow this week , Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder repeatedly said that he was taking responsibility for the crisis even as she reminded him that his then-chief of staff sent an email in July 2015 to a health department official warning of lead in the Flint drinking water . The email was released as part of a freedom of information request .

`` I 'm frustrated by the water issue in Flint , '' David Muchmore wrote . `` I really do n't think people are getting the benefit of the doubt . Now they are concerned and rightfully so about the lead level studies they are receiving . ''
In October 2014 , General Motors stopped using Flint River water at its engine plant because the company was seeing rust of vehicle parts .
Snyder said that General Motors ' concern `` was not a lead issue . ''
Harlow responded , `` It was the same issue of the pipes being corroded by the water , chemicals in the water , just like it is ( in Flint . ) It 's actually the same . ''
The governor said , `` These are very technical issues . But the lead came to my attention in October , end of September , early October of 2015 . We took immediate action , need to do more , did more . ''
He said Flint has seen a 45 % reduction in crime , and he touted a dental program for low-income children -- all moves his administration pushed for .

`` In terms of saying it happened because of the nature of the community here ? Absolutely not . ''
Snyder compared Flint 's unemployment struggles and other economic woes to what people in Detroit have endured in recent years , and he said his administration is responsible for improvements there .
This week , Snyder was served with a subpoena by attorneys representing Flint residents who have filed a class-action suit . They have asked for the governor 's emails and text messages going back to January 2011 .
`` Will you release all of those back to 2011 , from personal and work accounts ? '' Harlow asked .
`` I released the relevant emails , my emails , that address that issue for the relevant time period , '' said Snyder , who has released some emails from 2014 and 2015 .
`` We are complying with every investigation in terms of being open , '' he added . `` We 'll follow the appropriate legal process for subpoenas and other legal matters . ''
`` Again , we 're complying with every investigation , '' Snyder said . `` We 'll follow the appropriate legal process for subpoenas and other legal matters . With respect to releasing my emails , I did that . This is an extraordinary case . ''
Whether Flint 's water crisis happened because the city has poor residents has been discussed in social media , particularly by filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore .
Moore said the governor should be arrested for his role in the crisis . A state plan to save $ 15 million on Flint 's water bills may now cost $ 1.5 billion in clean-up , Moore said in his online petition for help from President Barack Obama .
`` This is a racial killing . Flint MI is 60 % black . When u knowingly poison a black city , u r committing a version of genocide # ArrestGovSnyder , '' Moore tweeted at one point .

`` Just to be clear : all 102K residents of Flint have been exposed to toxic water , all of Flint 's kids have ingested lead , & 10 ppl have died , '' Moore tweeted on another occasion .
The Black Lives Matter group said African-Americans , especially those in rural and poor areas , have long been denied equal access to clean drinking water .
`` The crisis in Flint is not an isolated incident . State violence in the form of contaminated water or no access to water at all is pervasive in Black communities , '' the group said on its website .
On Monday , state Attorney General Bill Schuette said he is appointing an ex-prosecutor and Detroit 's former FBI chief to join the investigation into Flint 's water crisis , creating a `` conflict wall '' between the state 's inquiry and the lawsuits targeting the state .

The prior announced investigation will determine `` whether any Michigan laws were violated in the process that created a major public health crisis for Flint residents . ''
`` I would certainly not bathe a newborn child or a young infant in this bad water , and if you ca n't drink the bad water , you should n't pay for it , '' Schuette said .
Flint 's state of emergency -- declared at municipal and state levels -- began years ago when the city suffered a financial emergency . The state took over the city 's budget and decided to temporarily switch Flint 's water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River to save money until a new supply line to Lake Huron was ready .
The river , however , was long-known as befouled . Locals call it the `` General Motors sewer . ''
After the April 2014 switch , residents complained their water had problems . Virginia Tech researchers found the water was highly corrosive . A class-action lawsuit alleges the state Department of Environmental Quality did n't treat the water for corrosion , in accordance with federal law , and because so many service lines to Flint are made of lead , the noxious element leached into the water of the city 's homes .
The city switched back to the Lake Huron water supply in October , but the damage was already done to the lead pipes . The state is now handing out filters and bottled water with the National Guard .","(CNN) The contamination of drinking water in Flint, Michigan, has so outraged community advocates that they now pose a powerful question: Was the city neglected because it is mostly black and about 40% poor?

""While it might not be intentional, there's this implicit bias against older cities -- particularly older cities with poverty (and) majority-minority communities,"" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, who represents the Flint area.

""It's hard for me to imagine the indifference that we've seen exhibited if this had happened in a much more affluent community,"" he said.

For the record, Flint is 57% black, 37% white, 4% Latino and 4% mixed race; more than 41% of its residents live below the poverty level, according to the U.S. Census

NAACP President and CEO Cornell Brooks drew a direct connection between Flint's socioeconomic factors and the toxic drinking water.

""Environmental Racism + Indifference = Lead in the Water & Blood,"" he tweeted.

Environmental Racism + Indifference = Lead in the Water & Blood...The Poisoning of Flint's Water https://t.co/bruzkWy5w0 #FlintWaterCrisis — Cornell Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 24, 2016

Brooks is pressing for a definitive plan of attack.

""We're trying to take action that is specific, that's focused, that's urgent and speaks to the people's needs,"" he said. ""Talking with a deadline that has dollar symbols represents action, and that's what we're trying to do.""

Governor takes hard questions

In an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow this week, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder repeatedly said that he was taking responsibility for the crisis even as she reminded him that his then-chief of staff sent an email in July 2015 to a health department official warning of lead in the Flint drinking water. The email was released as part of a freedom of information request.

""I'm frustrated by the water issue in Flint,"" David Muchmore wrote . ""I really don't think people are getting the benefit of the doubt. Now they are concerned and rightfully so about the lead level studies they are receiving.""

In October 2014, General Motors stopped using Flint River water at its engine plant because the company was seeing rust of vehicle parts.

Snyder said that General Motors' concern ""was not a lead issue.""

Harlow responded, ""It was the same issue of the pipes being corroded by the water, chemicals in the water, just like it is (in Flint.) It's actually the same.""

The governor said, ""These are very technical issues. But the lead came to my attention in October, end of September, early October of 2015. We took immediate action, need to do more, did more.""

He said Flint has seen a 45% reduction in crime, and he touted a dental program for low-income children -- all moves his administration pushed for.

""In terms of saying it happened because of the nature of the community here? Absolutely not.""

Snyder compared Flint's unemployment struggles and other economic woes to what people in Detroit have endured in recent years, and he said his administration is responsible for improvements there.

This week, Snyder was served with a subpoena by attorneys representing Flint residents who have filed a class-action suit. They have asked for the governor's emails and text messages going back to January 2011.

Snyder has released some emails from 2014 and 2015.

""Will you release all of those back to 2011, from personal and work accounts?"" Harlow asked.

""I released the relevant emails, my emails, that address that issue for the relevant time period,"" said Snyder, who has released some emails from 2014 and 2015.

""We are complying with every investigation in terms of being open,"" he added. ""We'll follow the appropriate legal process for subpoenas and other legal matters.""

""Again, we're complying with every investigation,"" Snyder said. ""We'll follow the appropriate legal process for subpoenas and other legal matters. With respect to releasing my emails, I did that. This is an extraordinary case.""

Michael Moore: Arrest governor

Whether Flint's water crisis happened because the city has poor residents has been discussed in social media, particularly by filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore.

Moore said the governor should be arrested for his role in the crisis. A state plan to save $15 million on Flint's water bills may now cost $1.5 billion in clean-up, Moore said in his online petition for help from President Barack Obama.

""This is a racial killing. Flint MI is 60% black. When u knowingly poison a black city, u r committing a version of genocide #ArrestGovSnyder,"" Moore tweeted at one point.

This is a racial killing. Flint MI is 60% black. When u knowingly poison a black city, u r committing a version of genocide #ArrestGovSnyder — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) December 20, 2015

""Just to be clear: all 102K residents of Flint have been exposed to toxic water, all of Flint's kids have ingested lead, & 10 ppl have died,"" Moore tweeted on another occasion.

The Black Lives Matter group said African-Americans, especially those in rural and poor areas, have long been denied equal access to clean drinking water.

""The crisis in Flint is not an isolated incident. State violence in the form of contaminated water or no access to water at all is pervasive in Black communities,"" the group said on its website.

On Monday, state Attorney General Bill Schuette said he is appointing an ex-prosecutor and Detroit's former FBI chief to join the investigation into Flint's water crisis, creating a ""conflict wall"" between the state's inquiry and the lawsuits targeting the state.

The prior announced investigation will determine ""whether any Michigan laws were violated in the process that created a major public health crisis for Flint residents.""

""I would certainly not bathe a newborn child or a young infant in this bad water, and if you can't drink the bad water, you shouldn't pay for it,"" Schuette said.

Flint's state of emergency -- declared at municipal and state levels -- began years ago when the city suffered a financial emergency. The state took over the city's budget and decided to temporarily switch Flint's water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River to save money until a new supply line to Lake Huron was ready.

The river, however, was long-known as befouled. Locals call it the ""General Motors sewer.""

After the April 2014 switch, residents complained their water had problems. Virginia Tech researchers found the water was highly corrosive. A class-action lawsuit alleges the state Department of Environmental Quality didn't treat the water for corrosion, in accordance with federal law, and because so many service lines to Flint are made of lead, the noxious element leached into the water of the city's homes.

The city switched back to the Lake Huron water supply in October, but the damage was already done to the lead pipes. The state is now handing out filters and bottled water with the National Guard.",www.cnn.com,left,pLNOx4GJU7hff4kT

Suggesting that a left-leaning media finds these facts offensive, he accused us of scientific illiteracy, immaturity and “emotionalism.” We’re in denial, he says.

Well, I would love to talk about IQ. I’m a sociologist with a particular interest in the body and an interdisciplinary background, so I’ve made understanding the relationship between society and biology part of my research agenda. The truth is that reality is far more complicated, fascinating, and infuriating than most of us ever imagined.

Story Continued Below

Here’s my argument in short: We shouldn’t expect to find genetic differences in IQ between Hispanics and whites because neither category exists in nature. If we do find differences, that’s a red flag that something’s very wrong.

One problem may involve the test itself. Intelligence tests are culturally specific, meaning that measures of IQ don’t always translate from place to place. But there is an even more insidious possibility: The likelihood that measurable differences in IQ are a result of inequality. That is, average levels of intelligence are a physical manifestation of the fact that some groups have a privileged position in society, while others do not.

( Also on POLITICO: Why can't we talk about IQ?)

The possibility that social conditions have consequences that are more than skin deep is a story about biology, race and IQ, but it’s a very different one than that told by Richwine. Instead of naturalizing inequality and justifying prejudice, it reveals that nature itself can be a tool of oppression.

So, yes, let’s talk about race and IQ.

Richwine’s first mistake was related to race. He assumes that any differences in IQ documented between races are an indication, at least in part, of contrasting racial genetics. As others have commented, his entire enterprise is doomed from the start because, while human diversity is real, race is a fiction. Human beings don’t come in a set number of biologically distinct categories. Racial designations are historical inventions that vary across countries and over time in the United States. There are some genetic markers that vary by region, such as sickle cell anemia, but none that systematically vary by the invented categories we know as race. Race is a figment of the imagination.

Richwine’s second mistake was to take IQ scores for granted as measures of cognitive ability. Racial minorities in the U.S. and members of non-Westernized nations might, on average, score more poorly that Western whites because the test isn’t designed with them in mind.

The test does measure something cognitive, but it’s culture-specific. Different parts of the world — and indeed, our societies — require different cognitive skills and this has led humans to develop a wide range of types of intelligences. Verbal and visual strategies, for example, are both effective tools for memorization, but members of some cultures are better at verbal than visual and the opposite can be said for others (e.g., white vs. aboriginal Australians). Context matters too: A pair of studies showed that both California housewives and children working in the streets of Brazil were using mathematics, but neither performed well on equivalent tasks abstracted from concrete reality and presented to them in classrooms.

So, what kind of intelligence is useful varies across culture, leading people to develop different abilities. This is not a liberal fantasy. The American Psychological Association is on record stating that we have not developed a “culture-free” intelligence test and, further, that it is likely not possible to do so.

Even if there were culture-free IQ tests, however, there are very good reasons why some populations might score worse or better. When someone is aware that she is a member of a group that is expected to do badly on a test, she often does more poorly than they otherwise would.

To demonstrate this, psychologists manipulate the outcome of tests by invoking stereotypes. Want women to do badly on a math test? Simply ask them to indicate their sex at the beginning of the test. In a society that stereotypes women as bad at math, reminding them that they’re female harms their performance.

Does this work with race? Absolutely. Activating a negative stereotype suppresses scores for people to whom the stereotype applies. So, if a member of a racial group deemed intellectually inferior sits down to take a test, and his race is on his mind, this is at play. IQ tests, then, must be taken with a grain of salt for this reason as well.

Sotomayor , who is joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , dedicates 58 pages to the dissent and highlights one central theme : Race matters . It 's the first time she has ever read a dissent from the bench , though she just recently told the Yale Law Journal that such readings are `` like entertainment for the press '' and `` I really wish it did n't happen at all . '' But , she added , `` it 's become a signal of how fiercely someone believes that the Court is wrong , and I understand some of that value . ''
In her dissent , she notes that voters in Michigan could have used other means to eliminate the use of race-sensitive admissions policies . `` They could have persuaded existing board members to change their minds through individual or grassroots lobbying efforts , or through general public awareness campaigns , '' she says . `` Or they could have mobilized efforts to vote uncooperative board members out of office , replacing them with members who would share their desire to abolish race-sensitive admissions policies . ''
But instead she invokes the `` political process doctrine '' and says : `` A majority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic rules of the political process '' and `` uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities . ''
READ MORE ABOUT TODAY 'S SUPREME COURT RULING Here 's her reasoning , which tracks with the lower court that struck down the ban : `` A citizen who is a University of Michigan alumnus , for instance , can advocate for an admissions policy that considers an applicant 's legacy status by meeting individually with members of the Board of Regents to convince them of her views , by joining with other legacy parents to lobby the board , or by voting for and supporting Board candidates who share her position . ''
She says those options are available to citizens who want the board to adopt policies that might consider athleticism , geography and area of study . But she goes on : `` The one and only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through this long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions policy that considered race in an individualized manner when it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not adequate to achieve diversity . ''
She says the voter initiative `` restructures the political process '' in Michigan to place unique burdens on racial minorities .
Sotomayor writes , `` While our Constitution does not guarantee minority groups victory in the political process , it does guarantee them meaningful and equal access to that process . ''
`` It guarantees that the majority may not win by stacking the political process against minority groups permanently , forcing the minority alone to surmount unique obstacles in pursuit of its goals-here , educational diversity . ''
And then she gets into the issue of race . `` My colleagues , '' she says , `` are of the view that we should leave race out of the picture entirely and let the voters sort it out . ''
She takes a dig at Chief Justice John Roberts who wrote once , `` The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race . '' Sotomayor says : `` It is a sentiment out of touch with reality . ''
Sotomayor says , `` Race matters . Race matters in part because of the long history of racial minorities ' being denied access to the political process . '' `` Race matters to a young man 's view of society when he spends his teenage years watching others tense up as he passes , no matter what neighborhood he grew up . Race matters to a young woman 's sense of self when she states her hometown , and then is pressed , 'No , where are you really from ? ' ''
Sotomayor says , `` The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race , and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination . ''
After citing what she perceives as the negative impact of Michigan 's ban on diversity , Sotomayor says she `` can not ignore the unfortunate outcome of today 's decision . ''
`` The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from political defeat . But neither does it give the majority free rein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities . ''
At oral arguments Sotomayor was the most vocal opponent of the ban . In fact , at one point , she asked a lawyer for Michigan a line of questions regarding its impact . When she was finished Chief Justice John Roberts pointedly said to the lawyer , `` You have been asked several questions that refer to the ending or termination of affirmative action . That 's not what is at issue here , is it ? ''
In her recent memoir , My Beloved World , Sotomayor writes about the impact of affirmative action in her life . She details her time at Princeton : `` The Daily Princetonian routinely published letters to the editor lamenting the presence on campus of `` affirmative action students , '' each one of whom had presumably displaced a far more deserving affluent white male and could rightly be expected to crash into the gutter built of her own unrealistic aspirations . There were vultures circling , ready to dive when we stumbled . The pressure to succeed was relentless , even if self-imposed out of fear and insecurity . ''
Later she tells a story about an experience at a recruiting dinner hosted by a well-respected Washington firm . One partner told her the `` problem '' with affirmative action is that `` you have to wait to see if people are qualified or not . Do you think you would have been admitted to Yale Law School if you were not Puerto Rican ? ''
`` It probably did n't hurt , '' a stunned Sotomayor said , `` but I imagine that graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton had something to do with it too . ''
Sotomayor , 59 , writes that `` much has changed '' in the thinking about affirmative action `` since those early days when it opened doors in my life . But one thing has not changed : to doubt the worth of minority students ' achievement when they succeed is really only to present another face of the prejudice that would deny them a chance even to try .

She says those options are available to citizens who want the board to adopt policies that might consider athleticism, geography and area of study. But she goes on: ""The one and only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through this long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions policy that considered race in an individualized manner when it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not adequate to achieve diversity.""

She says the voter initiative ""restructures the political process"" in Michigan to place unique burdens on racial minorities.

Sotomayor writes, ""While our Constitution does not guarantee minority groups victory in the political process, it does guarantee them meaningful and equal access to that process.""

""It guarantees that the majority may not win by stacking the political process against minority groups permanently, forcing the minority alone to surmount unique obstacles in pursuit of its goals-here, educational diversity.""

And then she gets into the issue of race. ""My colleagues,"" she says, ""are of the view that we should leave race out of the picture entirely and let the voters sort it out.""

She takes a dig at Chief Justice John Roberts who wrote once, ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race."" Sotomayor says: ""It is a sentiment out of touch with reality.""

Sotomayor says, ""Race matters. Race matters in part because of the long history of racial minorities' being denied access to the political process."" ""Race matters to a young man's view of society when he spends his teenage years watching others tense up as he passes, no matter what neighborhood he grew up. Race matters to a young woman's sense of self when she states her hometown, and then is pressed, 'No, where are you really from?'""

Sotomayor says, ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination.""

After citing what she perceives as the negative impact of Michigan's ban on diversity, Sotomayor says she ""cannot ignore the unfortunate outcome of today's decision.""

""The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from political defeat. But neither does it give the majority free rein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities.""

At oral arguments Sotomayor was the most vocal opponent of the ban. In fact, at one point, she asked a lawyer for Michigan a line of questions regarding its impact. When she was finished Chief Justice John Roberts pointedly said to the lawyer, ""You have been asked several questions that refer to the ending or termination of affirmative action. That's not what is at issue here, is it?""

In her recent memoir, My Beloved World, Sotomayor writes about the impact of affirmative action in her life. She details her time at Princeton: ""The Daily Princetonian routinely published letters to the editor lamenting the presence on campus of ""affirmative action students,"" each one of whom had presumably displaced a far more deserving affluent white male and could rightly be expected to crash into the gutter built of her own unrealistic aspirations. There were vultures circling, ready to dive when we stumbled. The pressure to succeed was relentless, even if self-imposed out of fear and insecurity.""

Later she tells a story about an experience at a recruiting dinner hosted by a well-respected Washington firm. One partner told her the ""problem"" with affirmative action is that ""you have to wait to see if people are qualified or not. Do you think you would have been admitted to Yale Law School if you were not Puerto Rican?""

""It probably didn't hurt,"" a stunned Sotomayor said, ""but I imagine that graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton had something to do with it too.""

Sotomayor, 59, writes that ""much has changed"" in the thinking about affirmative action ""since those early days when it opened doors in my life. But one thing has not changed: to doubt the worth of minority students' achievement when they succeed is really only to present another face of the prejudice that would deny them a chance even to try.""",www.abcnews.go.com,left,94YOVyzO8OhRwgNT

A New Public Face

As children gathered for day camp in a room down the hall last month, Andre Anderson, a black police commander from Glendale, Ariz., took to a podium in front of television cameras to be introduced as this city’s new, interim police chief.

“We cannot do this without you,” Chief Anderson told the gathered crowd at the community center, emphasizing his commitment to a new kind of inclusive, community-centered policing.

It is, perhaps, the worst nightmare for those of us constantly trying to get a white-dominated Hollywood to widen its doors of opportunity for people of color: All those executives who say the right things in public and give to the right causes, just might think something much less admirable about diversity behind closed doors.

This seems a prime example of how even institutions that take a close look at Hollywood's issues with race can also reinforce those problems by sticking with old habits and established practices.

Pascal has pushed back against those who suggest the leaked emails should cost her the chairman's job at Sony, saying the messages ""are not an accurate reflection of who I am.""

I believe her. But I also believe these messages are an accurate reflection of Hollywood's attitudes about diversity, where assumptions are made without proof and even the president can find himself at the butt end of a racist joke between the most powerful people in town.

The best way big shots like Pascal and Rudin can prove they aren't the people depicted in these emails is to challenge the status quo and insist on results. Break down any rule or practice that hinders bringing more diversity to executive suites, producing and directing ranks, and casting offices.

Yes, there are some people of color who are doing well in Hollywood, particularly Latino filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro Inarritu, Jorge Gutierrez and Alfonso Cuaron. But they still seem like notable exceptions.

It's time to ensure that the meeting with Sharpton isn't job-saving window dressing, but a real step toward making Hollywood's releases look more like America.

Yet he says increased diversity is also triggering a backlash from some white baby boomers who view it as a threat to traditional American values

William H. Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a population-studies professor at the University of Michigan, is author of ""Diversity Explosion: How New Racial Demographics are Remaking America."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) America's ongoing diversity explosion should be greeted with optimism because of the opportunities it presents for revitalizing our country, energizing our labor force and providing greater connectivity to the global economy. But there is a hidden danger lurking in the form of an emerging generation gap with strong racial overtones that, left unchecked, could become a significant obstacle to progress.

This gap has been greatly inflamed by the rhetoric of the presidential primaries. Its potential harm was illustrated in the canceled Donald Trump event earlier this month in Chicago, which saw young people of mixed races protesting against the views of what one of them called ""white suburbanites"" who embrace, often angrily, a vision of America that would shut them out.

With more than a subtle focus on race, each party's candidates have also been talking to different generations.

Hillary Clinton emphasizes concern for children in Flint, Michigan, ending child poverty and deportation and reforming the criminal justice system. Bernie Sanders reaches out to young people concerned about student debt and jobs. In contrast, Trump continues to talk tough on immigration and keeping out Muslims, on maintaining traditional American values, backing strong policing and protecting the middle class from tax increases.

These stances mirror generationally different attitudes revealed in a 2012 Pew Survey that showed that more than half of white baby boomers and seniors view the rise of newcomers from other countries as a threat to traditional American values and customs, a view that was held by a minority of the millennial generation born in the early 1980s to the early 2000s.

First of all , while it ’ s not true that schools have “ resegregated , ” as some claim ( see here , here , and here ) , it is fair to say that desegregation has been pretty slow .

Second , it is true that segregation is bad even when it ’ s not legally mandated the way it was during Jim Crow . Integrated schools seem to provide better education for minority students and by definition facilitate more cross-race contact .

There are a few things to unpack here.

First of all, while it’s not true that schools have “resegregated,” as some claim (see here, here, and here), it is fair to say that desegregation has been pretty slow. And yes, one of the reasons it’s slow is that the gradual end of court-ordered integration has canceled out some of the effect of rising residential integration (which isn’t happening all that fast itself).

Second, it is true that segregation is bad even when it’s not legally mandated the way it was during Jim Crow. Integrated schools seem to provide better education for minority students and by definition facilitate more cross-race contact.

However, reducing segregation via forced busing — i.e., sending kids farther away from home than the neighborhood school, sometimes very far indeed — just didn’t go all that well. Whites hated it. So did a substantial minority of blacks.

The failures of busing were widely recognized even on the left not too long ago. In 2014 Slate ran a multi-part series about how liberals’ “embrace of busing hurt the cause of integration.” (“Many black Americans did believe in the school bus and the access it provided, and busing might have been a viable tool for those families had it been smartly and surgically applied.

Charter schools, voucher systems, and letting parents choose among a city’s public schools can bring children from segregated schools into integrated ones, especially if they’re designed with that goal in mind. We could also integrate schools indirectly, by integrating neighborhoods, including by scaling back overly restrictive zoning rules.

The civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, in a 1957 speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, called on Congress to introduce equal voting rights for all Americans.

""Give us the ballot,"" said Dr King, ""and we will fill our legislative halls with men of goodwill"".

Half a century after his death, Reality Check looks at how the racial and ethnic make-up of Congress and state legislatures has changed.

The US Congress is made up of 435 elected lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, and 100 in the Senate, the upper chamber.

US politics has gradually become more diverse and this Congress is the most racially and ethnically diverse yet. Barack Obama's rise to the presidency was also seen as an important milestone.

But compared to the population as a whole, many branches of political office in America are still disproportionally white.

Changes in the Senate

Months before Dr King was killed, Edward Brooke became the first African American to win election to the Senate by a popular vote.

Mr Brooke, who represented Massachusetts and served two full terms, was known for his work in promoting low-income housing, and racial equality in the South.

Seven African-American senators have served since then, two of them women.

In Congress as a whole, the number of African-, Hispanic- and Asian-American citizens has steadily increased in the last few decades. But lawmakers are still overwhelmingly white.

In the last half a century, the total minority population in the US has more than doubled.

But while about one fifth of the most recent Congress was from a minority group, minorities represent about 38% of the population overall.

In 2017, 3% of the Senate and 10% of the House of Representatives was African American - but that group represents about 13% of the population overall.

There were similar proportions for Asian Americans (2% in the Senate, 3% in the House, but 6% overall) and Hispanic Americans (4% in the Senate, 9% in the House, but 18% overall) in Congress.

What about the House of Representatives?

About 23% of the House come from a minority background, a higher proportion than in the Senate.

Out of the number of new Congressmen and women, 34% were from a minority group, according to Pew Research Centre. This much more closely resembles an increasingly diverse country.

Almost all of the members of the House of Representatives from a minority group are in the Democratic party. The process of making politics more representative has been far less substantial among Republicans, says Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics group at American University in Washington DC.

One of the reasons why it matters, says Ms Lawless, is because politicians are more likely to raise issues affecting a minority group if they have been affected by the issue themselves as a member of that group.

There are two Native Americans serving in the House of Representatives: Tom Cole, of the Chickasaw tribe, represents Oklahoma, and Markwayne Mullin, of the Cherokee tribe, also represents Oklahoma.

There have been three senators of known Native American descent. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a member of the North Cheyenne tribe, served until 2005. A record number of Native Americans ran for office in 2016.

State politics

More than 7,000 men and women are elected to serve in state legislatures. Like their counterparts in the national Congress, state lawmakers are less diverse than the whole population. Based on a study by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) in 2015, Hawaii, followed by New Mexico, have the highest proportion of minority lawmakers in their state - 78% and 49% respectively. The state with the highest percentage of white lawmakers in 2015 was North Dakota with 99%. Minorities account for about 15% of the state's total population.

Hawaii, California, the southern states on the Mexican border, Florida and some of the states along the eastern coast have the highest proportion of legislators from minority populations. States in the middle of the country and those on the northern border generally have the lowest percentage.

The state with the highest proportion of African-American legislators is Mississippi, Hawaii has the highest proportion of Asian and Pacific Islanders, for Native Americans it's Montana and for Hispanic Americans it's New Mexico.

The law, which requires transgender people to use public bathrooms that conform to the sex on their birth certificate, has been broadly condemned by gay-rights groups, businesses and entertainers.

I really don’t see what the problem is with this bill. It’s as if no one on the political left actually read it. It does not strip protections from anyone, businesses can adopt their own nondiscrimination standards (or honor the ones currently on the books), and they are free to establish single occupancy bathrooms. Local governments can also adopt stricter anti-discrimination codes for their employees. What about those transgender persons who have undergone a sex change?

So, what’s the problem here? No protections are being undercut, businesses and localities are free to accept the current nondiscrimination standards on the books, or adopt new, stricter standards. This appears to be just another political stunt to satisfy the blood thirst with left-wingers on this issue.

Concerning image, it also doesn’t help that a transwoman seems to have lied about being confronted by a custodian at a Transit Center in North Carolina for using the woman’s bathroom. The transgender woman planned on taking a selfie inside. She claims to have been escorted out by security, which was a humiliating experience. The problem is that the security camera footage doesn’t show her being escorted out. When confronted, she pretty much said you just had to be there. That’s not how this works.

The possible loss of federal funds will surely hurt North Carolina’s economy, which has been the fastest growing since 2013. All of this because North Carolina decided to give their residents a sense of privacy in the restroom areas, in order to prevent some male creepers have dressed as women in order to record unsuspecting females in those facilities. Again, no rights were stripped from transgender people; the same protections that existed then, exist now. Birth certificates can be changed.

(CNN) – The fiftieth anniversary of the historic March on Washington, celebrated in the nation's capital this week, is being marked with separate events by Republicans and Democrats as a sharp partisan divide persists on issues of race in America.

Half a century after Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" address, which became a crucial moment in the struggle for civil rights in the U.S., a new national poll indicates a left-right divide over whether King's dream has been reached. And political issues that involve race, including voting rights and high minority unemployment, continue to split Americans along party lines.



According to Pew Research Center survey released last week, 49% of Americans say that ""a lot more"" needs to be done to achieve King's dream, with just over three in ten saying ""some more"" needs to be done and 16% saying little or nothing needs to be accomplished.

The poll indicates Democrats and Republicans don't see eye to eye on the question. Thirty-five percent of Republicans surveyed say ""a lot more"" needs to be done to reach racial equality. That number jumps to 63% among Democrats questioned in the survey, which was conducted in early August.

Louisiana's Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, who in 2008 became the first Indian-American to serve as governor in the country's history, wrote in Politico Monday that for all the progress made on racial equality since King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech, there was still a sense of dividedness among Americans.

""We still place far too much emphasis on our 'separateness,' our heritage, ethnic background, skin color, etc,"" he wrote. ""We live in the age of hyphenated Americans: Asian-Americans, Italian-Americans, African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Indian-Americans, and Native Americans, to name just a few. Here's an idea: How about just 'Americans?'""

""We are all created in the image of God – skinny, fat, tall, short, dark, light, whatever. Who cares? What does it matter? It's time to get over it,"" he continued. ""It's time for the end of race in America. Now that would be progress.""

Jindal's essay comes as Republican and Democratic politicians hold separate events to mark the anniversary of King's speech and the March on Washington, which in 1963 drew hundreds of thousands of Americans to the National Mall in Washington.

A Saturday rally, organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network along with Martin Luther King III and the NAACP, featured speeches from Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, as well as Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights leader who now serves as a Democratic congressman representing parts of Atlanta.

Attorney General Eric Holder and Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in the Garden State, also spoke.

On Wednesday, which will be 50 years since Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, President Barack Obama will deliver remarks at a rally in the same spot. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter will also attend and address the crowd.

Former President George W. Bush was invited to attend, but declined since he's recovering from a heart procedure earlier this summer. Bush had a stent placed in his heart on August 6 and left the hospital a day later.

No Republicans are slated to speak at the Wednesday event. Instead, the Republican National Committee is hosting a luncheon Monday to commemorate the anniversary that features the party's chairman Reince Priebus and prominent African-American Republicans, including T.W. Shannon, the speaker of Oklahoma's state House of Representatives, and former Rep. Allen West of Florida, who lost his bid for re-election last year.

""I think the RNC and chairman Priebus' timing on commemorating that event was well worth it,"" Shannon said on CNN later Monday. ""If you look at the attendance that we had, we had people from all walks of life that came to the luncheon to participate to recognize that not only are we honoring the man, but we were honoring an idea.""

Also attending the event – Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who's been a leading GOP voice on rewriting portions of the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court gutted its key provisions in June.

Saying the court had ""thrown a monkey wrench"" into the law, he said it was lawmakers' responsibility to fix it.

Republican lawmakers also marked the march's anniversary in July, before leaving for August's recess, with an event in the U.S. Capitol led by House Speaker John Boehner.

If they really cared about Rosa Parks ’ memory , Republicans would attempt to emulate her courage in challenging the white male entitlement that demanded she give up the seat that she paid for .

Moreover , the GOP ’ s refusal to grapple with the persistent and enduring problem of racism will find them on the wrong side of history just a couple of generations hence . For instance , though Marissa Alexander is now free on bond in Florida , awaiting a second trial for firing a warning shot at her abusive ex-husband , by all indications conservative prosecutor Angela Corey insists on using taxpayer money to try her again and to lock her up for 20 years based on Alexander ’ s attempt to defend herself .

This Rosa Parks fiasco demonstrates that the GOP ’ s intellectual and political gymnastics around racism and civil rights are so off-kilter that they couldn ’ t even manage to stick the landing on an exercise with a minimal level of difficulty . They definitely need to come again . And this time , I hope they ’ ll come correct .","With this week marking the 58th anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, much has rightly been made of the Republican National Committee tweeting a picture of Rosa Parks this weekend, with a caption that said: “today we remember Rosa Parks’ bold stand and her role in ending racism."" (emphasis added)

But while many have justifiably focused on the claim that racism has “ended” (which the RNC later ""clarified""), another significant truth has gotten lost. If they really cared about Rosa Parks’ memory, Republicans would attempt to emulate her courage in challenging the white male entitlement that demanded she give up the seat that she paid for. That kind of white male entitlement still dominates both the GOP and the American political scene today.

civil_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/14/george-soros-funds-ferguson-protests-hopes-to-spur/,"George Soros funds Ferguson protests, hopes to spur civil action",2015-01-14,Kelly Riddell,"There ’ s a solitary man at the financial center of the Ferguson protest movement . No , it ’ s not victim Michael Brown or Officer Darren Wilson . It ’ s not even the Rev . Al Sharpton , despite his ubiquitous campaign on TV and the streets .
Rather , it ’ s liberal billionaire George Soros , who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts American politics and policy , not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org .
Mr. Soros spurred the Ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S. , according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by The ███ .
In all , Mr. Soros gave at least $ 33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots , on-the-ground activists in Ferguson , according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations .
The financial tether from Mr. Soros to the activist groups gave rise to a combustible protest movement that transformed a one-day criminal event in Missouri into a 24-hour-a-day national cause celebre .
“ Our DNA includes a belief that having people participate in government is indispensable to living in a more just , inclusive , democratic society , ” said Kenneth Zimmerman , director of Mr. Soros ‘ Open Society Foundations ’ U.S. programs , in an interview with The ███ . “ Helping groups combine policy , research [ and ] data collection with community organizing feels very much the way our society becomes more accountable . ”

Mr. Zimmerman said OSF has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early ‘ 90s , and that , although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of Mr. Soros ‘ grants , they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of Open Society .
“ The incidents , whether in Staten Island , Cleveland or Ferguson , were spontaneous protests — we don ’ t have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say , ” Mr. Zimmerman said . “ But these circumstances focused people ’ s attention — and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like Ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation . ”
Soros-sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in Ferguson , building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign .
Other Soros-funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep , and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive .
The plethora of organizations involved not only shared Mr. Soros ‘ funding , but they also fed off each other , using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on another ’ s website , referencing each other ’ s news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of Facebook “ likes ” and Twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds .
Buses of activists from the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference in Chicago ; from the Drug Policy Alliance , Make the Road New York and Equal Justice USA from New York ; from Sojourners , the Advancement Project and Center for Community Change in Washington ; and networks from the Gamaliel Foundation — all funded in part by Mr. Soros — descended on Ferguson starting in August and later organized protests and gatherings in the city until late last month .
All were aimed at keeping the media ’ s attention on the city and to widen the scope of the incident to focus on interrelated causes — not just the overpolicing and racial discrimination narratives that were highlighted by the news media in August .
“ I went to Ferguson in a quest to be in solidarity and stand with the young organizers and affirm their leadership , ” said Kassandra Frederique , policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance , which was founded by Mr. Soros , and which receives $ 4 million annually from his foundation . She traveled to Ferguson in October .
“ We recognized this movement is similar to the work we ’ re doing at DPA , ” said Ms. Frederique . “ The war on drugs has always been to operationalize , institutionalize and criminalize people of color . Protecting personal sovereignty is a cornerstone of the work we do and what this movement is all about . ”
Ms. Frederique works with Opal Tometi , co-creator of # BlackLivesMatter — a hashtag that was developed after the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida — and helped promote it on DPA ’ s news feeds . Ms. Tometi runs the Black Alliance for Just Immigration , a group to which Mr. Soros gave $ 100,000 in 2011 , according to the most recent of his foundation ’ s tax filings .
“ I think # BlackLivesMatter ’ s success is because of organizing . This was created after Trayvon Martin , and there has been sustained organizing and conversations about police violence since then , ” said Ms. Frederique . “ Its explosion into the mainstream recently is because it connects all the dots at a time when everyone was lost for words . ‘ Black Lives Matter ’ is liberating , unapologetic and leaves no room for confusion . ”
With the backing of national civil rights organizations and Mr. Soros ‘ funding , “ Black Lives Matter ” grew from a hashtag into a social media phenomenon , including a # BlackLivesMatter bus tour and march in September .
“ More than 500 of us have traveled from Boston , Chicago , Columbus , Detroit , Houston , Los Angeles , Nashville , Portland , Tucson , Washington , D.C. , Winston-Salem , North Carolina , and other cities to support the people of Ferguson and help turn a local moment into a national movement , ” wrote Akiba Solomon , a journalist at Colorlines , describing the event .
Colorlines is an online news site that focuses on race issues and is published by Race Forward , a group that received $ 200,000 from Mr. Soros ’ s foundation in 2011 . Colorlines has published tirelessly on the activities in Ferguson and heavily promoted the # BlackLivesMatter hashtag and activities .
At the end of the # BlackLivesMatter march , organizers met with civil rights groups like the Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment to strategize their operations moving forward , Ms. Solomon wrote . OBS and MORE are also funded by Mr. Soros .
Mr. Soros gave $ 5.4 million to Ferguson and Staten Island grass-roots efforts last year to help “ further police reform , accountability and public transparency , ” the Open Society Foundations said in a blog post in December . About half of those funds were earmarked to Ferguson , with the money primarily going to OBS and MORE , the foundation said .
OBS and MORE , along with the Dream Defenders , established the “ Hands Up Coalition ” — another so-called “ grass-roots ” organization in Missouri , whose name was based on now-known-to-be-false claims that Brown had his hands up before being shot . The Defenders were built to rally support and awareness for the Trayvon Martin case and were funded by the Tides Foundation , another recipient of Soros cash .
Hands Up Coalition has made it its mission to recruit and organize youth nationwide to start local events in their communities — trying to take Ferguson nationwide .
Hands Up Coalition has dubbed 2015 as “ The Year of Resistance , ” and its outreach program strongly resembles how President Obama ’ s political action committee — Organizing for Action — rallies youth for its causes , complete with a similarly designed Web page and call to action .
Mr. Soros , who made his fortune betting against the British pound during the currency crisis in the early ‘ 90s , is a well-known supporter of progressive-liberal causes and is a political donor to Mr. Obama ’ s campaigns . He committed $ 1 million to Mr. Obama ’ s super PAC in 2012 .
Mr. Soros ‘ two largest foundations manage almost $ 3 billion in assets per year , according to their most recent respective tax returns . The Foundation to Promote Open Society managed $ 2.2 billion in assets in 2011 , and his Open Society Institute managed $ 685.9 million in 2012 .
In comparison , David and Charles Koch , the billionaire brothers whom liberals often call a threat to democracy — and worse — for their conservative influence , had $ 308 million tied up in their foundation and institute in 2011 .
One of the organizations that Mr. Soros funds , and which fueled the demonstrations in Ferguson , is the Gamaliel Foundation , a network of grass-roots , interreligious and interracial organizations . Mr. Obama started his career as a community organizer at a Gamaliel affiliate in Chicago .
The Rev . Traci Blackmon of Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant , Missouri , which is part of the Gamaliel network , said in one of the group ’ s webinars that clergy involved with Gamaliel must be “ protectors of the narrative ” of what happened in Ferguson .
The Gamaliel affiliate in St. Louis — Metropolitan Congregations United — organized the “ Weekend of Resistance ” in October , in which clergy members from around the nation were called to come to Ferguson to protest .
Representatives of Sojourners , a national evangelical Christian organization committed “ to faith in action for social justice , ” attended the weekend . The group received $ 150,000 from Mr. Soros in 2011 .
Clergy representatives from the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference , where the Rev . Jeremiah Wright serves as a trustee , also showed up . Mr. Wright was Mr. Obama ’ s pastor in Chicago before some of his racially charged sermons , including the phrase “ God damn America , ” forced Mr. Obama to distance himself . SDPC received $ 250,000 from Mr. Soros in 2011 .
During Gamaliel ’ s weekend protest event , Sunday was deemed “ Hands Up Sabbath , ” where clergy were asked to speak out about racial issues , using packets and talking points prepared for them by another religion-based community organizing group , PICO .
PICO is also supported by the Open Society Foundations , according to its website .
The weekend concluded Monday , when clergy members were asked to lead in acts of civil disobedience , prompting many of them to go to jail in the hopes of gaining media attention .
It worked , as imagery of clergy members down on their hands and knees in front of police dominated the mainstream news cycle that day — two months after Brown ’ s shooting .
“ After the initial shooting , we were all hit in the face with how blatant racism really is , ” said the Rev . Susan Sneed , a Gamaliel organizer who helped stage the October weekend event . “ We began quickly hearing from our other affiliates offering support . ”
At the end of August , Gamaliel had a large organizational meeting to discuss its Ferguson strategy , Ms. Sneed said .
It had its affiliates in New York and California handling the St. Louis Twitter feed and Facebook page , helped in correcting any inaccurate stories in the press and promoted their events , she said .
“ When we started marching down the street , saying , ‘ hands up , don ’ t shoot , ’ those images reached all over the world , ” said Ms. Sneed , referring to the moment she realized Ferguson was going to become a movement . “ The Twitter images , Facebook posts of burning buildings — it ’ s everywhere , and the imagery is powerful . And the youth — the youth is so engaged . They ’ ve found a voice in Ferguson . ”
Larry Fellows III , 29 , a Missouri native , did find his voice in the chaos of Ferguson with the help of outside assistance backed by Mr. Soros .
Mr. Fellows is co-founder of the Millennial Activists United , a key source of video and stories developed in Ferguson by youth activists used to inspire other groups nationally .
Mr. Fellows explained how he started his organization in an interview with the American Civil Liberties Union ( another Soros-backed entity that sent national representatives to Missouri ) in November .
“ Initially , it would just be that we would show up for protests , and the next day we ’ d clean up the streets .

No, it’s not victim Michael Brown or Officer Darren Wilson. It’s not even the Rev. Al Sharpton, despite his ubiquitous campaign on TV and the streets.

Rather, it’s liberal billionaire George Soros, who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts American politics and policy, not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org.

Mr. Soros spurred the Ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by The Washington Times.

In all, Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson, according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations.

The financial tether from Mr. Soros to the activist groups gave rise to a combustible protest movement that transformed a one-day criminal event in Missouri into a 24-hour-a-day national cause celebre.

“Our DNA includes a belief that having people participate in government is indispensable to living in a more just, inclusive, democratic society,” said Kenneth Zimmerman, director of Mr. Soros‘ Open Society Foundations’ U.S. programs, in an interview with The Washington Times. “Helping groups combine policy, research [and] data collection with community organizing feels very much the way our society becomes more accountable.”

No strings attached

Mr. Zimmerman said OSF has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early ‘90s, and that, although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of Mr. Soros‘ grants, they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of Open Society.

“The incidents, whether in Staten Island, Cleveland or Ferguson, were spontaneous protests — we don’t have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say,” Mr. Zimmerman said. “But these circumstances focused people’s attention — and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like Ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation.”

Soros-sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in Ferguson, building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign.

Other Soros-funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep, and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive.

The plethora of organizations involved not only shared Mr. Soros‘ funding, but they also fed off each other, using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on another’s website, referencing each other’s news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of Facebook “likes” and Twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds.

Buses of activists from the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference in Chicago; from the Drug Policy Alliance, Make the Road New York and Equal Justice USA from New York; from Sojourners, the Advancement Project and Center for Community Change in Washington; and networks from the Gamaliel Foundation — all funded in part by Mr. Soros — descended on Ferguson starting in August and later organized protests and gatherings in the city until late last month.

Broaden issue focus

All were aimed at keeping the media’s attention on the city and to widen the scope of the incident to focus on interrelated causes — not just the overpolicing and racial discrimination narratives that were highlighted by the news media in August.

“I went to Ferguson in a quest to be in solidarity and stand with the young organizers and affirm their leadership,” said Kassandra Frederique, policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance, which was founded by Mr. Soros, and which receives $4 million annually from his foundation. She traveled to Ferguson in October.

“We recognized this movement is similar to the work we’re doing at DPA,” said Ms. Frederique. “The war on drugs has always been to operationalize, institutionalize and criminalize people of color. Protecting personal sovereignty is a cornerstone of the work we do and what this movement is all about.”

Ms. Frederique works with Opal Tometi, co-creator of #BlackLivesMatter — a hashtag that was developed after the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida — and helped promote it on DPA’s news feeds. Ms. Tometi runs the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, a group to which Mr. Soros gave $100,000 in 2011, according to the most recent of his foundation’s tax filings.

“I think #BlackLivesMatter’s success is because of organizing. This was created after Trayvon Martin, and there has been sustained organizing and conversations about police violence since then,” said Ms. Frederique. “Its explosion into the mainstream recently is because it connects all the dots at a time when everyone was lost for words. ‘Black Lives Matter’ is liberating, unapologetic and leaves no room for confusion.”

#BlackLivesMatter

With the backing of national civil rights organizations and Mr. Soros‘ funding, “Black Lives Matter” grew from a hashtag into a social media phenomenon, including a #BlackLivesMatter bus tour and march in September.

“More than 500 of us have traveled from Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Nashville, Portland, Tucson, Washington, D.C., Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and other cities to support the people of Ferguson and help turn a local moment into a national movement,” wrote Akiba Solomon, a journalist at Colorlines, describing the event.

Colorlines is an online news site that focuses on race issues and is published by Race Forward, a group that received $200,000 from Mr. Soros’s foundation in 2011. Colorlines has published tirelessly on the activities in Ferguson and heavily promoted the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag and activities.

At the end of the #BlackLivesMatter march, organizers met with civil rights groups like the Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment to strategize their operations moving forward, Ms. Solomon wrote. OBS and MORE are also funded by Mr. Soros.

Mr. Soros gave $5.4 million to Ferguson and Staten Island grass-roots efforts last year to help “further police reform, accountability and public transparency,” the Open Society Foundations said in a blog post in December. About half of those funds were earmarked to Ferguson, with the money primarily going to OBS and MORE, the foundation said.

OBS and MORE, along with the Dream Defenders, established the “Hands Up Coalition” — another so-called “grass-roots” organization in Missouri, whose name was based on now-known-to-be-false claims that Brown had his hands up before being shot. The Defenders were built to rally support and awareness for the Trayvon Martin case and were funded by the Tides Foundation, another recipient of Soros cash.

Hands Up Coalition has made it its mission to recruit and organize youth nationwide to start local events in their communities — trying to take Ferguson nationwide.

Years and weekends of ‘resistance’

Hands Up Coalition has dubbed 2015 as “The Year of Resistance,” and its outreach program strongly resembles how President Obama’s political action committee — Organizing for Action — rallies youth for its causes, complete with a similarly designed Web page and call to action.

Mr. Soros, who made his fortune betting against the British pound during the currency crisis in the early ‘90s, is a well-known supporter of progressive-liberal causes and is a political donor to Mr. Obama’s campaigns. He committed $1 million to Mr. Obama’s super PAC in 2012.

Mr. Soros‘ two largest foundations manage almost $3 billion in assets per year, according to their most recent respective tax returns. The Foundation to Promote Open Society managed $2.2 billion in assets in 2011, and his Open Society Institute managed $685.9 million in 2012.

In comparison, David and Charles Koch, the billionaire brothers whom liberals often call a threat to democracy — and worse — for their conservative influence, had $308 million tied up in their foundation and institute in 2011.

One of the organizations that Mr. Soros funds, and which fueled the demonstrations in Ferguson, is the Gamaliel Foundation, a network of grass-roots, interreligious and interracial organizations. Mr. Obama started his career as a community organizer at a Gamaliel affiliate in Chicago.

The Rev. Traci Blackmon of Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Missouri, which is part of the Gamaliel network, said in one of the group’s webinars that clergy involved with Gamaliel must be “protectors of the narrative” of what happened in Ferguson.

The Gamaliel affiliate in St. Louis — Metropolitan Congregations United — organized the “Weekend of Resistance” in October, in which clergy members from around the nation were called to come to Ferguson to protest.

Clergy involvement

Representatives of Sojourners, a national evangelical Christian organization committed “to faith in action for social justice,” attended the weekend. The group received $150,000 from Mr. Soros in 2011.

Clergy representatives from the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference, where the Rev. Jeremiah Wright serves as a trustee, also showed up. Mr. Wright was Mr. Obama’s pastor in Chicago before some of his racially charged sermons, including the phrase “God damn America,” forced Mr. Obama to distance himself. SDPC received $250,000 from Mr. Soros in 2011.

During Gamaliel’s weekend protest event, Sunday was deemed “Hands Up Sabbath,” where clergy were asked to speak out about racial issues, using packets and talking points prepared for them by another religion-based community organizing group, PICO.

PICO is also supported by the Open Society Foundations, according to its website.

The weekend concluded Monday, when clergy members were asked to lead in acts of civil disobedience, prompting many of them to go to jail in the hopes of gaining media attention.

It worked, as imagery of clergy members down on their hands and knees in front of police dominated the mainstream news cycle that day — two months after Brown’s shooting.

“After the initial shooting, we were all hit in the face with how blatant racism really is,” said the Rev. Susan Sneed, a Gamaliel organizer who helped stage the October weekend event. “We began quickly hearing from our other affiliates offering support.”

At the end of August, Gamaliel had a large organizational meeting to discuss its Ferguson strategy, Ms. Sneed said.

It had its affiliates in New York and California handling the St. Louis Twitter feed and Facebook page, helped in correcting any inaccurate stories in the press and promoted their events, she said.

“When we started marching down the street, saying, ‘hands up, don’t shoot,’ those images reached all over the world,” said Ms. Sneed, referring to the moment she realized Ferguson was going to become a movement. “The Twitter images, Facebook posts of burning buildings — it’s everywhere, and the imagery is powerful. And the youth — the youth is so engaged. They’ve found a voice in Ferguson.”

National activists descend

Larry Fellows III, 29, a Missouri native, did find his voice in the chaos of Ferguson with the help of outside assistance backed by Mr. Soros.

Mr. Fellows is co-founder of the Millennial Activists United, a key source of video and stories developed in Ferguson by youth activists used to inspire other groups nationally.

Mr. Fellows explained how he started his organization in an interview with the American Civil Liberties Union (another Soros-backed entity that sent national representatives to Missouri) in November.

“Initially, it would just be that we would show up for protests, and the next day we’d clean up the streets. A lot of the same people were out at the protests and going out to lunch and talking about what was happening. That became a cycle until a lot of us figured out we needed to have a strategy,” Mr. Fellows explained to the ACLU, which posted the interview in its blog.

“Then a lot of organizers from across the country started to come in to help us do the planning and do the strategizing. That helped us start doing it on our own and planning out actions and what our narratives were going to be,” he said.

MAU has listed on its website that it has partnered with Gamaliel network churches. They’ve also received training on civil disobedience from the Advancement Project — which was given a $500,000 grant from Mr. Soros in 2013 “to build a fair and just, multi-racial democracy in America through litigation, community organizing support, public policy reform, and strategic communications,” according to the Foundation’s website.

The Advancement Project, based in Washington, also arranged the meeting between community organizers in Ferguson and Mr. Obama last month to brief him on the situation in Ferguson and to set up a task force that examines trust between police and minority communities.

In addition, the Advancement Project has also dedicated some of its staff to lead organizations in Ferguson, like the Don’t Shoot Coalition, another grass-roots group that preaches the same message, links to the same Facebook posts and “likes” the same articles as DPA, ACLU, Hands Up Coalition, OBS, MORE and others.

As he reaches for the remote , disaster strikes . He knocks over the bowl , and his Cheetos spill on the floor . The man throws his head back in operatic despair and raises his hands to heaven as two words appear on the screen :
Yep , thanks President Obama . You ran for office vowing to unite us , but instead you gave us race-baiting , race riots and Black Lives Matter . You turned the promise of a post-racial era into one of the most racial periods in American history .
What 's going to happen to those demons , though , once Obama leaves office ? Will racial tensions ease once his term ends ? Or is racial strife the new normal ?
A recent CNN and Kaiser Family Foundation poll could point to an answer . The survey asked people from various ethnic groups about their impression of race relations , and their answers do n't offer much in the way of hope or change .
Most Americans told the CNN/KFF poll that racial strife is getting worse . When asked whether tensions between racial and ethnic groups have increased during the past decade , 64 % said yes , as did a majority of whites ( 67 % ) , blacks ( 65 % ) and Latinos ( 55 % ) .
All those numbers are up significantly from April 2001 , when only 29 % of Americans said tensions had worsened over the previous 10 years . They 're also significantly higher than in the wake of the Million Man March in 1995 , when 47 % thought tensions had increased .
But when some of this year 's respondents and other observers were asked in follow-up interviews about the source of this surge in racial tension , their answers were as splintered as the nation 's electorate .
Consider the question of whether racial strife is now the norm .
`` I do n't see that stopping when Obama is no longer president , '' says Steve Sailer , who writes for Unz Review and Taki 's Magazine , both started by alumni of The American Conservative . `` I can imagine a white president like Hillary [ Clinton ] upping the ante because she does n't have the benefit of being black . ''
Sailer says Clinton will need to talk more about racial grievances to attract minority voters because she ca n't count on the strong black support that Obama enjoyed .
Democrats , he says , have decided to build a coalition of `` fringe '' groups by demonizing people who `` have rightful reasons for representing the core of Middle America . ''
That decision , however , is sparking a white backlash , Sailer warns . More whites are starting to see the need to unite like other ethnic groups .
`` It 's become more acceptable for people to insult whites , especially white men , '' he says . `` You 're seeing more and more whites starting to develop a certain amount of white identity . ''
Persistent racial tension , though , may actually be good for America , another writer suggests .
`` We are confronting issues instead of walking around in a kind of phony peace , '' Bailey says . `` That 's not a bad thing . ''
Then there is the question of blame . How much responsibility for increased racial tension rests with Obama ? Could he have done anything at the beginning of his first term to reduce them ? The answers are also varied .
For starters , a previous poll found that in 2011 -- well into Obama 's first term -- only 28 % of Americans felt that racism was a big problem , compared with 49 % in the 2015 CNN/KFF poll .
Also , social media , online comments and access to smartphone cameras have grown tremendously since Obama was first elected .
Accusations that police use excessive force against African-Americans , for example , now can get far more attention -- far more quickly -- than ever .
Eduardo Bonilla-Silva , a professor of sociology at Duke University , calls it part of the `` new racism . ''
Communities of color across the country can more easily connect , according to Bonilla-Silva , and people are picking up on patterns that scholars have long discussed .
`` People are doing Sociology 101 . They can connect Walter Scott , the assassinations of black folks in a church , the slamming of a girl in a school , '' he says . `` And then it 's across the nation . People are then connecting the dots and saying , 'No more . ' ``
Obama ran as someone who could transcend the nation 's racial divisions , many people interviewed for this story said . He declared during his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention , `` There is not a liberal America and a conservative America . There is a United States of America . ''
And during his 2008 speech on race in Philadelphia , he said , `` Working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds , and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union . ''
When , though , was the last time you heard someone seriously talk about the onset of a `` post-racial America '' ? For some people , revisiting that term is like unearthing love letters they wrote as a teenager : embarrassing .
The letdown over the post-racial promise many hoped Obama 's election would bring was memorably captured in an open letter Beth Reinhard wrote for the National Journal in 2013 under the headline , `` Barack Obama : A Divider , not a Uniter . '' She wrote :
We thought you were different , but you turned out to be like all the others . You promised hope and change ... but the red states and blue states are farther apart than ever . ... How could you

One poll respondent did n't have his heart broken because he never believed in Obama in the first place .
Robert Randall , who lives in Hillsborough , North Carolina , said in the CNN/KFF poll that racial tension had increased during the past decade . When asked why , he blamed it on Obama .
Randall , 68 , ticked off the reasons : Obama did nothing when Black Panther Party members intimidated voters at a polling station during the 2008 election ; he sent an entourage to the funeral of Michael Brown -- a black man whose death in Ferguson , Missouri , sparked protests in 2014 -- but sent no one to the funeral of a U.S. Army recruiter shot to death in Arkansas five years earlier ; and he took the side of a black Ivy League professor , Henry Louis Gates , who was arrested in his home by a white police office , before getting the facts .
`` He shows sympathy toward blacks , '' Randall , who is white , says of Obama . `` He 's done that in several instances . He whines about you do n't know what it 's like to be black . ''
Randall says the character of Americans has eroded under Obama . He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up . Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill . But under Obama , he says , the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers .
`` When you introduce socialism in this country , it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers , '' he says .
New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who 's running for the GOP presidential nomination , also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide .
`` I do n't think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we 're better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president , '' Christie told CNN 's Jake Tapper on `` The Lead . '' `` In fact , I think he 's made it worse . ''
Christie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together , something Obama campaigned on in 2008 .
`` We all had great hope , all of us , even those who did n't vote for him -- and I did n't -- in 2008 , had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country . ''
A New York scholar and activist , though , says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he 's been the primary target .
Mark Naison , a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University , says some whites are angry because their portion of the country 's population is shrinking . As the country gets browner , they get angrier .
`` They think this is their country , and they 're really special , '' Naison says . `` These tensions are going to get worse . We 're stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone 's culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership . ''
Naison says he 's not surprised by the surge in racial tension . He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008 .
`` I 'm never surprised at the depth of racism in America , '' he says . `` The depths of it are limitless . There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone . ''
Obama , though , could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites , Naison says .
He made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress . It was at the height of the Great Recession , and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program , Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs .
`` That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him , '' Naison says . `` He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act . ''
Bailey , the author , says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal .
`` If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on , I think he should start , not in places like Ferguson , but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents , '' Bailey says . `` And I do n't mean go there and lecture to them , but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names . They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard . ''
Still , there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey .
One respondent who lives in Vermont , one of the whitest states in the nation , agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade . Sean , who preferred to be identified only by his first name , blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama .
Sean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years . He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white . Because of his Anglo appearance , he says , he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites .
`` I do n't actually experience racial discrimination , '' Sean says . `` I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [ of color ] do n't experience . I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it 's cold , but I have a [ black ] friend who has . ''
Empathy , though , will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office , says Paul Street , an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office , including `` They Rule : The 1 % v . Democracy . ''
`` A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations , '' he says . `` We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing . These are underlying structural problems . ''
While some complain Obama has n't reached out enough to whites , others say he has n't done much for blacks either .
`` Because of his skin color , '' Street says , `` he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people . ''
If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency , Street says the `` hate machine '' likely will switch targets .
`` The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender , '' he says .
And if someone else wins in 2016 , Fordham 's Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama 's presidency may even get worse .
`` If you think there 's racial tension now , '' he says , `` wait until Donald Trump is elected . ''","(CNN) The scene opens with a pudgy white man plopped on a couch, watching TV with a bowl of Cheetos on the coffee table.

As he reaches for the remote, disaster strikes. He knocks over the bowl, and his Cheetos spill on the floor. The man throws his head back in operatic despair and raises his hands to heaven as two words appear on the screen:

""Thanks Obama.""

Yep, thanks President Obama. You ran for office vowing to unite us, but instead you gave us race-baiting, race riots and Black Lives Matter. You turned the promise of a post-racial era into one of the most racial periods in American history.

At least, that's the standard Obama critique that the viral Cheetos GIF mocks with its sarcastic caption.

Stumbling toward a multiracial future

Mark Naison, a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University, says some whites are angry because their portion of the country's population is shrinking. As the country gets browner, they get angrier.

""They think this is their country, and they're really special,"" Naison says. ""These tensions are going to get worse. We're stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone's culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership.""

Naison says he's not surprised by the surge in racial tension. He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008.

""I'm never surprised at the depth of racism in America,"" he says. ""The depths of it are limitless. There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone.""

What should Obama have done?

Obama, though, could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites, Naison says.

He made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress. It was at the height of the Great Recession, and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program, Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs.

""That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him,"" Naison says. ""He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act.""

Bailey, the author, says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal.

""If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on, I think he should start, not in places like Ferguson, but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents,"" Bailey says. ""And I don't mean go there and lecture to them, but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names. They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard.""

Still, there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey.

One respondent who lives in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation, agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade. Sean, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama.

Sean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years. He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white. Because of his Anglo appearance, he says, he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites.

""I don't actually experience racial discrimination,"" Sean says. ""I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [of color] don't experience. I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it's cold, but I have a [black] friend who has.""

Empathy, though, will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office, says Paul Street, an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office, including ""They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy.""

""A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations,"" he says. ""We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing. These are underlying structural problems.""

While some complain Obama hasn't reached out enough to whites, others say he hasn't done much for blacks either.

""Because of his skin color,"" Street says, ""he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people.""

Street expects no reprieve when Obama leaves office.

If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Street says the ""hate machine"" likely will switch targets.

""The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender,"" he says.

And if someone else wins in 2016, Fordham's Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama's presidency may even get worse.

""If you think there's racial tension now,"" he says, ""wait until Donald Trump is elected.""",www.cnn.com,left,r3zsc1en8WtEm5iS

On marriage, Obama said he believes that the unions performed in one state should apply in another and should make those couples eligible for all the federal benefits afforded to married couples. “It’s my personal belief — and I’m speaking now as a president [not] as a lawyer — if you’re married in Massachusetts and you move someplace else, you’re still married,” he said at a news conference with Senegalese President Macky Sall.

“But again, I’m speaking as a president and not as a lawyer,” he cautioned, saying that lawyers in his administration are working out the details of what Wednesday’s Supreme Court rulings will mean.

That work is being done by the executive branch in a “systematic and prompt way,” he said. “It’s important that people who deserve these benefits, that they’re getting them quickly.”

The Supreme Court’s decision Wednesday overturning a key piece of the Defense of Marriage Act was “not simply a victory for the LGBT community, I think it was a victory for American democracy,” the president said, following up on a written statement he made from aboard Air Force One.

Rickard that even egregious police conduct is not “ excessive force ” in violation of the Constitution . Police officers in West Memphis , Arkansas , pulled over a white Honda Accord because the car had only one operating headlight . Rather than get out of the car , as police requested , the driver sped away . The police took chase for more than five minutes , with the cars reaching speeds of over 100 miles per hour .

Nancy Gertner is a retired federal judge and a professor at Harvard Law School .","For example, two months before the Brown shooting, the US Supreme Court ruled in Plumhoff v. Rickard that even egregious police conduct is not “excessive force” in violation of the Constitution. Police officers in West Memphis, Arkansas, pulled over a white Honda Accord because the car had only one operating headlight. Rather than get out of the car, as police requested, the driver sped away. The police took chase for more than five minutes, with the cars reaching speeds of over 100 miles per hour. Eventually, officers fired 15 shots into the car, killing both the driver and a passenger. No weapons were found.

Although many are saying that the decision may have to do with race, it is more likely that Wilson is not facing charges because courts have decimated the law that holds officers accountable for excessive force, rulings that make incidents similar to Ferguson all the more likely.

Instead, the court said it “stands to reason that, if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended.”

The touchstone for evaluating police conduct was its “reasonableness,” a balance between a defendant’s rights and public safety. But “reasonableness” is notoriously imprecise. And courts can tip the balance: In Plumhoff, the Supreme Court gave special deference to the officer’s version of what happened, because officers make split second judgments, under tense circumstances. The message: Shoot first, think later, and you can count on being exonerated.

2015 has been relatively safe for police officers

As the first black president , Obama is seen as a product of the civil rights movement
Heralding the long fight toward racial equality that many say has n't ended , President Barack Obama commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. 's `` I Have a Dream '' speech Wednesday on the same steps the civil rights leader spoke from half a century ago .
`` His words belong to the ages , possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time , '' Obama told a diverse crowd that gathered under gray skies and intermittent drizzle to attend the hours-long ceremony .
King , Obama said , `` gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions , '' hailing leaders who braved intimidation and violence in their fight for equal rights .
On that August day in 1963 , when King and his fellow marchers attended what he labeled `` the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation , '' few in that crowd could have imagined that half a century later , an African-American president of the United States would mark the occasion with a speech in the same location .
And during his remarks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial , Obama cast his own election to the Oval Office as a consequence of persistence and courage from leaders such as King .
`` Because they kept marching , America changed , '' Obama said . `` Because they marched , city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and , yes , eventually , the White House changed . ''

King's words ""belong to the ages,"" Obama says

As the first black president, Obama is seen as a product of the civil rights movement

Heralding the long fight toward racial equality that many say hasn't ended, President Barack Obama commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech Wednesday on the same steps the civil rights leader spoke from half a century ago.

""His words belong to the ages, possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time,"" Obama told a diverse crowd that gathered under gray skies and intermittent drizzle to attend the hours-long ceremony.

King, Obama said, ""gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions,"" hailing leaders who braved intimidation and violence in their fight for equal rights.

On that August day in 1963, when King and his fellow marchers attended what he labeled ""the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation,"" few in that crowd could have imagined that half a century later, an African-American president of the United States would mark the occasion with a speech in the same location.

And during his remarks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Obama cast his own election to the Oval Office as a consequence of persistence and courage from leaders such as King.

""Because they kept marching, America changed,"" Obama said. ""Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and, yes, eventually, the White House changed.""

While other, negative changes have forestalled the push toward racial harmony, Obama stressed Wednesday that the work of civil rights leaders had permanently changed the discourse between races in America.

""To dismiss the magnitude of this process, to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed, that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years,"" Obama said.

Adopting words from another of King's speeches, Obama declared that ""the arc of the moral universe may bend toward justice, but it doesn't bend on its own.""

Leaders speaking at Wednesday's anniversary event, including Obama, stressed that income disparity, high unemployment and a shrinking middle class have slashed hopes for attaining equality for millions of Americans, though the president said those facts couldn't erase the forward march of the civil rights movement.

""To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency,"" he said, adding, ""We will suffer the occasional setback, but we will win these fights. This country has changed too much.""

In an interview after the speech, he said he wished his policies had done more to improve the gap between those who have wealth and those who do not.

""It certainly weighs on me,"" he told PBS. ""In my first term, essentially, my job was to make sure, as you said, that the economy didn't just completely collapse.""

In describing a “ nightmare scenario ” in the complaint filed in Illinois state court , the ACLU and other groups representing domestic violence survivors , sex workers , and immigrants said they were suing to put an end to Clearview ’ s “ unlawful surreptitious capture and storage of millions of Illinoisans ’ sensitive biometric identifiers. ” The lawsuit alleges that the facial recognition startup violated the state ’ s Biometric Information Privacy Act ( BIPA ) , a 2008 law that prevents companies from collecting or storing fingerprints or scans of citizen ’ s faces without their consent .
While the BIPA allows Illinois residents to sue companies for up to $ 5,000 for each violation , Nate Freed Wessler , an ACLU staff attorney , told ███ that the plaintiffs were not seeking money .
“ We ’ re not seeking monetary damages , only injunctive relief , he said . “ We want to see Clearview delete the faceprints it illegally captured and also stop capturing them in the future . ”
Since a story in the New York Times in January revealed it to the public , Clearview AI has come under scrutiny from lawmakers , news organizations , and civil liberties groups like the ACLU , which has called the company ’ s business “ privacy-destroying face surveillance. ” In February , a ███ investigation found that Clearview had provided its facial recognition software to more than 2,200 federal agencies , police departments , and private companies , despite its CEO ’ s claim that the tool was “ strictly for law enforcement . ”
In recent months , the company has been hit with a slew of lawsuits in New York , California , Virginia , and Vermont . In federal court in Illinois , a separate lawsuit seeking class action status is currently asking that a judge issue a temporary injunction against Clearview AI to prevent it from using the biometric information of current and past Illinois residents until the case reaches a conclusion .
In response to the proposed temporary injunction , Clearview AI recently said it would restrict its use of data from Illinois citizens and would cease relationships with all private companies .
Responding to Thursday ’ s ACLU lawsuit , Clearview lawyer Tor Ekeland likened Clearview AI to “ a search engine that uses only publicly available images on the internet . '' ( In past interviews , Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That has conceded that even if once-public photos are taken down or made private , they still remain in the company ’ s databases . )

“ Clearview is as free as it wants to look at public photos , ” he said . “ What they can ’ t do surreptitiously and without consent is generate people ’ s faceprints . That is conduct and not speech , and that conduct is not protected by the First Amendment . ”
In February , a ███ investigation found that law enforcement agencies that target undocumented people , including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection , had used Clearview to run thousands of searches .

(CNN) -- Before the Brooklyn Nets and Cleveland Cavaliers faced off on the basketball court Monday night, several players were already scoring points with protesters outside the arena.

As they warmed up for the game, Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were among the players wearing T-shirts that said ""I can't breathe"" -- Eric Garner's last words, which have become a rallying cry for protesters after last week's grand jury decision not to indict an officer in his death.

Outside the Barclays Center, a large crowd of demonstrators swarmed the streets, chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" and ""black lives matter.""

The crowd erupted in cheers after an organizer told them about the players' T-shirts.

The NBA players' show of support for protesters comes a week after five players from the St. Louis Rams walked onto the field and raised their palms in the air, demonstrating the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that protesters have been using in demonstrations over the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

Activists have been threatening to disrupt the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are visiting New York and attending the Nets-Cavaliers game.

""They need to know this is what America is. ... America is a system where those who benefit from others neglect to see the underclass, the people who are underprivileged, and that's why we're out here,"" said Jibri Nuriddin, a protester from New York.

Demonstrations, he said, aren't going to stop.

""We're going to keep chanting and keep marching,"" he told CNN from outside the arena. ""Everyone's going to know that this is an issue. We're not going to let this issue die.""

Amanda Jack, a public defender in New York, said she joined protests after seeing many of her clients suffer at the hands of what she called a racist system.

""There can't be any more business as usual when this kind of injustice continues. I think this (basketball game) is one of the examples of consumerism and excess, so it's time. Shut it down,"" she said. ""We've got to address our broken justice system.""

New York mayor praises police

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio praised police officers' handling of the protests.

""They've respected people's right under the First Amendment to express their views. They've kept the peace. They've kept order,"" he told reporters Monday. ""We had only a handful arrests the last two days, which is extraordinarily impressive given all of the activity that's happening.""

De Blasio is white. His son is biracial.

""This is a national reality. It's not just a New York reality,"" de Blasio said. ""And that, unfortunately, is further evidence of how much more we all have to learn from each other. ... The goal is to get to a day when no parent feels they have to have that conversation.""

Protesters flood California streets

A day after a heated standoff on a freeway between protesters in Oakland, California, and the California Highway Patrol, demonstrators in the area took to the streets again Monday.

CNN affiliate KTVU showed throngs of protesters in the streets in Berkeley, California.

It was a peaceful scene, KTVU reported. But violence erupted in earlier Berkeley protests Monday.

Some protesters looted and vandalized businesses, police spokeswoman Jennifer Coats said.

One protester was struck in the head with a hammer when he tried to keep fellow protesters from damaging and looting a Radio Shack, she said. The man was hospitalized, but his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

Two Berkeley officers also suffered minor injuries. Coats said five people were arrested, but she did not know the charges.

On Sunday night, demonstrators flooded a highway in Oakland, California. Some threw explosives, bottles and rocks at officers, authorities said. Officers responded by deploying gas and arresting eight protesters. In the end, two officers suffered minor injuries.

Police said five patrol cars were damaged.

Not everyone is on their side

In Imperial, Missouri, demonstrators staged a different kind of protest Sunday.

They burned St. Louis Rams football jerseys after the protest by players last week, CNN affiliate KSDK reported.

""Why would you do something like that? It's utterly ridiculous,"" said Larry Magee. ""I think the Rams ought to pack their bags, and I'll give them a plane ticket back to L.A.""

Daughter: 'This is not a black-and-white issue'

Garner's daughter Erica said she was deeply moved by the diversity of protesters who have demonstrated across the country.

""This is not a black-and-white issue. This is a national crisis,"" Erica Garner said.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has announced a federal civil rights investigation into Garner's death.

Johnson,"On this 50th anniversary of the March on Washington , the nation ’ s first black president will address the country from the very spot where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his moving “ I Have a Dream ” speech – a rousing petition for an end to racial discrimination . The visual of President Obama on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial will be a powerful commentary on America ’ s progress , and will have special meaning for African-Americans .
The election of a black man to the presidency has forever changed the outlook of African-Americans , but it has not changed our circumstances . Mr. Obama 's election was anticipated as the culmination of the two complementary , but distinct , events of August 28 , 1963 – the march and the speech . These are often couched as synonymous when , actually , one was an activist demand for equal rights and the other an emotional plea for equality . In fact , President Obama is the embodiment of the King ’ s inspiring oration , but not the personification of the march ’ s black activism .
There is no question that African-Americans were , and remain , incredibly proud that the nation entrusted its highest office to a black man . Images from the night of the 2008 presidential election reflect the deep , emotional significance of that event . Many remarked that the election served as proof that the American dream was finally tangible , and that it would no longer be dishonest to tell their children they could achieve anything .
His election is , and will forever be , Obama ’ s most significant contribution to African-Americans . Much as King ’ s speech provided a moment and a figure that symbolized a people ’ s heartfelt desire for equality , Obama ’ s election and two-term presidency updated the dream and positively changed the realm of the possible for African-Americans . Given the nation ’ s history , America is a renewed , if not new , place for many African-Americans now that a black man sits in the White House . This is not trivial .
Of course , this pride is not limited to one racial demographic . All Americans should be proud that our history has been a steady march toward the inclusiveness that has always been a part of the American idea , if not always evident in practice . No one group owns this achievement , but it ’ s undeniable that African-Americans rightly have an outsized connection to it .
But just as inspiration has its place , so does activism . There was a sense among African-Americans that once Obama assumed the presidency , he would begin to address the long-ignored ills that have plagued many black communities for decades . Instead , he made very clear early on that his job is to help all Americans by strengthening the middle class and speeding the economic recovery through fair-share , progressive tax and other policies .
For example , when criticized about not doing enough to help African-American businesses , he ’ s replied , “ My general view has been consistent throughout , which is that I want all businesses to succeed . I want all Americans to have opportunity . I ’ m not the president of black America . I ’ m the president of the United States of America. ” And this is exactly correct . Anyone expecting Obama to make the plight of African-Americans the focus of his presidency does not fully appreciate the enormity of the office and issues it must address .
The result is that his election and policies have not significantly affected the conditions in black America as advocated for at the March in 1963 . The full name of that political demonstration is instructive : The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . This assembly of Americans of all races , but primarily blacks , was an expression of solidarity for very specific requests of the federal government . The agenda consisted of petitions for fair employment practices , sufficient wages , access to suitable and integrated schools , and nondiscriminatory housing .
Yet , even as the job market has recovered under Obama , black unemployment remains in a perpetual state of recession-level percentages , and consistently twice the national average . African-American wage disparity as compared to the national average remains an issue today just as it always has . An Economic Policy Institute report , “ The Unfinished March , ” shows that concentrated , impoverished housing and school segregation today remain very close to the levels they did in 1963 . African-American imprisonment rates , particularly for young men , remain appalling .
The president has simply aligned his approach with the adage , “ a rising tide lifts all boats. ” In other words , by simply helping all Americans , the theory goes , it is inevitable that African-Americans will also benefit . But what the March on Washington , and many members of the black community , argued is that the primary issue was about disparities – that rising tides do not close those gaps . Thus , from a practical perspective , not much has changed about the African-American experience under a black president .
To be sure , there have been some steps the president has taken to specifically help African-Americans . His executive order awarding grants to historically black colleges and universities was a welcome development , though the recent change in some federal loan requirements means fewer students will be there to take advantage . Additionally , the announcement that the Department of Justice would undertake sentencing reform was welcome news to exasperated African-Americans – even if many would have preferred the Obama administration to have tackled the issue much earlier .
For all the meaning that will be on display when President Obama takes the stage to commemorate a seminal moment in American history , it will be a largely symbolic moment that does not bring about the change the March on Washington demanded . This may have to be enough . After all , his contribution as role model has forever changed the nation .

On November 17 , 1957 , Martin Luther King , Jr. preached a sermon called `` Love Your Enemies '' at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery , Alabama . `` Love has within it a redemptive power . And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals . That 's why Jesus says , 'Love your enemies . ' Because if you hate your enemies , you have no way to redeem and to transform your enemies . But if you love your enemies , you will discover that at the very root of love is the power of redemption , '' King preached .
His message was more than a spirited sermon . It was a belief that defined his leadership and became the crux of the civil rights movement .
Rev . Jesse Douglas , a civil rights leader , and King 's friend said , `` This person who was from the American Nazi Party called his [ MLK 's ] name . And when he turned around , he punched him in the face . The guys that were there – they were going to do him in . And Dr. King said , 'No , brethren , wait a minute , wait , wait – do n't harm him . He is the victim of the indoctrination of hate . ' ''
At the time , a reporter asked if King would press charges against the attacker .
`` He felt that hate can not overpower hate . That only love can . If you 're going to fight hate with hate , you 're fighting a losing battle , '' Douglas said .
Dr. King 's example inspired peaceful protests across the country . It also exposed decades of social injustice , bringing blacks and whites together for a common cause .
`` When America began to see racism , America , good-hearted people , began to say 'no , I do n't think so . This is not right . This is not good , ' '' said Alveda King , Martin Luther King 's niece .
`` I just could n't understand why this was happening to the African American community , '' said Peggy Wallace Kennedy .
Peggy had a unique view of racial prejudice . Her father was George Wallace – the man who won his bid for governor of Alabama on one promise : `` I say , 'Segregation now . Segregation tomorrow . Segregation forever . ' ''
She was 12 when her father , flanked by state troopers , blocked Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama . It was in direct defiance of President John F. Kennedy 's executive order to integrate schools and colleges .
`` I loved my daddy more than anything in the world , '' Peggy said . `` I did not want him to stand in the schoolhouse door , but he did . I just thought it was wrong . I wanted to go up to these people and say , 'You deserve to be here . You should be here . ' But I could n't . ''
The standoff ended without incident when President Kennedy called in the National Guard . but the next time Governor Wallace tried to intervene , it did n't end so peacefully .
On March 7 , 1965 , 600 men and women started out on foot from Selma , Alabama to the state capitol in Montgomery to protest voter discrimination . On the far side of the Edmund Pettis Bridge , they were met and assaulted by state and local police .
The clash , known as Bloody Sunday , left one dead and dozens wounded . Wallace , who had ordered law enforcement to Selma , had to answer for the violence .
`` Now , I 'm against violence , and I 'm just as sorry that anybody got hurt , '' Wallace said after the clash . `` My orders have always been to use a minimum amount of force . ''
`` I would like to think that my father said , 'Do not attack the marchers . ' That 's what I would love to think , '' Peggy said .
Two weeks later , Martin Luther King , Jr. , along with other civil rights leaders and 25,000 protestors , made the 47-mile trek from Selma to Montgomery . The following August , President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into Law .
On April 4 , 1968 , Dr. Martin Luther King was shot to death on a hotel balcony in Memphis , Tennessee .
`` I ca n't stand to talk about it . That 's how hurt I was , '' Rev . Jesse Douglas told us .
`` I remember saying to my dad , ' I just hate white people ; they killed Uncle ML , ' '' Alveda King said . `` He said , 'wait a minute , wait a minute . White people did n't kill your uncle . ' He said , 'white people prayed with us , white people marched with us . White people go to jail with us , white people die with us . The devil killed your uncle . ' And I remember him saying that we have to love , we have to forgive , we have to love , we have to forgive . ''
`` He did n't hate anyone , '' Douglas added . `` He saw this as a part of God 's plan because he knew his life might be snuffed out at any time . And he was ready for that . We were determined to give ourselves to helping to fulfill the dream . ''
Dr. King 's daughter , Bernice , who was only five years old when he was murdered , found herself struggling with anger as she entered her teen years .
`` I remember distinctly in my heart feeling very angry . I was angry at white people because I felt they were responsible , '' Bernice King said . `` I was angry at black people because I felt like we had n't done enough to continue the work . I was angry at God because I felt He could have stopped it . My anger did turn to rage and bitterness and hate . I literally ended up hating all white people especially white men . ''
But as Bernice dealt with her own pain , Dr. King 's message of love and forgiveness would prevail – even in the hearts of those who were once his enemies .
While campaigning for the presidency in May 1972 , George Wallace was shot four times at close range by a volunteer . The wounds left him permanently bound to a wheelchair . But that was n't the only change Peggy saw in her father in the years that followed .
`` He realized , with his suffering and pain , how much suffering and pain he must have caused the African American community . He 'd talk about segregation , and he 'd talk about how wrong he was . He just wanted forgiveness , '' Peggy said .
`` One Sunday , he asked his bodyguards , he said , ' I want you to take me to Dexter Avenue Church ' They took him down there unannounced . And they rolled his wheelchair down that middle aisle , and he sat there and asked that congregation to forgive him . And they did . It showed me what love and forgiveness are about . It filled my heart up . This was a very healing moment for him , '' she said .
Meanwhile , Bernice 's heart was also changing . Ever since her father was killed , her mother , Coretta Scott King , had refused to give in to hatred .
`` The Bible says , 'Do good to them that hate you . Bless them that curse you ' '' Bernice recalled . `` I saw her bless those that cursed her . Do good to those that hate her . And when she would say , ' I do n't hold grudges , ' I watched when people did very painful things to her that she just did n't hold it . She still loved them . It was just a powerful embodiment of Christ 's spirit in our home . ''
However , it was n't until an interview on the James Robison Show in 2000 that Bernice 's healing finally began .
`` In the middle of it , [ Robison ] said , 'Can I give you a hug ? ' Now internally I 'm like 'no ! ' . But my mother taught me better . So , I said 'sure ' and he gave me a hug and – it was one of the most genuine hugs I 've ever received . And that sounds , probably for most people , so simple and trite but it was very powerful because it began my healing process , '' Bernice said .
Then , in 2013 , part of her father 's dream was fulfilled . Bernice King and Peggy Wallace Kennedy stood side-by-side as hundreds of thousands gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King , Jr. 's iconic `` I Have a Dream '' speech .

People know the name of Jesus . They do n't know His spirit . And we must become His spirit . ''","On the 50th anniversary of his assassination, we look back at the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

On November 17, 1957, Martin Luther King, Jr. preached a sermon called ""Love Your Enemies"" at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. ""Love has within it a redemptive power. And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals. That's why Jesus says, 'Love your enemies.' Because if you hate your enemies, you have no way to redeem and to transform your enemies. But if you love your enemies, you will discover that at the very root of love is the power of redemption,"" King preached.

His message was more than a spirited sermon. It was a belief that defined his leadership and became the crux of the civil rights movement.

Rev. Jesse Douglas, a civil rights leader, and King's friend said, ""This person who was from the American Nazi Party called his [MLK's] name. And when he turned around, he punched him in the face. The guys that were there – they were going to do him in. And Dr. King said, 'No, brethren, wait a minute, wait, wait – don't harm him. He is the victim of the indoctrination of hate.'""

At the time, a reporter asked if King would press charges against the attacker.

""No,"" King said. ""I don't plan to.""

Only Love Can Overpower Hate

""He felt that hate cannot overpower hate. That only love can. If you're going to fight hate with hate, you're fighting a losing battle,"" Douglas said.

Dr. King's example inspired peaceful protests across the country. It also exposed decades of social injustice, bringing blacks and whites together for a common cause.

""When America began to see racism, America, good-hearted people, began to say 'no, I don't think so. This is not right. This is not good,'"" said Alveda King, Martin Luther King's niece.

""I just couldn't understand why this was happening to the African American community,"" said Peggy Wallace Kennedy.

Peggy had a unique view of racial prejudice. Her father was George Wallace – the man who won his bid for governor of Alabama on one promise: ""I say, 'Segregation now. Segregation tomorrow. Segregation forever.'""

She was 12 when her father, flanked by state troopers, blocked Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama. It was in direct defiance of President John F. Kennedy's executive order to integrate schools and colleges.

""I loved my daddy more than anything in the world,"" Peggy said. ""I did not want him to stand in the schoolhouse door, but he did. I just thought it was wrong. I wanted to go up to these people and say, 'You deserve to be here. You should be here.' But I couldn't.""

Bloody Sunday



The standoff ended without incident when President Kennedy called in the National Guard. but the next time Governor Wallace tried to intervene, it didn't end so peacefully.



On March 7, 1965, 600 men and women started out on foot from Selma, Alabama to the state capitol in Montgomery to protest voter discrimination. On the far side of the Edmund Pettis Bridge, they were met and assaulted by state and local police.

The clash, known as Bloody Sunday, left one dead and dozens wounded. Wallace, who had ordered law enforcement to Selma, had to answer for the violence.

""Now, I'm against violence, and I'm just as sorry that anybody got hurt,"" Wallace said after the clash. ""My orders have always been to use a minimum amount of force.""

""I would like to think that my father said, 'Do not attack the marchers.' That's what I would love to think,"" Peggy said.

Two weeks later, Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders and 25,000 protestors, made the 47-mile trek from Selma to Montgomery. The following August, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into Law.

MLK Assassinated in Memphis

But hatred was still alive.

On April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King was shot to death on a hotel balcony in Memphis, Tennessee.

""I can't stand to talk about it. That's how hurt I was,"" Rev. Jesse Douglas told us.



""I remember saying to my dad, 'I just hate white people; they killed Uncle ML,'"" Alveda King said. ""He said, 'wait a minute, wait a minute. White people didn't kill your uncle.' He said, 'white people prayed with us, white people marched with us. White people go to jail with us, white people die with us. The devil killed your uncle.' And I remember him saying that we have to love, we have to forgive, we have to love, we have to forgive.""

""He didn't hate anyone,"" Douglas added. ""He saw this as a part of God's plan because he knew his life might be snuffed out at any time. And he was ready for that. We were determined to give ourselves to helping to fulfill the dream.""

The Struggle With Anger and Unforgiveness

Not everyone would embrace that dream.

Dr. King's daughter, Bernice, who was only five years old when he was murdered, found herself struggling with anger as she entered her teen years.

""I remember distinctly in my heart feeling very angry. I was angry at white people because I felt they were responsible,"" Bernice King said. ""I was angry at black people because I felt like we hadn't done enough to continue the work. I was angry at God because I felt He could have stopped it. My anger did turn to rage and bitterness and hate. I literally ended up hating all white people especially white men.""

But as Bernice dealt with her own pain, Dr. King's message of love and forgiveness would prevail – even in the hearts of those who were once his enemies.

Assassination Attempt



While campaigning for the presidency in May 1972, George Wallace was shot four times at close range by a volunteer. The wounds left him permanently bound to a wheelchair. But that wasn't the only change Peggy saw in her father in the years that followed.

""He realized, with his suffering and pain, how much suffering and pain he must have caused the African American community. He'd talk about segregation, and he'd talk about how wrong he was. He just wanted forgiveness,"" Peggy said.

""One Sunday, he asked his bodyguards, he said, 'I want you to take me to Dexter Avenue Church' They took him down there unannounced. And they rolled his wheelchair down that middle aisle, and he sat there and asked that congregation to forgive him. And they did. It showed me what love and forgiveness are about. It filled my heart up. This was a very healing moment for him,"" she said.

Another Heart Softens and Changes

Meanwhile, Bernice's heart was also changing. Ever since her father was killed, her mother, Coretta Scott King, had refused to give in to hatred.

""The Bible says, 'Do good to them that hate you. Bless them that curse you'"" Bernice recalled. ""I saw her bless those that cursed her. Do good to those that hate her. And when she would say, 'I don't hold grudges,' I watched when people did very painful things to her that she just didn't hold it. She still loved them. It was just a powerful embodiment of Christ's spirit in our home.""

However, it wasn't until an interview on the James Robison Show in 2000 that Bernice's healing finally began.

""In the middle of it, [Robison] said, 'Can I give you a hug?' Now internally I'm like 'no!'. But my mother taught me better. So, I said 'sure' and he gave me a hug and – it was one of the most genuine hugs I've ever received. And that sounds, probably for most people, so simple and trite but it was very powerful because it began my healing process,"" Bernice said.

MLK's Dream Fulfilled

Then, in 2013, part of her father's dream was fulfilled. Bernice King and Peggy Wallace Kennedy stood side-by-side as hundreds of thousands gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s iconic ""I Have a Dream"" speech.

""Being able to join as sister-to-sister with Peggy Wallace years later was like a moment of redemption,"" said Bernice.



""I hugged her and I said, 'I love you, Bernice.' And she said, 'I love you, Peggy,'"" Peggy remembered. ""And I thought at that moment about that line that Dr. King spoke about 'One day down in Alabama, I hope that little white girls and little black girls can hold hands like sisters down in Alabama.' And I thought Dr. King and my father must be up there going 'How would we know that it would be our daughters that held hands as sisters down in Alabama?'""

Much has been accomplished through the work and sacrifices of so many people. While there is more to be done, the solution is always the same.

""Only love can develop sensitivity in another person's mind and heart,"" Jesse Douglas declared.

""It will never be legislating morality to such a point that people will do what is right unless you change the heart of the human being."" Alveda King added. ""The human heart, once it confronts genuine love, forgiveness, repentance, it can change. And when that heart is genuinely surrendered to God, then we can learn and find what my uncle called: 'the strength to love.'""



""It's who we are and how we live and lead our lives that causes true transformation,"" Bernice concluded. ""Dr. King changed people not just by his words. He didn't preach stuff that he didn't live, he lived it. We have to learn to hear the truth of God's message and live it and embody it because that's the light that the world desperately needs right now. It needs the spirit of Christ.

Who owns the story of health care in this country ? Who owns the story of closing abortion clinics ? Who owns the story of self-defense ? Who owns the story of marriage ?
I moved to Texas at the end of July , trying to take ownership of my life . One of the things I have struggled with is the idea that academia now has control over me , that my degree requirements , my professors , my program will dictate my future . But what has really bothered me are some of the ways ownership has been talked about in class . I have realized that I was under the false impression that when one reached a certain level of education , the racism and sexism would end .
Recently , one of my classes got to talking about race and discourse ( what language has to do with power ) , and one student raised a hand and said he had an example that would help . Then he described how , when he was a boy , he could n't figure out what a certain newscaster ’ s name was . The student complained that because the newscaster pronounced his name with a “ Mexican ” accent , he couldn ’ t understand it . He gave this as an example of “ code-switching , ” as an example of how this “ code-switch ” took away the newscaster 's power . ( I will get to code-switching , a term that I think was confused in this class . ) The student claimed that the newscaster 's pronunciation of his name stopped him from reaching his audience . Then the student said what has been bothering me relentlessly since then , that this—the newscaster 's name as he himself owned it— ” wasn ’ t his real name . ”
I didn ’ t know how to respond . I knew how I would have questioned this conversation as a teacher , how I would have shut it down before ownership of someone 's name was denied and then talked about the importance and implications of such a conversation , but I was not the instructor . I did not hold power in that classroom . What I did , which I hope was the right thing to do , was to say that “ on the record ” —I made a point of this—what this student had said made me extremely uncomfortable . I hoped that the instructor would take it from there , but he did not .
I have been repeating this story to everyone I know , or everyone I know who doesn ’ t share this other student ’ s opinion—which , in truth , is everyone I know well enough to tell . And I have tried to own the story , too . I have tried to make it slightly different than it was , a story where we would all be outraged , where we would all have time to process and examine what happened . But in the classroom , this comment went otherwise unchallenged , and I left the class feeling completely undone , and blaming , no doubt unfairly , the entire state of Texas .
It gives me the shivers , the idea that we do not own our names , that they belong to the ( white ) majority . And the way this student gave the example , like this would clear things up , like this was something everyone could agree on .
I am in Texas . Right now , Wendy Davis is running for governor . Wendy Davis whom I watched on YouTube ( because no major news network covered it live ) filibuster an anti-abortion law in the State Senate . Whose pink sneakers became a cultural icon . Who soon announced her candidacy for governor and her intent to write a memoir . She is taking control of her story , building on her new fame . ( Not a complaint . I hear that desire and wish I were in the position to do the same . ) What I want to talk about is a recent campaign stop where Davis claimed she was “ pro-life , ” which she described as follows :
I care about the life of every child : every child that goes to bed hungry , every child that goes to bed without a proper education , every child that goes to bed without being able to be a part of the Texas dream , every woman and man who worry about their children ’ s future and their ability to provide for that future . I care about life and I have a record of fighting for people above all else .
Texas Republicans , by most accounts , are not happy about this use of the term “ pro-life. ” They do not like how Davis claimed the term , though many Republicans refer to pro-choice as “ pro-abortion. ” This is the kind of ownership that wins or loses an election , and Davis has to play this game because she is playing the game of running for governor . The Republicans would argue that it is not her term to use , or that it is not right for her to use the term in a way that does not mean “ anti-abortion. ” Davis is clearly not anti-abortion . Yet she is using the term as a way to talk about what she is for , that she is for life ; she is using the term as a way to define herself and to take ownership of her beliefs , rather than be labeled by someone else ’ s beliefs .
This is an issue of particular concern to me . I have , over the last couple of years , learned that many of the terms I have used to describe my experience have been called into question by people with similar experiences . For example , I have learned that many adoptees do not like to call the parents who give birth to us , “ birth parents. ” I have learned that some families call the day their adopted son/daughter arrived , “ Gotcha Day. ” I have been in shock over this term , too , for a long time : the idea that a word used to describe journalism that catches someone out is used to describe the day adoptees arrive , and in celebration ! I have been in shock over the ownership element , and whose day it is “ supposed ” to be . It has become clear that to the general public , adoption is “ owned ” by adoptive parents .
Whose story is it , the story of the child who moves from one family to another , who leaves one life and has to start a new one ?
And this brings me back to the issue of names . It is not uncommon that adult adoptees change their names to their original/birth names , or incorporate those names in some way . This can be seen as a rejection by adoptive parents . I have a friend whose parents refuse to call her by her legal name , i.e . not the name they gave her . Do they own her name ? For some adoptees , that may seem too close to the question , do they own her ? It must be remembered , of course , that adoption is a financial transaction as well as a familial one .
For some of us , ownership of a name , of a person , is something that can bring up some serious personal and historical trauma .
I am currently the Fiction Editor at a magazine called The Good Men Project . I also teach for a program called Writers in the Schools , which matches writers to school systems . They look at our resumes or our faces or hear us talk or read our work and then they determine a “ placement. ” I have been matched to an all-boys Catholic school , fifth grade . Though I requested kindergarten to elementary , or in lieu of that , high school . Though I have a daughter and am far better suited to raising a daughter than I would be to raising a son . They saw what they wanted to see .
It reminds me of when I would listen to complaints from white Americans , when I was in Korea , about Koreans . Then I would hear complaints from Koreans , about Americans . But when I tried to defend Korea , the Americans would shut down , placing me as not American and thereby devaluing my opinions . And when I tried to defend America , the Koreans would shut down . Being on one side and then another only made me feel more clearly that I will always be in between . Maybe a common experience for adoptees who return to their birth lands .
At The Good Men Project , though I publish stories that do not prescribe what it is to be a ( good ) man , so many of the submissions I get ( from men ) do prescribe this . That , on its own , shows the power of a name . But what makes it worse is that many of these submissions put forward , either subtly or unsubtly , a perspective of male superiority , and implicitly , white man ’ s superiority . I get a lot of fiction where men own their stories but women do not . Some writers see the name of the magazine and see a safe place for the existing power structure . To some , `` The Good Men Project '' is a forum where men ’ s agency is on the table and therefore women ’ s agency is off the table .
The magazine has run into its own fair share of privilege problems , in fact , including publishing a string of essays on the subject of rape . Part of the problem in publishing these essays , even as a way into a conversation , is the privilege the male voice already has in defining and framing an act that is most often forced on women . The magazine did n't offer a perspective sensitive to that position , or anticipate clearly what it would mean for a venue called The Good Men Project to run an essay by an unapologetic rapist . It is bad enough that there are plenty of other places where men can say terrible things about women . Why here ? And what privilege it takes to think that this could start a conversation , not set it back . In founder and ex-contributor Tom Matlack 's most controversial essays , what he did n't get , somehow , was that he had a platform of male goodness and was using it to judge women .
This environment is not lost on one 's readers . I was recently on an email string where a reader accused The Good Men Project of “ shaming ” men , claiming good man status by saying he formed relationships on equality , and arguing that to suggest men should bear the brunt of equality was shaming . I wrote back that men bear more responsibility for establishing equality because of the power males have in our society , and that approaching relationships as if a gendered power structure doesn ’ t exist is to perpetuate that power structure . That argument , unfortunately , did n't get far . ( I should mention that the other editors did not share this reader 's , or Matlack 's , views . )
This is something I see all the time now , in this “ post-racist , ” “ post-sexist ” society : those with privilege trying to get out of responsibility for that privilege by claiming that we ’ re all equal now , or at least , `` I 'm a liberal/not racist/not sexist , so . '' Or those with privilege displaying what is commonly referred to , as I understand it , as white guilt , saying “ I ’ ll just never understand because I ’ m not like you ” ( read : why try ? ) , or , “ I don ’ t really have a better life ” ( do n't blame me ! ) , or “ Your culture is wonderful , I eat your food ” ( do n't blame me , I love kimchi ! ) .
God how I wish people would own their privilege . I am a man , and an American . Those things carry a certain power . I write this with a certain power . If I ignore the power I have , if I pretend not to have it , if I downplay it , or if I say someone with less power is “ special ” or “ valued ” ( read : exotic ) , I am perpetuating the power structure by trying to hide it from those who lose in it . If we ignore the power structures that are there , if we try to make them invisible , they don ’ t go away . We just validate them by putting the onus for them on the disempowered .
In the class I was in , where the other student said the newscaster ’ s name did not belong to him , I also got into an argument about code-switching . A second student was saying that code-switching was a way to make everyone feel empathy for each other , which was something I couldn ’ t get my head around .
Empathy is kind of a personal buzz word for me . I am all about empathy . And yet it was a failure of empathy that stopped me from understanding the empathy this student was referring to . I was looking at code-switching from the perspective of someone with less power switching to the code of the powerful . But he was looking at code-switching from the perspective of someone with power trying out the codes of the less powerful . That is , he thought of code-switching from a position of privilege . If a white American went to Japan and tried to “ act ” Japanese , he said , the American might learn something about a different culture . This is true . But what I think is most interesting here is the way this student was able to think about code-switching as an appreciation—because he was talking as someone who already owned the majority code , he did n't have to think about “ coding up. ” He was talking about “ coding-down. ” ( Power structure-wise , not cultural value-wise . )
When I figured out where he was coming from , that angle of privilege , I saw the point he was making . But he still wasn ’ t seeing from my point of view , that code-switching can be a way of making people feel like their own culture is less important , because they have to switch to a different culture to be understood , the way the first student was talking about the newscaster . We have to talk about code-switching our names now ! Or maybe this second student did understand and I 'm not giving him enough credit , again . But what I wanted from him was to own the fact that code-switching is far more often something done by the minority to fit into the majority society . What I wanted from him was to own the fact that it was a privilege for him to think about code-switching as a choice .
I wanted ownership of that story , the story of race and discourse , as a minority student . I felt like that story was mine .","Sometimes it seems like politics is an endless battle for the ownership of stories. Who owns the story of health care in this country? Who owns the story of closing abortion clinics? Who owns the story of self-defense? Who owns the story of marriage?

I moved to Texas at the end of July, trying to take ownership of my life. One of the things I have struggled with is the idea that academia now has control over me, that my degree requirements, my professors, my program will dictate my future. But what has really bothered me are some of the ways ownership has been talked about in class. I have realized that I was under the false impression that when one reached a certain level of education, the racism and sexism would end.

Recently, one of my classes got to talking about race and discourse (what language has to do with power), and one student raised a hand and said he had an example that would help. Then he described how, when he was a boy, he couldn't figure out what a certain newscaster’s name was. The student complained that because the newscaster pronounced his name with a “Mexican” accent, he couldn’t understand it. He gave this as an example of “code-switching,” as an example of how this “code-switch” took away the newscaster's power. (I will get to code-switching, a term that I think was confused in this class.) The student claimed that the newscaster's pronunciation of his name stopped him from reaching his audience. Then the student said what has been bothering me relentlessly since then, that this—the newscaster's name as he himself owned it—”wasn’t his real name.”

I didn’t know how to respond. I knew how I would have questioned this conversation as a teacher, how I would have shut it down before ownership of someone's name was denied and then talked about the importance and implications of such a conversation, but I was not the instructor. I did not hold power in that classroom. What I did, which I hope was the right thing to do, was to say that “on the record”—I made a point of this—what this student had said made me extremely uncomfortable. I hoped that the instructor would take it from there, but he did not.

I have been repeating this story to everyone I know, or everyone I know who doesn’t share this other student’s opinion—which, in truth, is everyone I know well enough to tell. And I have tried to own the story, too. I have tried to make it slightly different than it was, a story where we would all be outraged, where we would all have time to process and examine what happened. But in the classroom, this comment went otherwise unchallenged, and I left the class feeling completely undone, and blaming, no doubt unfairly, the entire state of Texas.

It gives me the shivers, the idea that we do not own our names, that they belong to the (white) majority. And the way this student gave the example, like this would clear things up, like this was something everyone could agree on.

I am in Texas. Right now, Wendy Davis is running for governor. Wendy Davis whom I watched on YouTube (because no major news network covered it live) filibuster an anti-abortion law in the State Senate. Whose pink sneakers became a cultural icon. Who soon announced her candidacy for governor and her intent to write a memoir. She is taking control of her story, building on her new fame. (Not a complaint. I hear that desire and wish I were in the position to do the same.) What I want to talk about is a recent campaign stop where Davis claimed she was “pro-life,” which she described as follows:

“Do I think he’s a civil rights leader? No,” said Al Sharpton, who has become close to Obama in part because they are of the same post-movement generation. “I think he’d be the first person to tell you that.”

So when Obama settles into King’s footsteps at the base of the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday, half a century after the 1963 March on Washington, black leaders will be listening not for the inspirational rhetoric of a civil rights icon but for the substance of a president.

“Those are two different roles,” said Jesse Jackson, who has had his differences with Obama. “What we needed from Dr. King was motivation and vision. What we need from the president is appropriation and legislation.”

In other words, Obama is more Kennedy than King. Obama’s background is in organizing but he never promised or sought to be a King-style leader. Indeed, of all the things King envisioned in his famous refrain — “I have a dream…” — a black president was not one of them.

Much as Obama treads on new ground, the election and re-election of a black president have forced contemporary black civil rights leaders to confront a challenge that was hard to foresee half a century ago: Their activism is aimed at a fellow person of color.

At times over the past five years, the calculus for civil rights leaders who hope to prod the president to act on a range of issues has proven difficult. Obama has received overwhelming support from black voters in two elections, meaning the leaders of civil rights organizations are risking their own standing if they take him on. There’s also the danger that they could hurt the president politically by challenging him publicly. At the same time, Obama’s willingness to work around some of those leaders has caused consternation that is typically discussed only in private settings.

Obama has elevated Sharpton and his National Action Network by having one-on-sessions with the MSNBC television host and inviting him to group meetings with leaders of longer-standing civil rights organizations such as the NAACP.

civil_rights,NPR Online News,1,http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/02/26/172971321/has-u-s-outgrown-the-voting-rights-act,Has The U.S. Outgrown The Voting Rights Act?,2013-02-26,Liz Halloran,"Black voters have been turning out for general elections in rates that for the first time in U.S. history rival those of whites .
And the number of black elected officials in the U.S. exceeds 10,500 , up from fewer than 1,500 four decades ago .
There can be little argument that those developments illustrate dramatic change in a country still scrubbing at the enduring stain of slavery .
But do they suggest that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , a civil rights breakthrough originally designed to wring institutionalized discrimination from the nation 's voting process in the Old South , is obsolete ?
The Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider just that , as justices hear a challenge to the act 's key Section 5 , which requires federal preapproval of proposed election and voting changes — from voter ID to redistricting — in nine states and a smattering of smaller jurisdictions elsewhere with histories of voting-related discrimination .

The nation has twice elected an African-American president.

Black voters have been turning out for general elections in rates that for the first time in U.S. history rival those of whites.

And the number of black elected officials in the U.S. exceeds 10,500, up from fewer than 1,500 four decades ago.

There can be little argument that those developments illustrate dramatic change in a country still scrubbing at the enduring stain of slavery.

But do they suggest that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a civil rights breakthrough originally designed to wring institutionalized discrimination from the nation's voting process in the Old South, is obsolete?

The Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider just that, as justices hear a challenge to the act's key Section 5, which requires federal preapproval of proposed election and voting changes — from voter ID to redistricting — in nine states and a smattering of smaller jurisdictions elsewhere with histories of voting-related discrimination.

The constitutional challenge, which originated in Alabama's Shelby County, comes seven years after Congress overwhelmingly reauthorized the act for another quarter century.

And it follows an election season when the act was used to forestall a number of efforts that would likely have made voting more difficult for poor and minority Americans — including those in the rapidly growing Hispanic community.

""Election laws need to apply to every state and jurisdiction equally, whether they're heavily Hispanic or heavily African-American,"" Edward Blum, a leading force behind the high court challenge, told us in a recent interview. ""Those laws need to be one-size-fits-all.""

Lining up on the other side are civil rights activists, fair voting experts and even Virginia lawyer Gerald Hebert, who has made his name helping jurisdictions get off -- or, in the common vernacular, ""bail out"" — of the federal government's election watch list.

A Way Out, If You Don't Discriminate

One of the most persistent arguments made by those who want to see Section 5 go away is that states are unfairly compelled to remain on the federal list because of outdated formulas contained in the original 1965 act, and not based on current evidence of discrimination.

They also argue that bailing out, which requires proof of a decade of nondiscrimination in elections and voting, is complicated and prohibitively expensive.

Hogwash, says Hebert, who notes that since 2009, when the Supreme Court made bailing out easier, nearly 130 jurisdictions (though no states) have successfully been released from the federal list.

An additional 69 jurisdictions successfully bailed out between 1982 — when Congress amended the Voting Rights Act to include new bailout standards for local governments — and 2009.

More than 100 Virginia jurisdictions, including 24 counties and seven independent cities, have successfully bailed out of federal pre-clearance.

The costs of the process, which is largely paperwork, Hebert says, rarely exceed $5,000.

""It's affordable and cost-effective, it's administratively feasible and readily achievable,"" says Hebert, a former longtime Justice Department voting rights official who has argued as much in an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court. ""Bailout is not illusory; it's actually workable.""

The 1965 act, he argues, is not frozen in time, as its critics argue.

Section 2, however, puts the onus of proof on the plaintiff. Hebert argues that the cost and time of mounting a discrimination lawsuit under that section of the act is an ""uphill climb."" Some statewide redistricting challenges, for example, can run well over $1 million, he says.

Redistricting Ramifications

The Voting Rights Act in recent years has been used to block efforts that have included a photo ID law change in South Carolina, early voting curtailment in Florida, and, perhaps most significantly, Texas redistricting that federal officials found intentionally discriminatory.

If the high court decides to strike Section 5, redistricting experts like Michael McDonald suggest that the biggest effect will be felt in state and local voting districts.

At the state and local level, however, parties in power would have much more ability to gerrymander with impunity, dividing voting communities, redistricting experts argue, or packing them with minority voters to dilute their ability to build crossover coalitions in more diverse districts.

Courting Speculation

In testimony before Congress in 2006, before legislators reauthorized the Voting Rights Act, Chandler Davidson of Rice University noted that the act had been in effect for more than four decades.

""From one perspective, this is a rather long period of time,"" he said. ""On the other hand, that period constituted the longest uninterrupted stretch of time in the history of our republic in which blacks nationwide have been able to vote with relative freedom.""

""To dismiss the magnitude of this progress — to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed — that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years,"" Obama said. ""Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, Martin Luther King Jr. — they did not die in vain. Their victory was great.

In a speech that ran around 30 minutes, President Obama delivered a nuanced analysis of the progress of the Rev. Martin Luther King's dream.

""To dismiss the magnitude of this progress, to suggest little has changed dishonors"" the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march, Obama said. But to say that everything is OK, also dishonors that legacy.

Obama opened his speech by reminding the crowd of the history of the march. It wasn't just about ending oppression, Obama said, it was also about jobs.

He quoted MLK, saying what good is it for a man to be able to sit at a lunch counter, if he can't afford to pay the meal.

Update at 2:59 p.m. ET. 'Let Freedom Ring':

At about 3 p.m. ET, Bernice King, King's daughter, said that today, ""we are going to let freedom ring.""

The King family walked up to a bell saved after the Birmingham Baptist Church was bombed in 1963 and rang it. Across the country, churches joined in, ringing their bells in order to remember King.

Update at 2:41 p.m. ET. 'The Choice Remains':

The choice from 50 years ago, said President Bill Clinton, remains the same today: ""cooperate and thrive or fight with each other and fall behind.""

Clinton said that Americans today owe a tremendous debt to ""those people who came here 50 years ago."" Millions of us, said Clinton, have lived the dream King talked about.

The question, said Clinton, is how will we repay that debt?

""Martin Luther King did not live and die to hear us complain,"" said Clinton. ""It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back.""

Update at 2:32 p.m. ET. Greatest Leader:

Dr. King is ""the greatest leader my native state, and perhaps my native country has ever produced,"" former President Carter said.

He said that King's dream is still not complete. He said ""we all know"" how Dr. King would feel at some voter ID laws, and at the Supreme Court ruling striking a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. ""We all know"" what Dr. King would think about the incredible unemployment rate, and incarceration rate of blacks.

""There's a tremendous agenda before us,"" Carter said. ""I'm thankful to Martin Luther King Jr. that his dream is still alive.""

Update at 2:24 p.m. ET. Long Way To Go:

Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic congressman from Georgia, is now at the podium. Remember, Lewis was at 23, the youngest speaker at the March on Washington, 50 years ago.

civil_rights,The Hill,1,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/506494-pressure-mounts-on-facebook-to-rein-in-hate-speech,Pressure mounts on Facebook to rein in hate speech,2020-07-08,,"Facebook came under renewed public scrutiny Wednesday with the release of an independent audit slamming the platform ’ s progress on civil rights issues , adding to internal and external pressure on the company to rein in hate speech and misinformation .
The audit was the third shoe to drop this month after a group of high-profile advertisers launched a boycott of the site and following a Democratic National Committee memo bashing the company just months before a crucial election .
The independent review of the company ’ s policies released Wednesday — the third in a set of three commissioned by the social media giant in 2018 — criticized Facebook for failing to develop a mechanism for protecting civil rights and for a hands-off approach when it comes to free speech , even in cases of violent posts .
Outside critics said the findings report shows the company needs to step up and make changes . If it doesn ’ t , they argued , government intervention would be warranted .
“ If Facebook won ’ t create rules for the platform that protect free elections and public safety , then Congress must intervene to ensure civil rights are protected , ” said Rashad Robinson , head of Color of Change . “ Our work continues with or without Facebook ’ s collaboration ; we won ’ t rest until the platform is a safe and just place for Black people . ”
Auditors took particular issue with Facebook ’ s handling of posts from President Trump Donald John TrumpWayfair refutes QAnon-like conspiracy theory that it 's trafficking children Stone rails against US justice system in first TV interview since Trump commuted his sentence Federal appeals court rules Trump admin ca n't withhold federal grants from California sanctuary cities MORE . One of the posts they highlighted was one from the president in response to protests in Minneapolis over the police killing of George Floyd in which Trump wrote “ when the looting shoots , the shooting starts . ”
The review said Facebook ’ s decision to leave such posts untouched has “ real world consequences . ”
The report acknowledged Facebook has made “ some significant improvements in the platform , ” but the overall audit was a scathing rebuke .
The report adds to growing pressure on Facebook to tighten its policies against hate speech and misinformation .
Several civil rights groups last month launched an ad boycott campaign called “ Stop Hate for Profit , ” asking companies to pull their ad dollars from Facebook for the month of July until action is taken on those issues . Hundreds of businesses have joined the campaign .
On Monday , the leaders of those civil rights groups met with Facebook executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergWe have n't seen how low it can go Hillicon Valley : Facebook considers political ad ban | Senators raise concerns over civil rights audit | Amazon reverses on telling workers to delete TikTok Facebook considering ban on political ads : reports MORE and COO Sheryl Sandberg for more than an hour . The meeting , organized by Facebook , did little to win over its critics .
“ The end of the conversation was the exact same thing that we started with : another dialogue , no action , ” Derrick Johnson , CEO and president of the NAACP , said in an interview with ███ on Monday .
The organizers presented a list of 10 demands aimed at reducing hate on the platform , according to Johnson , including hiring a civil rights expert to a top executive position , submitting to regular audits and creating expert teams to review harassment claims .
Facebook said in a statement after the meeting that it is working to “ keep hate off of our platform ” and that the civil rights leaders “ want Facebook to be free of hate speech and so do we . ”
In a separate call Tuesday , executives at Facebook met with other civil rights leaders , including Vanita Gupta of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Sherrilyn Ifill , president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund .
“ The company ’ s recent announcements have been incremental , rather than the kind of bold action needed to seriously address the harmful impact of voter disinformation and hate speech on the platform , ” Gupta and Ifill said in a joint statement . “ As long as the platform is weaponized to spread hate and undermine our democracy , a united civil rights community will continue to fight . ”
The platform has sought to position the civil rights audit as proof of its commitment to meaningful improvements . Sandberg said Wednesday that having “ our shortcomings exposed by experts ” has “ undoubtedly been a really important process for our company . ”
Critics have been quick to point out that Facebook did not adopt recommendations from the previous two audits .
“ They have not even adapted the recommendations from the release of the prior audit , ” Johnson told ███ . “ What we learned from the prior two audit releases is that the recommendations fall flat . ”
Criticism of Facebook has not been confined to civil rights circles .
The Democratic National Committee skewered the company for failing to keep promises in a memo obtained by ███ .
The memo says the platform has not managed to limit sensational and hyperpartisan content or develop a substantial enough fact-checking team .
“ Following the 2016 election , Facebook made a number of public promises of change , ” the memo reads . “ As the company makes new commitments in response to renewed public criticism , it is worth reviewing carefully how the company ’ s actions measure up to its words . In many cases , as documented below , Facebook failed to keep its promises . ”
The platform ’ s approach to hate speech has drawn internal ire as well . Last month , dozens of employees staged a digital walkout while others publicly criticized Zuckerberg online .
The fire from all angles has led to some changes , though .
Zuckerberg recently committed to flagging political speech that violates platform policies , a marked shift from the company ’ s previous approach .
The company also committed to a civil rights position , although not at the C-suite level as requested by the civil rights groups .
However , those changes don ’ t match the steps taken by other social media companies . Twitter has begun labeling and reducing the spread of Trump ’ s posts , while Snapchat has stopped promoting the president entirely .

The audit was the third shoe to drop this month after a group of high-profile advertisers launched a boycott of the site and following a Democratic National Committee memo bashing the company just months before a crucial election.

The independent review of the company’s policies released Wednesday — the third in a set of three commissioned by the social media giant in 2018 — criticized Facebook for failing to develop a mechanism for protecting civil rights and for a hands-off approach when it comes to free speech, even in cases of violent posts.

Outside critics said the findings report shows the company needs to step up and make changes. If it doesn’t, they argued, government intervention would be warranted.

“If Facebook won’t create rules for the platform that protect free elections and public safety, then Congress must intervene to ensure civil rights are protected,” said Rashad Robinson, head of Color of Change. “Our work continues with or without Facebook’s collaboration; we won’t rest until the platform is a safe and just place for Black people.”

Auditors took particular issue with Facebook’s handling of posts from President Trump Donald John TrumpWayfair refutes QAnon-like conspiracy theory that it's trafficking children Stone rails against US justice system in first TV interview since Trump commuted his sentence Federal appeals court rules Trump admin can't withhold federal grants from California sanctuary cities MORE. One of the posts they highlighted was one from the president in response to protests in Minneapolis over the police killing of George Floyd in which Trump wrote “when the looting shoots, the shooting starts.”

The review said Facebook’s decision to leave such posts untouched has “real world consequences.”

The report acknowledged Facebook has made “some significant improvements in the platform,” but the overall audit was a scathing rebuke.

The report adds to growing pressure on Facebook to tighten its policies against hate speech and misinformation.

Several civil rights groups last month launched an ad boycott campaign called “Stop Hate for Profit,” asking companies to pull their ad dollars from Facebook for the month of July until action is taken on those issues. Hundreds of businesses have joined the campaign.

On Monday, the leaders of those civil rights groups met with Facebook executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergWe haven't seen how low it can go Hillicon Valley: Facebook considers political ad ban | Senators raise concerns over civil rights audit | Amazon reverses on telling workers to delete TikTok Facebook considering ban on political ads: reports MORE and COO Sheryl Sandberg for more than an hour. The meeting, organized by Facebook, did little to win over its critics.

“The end of the conversation was the exact same thing that we started with: another dialogue, no action,” Derrick Johnson, CEO and president of the NAACP, said in an interview with The Hill on Monday.

The organizers presented a list of 10 demands aimed at reducing hate on the platform, according to Johnson, including hiring a civil rights expert to a top executive position, submitting to regular audits and creating expert teams to review harassment claims.

Their demands were not met.

Facebook said in a statement after the meeting that it is working to “keep hate off of our platform” and that the civil rights leaders “want Facebook to be free of hate speech and so do we.”

In a separate call Tuesday, executives at Facebook met with other civil rights leaders, including Vanita Gupta of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.

“The company’s recent announcements have been incremental, rather than the kind of bold action needed to seriously address the harmful impact of voter disinformation and hate speech on the platform,” Gupta and Ifill said in a joint statement. “As long as the platform is weaponized to spread hate and undermine our democracy, a united civil rights community will continue to fight.”

The platform has sought to position the civil rights audit as proof of its commitment to meaningful improvements. Sandberg said Wednesday that having “our shortcomings exposed by experts” has “undoubtedly been a really important process for our company.”

Critics have been quick to point out that Facebook did not adopt recommendations from the previous two audits.

“They have not even adapted the recommendations from the release of the prior audit,” Johnson told The Hill. “What we learned from the prior two audit releases is that the recommendations fall flat.”

Criticism of Facebook has not been confined to civil rights circles.

The Democratic National Committee skewered the company for failing to keep promises in a memo obtained by The Hill.

The memo says the platform has not managed to limit sensational and hyperpartisan content or develop a substantial enough fact-checking team.

“Following the 2016 election, Facebook made a number of public promises of change,” the memo reads. “As the company makes new commitments in response to renewed public criticism, it is worth reviewing carefully how the company’s actions measure up to its words. In many cases, as documented below, Facebook failed to keep its promises.”

The platform’s approach to hate speech has drawn internal ire as well. Last month, dozens of employees staged a digital walkout while others publicly criticized Zuckerberg online.

The fire from all angles has led to some changes, though.

Zuckerberg recently committed to flagging political speech that violates platform policies, a marked shift from the company’s previous approach.

The company also committed to a civil rights position, although not at the C-suite level as requested by the civil rights groups.

However, those changes don’t match the steps taken by other social media companies. Twitter has begun labeling and reducing the spread of Trump’s posts, while Snapchat has stopped promoting the president entirely.

Facebook’s commitment to free expression above all else, a position outlined in a lengthy speech Zuckerberg gave at Georgetown University last year, is likely to draw further criticism, especially as Election Day draws near.

“Elevating free expression is a good thing, but it should apply to everyone,” the auditors wrote in their report.

“When it means that powerful politicians do not have to abide by the same rules that everyone else does, a hierarchy of speech is created that privileges certain voices over less powerful voices,” they added. “The prioritization of free expression over all other values, such as equality and non-discrimination, is deeply troubling to the Auditors.”",www.thehill.com,center,TzLfrzwiFY3wafKZ

The auditors found that the company simply hasn ’ t done enough to combat hate and abuse on its platform .

In a blog post announcing the report ’ s release on Wednesday , Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said that the company “ won ’ t make every change they [ auditors ] call for , ” but that it “ will put more of their proposals into practice . ”
Regardless of what the company ends up doing , the audit serves as a thorough examination of Facebook ’ s longstanding struggle to reconcile its stated values around free speech with the history of harm caused by unchecked vitriol and discrimination on its platform . With that overarching theme in mind , here are five key takeaways about Facebook and civil rights from the 89-page report .
1 ) Holding Trump to a different standard sets a troubling precedent
Facebook has failed to penalize Trump for violating its community guidelines , the auditors say , which stands “ to gut policies ” that had represented progress for civil rights on the platform . The report specifically highlights a group of Trump ’ s posts that made misleading claims about voting and the president ’ s infamous “ looting … shooting ” post about protesters . Echoing previous concerns from civil rights groups , the auditors say these posts clearly violate Facebook ’ s community guidelines and that not removing them establishes a concerning precedent for Trump and other politicians .
The voting-related posts by Trump referenced in the report include false claims about mail-in ballots in California , Michigan , and Nevada . Facebook ultimately decided that these posts did not violate its guidelines , arguing in the case of Michigan and Nevada that the language in the posts was merely “ challenging the legality of officials. ” The auditors explain that they “ vehemently expressed ” their view that the posts violated policy but were “ not afforded an opportunity to speak directly to decision-makers ” until after the final decision was made .
Facebook ’ s decisions , they said , constitute a “ tremendous setback for all of the policies that attempt to ban voter suppression on Facebook . ”
Trump ’ s “ looting ... shooting ” post represents a similar pattern of self-justified inaction . In that post , the president appeared to threaten violence against Black Lives Matter protesters , using language that echoed civil rights-era white segregationists . Though Facebook executives called the White House requesting that Trump change or delete the post , the company ultimately did nothing about it . By contrast , Twitter chose to label an identical post by President Trump on its platform for violating its rules about glorifying violence .
Facebook defended its decision by arguing that threats of state action are allowed on the platform . The auditors say that logic ignored “ how such statements , especially when made by those in power and targeted toward an identifiable , minority community , condone vigilantism and legitimize violence against that community. “ They added , “ Random shooting is not a legitimate state use of force. ” Again , the auditors say they were not included in the decision-making process in time . Facebook ’ s decision about the “ looting … shooting ” post , which Mark Zuckerberg later defended on a call with employees , prompted criticism from company executives and a virtual employee walkout . It was one of the incidents that inspired the Stop Hate for Profit boycott .
In June , Facebook announced it will label posts that violate its community guidelines but are left up because they ’ re deemed newsworthy ( and if their public interest value eclipses the harm they cause ) , but that doesn ’ t seem to happen very often . The audit revealed that over the past year , the company only applied the newsworthy exception to politicians 15 times , and only once in the United States , and it was not immediately clear what those instances were .
Meanwhile , the company still hasn ’ t taken any action against Trump ’ s past posts , and the auditors concluded that for many civil rights advocates , “ the damage has already been done. ” Even if Facebook has policies supporting civil rights , the auditors concluded , the refusal to enforce them against Trump has eroded trust in the company and leaves room for other politicians to follow in Trump ’ s footsteps .
While Facebook ’ s leadership has repeatedly emphasized the company ’ s commitment to free expression , the auditors found that this comes at a cost . Facebook systematically chooses to prioritize the speech of politicians over clamping down on harmful and hateful rhetoric , which hurts its users overall . Several times in the report , the auditors cite Zuckerberg ’ s 2019 speech at Georgetown as a “ turning point , ” where Facebook reiterated its commitment to free expression as “ a governing principle of the platform . ”
Facebook ’ s choice not to fact-check politicians — and to allow them to sometimes break Facebook ’ s own rules against posting harmful content because what politicians say is inherently newsworthy — represents another problem . Both steps have significantly hurt the company ’ s civil rights efforts , the auditors said . Allowing politicians to spread misinformation about voting , which Zuckerberg in his Georgetown speech argued was a form of free expression , particularly undermines Facebook ’ s commitment to its values . The auditors said they found Facebook ’ s prioritization of free speech over other values , like nondiscrimination and equality , “ deeply troubling . ”
The auditors said they found Facebook ’ s prioritization of free speech over other values , like nondiscrimination and equality , “ deeply troubling ”
By forming exemptions for politicians ’ content , they argue , a “ hierarchy of speech is created that privileges certain voices over less powerful voices . ”
The report , however , acknowledges that Facebook is failing to address the tension between its civil rights promises and its monolithic commitment to free expression . Instead , the company should work to develop a more comprehensive understanding of free speech that acknowledges how typical users actually experience the platform .
“ For a 21st century American corporation , and for Facebook , a social media company that has so much influence over our daily lives , the lack of clarity about the relationship between those two values is devastating , ” lead auditor Laura W. Murphy wrote in the report ’ s introduction . “ It will require hard balancing , but that kind of balancing of rights and interests has been part of the American dialogue since its founding and there is no reason that Facebook can not harmonize those values , if it really wants to do so . ”
3 ) Hate speech is still a problem for Facebook , and we don ’ t know how bad it really is
Facebook has long struggled with hateful and violent speech on its platform , including from white nationalists streaming talk shows on Facebook Watch and members of the “ boogaloo movement ” that promote anti-government ideology and has instigated violence at recent racial justice protests .
Facebook ’ s audit highlights that the company has a long way to go in combating hate speech , particularly around white nationalism . Facebook has made some progress : It says it ’ s gotten better at identifying hate speech , and it now has a team of 350 people who work exclusively on combating dangerous groups on Facebook . But the auditors say hateful content often stays on the platform for longer than it should or doesn ’ t get removed in the first place . This is an “ especially acute ” problem with content targeting African Americans , Jews , and Muslims , according to the audit .
For example , the auditors asked Facebook to ban all content that promotes white nationalist or white separatist ideology , something it has so far failed to do . The company has explicitly banned phrases like “ white nationalism ” or “ white separatism , ” but that simplistic approach still allows racist content to continue to spread on the platform , the auditors said .
The audit also criticized Facebook for not taking down hateful events fast enough . The report highlights how in 2019 , it took Facebook more than 24 hours to remove an event intended to physically intimidate attendees at the Islamic Society of North America ’ s annual meeting in Houston , Texas . Facebook has acknowledged its misstep with that incident , but auditors called for the company to fundamentally revise its review process to expedite the removal of such events . Properly moderating events , the report says , is essential “ to ensure that people can not use Facebook to organize calls to arms to harm or intimidate specific groups ” during the current nationwide protests .
One thing complicating Facebook ’ s hate speech problem is the fact that there ’ s not enough hard data to know how bad it is or how it impacts different groups . The report says “ the absence of data for analysis and study seems to undercut efforts to document and define the problem , identify its source , and explore potential mitigation . ”
While the audit focused on issues of hate speech , it also touched on a related and even more complex issue that has dogged Facebook for years : whether its platform politically polarizes its users and how this might be connected to the hate speech that spreads on Facebook . A recent Wall Street Journal report found that Facebook ’ s leadership shut down efforts to make the site less divisive by shelving internal research on whether social media increases polarization . Facebook , and Zuckerberg in particular , has denied these claims and criticized the Journal ’ s reporting .
Zuckerberg has vehemently disputed the notion that Facebook is polarizing its users , arguing that on the whole the platform brings people together . The auditors questioned that conclusion , saying they “ do not believe that Facebook is sufficiently attuned to the depth of concern on the issue of polarization and the way that the algorithms used by Facebook inadvertently fuel extreme and polarizing content . ”
Under public pressure after the 2016 election , Facebook adjusted its News Feed ’ s algorithm so that it promotes posts from friends and family over news articles . Still , the auditors believe this wasn ’ t sufficient action and that “ Facebook should do everything in its power to prevent its tools and algorithms from driving people toward self-reinforcing echo chambers of extremism , and that the company must recognize that failure to do so can have dangerous ( and life-threatening ) real-world consequences . ”
Facebook can do this , the auditors say , not just by removing hateful content but also by redirecting users “ away from ( rather than toward ) extremist organizations ” in the types of recommendations it makes .
4 ) Covid-19 showed Facebook can effectively police harmful content when it wants to
The Covid-19 pandemic raised the stakes for how the company handles harmful content . Notably , in response to the pandemic , Facebook began to aggressively take down misinformation related to Covid-19 , removing hundreds of thousands of false posts that Facebook identified as having the potential to cause imminent physical harm .
This new approach contrasts starkly with how the company combats other types of misinformation , which Facebook has historically chosen not to act on . The report says that “ Facebook has no qualms about reining in speech by the proponents of the anti-vaccination movement , or limiting misinformation about COVID-19 , but when it comes to voting , Facebook has been far too reluctant to adopt strong rules to limit misinformation and voter suppression . ”
Moderating pandemic-related content is also getting more complicated for the platform : As Recode ’ s Peter Kafka explained in late May , the discussion around Covid-19 has evolved from a public health concern into a rancorous and partisan political debate that encompasses voting rights , state reopening plans , and the politics of wearing ( or not wearing ) masks . The report notes the majority of the 100,000 pieces of content between March and May taken down for violating its voter inference policies were related to Covid-19 .
5 ) The person Facebook hires to be its new civil rights executive needs real decision-making power
For years , civil rights leaders have pressured Facebook to create a role that would ensure that the company is thinking about whether its products and policies are treating people fairly . With the publication of this report , Facebook announced that it is creating a senior vice president on civil rights leadership role . But auditors say that isn ’ t enough . They want Facebook to create a “ civil rights infrastructure . ”
The audit recommends that the new vice president of civil rights should manage a team rather than work in a standalone position ; they should have a mandatory say in key “ decisions with civil rights implications , ” such as whether or not to remove controversial posts from a politician . The auditors specifically said the new vice president of civil rights “ must be ‘ in the room ’ ( meaning in direct dialogue with decision-makers ) when decisions are being made and have direct conversations with leadership . ”
Fewer than 10 people weighed in on Zuckerberg ’ s controversial final decision not to take down Trump ’ s post referencing “ shooting ” at protests , according to a transcript of an internal Facebook all-hands meeting Recode reported on in June . Of the people Zuckerberg cited in the meeting , only one was Black , and none had roles dedicated exclusively to civil rights .
In a statement to Recode , Rashad Robinson , the president of Color of Change , said the newly announced position was “ an important step ” but added that “ their office needs to be provided with full resources to be effective . ”
“ Without this , there is no reason to believe that Facebook will prioritize civil rights protections moving forward , ” Robinson said . “ All we can count on is Zuckerberg pontificating about free expression , while giving a free pass to politicians to lie , sow discord , and thrive off of hate and political chaos . ”
For civil rights leaders who have been waiting on the results of this report for two years , the big question is what comes next . Will Facebook enact the many changes in this audit it has said it ’ s “ considering ” or “ piloting ” ?
Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg , in her blog post announcing the audit ’ s release on Wednesday , called it the “ beginning of the journey — not the end ” for Facebook ’ s handling of hate speech and related issues . But some civil rights organizations are losing patience , and according to the audit , some are considering stopping their work with Facebook altogether . This is an alarming sign , considering how close the November election is .
“ I ’ m not looking only for what the audit recommends , but what Facebook is going to do about it , ” Jessica González , president of the civil rights organization Free Press , which has been one of the organizations leading an advertising boycott of Facebook , told Recode .
“ I know that we can ’ t snap our fingers and transform a social media network in a day , but [ Facebook has ] been way too lethargic about this ”
Advertisers are continuing to sign on to the boycott , with around 125 new ones signing up so far this week alone , González told Recode on Wednesday . Congress is also likely to press Facebook on these issues at an upcoming congressional hearing on antitrust issues in July , during which Zuckerberg and other major tech executives are set to testify .
“ I know that we can ’ t snap our fingers and transform a social media network in a day , but [ Facebook has ] been way too lethargic about this , ” said González . “ The actions don ’ t meet the words . ”

The auditors found that the company simply hasn’t done enough to combat hate and abuse on its platform.

Moderating pandemic-related content is also getting more complicated for the platform: As Recode’s Peter Kafka explained in late May, the discussion around Covid-19 has evolved from a public health concern into a rancorous and partisan political debate that encompasses voting rights, state reopening plans, and the politics of wearing (or not wearing) masks. The report notes the majority of the 100,000 pieces of content between March and May taken down for violating its voter inference policies were related to Covid-19.

5) The person Facebook hires to be its new civil rights executive needs real decision-making power

For years, civil rights leaders have pressured Facebook to create a role that would ensure that the company is thinking about whether its products and policies are treating people fairly. With the publication of this report, Facebook announced that it is creating a senior vice president on civil rights leadership role. But auditors say that isn’t enough. They want Facebook to create a “civil rights infrastructure.”

The audit recommends that the new vice president of civil rights should manage a team rather than work in a standalone position; they should have a mandatory say in key “decisions with civil rights implications,” such as whether or not to remove controversial posts from a politician. The auditors specifically said the new vice president of civil rights “must be ‘in the room’ (meaning in direct dialogue with decision-makers) when decisions are being made and have direct conversations with leadership.”

Fewer than 10 people weighed in on Zuckerberg’s controversial final decision not to take down Trump’s post referencing “shooting” at protests, according to a transcript of an internal Facebook all-hands meeting Recode reported on in June. Of the people Zuckerberg cited in the meeting, only one was Black, and none had roles dedicated exclusively to civil rights.

In a statement to Recode, Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, said the newly announced position was “an important step” but added that “their office needs to be provided with full resources to be effective.”

“Without this, there is no reason to believe that Facebook will prioritize civil rights protections moving forward,” Robinson said. “All we can count on is Zuckerberg pontificating about free expression, while giving a free pass to politicians to lie, sow discord, and thrive off of hate and political chaos.”

What’s next

For civil rights leaders who have been waiting on the results of this report for two years, the big question is what comes next. Will Facebook enact the many changes in this audit it has said it’s “considering” or “piloting”?

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, in her blog post announcing the audit’s release on Wednesday, called it the “beginning of the journey — not the end” for Facebook’s handling of hate speech and related issues. But some civil rights organizations are losing patience, and according to the audit, some are considering stopping their work with Facebook altogether. This is an alarming sign, considering how close the November election is.

“I’m not looking only for what the audit recommends, but what Facebook is going to do about it,” Jessica González, president of the civil rights organization Free Press, which has been one of the organizations leading an advertising boycott of Facebook, told Recode.

“I know that we can’t snap our fingers and transform a social media network in a day, but [Facebook has] been way too lethargic about this”

Advertisers are continuing to sign on to the boycott, with around 125 new ones signing up so far this week alone, González told Recode on Wednesday. Congress is also likely to press Facebook on these issues at an upcoming congressional hearing on antitrust issues in July, during which Zuckerberg and other major tech executives are set to testify.

“I know that we can’t snap our fingers and transform a social media network in a day, but [Facebook has] been way too lethargic about this,” said González. “The actions don’t meet the words.”

(CNN) -- A little over two days. That's how long the grand jury deliberated before deciding not to bring an indictment against Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9. St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury had heard more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses before reaching its decision, which he said was supported by physical evidence.

Sadly, the grand jury's failure to return an indictment of Wilson was not surprising. But don't blame the grand jury; blame McCulloch. He oversaw the proceedings and bears responsibility for their outcome.

McCulloch compromised the Ferguson grand jury proceedings from the start. He resisted calls to recuse himself, saying, ""I have absolutely no intention of walking away from duties and the responsibilities entrusted in me by the people of this community."" However, the community would have been better served if he had stepped aside.

Are protests taking place near you?

McCulloch's father was a police officer killed in a shootout with an African-American suspect. His brother, uncle and cousin served with the St. Louis Police Department, and his mother worked there for 20 years as a clerk. Newsweek noted McCulloch's ""long history of siding with the police."" For the sake of impartiality, McCulloch should have let a special prosecutor take over the case.

The grand jury only needed to find ""probable cause"" to charge Wilson. That's one of the lowest legal standards in our justice system, below ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" (required for a criminal conviction) and ""preponderance of the evidence"" (the standard in a civil trial). The fact that McCulloch did not get an indictment for a killing that shocked the nation raises questions about whether he really wanted an indictment.

""We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury,"" McCulloch said in August. Yet in grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor typically shows the minimal amount of evidence necessary to establish that a trial is merited. By dumping so much evidence on the grand jury, McCulloch may have overwhelmed them and led them to the wrong conclusion. In the process, he's opened himself to charges that he was acting to protect Wilson.

Opinion: Why I feel torn about the Ferguson verdict

Consider McCulloch's time frame for the grand jury, which The New York Times described as ""prolonged and exhaustive."" Grand juries routinely return criminal indictments in a matter of days. But the Ferguson proceedings dragged on for months, putting a burden on the jurors to recall everything and then decide wisely. Another red flag was that this lengthy process was riddled with leaks, all of which supported Wilson's account of the events.

Worse, McCulloch declined to recommend charges to the grand jury. Prosecutors normally walk a jury through the charges they are seeking, breaking them down and explaining why they are deserved. McCulloch instead left the Ferguson grand jury to sort through terms such as ""voluntary manslaughter"" and ""involuntary manslaughter in the second degree"" on their own -- making it more likely that they would not seek an indictment.

In fact, McCulloch could have brought charges directly against Wilson, circumventing the grand jury. He chose not to do so, which is a troubling indicator of his interest in aggressively prosecuting this case.

Opinion: Ferguson shows failure at every level

Sure, there are conflicting accounts of what transpired between Wilson and Michael Brown. Was Wilson in fear for his life, as he told investigators, when he and Brown struggled for his gun? Did Brown have his hands up when he was fatally shot? We will never know, because there will be no trial. That's a tragedy for the Brown family and an affront to the fundamental American value that we all are equal under the law.

The grand jury's decision has implications far beyond Ferguson. Gallup polling has found that African-Americans have less confidence in the criminal justice system than white Americans, while a W.W. Kellogg Foundation report found that 68% of Latinos report being worried about police brutality. Wilson walking free will likely reinforce the views among communities of color that our justice system is unfair. And when significant segments of our population lose faith in our justice system, our democracy is weakened.

The Ferguson decision reflects poorly on prosecutor McCulloch. His flawed grand jury proceedings ensured that justice was not served for Michael Brown.

I walked out of my hotel one morning to a leaflet drop , which demanded higher salaries and an end to corporate favors from government . I saw some street art featuring three patron saints : Jesus , tango singer Carlos Gardel and Che Guevara , a native son whose image is all over the capital .

I found a similar culture of protest in my last visit to the country 11 years earlier , including widespread opposition to the war in Iraq .

The government of President Cristina Fernández Kirchner announced last week that 800,000 poor workers making less than 35,000 pesos a year ( roughly $ 4,100 ) would receive an exemption from income taxes , which labor leaders alternately praised and denounced as a pittance of what was needed to protect vulnerable citizens .

But behind the headlines , back in August I saw a prominent town square in Jalisco state completely occupied by protesters , who had erected a tent city in opposition to what they called the despotism of the local government . The police had seemingly given up trying to dislodge it . The protesters held a dance party one night , handing out food and literature to the revelers .
We used to have this same belief in America , that street action mattered and needed to be nurtured .

Bobrush, Sun-Times Staff, Jake Wittich, Sam Kelly, Joe Cowley, John Silver","Every few years , America catches a nasty “ cold ” that afflicts untold damage on its communities and citizenry . These colds aren ’ t always pathological , and they manifest in different forms , but the carnage they wreak on our nation ’ s most vulnerable is always staggering .
In 2005 , this cold took the form of one of the costliest hurricanes on record , slamming into Louisiana and Texas and leaving $ 125 billion in damage in its wake . A few years later , we suffered as a nation from the Great Recession , which was brought on by the collapse of the housing market and further decimated the already waning middle class . And in the latter part of the 2010s , we have lived through a scourge of mass shootings that have left virtually no part of the country untouched .
These colds have impacted all Americans , but it is always the most vulnerable who fair the worst by far , particularly when it comes to the black community . Hurricane Katrina devastated a region , but effectively obliterated the black middle class there ; the Great Recession damaged the entire economy , but , by all accounts , was particularly disastrous for black Americans and further widened the already vast racial wealth gap ; and although America is rightfully fixated by the mass shootings that happen at our schools , churches , and concert venues around the country , there have been 36 mass shootings in my district — which is a majority-minority district — since 2013 alone .
Over the history of our country , we have weathered a number of these sorts of colds , but in every case , it is clear that when America catches a cold , the black community has caught pneumonia . This time , however , there is an actual virus that is ravaging our nation . Specifically , a severe acute respiratory syndrome brought on by a novel coronavirus , and it has proven to be particularly deadly for the African American community .
As of April 4 , out of the 86 recorded deaths from COVID-19 in Chicago , 61 were black residents . Less than 30 percent of Chicago ’ s population is black , and yet this population makes up a full 70 percent of those who have succumbed to this disease . Looking at Cook County as a whole , we are seeing strikingly similar trends . African Americans , who make up only 23 percent of Cook County ’ s population , represent 58 percent of the county ’ s COVID-19 deaths .
Tragically , these terrible trends are not unique to Chicago . In Milwaukee County , Wisconsin , African Americans make up about half of the county ’ s 945 confirmed cases but account for 81 percent of the deaths . In Michigan , which is only 14 percent black , African Americans accounted for 35 percent of the cases and 40 percent of the COVID-19 related deaths .
While these statistics are shocking , they are not a coincidence , and as I have outlined , this situation is , unfortunately , all too predictable . According to an article published in ProPublica last week , “ Environmental , economic and political factors have compounded for generations , putting black people at higher risk of chronic conditions that leave lungs weak and immune systems vulnerable : asthma , heart disease , hypertension and diabetes. ” Furthermore , African Americans are more likely to have jobs that have been deemed “ essential ” — including those in industries such as health care , transportation , government , and food supply — making it impossible for them to stay home .
What ’ s equally alarming is the gross amount of misinformation that very well might have led an already vulnerable population to not take this pandemic as seriously as they should have . In the weeks leading up to these staggering deaths , various social media platforms found themselves overrun with an alarming amount of misinformation related to the coronavirus . These falsehoods ranged from fraudulent vaccines and cures for the virus to more outrageous mistruths that claim African Americans are altogether immune to this pathogen .
Although this might make for tempting wishful thinking , the numbers coming out of Chicago , Milwaukee and Detroit tell us that this could not be further from the truth .
In the face of the grim reality that black people will continue to die at disproportionally higher rates than white Americans as a result of COVID-19 , combined with the startling amount of misinformation being thrown at us online , it is imperative that black Americans remain hypervigilant as we weather America ’ s latest cold . We must follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’ s guidance as well as the stay-at-home order issued by Gov . J.B. Pritzker . If you must leave your home , take the necessary precautions and practice social distancing .
On the federal level , I am also calling for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that the data , clinical trials and access to vaccines and treatments include the communities that are the most likely to catch “ pneumonia ” when this is all said and done . When vaccines and treatments do become available , the federal government must prioritize hot spots and medically underserved areas when determining distribution , as these areas will need access to tests and treatments as quickly as possible .
America has weathered some terrible colds in the past , but sadly , it has been , and it will continue to be , the black community that catches the resulting pneumonia . If we are going to break that cycle , we must take this current cold deadly serious , and we must ensure that the needs of the black community as it relates to COVID-19 are taken just as seriously as well .

Over the history of our country, we have weathered a number of these sorts of colds, but in every case, it is clear that when America catches a cold, the black community has caught pneumonia. This time, however, there is an actual virus that is ravaging our nation. Specifically, a severe acute respiratory syndrome brought on by a novel coronavirus, and it has proven to be particularly deadly for the African American community.

As of April 4, out of the 86 recorded deaths from COVID-19 in Chicago, 61 were black residents. Less than 30 percent of Chicago’s population is black, and yet this population makes up a full 70 percent of those who have succumbed to this disease. Looking at Cook County as a whole, we are seeing strikingly similar trends. African Americans, who make up only 23 percent of Cook County’s population, represent 58 percent of the county’s COVID-19 deaths.

Tragically, these terrible trends are not unique to Chicago. In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, African Americans make up about half of the county’s 945 confirmed cases but account for 81 percent of the deaths. In Michigan, which is only 14 percent black, African Americans accounted for 35 percent of the cases and 40 percent of the COVID-19 related deaths.

While these statistics are shocking, they are not a coincidence, and as I have outlined, this situation is, unfortunately, all too predictable. According to an article published in ProPublica last week, “Environmental, economic and political factors have compounded for generations, putting black people at higher risk of chronic conditions that leave lungs weak and immune systems vulnerable: asthma, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes.” Furthermore, African Americans are more likely to have jobs that have been deemed “essential” — including those in industries such as health care, transportation, government, and food supply — making it impossible for them to stay home.

What’s equally alarming is the gross amount of misinformation that very well might have led an already vulnerable population to not take this pandemic as seriously as they should have. In the weeks leading up to these staggering deaths, various social media platforms found themselves overrun with an alarming amount of misinformation related to the coronavirus. These falsehoods ranged from fraudulent vaccines and cures for the virus to more outrageous mistruths that claim African Americans are altogether immune to this pathogen.

Although this might make for tempting wishful thinking, the numbers coming out of Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit tell us that this could not be further from the truth.

In the face of the grim reality that black people will continue to die at disproportionally higher rates than white Americans as a result of COVID-19, combined with the startling amount of misinformation being thrown at us online, it is imperative that black Americans remain hypervigilant as we weather America’s latest cold. We must follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance as well as the stay-at-home order issued by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. If you must leave your home, take the necessary precautions and practice social distancing.

On the federal level, I am also calling for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that the data, clinical trials and access to vaccines and treatments include the communities that are the most likely to catch “pneumonia” when this is all said and done. When vaccines and treatments do become available, the federal government must prioritize hot spots and medically underserved areas when determining distribution, as these areas will need access to tests and treatments as quickly as possible.

America has weathered some terrible colds in the past, but sadly, it has been, and it will continue to be, the black community that catches the resulting pneumonia. If we are going to break that cycle, we must take this current cold deadly serious, and we must ensure that the needs of the black community as it relates to COVID-19 are taken just as seriously as well.

What we know

Since June 21st, there have been at least four mysterious fires at black churches in the South — three of which were likely deliberate. In three cases, law enforcement officers have said that there's evidence that the fire was deliberately set. In one other case, investigators have been unable to determine whether the fire was intentional or not.

Many media reports have referred to fires at ""seven churches."" But those include two churches that were struck by lightning (one of which was a white church), and another church where the cause of the fire was likely an electrical failure.

Here's what we know about the cases, based on reporting from the Los Angeles Times's Matt Pearce,CNN's Ben Brumfield and Sam Stringer, the Associated Press's Bruce Smith and Meg Kinnard, and local media:

Why many are concerned

Attacks on black churches have been a frequent form of anti-black terrorism in America: The black church has been a symbol and a gathering place for black America, and that's made it an appealing target for white supremacist terrorists.

civil_rights,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/19/us/king-speeches-never-heard/index.html?hpt=hp_c2,The greatest MLK speeches you never heard,2014-01-19,John Blake,"Can you name any of his great speeches or written works without citing `` I Have a Dream `` or the `` Letter from Birmingham Jail '' ?
Most Americans would likely flub this quiz . King may be a national hero whose birthday the country commemorates on Monday , but to many he remains a one-dimensional hero -- the vast body of his work unknown . Though he wrote five books and delivered up to 450 speeches a year , he 's defined by one speech and one letter .
What then are the great works by King that never get the attention they deserve ?
That 's the question CNN put to some members of King 's inner circle as well as top King scholars . We asked them to pick their favorite overlooked gems from King , any extraordinary spoken or written words people do n't typically hear during King commemorations .
Six entries made our final cut : three sermons and speeches , King 's most radical book , an astonishing letter he wrote as a college student , and a `` eulogy '' he delivered for a friend that revealed a side of him the public rarely saw .
Sermon delivered at Riverside Church in New York on April 4 , 1967 .
Why it 's important : This was King 's most : This was King 's most controversial speech . Even some members of his own staff warned him not to give it . With this sermon , King decisively came out against the Vietnam War at a time when many Americans still supported it . People were furious . President Lyndon Johnson stopped talking to him . Civil rights leaders criticized him , and major newspapers told him to stick to civil rights . Yet King put principle over personal popularity and continued to oppose the war . One year later to the day he gave this speech , King was assassinated in Memphis , Tennessee .
What he said : Money that should have been spent on Johnson 's War on Poverty was being lost in Vietnam 's killing fields . He said , `` A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death . '' The speech distilled King 's belief that racism , economic exploitation and war were all connected as `` triple evils . ''
Signature lines : `` We are taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them 8,000 miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in Southwest Georgia and East Harlem . So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools . ''
What others say : `` It 's Dr. King 's most underappreciated speech , '' says Vorris Nunley , a professor of rhetoric at the University of California , Riverside . `` Former supporters , black as well as white , backed away from this too compassionate , too radical , too political King . ''
Speech delivered on March 25 , 1965 , in Montgomery , Alabama , at the end of the Selma-to-Montgomery march .
Why it 's important : It is one of King 's most : It is one of King 's most electrifying speeches . When the roaring crowd joins King in shouting `` Glory hallelujah ! '' at the end of the speech , the march becomes a church revival . The speech was the culmination of one of the movement 's most brutal but critical campaigns . Three civil rights activists were killed and other marchers were beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge . King gave his defiant speech while standing on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery , a city known as the `` Cradle of the Confederacy . '' This was the high-water mark of the civil rights movement . The Selma campaign would spark the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act .
What he said : King praised the white clergy and laypeople of various faiths who traveled to Selma to face danger with African-American protesters . He said that segregation was `` on its deathbed '' and the movement must now be prepared to `` march on poverty . ''
Signature lines : `` They told us we would n't get here . And there were those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies , but all the world today knows that we are here and that we are standing before the forces of power in the state of Alabama saying , 'We ai n't going to let nobody turn us around . '
`` I come to say to you this afternoon , however difficult the moment , however frustrating the hour , it will not be long , because 'truth crushed to earth will rise again . ' How long ? Not long , because 'no lie can live forever . ' ... How long ? Not long , because the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice . ''
What others say : The speech marked the triumphant end of the first phase of the civil rights movement -- seeking legal and political rights -- and the beginning of a new phase focused on economic inequality , says Jerald Podair , a history professor at Lawrence University in Appleton , Wisconsin .
`` We see King at a moment of triumph , '' Podair says . `` He is on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol , near the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church from which he launched the Montgomery bus boycott , as ( Alabama ) Gov . George Wallace cowers in his office with blinds drawn . But he also has miles to go . America is still an economically and socially divided nation .
Sermon delivered at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on July 4 , 1965 .
Why it 's important : We 've heard about King 's dream . But just two years later he told an audience that his dream had turned into a nightmare . King 's We 've heard about King 's dream . But just two years later he told an audience that his dream had turned into a nightmare . King 's sermon addresses questions that could have been snatched from today 's headlines : What is a living wage for workers in menial jobs ? Is income inequality as corrosive as racial injustice ? What are the challenges of preserving a multicultural democracy ?
What he said : King said that class divisions within the United States `` can be as vicious and evil as a system based on racial injustice . '' King also talked about the dignity of all work , saying that even menial workers should make enough `` so they can live and educate their children and buy a home and have the basic necessities of life . ''
Signature lines : `` About two years ago now , I stood with many of you who stood there in person and all of you who were there in spirit before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington . As I came to the end of my speech there , I tried to tell the nation about a dream I had . I must confess to you this morning that since that sweltering August afternoon in 1963 , my dream has often turned into a nightmare .
I must confess to you this morning that ... my dream has often turned into a nightmare The Rev . Martin Luther King Jr .
`` I 've seen my dream shattered as I 've walked the streets of Chicago and see Negroes , young men and women , with a sense of utter hopelessness because they ca n't find any jobs . ... I 've seen my dream shattered as I 've been through Appalachia , and I 've seen my white brothers along with Negroes living in poverty . And I 'm concerned about white poverty as much as I 'm concerned about Negro poverty . ''
`` King asks : How are you going to have a multiracial democracy if inequality makes life is so harsh and competitive at the bottom , where society is most multiracial and multinational ? ''
Why it 's important : `` Every hero becomes a bore at last . '' That quote from the 19th century writer Ralph Waldo Emerson could have applied to King . With the rise of the Black Power movement , King seemed dull and obsolete to many youths in the late 1960s who preferred the fire of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers . King dressed like an undertaker and carefully measured each word in public . But King 's `` mock eulogy '' reveals that in private King had a wicked sense of humor . He was a man who nicknamed one of his top aides , `` Lil ' Nigger , '' drank Harveys Bristol Cream sherry and smoked in private , and liked `` playing the dozens , '' an African-American tradition of friends good-naturedly trading insults .
What he said : The moment is grim . King is holding a meeting of top staffers in 1963 just before they initiate a campaign in Birmingham . He warns them that some may not return alive . Then he breaks the tension by assuring them he would preach a marvelous tribute for anyone who does n't make it . He proceeds by delivering an The moment is grim . King is holding a meeting of top staffers in 1963 just before they initiate a campaign in Birmingham . He warns them that some may not return alive . Then he breaks the tension by assuring them he would preach a marvelous tribute for anyone who does n't make it . He proceeds by delivering an over-the-top eulogy for one of his aides at the meeting , Andrew Young , who was often dispatched to negotiate with white leaders because of his nonthreatening demeanor .
Signature lines : `` Andy , when the Klan finally gets you , here 's what I 'll preach : 'Lord , white folks made a big mistake today .

Most Americans would likely flub this quiz. King may be a national hero whose birthday the country commemorates on Monday, but to many he remains a one-dimensional hero -- the vast body of his work unknown. Though he wrote five books and delivered up to 450 speeches a year, he's defined by one speech and one letter.

What then are the great works by King that never get the attention they deserve?

That's the question CNN put to some members of King's inner circle as well as top King scholars. We asked them to pick their favorite overlooked gems from King, any extraordinary spoken or written words people don't typically hear during King commemorations.

Six entries made our final cut: three sermons and speeches, King's most radical book, an astonishing letter he wrote as a college student, and a ""eulogy"" he delivered for a friend that revealed a side of him the public rarely saw.

'A Time to Break the Silence'

Sermon delivered at Riverside Church in New York on April 4, 1967.

Why it's important: This was King's most : This was King's most controversial speech . Even some members of his own staff warned him not to give it. With this sermon, King decisively came out against the Vietnam War at a time when many Americans still supported it. People were furious. President Lyndon Johnson stopped talking to him. Civil rights leaders criticized him, and major newspapers told him to stick to civil rights. Yet King put principle over personal popularity and continued to oppose the war. One year later to the day he gave this speech, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee.

What he said: Money that should have been spent on Johnson's War on Poverty was being lost in Vietnam's killing fields. He said, ""A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death."" The speech distilled King's belief that racism, economic exploitation and war were all connected as ""triple evils.""

Signature lines: ""We are taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them 8,000 miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in Southwest Georgia and East Harlem. So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools.""

What others say: ""It's Dr. King's most underappreciated speech,"" says Vorris Nunley, a professor of rhetoric at the University of California, Riverside. ""Former supporters, black as well as white, backed away from this too compassionate, too radical, too political King.""

'Our God is Marching On!'

Speech delivered on March 25, 1965, in Montgomery, Alabama, at the end of the Selma-to-Montgomery march.

Why it's important: It is one of King's most : It is one of King's most electrifying speeches . When the roaring crowd joins King in shouting ""Glory hallelujah!"" at the end of the speech, the march becomes a church revival. The speech was the culmination of one of the movement's most brutal but critical campaigns. Three civil rights activists were killed and other marchers were beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. King gave his defiant speech while standing on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, a city known as the ""Cradle of the Confederacy."" This was the high-water mark of the civil rights movement. The Selma campaign would spark the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

What he said: King praised the white clergy and laypeople of various faiths who traveled to Selma to face danger with African-American protesters. He said that segregation was ""on its deathbed"" and the movement must now be prepared to ""march on poverty.""

Signature lines: ""They told us we wouldn't get here. And there were those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies, but all the world today knows that we are here and that we are standing before the forces of power in the state of Alabama saying, 'We ain't going to let nobody turn us around.'

""I come to say to you this afternoon, however difficult the moment, however frustrating the hour, it will not be long, because 'truth crushed to earth will rise again.' How long? Not long, because 'no lie can live forever.' ... How long? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.""

What others say: The speech marked the triumphant end of the first phase of the civil rights movement -- seeking legal and political rights -- and the beginning of a new phase focused on economic inequality, says Jerald Podair, a history professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin.

""We see King at a moment of triumph,"" Podair says. ""He is on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol, near the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church from which he launched the Montgomery bus boycott, as (Alabama) Gov. George Wallace cowers in his office with blinds drawn. But he also has miles to go. America is still an economically and socially divided nation.

'The American Dream'

Sermon delivered at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on July 4, 1965.

Why it's important: We've heard about King's dream. But just two years later he told an audience that his dream had turned into a nightmare. King's We've heard about King's dream. But just two years later he told an audience that his dream had turned into a nightmare. King's sermon addresses questions that could have been snatched from today's headlines: What is a living wage for workers in menial jobs? Is income inequality as corrosive as racial injustice? What are the challenges of preserving a multicultural democracy?

What he said: King said that class divisions within the United States ""can be as vicious and evil as a system based on racial injustice."" King also talked about the dignity of all work, saying that even menial workers should make enough ""so they can live and educate their children and buy a home and have the basic necessities of life.""

Signature lines: ""About two years ago now, I stood with many of you who stood there in person and all of you who were there in spirit before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. As I came to the end of my speech there, I tried to tell the nation about a dream I had. I must confess to you this morning that since that sweltering August afternoon in 1963, my dream has often turned into a nightmare.

I must confess to you this morning that ... my dream has often turned into a nightmare The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

""I've seen my dream shattered as I've walked the streets of Chicago and see Negroes, young men and women, with a sense of utter hopelessness because they can't find any jobs. ... I've seen my dream shattered as I've been through Appalachia, and I've seen my white brothers along with Negroes living in poverty. And I'm concerned about white poverty as much as I'm concerned about Negro poverty.""

""King asks: How are you going to have a multiracial democracy if inequality makes life is so harsh and competitive at the bottom, where society is most multiracial and multinational?""

'Mock eulogy'

Delivered just before the 1963 campaign in Birmingham, Alabama.

Why it's important: ""Every hero becomes a bore at last."" That quote from the 19th century writer Ralph Waldo Emerson could have applied to King. With the rise of the Black Power movement, King seemed dull and obsolete to many youths in the late 1960s who preferred the fire of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers. King dressed like an undertaker and carefully measured each word in public. But King's ""mock eulogy"" reveals that in private King had a wicked sense of humor. He was a man who nicknamed one of his top aides, ""Lil' Nigger,"" drank Harveys Bristol Cream sherry and smoked in private, and liked ""playing the dozens,"" an African-American tradition of friends good-naturedly trading insults.

What he said: The moment is grim. King is holding a meeting of top staffers in 1963 just before they initiate a campaign in Birmingham. He warns them that some may not return alive. Then he breaks the tension by assuring them he would preach a marvelous tribute for anyone who doesn't make it. He proceeds by delivering an The moment is grim. King is holding a meeting of top staffers in 1963 just before they initiate a campaign in Birmingham. He warns them that some may not return alive. Then he breaks the tension by assuring them he would preach a marvelous tribute for anyone who doesn't make it. He proceeds by delivering an over-the-top eulogy for one of his aides at the meeting, Andrew Young, who was often dispatched to negotiate with white leaders because of his nonthreatening demeanor.

Signature lines: ""Andy, when the Klan finally gets you, here's what I'll preach: 'Lord, white folks made a big mistake today. They have sent home to glory your faithful servant, Andrew Young. Lord, have mercy on the white folks who did this terrible deed. They killed the wrong Negro. In Andrew Young, white folk had a friend so faithful, so enduring, they should never have harmed a hair on his head. Of all my associates, no one loved white folks as much as Andy.' ""

What others say: ""King lived under the tremendous burden of people's expectations,"" says Jonathan Rieder, a sociology professor at Barnard College in New York who includes King's mock eulogy and other examples of his ""backstage"" personality in his book, : ""King lived under the tremendous burden of people's expectations,"" says Jonathan Rieder, a sociology professor at Barnard College in New York who includes King's mock eulogy and other examples of his ""backstage"" personality in his book, ""The Word of the Lord is Upon Me: The Righteous Performance of Martin Luther King, Jr.""

I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

""By temperament, he had a tremendous sense of refinement and dignity,"" Rieder says. ""The burden of dignity was always being proper because he was leading people. So this was a special moment with his preacher buddies when he could cut loose and renew his spirit to go on.""

Letter to Coretta

Written on July 18, 1952, to his future wife, Coretta Scott, in which King revealed some surprising thoughts on capitalism and communism.

Why it's important: There's a theory that King adopted more radical economic theories in the last three years of his life. But King's : There's a theory that King adopted more radical economic theories in the last three years of his life.

What others say: ""King steered toward socialism early on,"" says Michael G. Long, author of ""Christian Peace and Nonviolence: A Documentary History.""

""He's speaking about the need for the demise of capitalism, the need to nationalize industries. Early on he has this dream that equality won't happen in America until there's a radical redistribution of wealth.""

'Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community'

King's fifth book was published in 1967

Why it's important: This is King's last -- and most This is King's last -- and most radical -- book . By 1967, he was organizing a ""Poor People's Campaign,"" a plan to dispatch an interracial army of poor people to occupy Washington and force the U.S. government to address poverty.

Every mass movement in America, the philosopher Eric Hoffer once wrote, becomes a racket in the end.

And he hadn’t even witnessed the full course of the civil rights movement. If the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington is a time for taking stock, the score is clear. The Dream was a glorious triumph, changing America forever and making it more just. The contemporary civil rights movement, partly as a consequence, is an intellectually exhausted disgrace.

Story Continued Below

It is the victim of its own success. No longer confronted by a system of American apartheid and incapable of simply saying, “We won,” it subsists largely on imagined slights and manufactured controversies unrelated to the welfare of real people.

Somewhere along the line, the movement took on all the moral majesty of an effort to extort contributions from corporations, a favorite tactic of Jesse Jackson. The Congressional Black Caucus, for its part, is a sponge for business money, making it “a fund-raising juggernaut,” in the words of a New York Times report.

The difference between the movement now and then is the difference between confronting grave injustices and coming up with excuses for your latest press release; the difference between connecting to the nation’s profoundest ideals and reflexively agitating for more government activism; the difference between a calling and a career.

As Roger Clegg of the Center for Equal Opportunity notes, from Martin Luther King Jr. to Al Sharpton is the personification of the Karl Marx line that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. Great challenges call for great men; frivolous times call for late-afternoon cable TV hosts who are fodder for “Saturday Night Live” parodies.

King did his work under clear and present physical threat. In Montgomery, Ala., in 1957, he had a bad feeling one night while staying at the parsonage in his Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and insisted on leaving. A few hours later, a bomb exploded outside on the street corner.

He gave his famous Mountaintop speech in 1968, the night before his assassination after flying from Atlanta to Memphis on a plane delayed because of a bomb threat.

He operated under the ever-watchful eye of an FBI that managed to flagrantly violate civil liberties before the advent of the National Security Agency surveillance program. In 1964, it sent King a “suicide letter” evidently intended to compel him to end his own life.

King had a well-developed moral philosophy, based on a profound engagement with the biblical prophets and Reinhold Niebuhr. He believed that “unearned suffering is redemptive” and rejected a facile optimism that comes so easily to Americans, as he wrote: “Instead of assured progress in wisdom and decency, man faces the ever present possibility of swift relapse not merely to animalism but into such calculated cruelty as no other animal can practice.”

He wasn’t merely glib, but truly eloquent, a practiced Baptist preacher who wedded the cadences of the Bible to the nation’s founding ideals under the unbearable pressure of historic events.

Then there’s Sharpton, whose career is a long catalog of the ridiculous and outrageous in pursuit of newspaper clips and cable TV appearances.

Sharpton is a Christian minister who refuses to this day to apologize to the man he defamed by falsely accusing him of raping a woman. He is the peacemaker who in the midst of anti-Jewish riots issued the inspiring call, “If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house.” He is the paragon of civil rights who denounced a Jewish businessman in Harlem as a “white interloper.”

If there were genuinely something consequential at stake, as in the fight against segregation of the mid-20th century, it would be a disaster for the country that Al Sharpton is so prominent.

But that fight is won, no matter how loath King’s self-appointed heirs are to admit it. At his speech at the Mall, Sharpton said Jim Crow has been vanquished, but now the struggle must go on against James Crow Jr., ESQ. The old Jim Crow knocked down protesters with high-pressure fire hoses; the new Jim Crow asks everyone to bring a photo ID when they vote. The apple has fallen very far from the tree.

In his own speech, President Barack Obama tried to reach rhetorical liftoff at the end by citing people serving the community or otherwise demonstrating kindness or regard for others and declaimed that they “are marching,” just like those marchers in 1963. This is a strained metaphor in the service of a deep misunderstanding. These people aren’t marching; they are living admirable lives in a society where the civil rights marches of yore are no longer necessary. Surely that’s the point.

What the contemporary civil rights establishment can’t bring itself to acknowledge is that cultural breakdown has more to do with the struggles of blacks than any officially sanctioned discrimination. To his credit, Obama says as much at times. It is one of the reasons that Jesse Jackson in 2008 thought he was “talking down to people,” and mused on an open mic about performing an anatomically sensitive operation on the presidential candidate.

But the left doesn’t want to hear it.

In an interview this week with NPR , President Obama asserted that the country is less racially divided than when he took office :
`` It 's understandable the polls might say , you know , that race relations have gotten worse — because when it 's in the news and you see something like Ferguson or the Garner case in New York , then it attracts attention . But I — I assure you , from the perspective of African-Americans or Latinos in poor communities who have been dealing with this all their lives , they would n't suggest somehow that it 's worse now than it was 10 , 15 or 20 years ago . ''
Morning Edition asked Roxane Gay , an author who focuses on race , gender and identity , what she thought of the president 's comments . She agreed that the country is n't more racially divided and that Americans are being forced to confront a difficult reality .
`` We 've been able to look away in the past , and we can no longer look away . We 're just seeing just how deep the racial divide is , and it 's uncomfortable to look at . ''
`` We 've been able to look away in the past , and we can no longer look away , '' says Gay . `` We 're just seeing just how deep the racial divide is , and it 's uncomfortable to look at . ''
When Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson , Mo. , Gay says , initially she was surprised by the outpouring of anger , since the incident was not a first . Looking back , she understands the reaction .
`` It was the tipping point that we needed , '' says Gay . `` People are starting to see that these systems only work for some of us , and they work against the rest of us — those of us with brown or black skin . ''
Gay says that rage is a reaction that is justified right now , but , she says , `` There 's always going to be a quiet after the storm , and that 's where the real change is going to happen . ''
Roxane Gay gave NPR a rundown of some of the most-talked-about stories of the year concerning race and gender .
I feel dispirited , but I think that to give up is a luxury , and I refuse to give in to that . I 'm going to try and remain hopeful that we can create actual change , that these conversations can become more productive than just saying what we think and feel , and we can figure out how to create political change , which is what 's going to be required for a lot of these issues to be addressed . So I 'm disheartened but I remain optimistic that our need for change will overcome our weariness .
You can see people who are online commenting on these matters , and they refer to black people as animals . So it 's a very real thing — this idea that humanity is not extended to all of us .
I do think that this was ... a year of reckoning where people are saying `` enough is enough '' ; the wealthy and the powerful can no longer use the rest of us as their playthings . And with Bill Cosby , the rumors have followed him for years — at least 15 to 20 years , if not longer . And I think it just reached a point where there were so many accusations that we had to say , `` We can not value Cliff Huxtable more than we can value the testimony of these women . ''
On Elliot Rodger and the University of California , Santa Barbara , killings
I thought what Elliot Rodger did was absolutely devastating and very indicative of the gender rift in this country that ... some men feel that women owe them attention , affection , love , sex . And when they are not given what they are owed , there are consequences .
It 's disheartening that people think that Donald Sterling [ former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers ] is the outlier and that he 's the exception and not the rule . That people are so stunned , it makes me think that perhaps people do n't have diverse social circles or professional circles where they are around people of color who might be frank with them about what it 's like to be a person of color in America . But at the same time it 's good that people can still be shocked by the kind of racism that Donald Sterling demonstrated . It 's good that people can look at that and say this is a problem .","Roxane Gay: 2014 Was The Year Of 'Enough Is Enough'

""We've been able to look away in the past, and we can no longer look away. We're just seeing just how deep the racial divide is, and it's uncomfortable to look at.""

""We've been able to look away in the past, and we can no longer look away,"" says Gay. ""We're just seeing just how deep the racial divide is, and it's uncomfortable to look at.""

When Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo., Gay says, initially she was surprised by the outpouring of anger, since the incident was not a first. Looking back, she understands the reaction.

""It was the tipping point that we needed,"" says Gay. ""People are starting to see that these systems only work for some of us, and they work against the rest of us — those of us with brown or black skin.""

Gay says that rage is a reaction that is justified right now, but, she says, ""There's always going to be a quiet after the storm, and that's where the real change is going to happen.""

Roxane Gay gave NPR a rundown of some of the most-talked-about stories of the year concerning race and gender.

Interview Highlights

On 2014 as a whole

I feel dispirited, but I think that to give up is a luxury, and I refuse to give in to that. I'm going to try and remain hopeful that we can create actual change, that these conversations can become more productive than just saying what we think and feel, and we can figure out how to create political change, which is what's going to be required for a lot of these issues to be addressed. So I'm disheartened but I remain optimistic that our need for change will overcome our weariness.

On the tone of public debate about race

You can see people who are online commenting on these matters, and they refer to black people as animals. So it's a very real thing — this idea that humanity is not extended to all of us.

On Bill Cosby

I do think that this was ... a year of reckoning where people are saying ""enough is enough""; the wealthy and the powerful can no longer use the rest of us as their playthings. And with Bill Cosby, the rumors have followed him for years — at least 15 to 20 years, if not longer. And I think it just reached a point where there were so many accusations that we had to say, ""We cannot value Cliff Huxtable more than we can value the testimony of these women.""

On Elliot Rodger and the University of California, Santa Barbara, killings

I thought what Elliot Rodger did was absolutely devastating and very indicative of the gender rift in this country that ... some men feel that women owe them attention, affection, love, sex. And when they are not given what they are owed, there are consequences.

On people being surprised that racism still exists

It's disheartening that people think that Donald Sterling [former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers] is the outlier and that he's the exception and not the rule. That people are so stunned, it makes me think that perhaps people don't have diverse social circles or professional circles where they are around people of color who might be frank with them about what it's like to be a person of color in America. But at the same time it's good that people can still be shocked by the kind of racism that Donald Sterling demonstrated. It's good that people can look at that and say this is a problem.",www.npr.org,center,hkXdd3ak2pO5zMsc

We don’t have to agree on questions of sexual morality. But what we should be able to agree on is our freedom, to live out our most important ideals.

Jack Phillips (Photo: Matthew Staver for USA TODAY)

What I didn’t say was that I wouldn’t sell them a cake.

I’m happy to sell a cake to anyone, whatever his or her sexual identity. People should be free to make their own moral choices. I don’t have to agree with them.

But I am responsible for my own choices. And it was that responsibility that led me to decline when two gentlemen came into my shop and invited me to create a wedding cake for their same-sex ceremony.

OUR VIEW: Baker's case is not about the First Amendment

Designing a wedding cake is a very different thing from, say, baking a brownie. When people commission such a cake, they’re requesting something that’s designed to express something about the event and about the couple.

More: President Trump is constitutionally right on the CFPB even if we oppose him otherwise

What I design is not just a tower of flour and sugar, but a message tailored to a specific couple and a specific event — a message telling all who see it that this event is a wedding and that it is an occasion for celebration.

In this case, I couldn’t. What a cake celebrating this event would communicate was a message that contradicts my deepest religious convictions, and as an artist, that’s just not something I’m able to do, so I politely declined.

But this wasn’t just a business decision. More than anything else, it was a reflection of my commitment to my faith. My religious convictions on this are grounded in the biblical teaching that God designed marriage as the union of one man and one woman.

Obviously, not everyone shares those convictions. I don’t expect them to. Each of us makes our own choices; each of us decides how closely we will hold to, defend and live out those choices.

The two men who came into my shop that day were living out their beliefs. All I did was attempt to live out mine. I respect their right to choose and hoped they would respect mine.

They did not. And, considering all of the hate mail, obscene calls and death threats my family has received since I was sued, a lot of other people don’t see tolerance as a two-way street, either.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

But the Constitution does. The First Amendment defends my right to create custom cake art that is consistent with my faith, while declining requests that ask me to celebrate events or messages that conflict with my faith. As a cake artist, I can live out my faith in my day-to-day life, and make that faith the basis for my creative decisions.

We live in a big, diverse nation. We don’t all have to agree on religion. We don’t have to agree on questions of sexual morality. We don’t even have to agree on the meaning of marriage.

What we should be able to agree on is our mutual freedom, as Americans, to live out the ideals that are most important to us.

Just as I shouldn’t be able to use the law to force others to design something that promotes my beliefs, others shouldn’t be able to force me to design a cake that celebrates theirs.

That, for me and those at Alliance Defending Freedom who are defending me, is what this case is about. I hope the U.S. Supreme Court affirms that basic freedom.

And if those who oppose me would grant me a certain measure of respect — not as someone they agree with, but as a fellow citizen free to stand by my own moral choices, well … that would be icing on the cake.

We Must Fight Harder Than Ever To Protect Our Civil Liberties.,2019-10-05,"Katherine Mangu-Ward, Eugene Volokh, Shikha Dalmia, J.D. Tuccille, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Baylen Linnekin, Nick Gillespie, Eric Boehm","Once upon a time , privacy was everyone 's default setting . Imagine an era when most letters and ledgers existed only in a single hard copy , when long-distance communication was slow and unreliable , when unpickable locks existed and cameras did n't .
These are the conditions under which America 's founding documents were written . It was far from a golden age , but there were undeniable upsides to a government that had neither the technology nor the resources to know what most people were up to most of the time .
Those days are done . Privacy is dead . We have killed it , you and I .
It happened slowly and then all at once , much like falling in love . We traded away some of our privacy for convenience , with credit cards and GPS and cloud computing and toll transponders . Some of it was taken from us while we were n't paying attention , via warrantless wiretaps and IRS reporting requirements and airport searches .
I applaud the valor of those who are fighting the rearguard action on privacy , making it their business to blow up bridges and burn crops as the rest of us beat a retreat . There are still many good opportunities to slow the rate at which the state gobbles up all privately held information about our purchases and daily routines and inboxes .
I used to think there might be some way to erect a legal bulwark between the ravenous state and the vast troves of private data .

Imagine an era when most letters and ledgers existed only in a single hard copy, when long-distance communication was slow and unreliable, when unpickable locks existed and cameras didn't.

These are the conditions under which America's founding documents were written. It was far from a golden age, but there were undeniable upsides to a government that had neither the technology nor the resources to know what most people were up to most of the time.

Those days are done. Privacy is dead. We have killed it, you and I.

It happened slowly and then all at once, much like falling in love. We traded away some of our privacy for convenience, with credit cards and GPS and cloud computing and toll transponders. Some of it was taken from us while we weren't paying attention, via warrantless wiretaps and IRS reporting requirements and airport searches.

I applaud the valor of those who are fighting the rearguard action on privacy, making it their business to blow up bridges and burn crops as the rest of us beat a retreat. There are still many good opportunities to slow the rate at which the state gobbles up all privately held information about our purchases and daily routines and inboxes.

I used to think there might be some way to erect a legal bulwark between the ravenous state and the vast troves of private data. I now think that is a losing battle, primarily thanks to the too-common eagerness of the firms we entrusted with our intimate information to hand it over to law enforcement without even the formality of a warrant.

So we cannot keep our secrets much longer. But there is still hope. A minimal state where civil liberties are expansively interpreted and scrupulously protected offers the best chance to preserve the sphere of individual liberty. It matters much less if the state knows everything about you when it has no cause and no right to act on that information unless a genuinely serious crime has been committed.

A state where civil liberties are robust and jealously guarded has little reason to install a vast surveillance network of its own or to force its way into private networks. There is little it can do with that information. It's a virtuous cycle.

When you look at Smart ’ s visceral reaction courtside , at him yelling at Orr about being called the N-word as he was being pulled away by his teammates , it is clear that Smart believes he heard the N-word , and reacted accordingly .
Is it really a stretch to believe that a middle-aged white man who taunts a kid by calling him a piece of crap used the N-word ? Not to me .
This is especially ironic given the reports that also surfaced this weekend about Italian soccer player Mario Balotelli , who was filmed in tears on his team ’ s bench , after Italian fans apparently taunted him with racial slurs during the entirety of his soccer match . Though reports have yet to confirm whether his tears were related to being subbed out of the game or the slurs , most fans who tweeted about the incident in the immediate aftermath connected his emotion to many slurs being hurled at him . Apparently , this is a regular occurrence .
What seems not so apparent to the folks who made Marcus Smart trot out and “ take full responsibility for his actions ” is something to which we should all take heed .
Racism hurts . It is painful . The moment that you are called the N-word , even if it happens to you when you are a child as it did with me and you don ’ t know the meaning of the word , you feel instantly degraded , as though you are walking around in shit-stained clothes that you are unable to remove . You feel as though your presence contaminates , as though you are a problem .
The fact that racism hurts is a truth about which many white folks remain purposefully oblivious and which many black folks would rather I not admit . When I wrote last summer about crying after a white woman called me the N-word on a plane , many black people accused me of being weak and having poor self-esteem because I cared what she thought . But part of what it means to exist together as fellow citizens in a body politic is that at base level we recognize and honor each other ’ s humanity . We don ’ t have to like or agree with each other . But we recognize each other as levelly human . Despite the general effectiveness of our 40-plus-year “ Say It Loud , Black and Proud ” campaign , racism still clutches at our insides and twists us into nothingness at least for a moment . The sick and twisted thing about white supremacy is that it makes us care about what white folks think and say about us , even though we know better . A refusal to care can often cost us our lives . Ask Trayvon Martin . Ask Jordan Davis .
In this regard , then , I ’ m actually intrigued by Jeff Orr ’ s rush to apologize and to clarify that he didn ’ t use a slur to refer to Marcus Smart . White folks , too , want their humanity conceded , even after they have actively disrespected someone else . And a credible argument for racism is the one thing that has the potential to erode that . At base level they recognize that racism is dehumanizing , and that if they are racist they are human in all the worst ways . Unfortunately , this has not led to a change in behavior , so much as a stalwart campaign to get racist behaviors branded as anything but . Still , what should be clear to us is that we all desire recognition as human beings and not monsters . The problem is that only one group has the power to force their desires on the rest of us .
Marcus Smart ’ s dignity was assaulted when Jeff Orr called him the N-word , and a “ piece of crap. ” Really , in this context , they are the same thing . A white man reducing a black man who is going about his work to mere waste performs the same kind of labor that the N-word does , whether it was used or not .
Smart reacted by grabbing Orr up by the collar . I can ’ t say I blame him . Yes , I believe in nonviolence as a way of life . But I also remember Malcolm X who said , “ I ’ m non-violent with those who are non-violent with me. ” If we lived in an America that cared about black people , or considering Balotelli , a world that cared about black folks , we would recognize that Smart didn ’ t make a mistake . Jeff Orr is the problem . Folks who think like him are a problem . In the face of blatant assaults on our humanity and personhood , black rage is not the problem .
Beyond Orr ’ s individual act of contrition , though , there is a whole sporting establishment implicated here . American athletics , in basketball and football , depend on young black men for their bread and butter . Yet , these organizations from the NCAA on up feel no responsibility to create contexts free from racial assault in which these players can play . Not only that , but they demand that black folks “ grin and bear it , ” when mistreated . White people are not without power in this situation . What might it have looked like for Marcus Smart ’ s coach to come out not only to testify about Smart being a stand-up guy but also to condemn the grown-ass man who viciously taunted him ? That is what support for the players who make your job possible looks like . That is what it means for white folks to confront racism .
Marcus Smart is the same age as Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis would have been if they had both reached their 19th birthdays this month . These young men , all born at the end of the 20th century , share at least one major sensibility in common . They did not automatically offer deference in the face of white audacity . They met disrespect with disrespect , which in my estimation is the supreme litmus test for whether America deserves its post-racial bona fides .
America keeps on failing . And this failure is a direct result of white folks ’ fervent belief that their “ shit don ’ t stink . ”
In this self-delusional America , George Zimmerman actually almost became a contestant in a celebrity boxing match pitting him against rapper DMX . Thanks to tens of thousands of signatures on petitions late last week , the promoter for the event canceled it . What does it mean that America accepts and loves the spectacle of racialized violence when it is staged for their consumption and entertainment but refuses to concede that violence is a legitimate response to acts of racist humiliation and aggression ?
George Zimmerman is a monster who murders children and terrorizes women . In America , if you ’ re white ( even a white Latino as Zimmerman is ) that apparently gets you celebrity status .
As for DMX , I get his thinking even if I don ’ t agree . Many black folks wanted this match to happen because they wanted to see Zimmerman get pounded . Maybe we could all feel vindicated if we could just see Zimmerman suffer some pain . But Zimmerman is nothing if not a masochist . He gets off on this shit . He needs black America to get down in the muck of self-degradation with him , so he can feel that his basic repulsion toward Trayvon Martin was founded on something real .
Ain ’ t nobody got time for that . Zimmerman will have to reckon with his choices at the hand of his Maker . And despite our great capacity for forgiveness and more than a few bouts at the lynching tree , it turns out that black people ain ’ t Jesus .
If we learned nothing else from Ralph Ellison ’ s `` Invisible Man , '' we should know that black folks never win the Battle Royale .","On Sunday, Marcus Smart, a sophomore basketball player at Oklahoma State University, apologized to Jeff Orr, a fan whom he shoved after Smart heard Orr call him the N-word.

When I wrote last summer about crying after a white woman called me the N-word on a plane, many black people accused me of being weak and having poor self-esteem because I cared what she thought. But part of what it means to exist together as fellow citizens in a body politic is that at base level we recognize and honor each other’s humanity. We don’t have to like or agree with each other. But we recognize each other as levelly human. Despite the general effectiveness of our 40-plus-year “Say It Loud, Black and Proud” campaign, racism still clutches at our insides and twists us into nothingness at least for a moment. The sick and twisted thing about white supremacy is that it makes us care about what white folks think and say about us, even though we know better. A refusal to care can often cost us our lives. Ask Trayvon Martin. Ask Jordan Davis.

In this regard, then, I’m actually intrigued by Jeff Orr’s rush to apologize and to clarify that he didn’t use a slur to refer to Marcus Smart. White folks, too, want their humanity conceded, even after they have actively disrespected someone else. And a credible argument for racism is the one thing that has the potential to erode that. At base level they recognize that racism is dehumanizing, and that if they are racist they are human in all the worst ways. Unfortunately, this has not led to a change in behavior, so much as a stalwart campaign to get racist behaviors branded as anything but. Still, what should be clear to us is that we all desire recognition as human beings and not monsters. The problem is that only one group has the power to force their desires on the rest of us.

Marcus Smart’s dignity was assaulted when Jeff Orr called him the N-word, and a “piece of crap.” Really, in this context, they are the same thing. A white man reducing a black man who is going about his work to mere waste performs the same kind of labor that the N-word does, whether it was used or not.

Smart reacted by grabbing Orr up by the collar. I can’t say I blame him. Yes, I believe in nonviolence as a way of life. But I also remember Malcolm X who said, “I’m non-violent with those who are non-violent with me.” If we lived in an America that cared about black people, or considering Balotelli, a world that cared about black folks, we would recognize that Smart didn’t make a mistake. Jeff Orr is the problem. Folks who think like him are a problem. In the face of blatant assaults on our humanity and personhood, black rage is not the problem.

Beyond Orr’s individual act of contrition, though, there is a whole sporting establishment implicated here. American athletics, in basketball and football, depend on young black men for their bread and butter. Yet, these organizations from the NCAA on up feel no responsibility to create contexts free from racial assault in which these players can play. Not only that, but they demand that black folks “grin and bear it,” when mistreated. White people are not without power in this situation. What might it have looked like for Marcus Smart’s coach to come out not only to testify about Smart being a stand-up guy but also to condemn the grown-ass man who viciously taunted him? That is what support for the players who make your job possible looks like. That is what it means for white folks to confront racism.

Marcus Smart is the same age as Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis would have been if they had both reached their 19th birthdays this month. These young men, all born at the end of the 20th century, share at least one major sensibility in common. They did not automatically offer deference in the face of white audacity. They met disrespect with disrespect, which in my estimation is the supreme litmus test for whether America deserves its post-racial bona fides.

America keeps on failing. And this failure is a direct result of white folks’ fervent belief that their “shit don’t stink.”

In this self-delusional America, George Zimmerman actually almost became a contestant in a celebrity boxing match pitting him against rapper DMX. Thanks to tens of thousands of signatures on petitions late last week, the promoter for the event canceled it. What does it mean that America accepts and loves the spectacle of racialized violence when it is staged for their consumption and entertainment but refuses to concede that violence is a legitimate response to acts of racist humiliation and aggression?

George Zimmerman is a monster who murders children and terrorizes women. In America, if you’re white (even a white Latino as Zimmerman is) that apparently gets you celebrity status.

As for DMX, I get his thinking even if I don’t agree. Many black folks wanted this match to happen because they wanted to see Zimmerman get pounded. Maybe we could all feel vindicated if we could just see Zimmerman suffer some pain. But Zimmerman is nothing if not a masochist. He gets off on this shit. He needs black America to get down in the muck of self-degradation with him, so he can feel that his basic repulsion toward Trayvon Martin was founded on something real.

Ain’t nobody got time for that. Zimmerman will have to reckon with his choices at the hand of his Maker. And despite our great capacity for forgiveness and more than a few bouts at the lynching tree, it turns out that black people ain’t Jesus.

Mike Brown 's family could also file a civil suit against him . VPC
FERGUSON , Mo . — The grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of a teenager will not end Wilson 's legal troubles .
Though the decision is likely the last word from Missouri 's criminal courts , Wilson , whose shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown provoked months of protests , could face civil rights charges brought by the Justice Department or a civil wrongful death lawsuit filed by Brown 's parents . Attorney General Eric Holder says the federal inquiry into incident `` remains ongoing . ''
Wilson could have been charged with first- or second-degree murder or manslaughter . At issue was how Brown died in the shooting Aug. 9 . Police say Brown , who was unarmed , struggled with Wilson inside his police car , then reached for Wilson 's weapon . Brown 's family and some witnesses say Wilson killed Brown as he raised his hands in surrender .
Police officers rarely face indictment for on-the-job shootings . The FBI defines `` justifiable homicide '' by law enforcement as `` killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty . '' In 2011 , police killed 404 people in the line of duty , the FBI 's Uniform Crime Report said . In 2012 , officers killed 410 . In 2013 , the number grew to 461 — the most in two decades .
The FBI data do n't include any information on criminal charges .
The grand jury , which convened Aug. 20 , did not weigh whether Wilson had a justifiable reason to shoot Brown .
`` They did not find probable cause to believe a crime was committed and Darren Wilson committed it , '' said Susan McGraugh , a criminal defense lawyer and a professor at the St. Louis University School of Law . `` They do n't have to explain their reasoning , and they wo n't . They simply have a form and sign something that says 'no true bill . ' ``
`` They are not making a decision on officer Wilson 's guilt , '' said Peter Joy , a criminal defense attorney and law professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law .
Wilson has been on paid leave from the department since the incident . Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told MSNBC that Missouri law would allow Wilson to return to the force if he is cleared of any charges . The Police Department would conduct an internal review of the Brown shooting to see whether Wilson violated any policies .
Brown 's family could sue Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department for excessive force and wrongful death , said James Cohen , a professor at Fordham University Law School .
In a civil trial , Brown 's family could seek monetary damages , as the victim 's family did in the case of football player O.J . Simpson , who was acquitted in a criminal trial of his wife 's murder but ordered by a court in a civil trial to pay millions to her family .

FERGUSON, Mo. — The grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of a teenager will not end Wilson's legal troubles.

Though the decision is likely the last word from Missouri's criminal courts, Wilson, whose shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown provoked months of protests, could face civil rights charges brought by the Justice Department or a civil wrongful death lawsuit filed by Brown's parents. Attorney General Eric Holder says the federal inquiry into incident ""remains ongoing.""

Wilson could have been charged with first- or second-degree murder or manslaughter. At issue was how Brown died in the shooting Aug. 9. Police say Brown, who was unarmed, struggled with Wilson inside his police car, then reached for Wilson's weapon. Brown's family and some witnesses say Wilson killed Brown as he raised his hands in surrender.

Police officers rarely face indictment for on-the-job shootings. The FBI defines ""justifiable homicide"" by law enforcement as ""killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty."" In 2011, police killed 404 people in the line of duty, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report said. In 2012, officers killed 410. In 2013, the number grew to 461 — the most in two decades.

The FBI data don't include any information on criminal charges.

The grand jury, which convened Aug. 20, did not weigh whether Wilson had a justifiable reason to shoot Brown.

""They did not find probable cause to believe a crime was committed and Darren Wilson committed it,"" said Susan McGraugh, a criminal defense lawyer and a professor at the St. Louis University School of Law. ""They don't have to explain their reasoning, and they won't. They simply have a form and sign something that says 'no true bill.' ""

""They are not making a decision on officer Wilson's guilt,"" said Peter Joy, a criminal defense attorney and law professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law.

Wilson has been on paid leave from the department since the incident. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told MSNBC that Missouri law would allow Wilson to return to the force if he is cleared of any charges. The Police Department would conduct an internal review of the Brown shooting to see whether Wilson violated any policies.

Brown's family could sue Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department for excessive force and wrongful death, said James Cohen, a professor at Fordham University Law School.

In a civil trial, Brown's family could seek monetary damages, as the victim's family did in the case of football player O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted in a criminal trial of his wife's murder but ordered by a court in a civil trial to pay millions to her family.

The federal government's probe could have wide-ranging consequences not only for Wilson but also for the entire Police Department.

""Their claims would not just be excessive force, which would be directly associated with the police officer, but failure to adequately train the police officer,"" Cohen said. ""Then, you sort of implicate the whole department and its structure.""

More unlikely, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney could take a crack at Wilson. The grand jury's decision would not preclude a prosecutor from bringing new evidence to another grand jury or bypassing the grand jury entire by filing a criminal complaint, McGraugh said.

Wilson may never escape public infamy, but he won't have a criminal arrest record, McGraugh said. Since St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch did not bring a criminal complaint against Wilson and he was never charged, arraigned or arrested, she said. McCulloch also took the unusual step of presenting both incriminating and exculpatory evidence, she said.

Activists who spurred demonstrations across the country after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown , an unarmed 18-year-old black man in Ferguson , Mo. , now demand a prominent voice in a national conversation about race , challenging the primacy of established civil rights organizations such as Al Sharpton 's National Action Network and the NAACP . While the newer activists may share goals with more experienced groups , they have clashed with them in attempts at joint efforts .
That divide went on public display this month at a march organized by Sharpton in Washington , D.C. , when activist Johnetta Elzie , 25 , and other protesters pushed to the front of the stage and demanded a share of the spotlight .
`` This movement was started by the young people , '' Elzie , of St. Louis , said at the Dec. 13 march . `` We started this . There should be young people all over this stage . This should be young people all up here . ''
It was the second time in the last five months that Ferguson protesters had chastised the old guard . In October , during an interfaith service in St. Louis , young activists interrupted the program by heckling speakers and shouting for a place on stage . Eventually , several clergy members ceded their spots to protesters , who told the crowd that NAACP President Cornell William Brooks was out of touch .
`` This ai n't your grandparents ' civil rights movement , '' rapper and activist Tef Poe said onstage . `` A lot of us are not scholars . We 're not trained organizers . We are not professional activists . We are just real people who identified a problem and decided to do something about it . ''
The tactics employed by Ferguson protesters demonstrate a shift toward more daring actions for civil rights , said William Chafe , a history professor at Duke University who wrote a book on North Carolina 's sit-in movement . Similarly , he said , in the early 20th century , activists moved from polite letter-writing campaigns pleading for an end to segregation to boycotts and civil disobedience .
Rep. John Lewis , D-Ga. , is 74 now , but in 1963 he was 23 , and the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his historic `` I Have a Dream '' speech . Lewis 's moment at the podium was also borne out of conflict with tactics favored by the civil rights establishment .
Young people who longed for bolder action and quicker government response formed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , which received some support and mentorship from older activists in the 1960s , Lewis said . Still , Thurgood Marshall , then the head of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , criticized the group for staging sit-ins at segregated lunch counters that led to arrests and beatings by whites angered at their presence , Lewis recalled . Marshall instead favored litigating for civil rights in the courts .
Lewis , who was the national chairman of SNCC , told Marshall that the movement needed more than a few lawyers arguing before the Supreme Court to change the status of black people in the U.S .
`` We need a mass movement , '' Lewis said he told Marshall at the time . `` And that 's why we continued to go on the freedom rides , that 's why we continued to sit-in , that 's why we continued to march . And I think that 's what is needed today . ''
Lewis said he sees his younger self in the radical protesters who seek to bring attention to the cause with demonstrations that inconvenience people and disrupt everyday life .
`` If you see something that 's not right , that is not fair , that is not just , you have an obligation to speak up , act up and make some noise , and young people must be free to do that , '' Lewis said . `` When I see these young men and young women marching and speaking , I say that 's me when I had all my hair and ( was a ) few pounds lighter . ''
Sharpton criticized the protesters who interrupted the Washington , D.C. , march for taking what he characterized as an `` arrogant approach '' that disrespects the decades of protest work he and civil rights leaders have done .
The differences in approach do n't stem from a generational divide , Sharpton told ███ , noting that his National Action Network includes a youth division . Several teenagers affiliated with his organization went to jail during protests that preceded the death of Michael Brown , he said .
`` In the end , we are all fighting for the same thing , '' Sharpton said . `` I 've gone out of my way not to attack any of them because I 'm not trying to fight them . I 'm trying to do what I do and support justice for everybody . I ai n't got no beef . ''
Younger protesters helped organize the D.C. march this month and were scheduled to speak as part of the program , Dominique Sharpton , 28 , Sharpton 's daughter , told ███ . She called Elzie 's behavior `` disrespectful . ''
Following the event , the battle continued on Twitter when Dominique Sharpton referred to it as `` Al Sharpton 's march . '' She deleted the tweet after some Ferguson protesters criticized her for claiming ownership of the march for her father .
Elzie , who called Al Sharpton `` out of touch , '' does n't regret stepping on stage without being called up . She said she does n't think the young protesters from Ferguson would have had a chance to speak without asserting themselves .
`` Calm is not getting us anywhere , '' she said . `` Police brutality does not give a damn if you 're organized or not . It does not care if you 're on time or not . It does n't care about respectability . ''
Protester Leon Kemp , 33 , of St. Louis , said the incident with Sharpton and the ensuing discussions exposed a `` generational divide . ''
Current protesters differ from the 1960s college students who marched in pressed suits and deferred to their elders , Elzie and Kemp said . Today 's protesters include clergy , professors and high school dropouts with criminal records and some have a raw style that incorporates cursing to get their points across .
`` We did n't invent protesting , but we are showing people that you do n't have to be afraid of the police , '' Kemp said . `` This was not a movement for 'respectable negroes . ' If we were respectable in August , we would n't have had a march in D.C . ''

While many still think about the ERA as a relic of history , the amendment will be a live issue going into 2020 . ERA proponents claim that they can combine recent ratifications in Nevada and Illinois with those from the 1970s . Yes , Congress imposed a deadline of 1982 for getting the required two-thirds approval back when it sent the proposed amendment to the states in the ’ 70s . But proponents claim that , once Virginia ratifies , all they need is a bare majority in the House and Senate to undo that deadline .
Courts have ruled that amendments must be ratified in a reasonable time frame , but the 27th amendment was ratified more than two centuries after James Madison proposed it . Can activists get around the old congression deadlines ? And what of the fact that some of the ’ 70s ratifications have since been rescinded or had long-expired sunset clauses ?
While opponents can no doubt marshal strong arguments against this unusual process for amending our highest law , many of these legal questions have never been confronted in the history of our republic . ERA opponents shouldn ’ t rely on the Supreme Court to bail them out if the ERA is “ ratified . ”
The Democratic House already held a hearing in April , and because Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins are already on record supporting the ERA , stopping it in the Republican-controlled Senate is far from assured .
Which is why opponents must prepare to argue on the substance : Men and women are already equal under American law , but they aren ’ t the same . And that ’ s as it should be .

Then, too, today the meaning of “sex” is far from clear. In the hands of the right liberal judge, the ERA could become another weapon against women-only spaces and religious liberty, if “women” is interpreted to include men who subjectively claim to be female.

While many still think about the ERA as a relic of history, the amendment will be a live issue going into 2020. ERA proponents claim that they can combine recent ratifications in Nevada and Illinois with those from the 1970s. Yes, Congress imposed a deadline of 1982 for getting the required two-thirds approval back when it sent the proposed amendment to the states in the ’70s. But proponents claim that, once Virginia ratifies, all they need is a bare majority in the House and Senate to undo that deadline.

Courts have ruled that amendments must be ratified in a reasonable time frame, but the 27th amendment was ratified more than two centuries after James Madison proposed it. Can activists get around the old congression deadlines? And what of the fact that some of the ’70s ratifications have since been rescinded or had long-expired sunset clauses?

While opponents can no doubt marshal strong arguments against this unusual process for amending our highest law, many of these legal questions have never been confronted in the history of our republic. ERA opponents shouldn’t rely on the Supreme Court to bail them out if the ERA is “ratified.”

The Democratic House already held a hearing in April, and because Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins are already on record supporting the ERA, stopping it in the Republican-controlled Senate is far from assured.

Which is why opponents must prepare to argue on the substance: Men and women are already equal under American law, but they aren’t the same. And that’s as it should be.

On a recent evening in Portland , Oregon , Dr. William Toepper put on a paper surgical mask and made his way down a muddy road toward a row of shelters pitched beneath the fir trees . Smoke drifted up from a small fire tended by two women . One of them stood as he approached . “ You doing OK ? ” he asked.1 Ad Policy
“ We ’ ve got survivor kits , ” Toepper offered , holding out a ziplock bag packed with socks , snacks , antibiotic ointment , and hand sanitizer . “ I ’ ll take one , ” the woman said . “ I want to survive. ” 3
Toepper , a retired emergency physician , is the medical director of Portland Street Medicine , a group of doctors , nurses , social workers , and other volunteers who provide care to people living on the streets , in camps , or in forests in the Portland area . Volunteers go on rounds three days a week , providing acute care and basic medical supplies and offering to connect people with other services . In the past few weeks PSM volunteers have also been sharing information about Covid-19 as part of a multiorganization effort to protect Portland ’ s homeless population , estimated at 4,000 , during the pandemic.4
In the field , Toepper goes by “ Dr . Bill. ” He ’ s known this woman , whom I ’ ll call Hannah , for about two years . Hannah is 40 , and she has chronic hypertension . She ’ s on medication , and she ’ s feeling better , she told us— “ except for all this crap going on , ” she added , waving her hands . She was wearing blue latex gloves . “ I ’ m just stressed out really bad. ” 5
Nearby , a man with a short gray beard poked his head out of a tent . He ’ d been following news about the coronavirus on his phone . Earlier in the day Oregon ’ s governor issued a stay-home order , closing some businesses and public spaces that many people without housing rely on . “ Everything ’ s going to be shut down for two weeks now ? ” the man asked . “ Probably more like six weeks , yeah , ” Toepper replied.6
“ How are we supposed to eat ? ” the man said.7 Current Issue View our current issue
More than half a million people across the United States experience homelessness on any given night , and the population faces acute risks from the respiratory virus . Many have underlying health conditions , including chronic lung disease , HIV/AIDS , and mental illness , as well as higher levels of stress , which can weaken the immune system . Even in the absence of a viral pandemic , people experiencing unsheltered homelessness have a mortality rate almost 10 times the general population ’ s and nearly three times that of people living in shelters . Access to sanitation facilities , limited under ordinary circumstances , has been further complicated as public spaces like libraries close and service providers suspend operations in response to the pandemic.8
The first confirmed death from Covid-19 in the US homeless population occurred on March 16 in Silicon Valley ; since then , in New York City , at least two others have died , and dozens of people living in shelters have tested positive for the coronavirus . Social distancing is difficult if not impossible in shelter settings , though shelters across the country are taking various measures to try to limit the risk , including opening new temporary facilities to relieve crowding elsewhere . For those living outdoors , survival often depends on social bonds . “ It ’ s a social cohort of people , ” Toepper said , culturally and sometimes economically . “ It ’ s tough to distance when your income depends on sex work or canning [ collecting cans for the recycling deposit ] . ” He continued , “ My sense is that the overall risk of getting [ Covid-19 ] is lower , simply because of the fresh air . But once it hits , it ’ s going to be less well tolerated. ” And if it hits , “ the virus doesn ’ t stay in the homeless encampments . It ’ s a threat to everyone. ” 9
Farther down the row of campsites , a woman named Julie asked Toepper about the shelter-in-place rules . “ I was wondering if they ’ re possibly going to round us up and put us in camps , and if that ’ s the case , what ’ s going to happen to my dog ? ” she said . “ That is certainly not the plan , ” he assured her.10
Julie asked about the symptoms of the disease , and Brandon Deyo , a registered nurse and PSM volunteer , told her to watch out for cough , fever , and shortness of breath . “ The hard part is that hospitals are really busy right now because of this , and there are sick people there , so there are risks , ” he said . “ But if you ’ re struggling to breathe , then you should go. ” 11
Earlier , Toepper asked Hannah what her anxiety felt like . He described his own as like a pit in his stomach . “ Oh , man , ” she said , “ it goes right to my heart. ” 12
One of the foundational principles of street medicine is that providers meet people wherever they are . Offering regular care directly can avert unnecessary , expensive trips to the emergency room . It also helps build trust with people who might never visit a hospital or clinic , even if they ’ re critically ill or injured . “ When somebody comes into a health care setting , if they ’ re not clean or they don ’ t communicate well or they can ’ t bring their service dog , it can result in quite traumatic experiences , so they avoid it , ” Toepper said . “ Our experience on the streets is that people are underutilizing health care. ” 13
Over the past few weeks , Toepper has been grappling with a question that ’ s both logistical and ethical : How best to provide street medicine , which depends on personal contact , during a viral pandemic ? “ The difficult thing about doing the work is that contamination measures , distancing , PPE [ personal protective equipment ] —it ’ s a little more difficult in some of these chaotic environments , ” he said . Some of PSM ’ s outreach has been scaled back simply because many of its volunteers work in hospitals and are busier than ever because of the virus . “ One of us is probably going to get Covid , and I don ’ t know how that ’ s going to affect us , to be honest , ” he said . That prospect amplifies the need to protect not only PSM ’ s volunteers but also the people they treat.14
Several dozen street medicine programs operate in the US . Recently the Street Medicine Institute , which advises local community groups , released recommendations that outreach teams be limited to essential personnel and that they focus on reducing the “ spread of the pandemic , while still providing the best medical care possible to the rough sleeping population. ” In Portland , Toepper implemented new protocols for distributing medications and supplies to people , and he and Deyo wore masks.15
While Covid-19 complicates the logistics of providing care , the pandemic also makes the work more necessary . In addition to reaching an at-risk population , street medicine can play an important role in public health more broadly . “ So much of this work , on a practical level , has always been ER diversion , ” Deyo said . That mission “ is much more amplified in its importance now , ” given the need to focus hospital resources on treating Covid-19.16
Beginning on March 11 , PSM worked alongside the Multnomah County Department of Public Health and others in an effort to reach as much of the city ’ s unhoused population as possible with information about Covid-19 and supplies , including hand sanitizer . At first , Toepper said , many of the people they spoke with seemed uninterested or suspicious , but over the course of a week , they became increasingly concerned . Like Julie , many were afraid of being swept up and imprisoned in shelterlike environments.17
Advocates argue that Covid-19 should not be used to forcibly move people into shelters . Instead , they ’ re calling for cities to house people in hotels or other private accommodations during the crisis , and they call for significant increases in funding for housing assistance . “ It has never been more clear that housing is health care , ” said Diane Yentel , the president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition , in a statement . Advocates worry not only that the pandemic poses risks to individuals without housing but also that the economic fallout could push others into homelessness . The relief package passed by Congress addressed some of these concerns , providing $ 4 billion to assist homeless shelters and outreach workers , $ 1.25 billion for Section 8 housing vouchers , $ 685 million for public housing , and a limited eviction moratorium . ( Governors in Oregon , California , and other states have implemented broader moratoriums on residential evictions . ) 18 Coronavirus Seattle Destroyed Homeless Encampments as the Pandemic Raged Dae Shik Kim Jr. and Guy Oron Workers Are Warriors in the Fight Against the Coronavirus Jeet Heer 12 Coronavirus Funds That Will Help the Most Vulnerable Shirley Ngozi Nwangwa More in this series
In response to the pandemic , Portland , along with other cities , decided to limit its regular sweeps of encampments , in accordance with new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which advised that clearing camps could “ cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. ” This will be a reprieve for many people living outdoors in Portland , which , like so many other cities , has been embroiled in contentious debates about housing affordability and the encampments . “ The ask from the people living outside is , ‘ If we could just stay put for a little while , we ’ d be better able to clean up , we ’ d do better , we would have less impact on our city , ’ ” Toepper said . After some initial confusion about whether and how Oregon ’ s stay-home order affected people without housing , Governor Kate Brown recently clarified that her directive is “ not intended to serve as an enforcement mechanism against Oregon ’ s unsheltered population. ” 19
Later in the evening , Toepper pulled up to a street in Southeast Portland where several tents were set up . He and Deyo went from tent to tent , calling out , “ Portland Street Medicine ! You guys doing OK ? Anybody need any medical attention ? ” They were greeted by silence . “ It ’ s eerie , ” said Toepper.20
They approached a beige RV . A small dog leaped against its windows , barking . The woman who came to the door introduced herself as Dee . She described a long list of past and present health problems , including cancer , multiple sclerosis , and fibromyalgia . Deyo asked if she ’ d been following the news about Covid-19 . She said no ; she didn ’ t have Internet access . She ’ d heard that there was a virus going around but didn ’ t know the symptoms . “ It sounds like you might be pretty high risk , ” Deyo told her . When he explained that she should watch out for fever , coughing , and shortness of breath , she cut in : “ You ’ re talking about my life. ” 21
Throughout the evening , Toepper and Deyo passed out water , the assembled survival packs , and simple medications , depending on what people said they needed—Motrin , antacids , sterile saline for a man who ’ d split his finger open and had been told he ’ d need surgery . With many hospitals postponing nonessential procedures because of the pandemic , it wasn ’ t clear when that could happen.22
The next day , Toepper called me . He wanted to underscore the fundamental point of street medicine . It is , of course , to treat medical ailments , he said . “ But to explain the work by the minuscule , tiny tasks you see doesn ’ t really capture it. ” Think about the microbiome , he suggested—the bacteria , viruses , and other microorganisms “ that keep us alive and sometimes kill us , but mostly keep us alive. ” Our microbiomes aren ’ t ours alone ; they ’ re shaped by our environment and who we come in contact with . So are the nonbiological things that make us who we are , he continued . The pandemic illustrates this interdependence in a particularly stark way . “ You can ’ t keep a community healthy if you don ’ t keep the least-healthy in mind and cared for , ” said Toepper . “ We are not all living alone , you know ? ” 23","EDITOR’S NOTE: The Nation believes that helping readers stay informed about the impact of the coronavirus crisis is a form of public service.

At the same time , the sonorous cadences and ringing , metaphor-rich language of the King James Bible came instinctively to him . Quotations from the Bible , along with its vivid imagery , suffused his writings , and he used them to put the sufferings of African-Americans in the context of Scripture — to give black audience members encouragement and hope , and white ones a visceral sense of identification .
In his “ Dream ” speech , Dr. King alludes to a famous passage from Galatians , when he speaks of “ that day when all of God ’ s children — black men and white men , Jews and Gentiles , Protestants and Catholics — will be able to join hands. ” As he did in many of his sermons , he also drew parallels between “ the Negro ” still an “ exile in his own land ” and the plight of the Israelites in Exodus , who , with God on their side , found deliverance from hardship and oppression , escaping slavery in Egypt to journey toward the Promised Land .
The entire March on Washington speech reverberates with biblical rhythms and parallels , and bristles with a panoply of references to other historical and literary texts that would have resonated with his listeners . In addition to allusions to the prophets Isaiah ( “ I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted , every hill and mountain shall be made low ” ) and Amos ( “ We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream ” ) , there are echoes of the Declaration of Independence ( “ the unalienable rights of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ” ) ; Shakespeare ( “ this sweltering summer of the Negro ’ s legitimate discontent ” ) ; and popular songs like Woody Guthrie ’ s “ This Land Is Your Land ” ( “ Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York , ” “ Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California ” ) .
Such references added amplification and depth of field to the speech , much the way T. S. Eliot ’ s myriad allusions in “ The Waste Land ” add layered meaning to that poem . Dr. King , who had a doctorate in theology and once contemplated a career in academia , was shaped by both his childhood in his father ’ s church and his later studies of disparate thinkers like Reinhold Niebuhr , Gandhi and Hegel . Along the way , he developed a gift for synthesizing assorted ideas and motifs and making them his own — a gift that enabled him to address many different audiences at once , while making ideas that some might find radical somehow familiar and accessible . It was a gift that in some ways mirrored his abilities as the leader of the civil rights movement , tasked with holding together often contentious factions ( from more militant figures like Stokely Carmichael to more conservative ones like Roy Wilkins ) , while finding a way to balance the concerns of grass-roots activists with the need to forge a working alliance with the federal government .
At the same time , Dr. King was also able to nestle his arguments within a historical continuum , lending them the authority of tradition and the weight of association . For some , in his audience , the articulation of his dream for America would have evoked conscious or unconscious memories of Langston Hughes ’ s call in a 1935 poem to “ let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed ” and W. E. B . Du Bois ’ s description of the “ wonderful America , which the founding fathers dreamed. ” His final lines in the March on Washington speech come from a Negro spiritual reminding listeners of slaves ’ sustaining faith in the possibility of liberation : “ Free at last , free at last ; thank God Almighty , we are free at last . ”","The son, grandson and great-grandson of Baptist ministers, Dr. King was comfortable with the black church’s oral tradition, and he knew how to read his audience and react to it; he would often work jazzlike improvisations around favorite sermonic riffs — like the “dream” sequence — cutting and pasting his own words and those of others.

For some, in his audience, the articulation of his dream for America would have evoked conscious or unconscious memories of Langston Hughes’s call in a 1935 poem to “let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed” and W. E. B. Du Bois’s description of the “wonderful America, which the founding fathers dreamed.” His final lines in the March on Washington speech come from a Negro spiritual reminding listeners of slaves’ sustaining faith in the possibility of liberation: “Free at last, free at last; thank God Almighty, we are free at last.”",www.nytimes.com,left,7UqImXYpaHzodbOg

When I was coming of age in the late 1970s, as an African-American high-schooler and college student, I had two certainties: Nelson Mandela would die in prison in apartheid South Africa and no black person would become U.S. president in my lifetime.

So much for my youthful powers of prediction.

Little could I have known then that I would become a journalist who would one day get to cover events I once thought would never happen, at least not during my time on Earth.

In 1994, I was in South Africa for the Chicago Tribune covering the campaign and election that led to Mandela's becoming that nation's first black president. Years later, I participated in that paper's coverage of hometown politician Barack Obama's journey to the White House. How much luckier could one kid from the South Bronx get?

I was fortunate because I was getting paid to witness history writ large. But also because I was observing history of particular significance to African-Americans.

The political triumphs, first of Mandela, then of Obama, were pinch-me milestones on the long march to freedom for many members of two long-oppressed groups — black South Africans and African-Americans — each of which saw something of its own story in the other's.

Even blacks who didn't belong to Mandela's or Obama's political parties, or black journalists who strove to maintain a professional skepticism, couldn't help but reflect on the extraordinary history that was taking place.

Blacks weren't alone in that, of course. But our histories as being treated at best as second-class citizens arguably made the gap between our experience, and our sense of the possible, wider than it was for many whites.

Ban on affirmative action upheld
The Supreme Court delivered another setback to affirmative action Tuesday , easing the way for states to bar public colleges from considering race in admissions and to prohibit officials from taking race into account in hiring and contracting .
The decision upheld a constitutional amendment in Michigan voters approved in 2006 , banning preferential treatment based on race , gender , ethnicity or national origin .
The outcome of the case was not a shock , but the lopsided , 6-2 vote signaled the court ’ s continuing rightward shift on issues of race .
Eight states now have bans on affirmative action . California lawmakers briefly considered a measure that would have turned back its ban on using affirmative action in public university admissions , but the proposal was dropped .
The court ’ s ruling is likely to embolden opponents of racial preferences , who have already outlined plans to put Michigan-style constitutional amendments on the ballot in states including Ohio , Missouri and Utah .

Ban on affirmative action upheld

The Supreme Court delivered another setback to affirmative action Tuesday, easing the way for states to bar public colleges from considering race in admissions and to prohibit officials from taking race into account in hiring and contracting.

The decision upheld a constitutional amendment in Michigan voters approved in 2006, banning preferential treatment based on race, gender, ethnicity or national origin.

The outcome of the case was not a shock, but the lopsided, 6-2 vote signaled the court’s continuing rightward shift on issues of race.

( WATCH: Driving the Day)

Eight states now have bans on affirmative action. California lawmakers briefly considered a measure that would have turned back its ban on using affirmative action in public university admissions, but the proposal was dropped.

The court’s ruling is likely to embolden opponents of racial preferences, who have already outlined plans to put Michigan-style constitutional amendments on the ballot in states including Ohio, Missouri and Utah.

“The Supreme Court has made it clear that there’s no constitutional problem with banning preferential treatment… and that federal, state and local governments who want to do that can do so — and I hope that they will,” said Roger Clegg, president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.

“The most important takeaway from this is that more states should do what Michigan has done,” Clegg added.

Quite the contrary, said said affirmative action proponent Michael Olivas, director of the Institute for Higher Education Law and Governance at University of Houston. It’s a huge concern that states are making decisions about higher education via ballot measures, which can overturn nuanced, longstanding public policy in an instant.

“Conducting important educational business via ballot measure is a very bad development, and I say it’s bad even if my issue would win,” Olivas said.

While the court’s members leaned heavily in favor of allowing the Michigan amendment to take effect, the six justices who voted in the majority did not agree entirely on why.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has come to be the court’s key voice on race-related issues, announced the court’s ruling in the Supreme Court chamber.

“The respondents in this case insist that a difficult question of public policy must be taken from the reach of the voters, and thus removed from the realm of public discussion, dialogue, and debate in an election campaign,” Kennedy wrote in an opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.” Quite in addition to the serious First Amendment implications of that position with respect to any particular election, it is inconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsible, functioning democracy … It is demeaning to the democratic process to presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds.”

After sitting through hours of testimony and reading through thousands of pages of documents, a grand jury decided that there was not enough probable cause to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old.

Their decision, like the shooting that led up to all this, sparked violent protests overnight in Ferguson, Mo.

""The duty of the grand jury is to separate fact and fiction,"" the prosecuting attorney, Robert McCulloch, said in a televised address Monday night. After weighing the evidence, the grand jury decided that Wilson acted within the limits of the lethal-force law. To issue an indictment, the jury needed at least 9 members to vote for it.

In a rare move and in an attempt to allay concerns about bias, McCulloch made public the mountain of evidence presented to the grand jury. We're combing through the thousands of pages — including testimony from Wilson and many witnesses — and throughout the day, we'll update this post with the pieces that help explain how the jury reached its decision.

Last Updated at 11:14 a.m. ET. Witness Testimony:

Leading up to this decision, witness testimony has been hotly debated — so much so that the symbol of this story has become protesters raising their hands, symbolically telling police, ""Hands up, don't shoot.""

We have documents of dozens of witness interviews. If you listened to McCulloch last night, much of this jury's decision came down to whether Brown was charging Wilson or surrendering or running away.

As we've detailed in another post, it's really complicated. Some witnesses say Wilson started shooting after he got out of the car; some say he started shooting inside the car. Some say Brown was very clearly surrendering, others say it didn't look like he had been hit at all.

Perhaps the simplest way to explain all of this is to take a close look at Witness 14.

Without a doubt, Witness 14 is sympathetic to Brown and, in fact, had run into him at least once in the past.

""[Brown] was to me, and I'm going to say it, he was executed,"" the witness said. ""[Wilson] had made up his mind he was going to kill him.""

That was the witness' conclusion — that as Brown was shot, he was surrendering, he had his hands up.

That's what the witness told local authorities. But when the feds interviewed Witness 14 and drilled down on the details, the witness' assumptions became less clear.

Were Brown's hands a sign of surrender? Or was he checking his injuries? Were his palms facing the officer or facing Brown?

The witness eventually says: ""He was defenseless, hands up, he was trying to stay on his feet and you could see that his knees was beginning to buckle and he was going down.""

But the investigator eventually gets to a very important point. He leads the witness to say that Brown was moving toward Officer Wilson, who was screaming, ""Stop,"" as he fired his weapon:

Last Updated at 12:30 p.m. ET. Wilson Testimony:

Wilson's testimony to the grand jury presents the image of an officer who was scared for his life during the confrontation with the larger man who he says was physically assaulting him. One excerpt:

Wilson is 6 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs about 210 pounds. Brown was an inch taller and weighed about 290 pounds.

The officer said Brown and his associate, Dorian Johnson, were walking in the middle of the street, preventing normal traffic from passing. He said he told them to move to the sidewalk, and after a brief exchange Brown used a vulgarity at him. Wilson said he called for backup and tried open the door of his police car.

Wilson said he tried firing again but nothing happened. When he tried once more, it went off. Brown then hit him again, he said.

The officer said that when he looked up, Brown was running away. Wilson said he got out of the car, called for backup and began chasing Brown. He said Brown then stopped and he did, too. He said he ordered Brown to get on the ground, but the 18-year-old did not. He said Brown made an ""aggravated sound"" and ran back toward him. He said he warned Brown repeatedly to get on the ground, but when he did not comply the officer fired ""a series of shots.""

""I don't know how many I shot, I just know I shot it,"" he said.

Wilson then proceeded to explain his rationale for why he chased Brown. He said he wanted to keep Brown ""contained"" until support arrived. He said he thought that if he could buy 30 seconds of time, until other officers arrived, they could ""make the arrest, nothing happens, we are all good.""

""And it didn't happen that way,"" Wilson said.

Last Updated at 3:47 p.m. ET. The Physical Evidence:

One really important part of this case is of course the physical evidence. We've gone into more details in a separate post.

There are two findings of major importance: First, the autopsy found that Michael Brown was never shot in the back, as some early witnesses claimed.

Second, they found Brown's blood inside the police car and on Wilson's gun. This implies that there was close-range contact as Wilson alleges.

We've also posted the photographs taken of Wilson on the day of the confrontation. Doctors diagnosed him with a bruise. That seems to cast some doubt on Wilson's testimony about the intensity of the confrontation.

( New York ) – China ’ s proposed national security law for Hong Kong is a devastating assault on human rights and should be abandoned , more than 86 civil society organizations groups said today in a letter to Li Zhanshu , chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ’ s Congress ( NPCSC ) .
The proposed national security legislation is likely to be discussed at the NPCSC session from June 18 to 20 , 2020 , or at a special session by the end of June . The proposed law could come into force soon afterward , and quickly be used to crack down on Hong Kong ’ s freedoms .
“ China should abandon this effort to impose a national security law on Hong Kong immediately , ” said Sophie Richardson , China director at ███ . “ No government should invoke national security as a justification for repression . ”
While the details of the forthcoming legislation remain unclear , comparable legislation in the mainland criminalizes overly broad , vague ‘ offenses ’ that can encompass any criticism of the government and be used against people peacefully exercising and defending their human rights
The law may allow agencies such as the Ministry of State Security and the National Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security – long known for serious rights violations in China – to operate in Hong Kong
Beijing ’ s imposition of the security legislation in Hong Kong contravenes the Basic Law , Hong Kong ’ s functional constitution , and violates international human rights protections in Hong Kong
The groups said in their letter that the NPCSC should :
abandon plans to introduce national security legislation for Hong Kong , as what is known about the draft law so far and the experiences with respective national security laws in mainland China strongly indicate that neither the law nor its application would conform to international human rights law and standards .

The proposed national security legislation is likely to be discussed at the NPCSC session from June 18 to 20, 2020, or at a special session by the end of June. The proposed law could come into force soon afterward, and quickly be used to crack down on Hong Kong’s freedoms.



“China should abandon this effort to impose a national security law on Hong Kong immediately,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. “No government should invoke national security as a justification for repression.”



The groups emphasized that:

While the details of the forthcoming legislation remain unclear, comparable legislation in the mainland criminalizes overly broad, vague ‘offenses’ that can encompass any criticism of the government and be used against people peacefully exercising and defending their human rights

The law may allow agencies such as the Ministry of State Security and the National Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security – long known for serious rights violations in China – to operate in Hong Kong

Beijing’s imposition of the security legislation in Hong Kong contravenes the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s functional constitution, and violates international human rights protections in Hong Kong

The groups said in their letter that the NPCSC should:

abandon plans to introduce national security legislation for Hong Kong, as what is known about the draft law so far and the experiences with respective national security laws in mainland China strongly indicate that neither the law nor its application would conform to international human rights law and standards.

Bush leaves mixed record on race, civil rights",2018-12-03,Monica Rhor,"CLOSE A look back at the life and legacy of former U.S. President George H.W . Bush who died on November 30th . ███
Early in George H.W . Bush ’ s political career , when he was running for a U.S. Senate seat in Texas , he came out against the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 , deriding his opponent as “ radical ” for supporting the bill that ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination .
“ The new civil rights act was passed to protect 14 percent of the people , ” he said . “ I ’ m also worried about the other 86 percent . ”
The stand seemed at odds with his family ’ s long history of supporting civil rights ( his father , Prescott Bush , a Connecticut senator worked to desegregate schools and protect voting rights ) and with his own work raising money for the United Negro College Fund .
But in Texas , where the Republican Party was steadily becoming more conservative and embracing the Southern strategy of appealing to white voters , Bush ’ s position made sense .
He would later regret opposing the groundbreaking bill , even apologizing to his pastor , according to historian Timothy Naftali , author of “ George H.W . Bush : The American Presidents Series . ”
“ He came from the northern Republican tradition , which was moderate and somewhat progressive on race at the time , ” Naftali said . “ But George Bush sometimes chose expediency in his campaigning . He didn ’ t always have the courage of his convictions as a candidate , but more often than not , he had the courage of his convictions in office . ”
As a freshman congressman from Texas , Bush joined a group of moderate Republicans to support civil rights legislation and voted in favor of the 1968 Fair Housing Act – a move that did not sit well with his conservative constituents back home .
David Greenberg , a professor of history and journalism and media studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey , said Bush , who died Friday at the age of 94 , was often torn between “ the right thing to do versus the political thing to do . ”
Bush 's campaign in his 1988 bid for the presidency is often cited as one of the nastiest in political memory . An attack ad mined ugly stereotypes of African-Americans , and Bush questioned the patriotism of his opponent , Michael Dukakis .
The Willie Horton ad , which focused on a convicted murderer who committed a rape while out of prison on a furlough program Dukakis supported , was put out by a conservative PAC , not the Bush campaign . However , Bush repeatedly brought up Horton ’ s name in speeches , including one to the National Sheriffs ' Association .
“ Horton applied for a furlough , ” Bush said . “ He was given the furlough . He was released . And he fled – only to terrorize a family and repeatedly rape a woman . ”
The Bush campaign released an ad that showed footage of prisoners going through a revolving door – a strategy that played on white voters ’ fears and prejudices , said Jason Johnson , a professor of politics and journalism at Morgan State University in Baltimore .
Susan Estrich , Dukakis ' campaign manager , accused the Bush campaign of stoking racial tensions . `` If you were going to run a campaign of fear and smear and appeal to racial hatred , ” she told The New York Times , “ you could not have picked a better case to use than this one . ''
The Horton ad helped squelch the conversation on a criminal justice overhaul , which was in its incipient stages , Johnson said . “ It racialized and demonized black people . ”
As president , Bush ’ s actions often called into question his stands on race and civil rights , Johnson said .
“ It ’ s fair and reasonable to critique everything we can about George Bush , ” Johnson said . “ We can say he was horrendous on civil rights but that he was a good father and treated people decently . ”
In 1990 , Bush vetoed a civil rights act that would have expanded job protections . He and Ronald Reagan were the only presidents to veto a civil rights measure since the start of the civil rights era . Bush said the bill would have introduced the “ destructive force of quotas into our national employment system . ''
The move garnered criticism from civil rights leaders and liberals , including Sen. Edward Kennedy , D-Mass. , who said the veto showed Bush was “ more interested in appeasing extremists in his party than in providing simple justice . ”
“ It was not a good look to be vetoing a civil rights bill when you are trying to offer a kinder , gentler version of Reagan , ” said Greenberg , who noted that the backlash led Bush to work on a compromise bill , the 1991 Civil Rights Act , which passed the following year .
Bush ’ s most lasting legacy in race relations may stem from his nomination of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his role in escalating the war on drugs .
By selecting the conservative Thomas , an ardent opponent of affirmative action , to replace Thurgood Marshall , the first black Supreme Court justice , who championed equal rights and challenged discrimination , Bush stalled or set back progress on civil rights issues for decades , said Johnson , who likened the choice to “ trolling . ”
Bush was criticized for his role in the war on drugs , which began in the Reagan administration and carried on into the Clinton years and led to the mass incarceration of many African-American men .
In his first significant policy speech as president , on Sept. 5 , 1989 , Bush chose to focus on drug policy and the cocaine epidemic . Sitting in the Oval Office , Bush lifted up a plastic bag .
“ This is crack cocaine seized a few days ago by Drug Enforcement agents in a park just across the street from the White House , ” he said . “ It could easily have been heroin or PCP . It ’ s as innocent-looking as candy , but it ’ s turning our cities into battle zones , and it ’ s murdering our children . ”
He called for a $ 1.5 billion increase in drug-related federal spending to law enforcement and pushed to “ enlarge our criminal justice system across the board , at the local , state and federal levels alike . We need more prisons , more jails , more courts , more prosecutors . ”
That approach , along with the mandatory minimum sentences passed under Reagan , contributed to the so-called 100-to-1 drug sentencing discrepancy , in which the penalty for crack possession and sale was 100 times greater than that for cocaine , said Joshua Clark Davis , a University of Baltimore history professor .
The speech was notable not only for its substance but because the crack sale mentioned by Bush had been set up by the Drug Enforcement Administration . Agents manipulated a 19-year-old high school student , a low-level dealer , into conducting a sale near the White House .
Keith Jackson , who did not know where the White House was and had to be given directions , was arrested and sentenced to 10 years for another , unrelated sale after the first two juries deadlocked .
In a tweet posted Dec. 1 , Davis noted , “ It ’ s what his War on Drugs did to just one person . But it shows the human costs of that war in miniature detail . A high schooler was lured to the WH to sell crack and spent 7+ years in prison , so that the President could make a point on TV . ”
The judge in the case pointed out that Jackson , who had no prior criminal record , had been used as a prop . He urged Jackson to ask Bush for a commutation .
`` He used you , in the sense of making a big drug speech , '' said Stanley Sporkin , a Reagan appointee . `` But he 's a decent man , a man of great compassion . Maybe he can find a way to reduce at least some of that sentence . ''
Bush , referring to Jackson as “ this drug guy , ” said , “ I can not feel sorry for him . I 'm sorry , they ought not to be peddling these insidious drugs that ruin the children of this country .

civil_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/24/darren-wilson-cleared-by-ferguson-grand-jury-in-mi/,Ferguson erupts: Officer Darren Wilson cleared in Michael Brown shooting death,2014-11-24,Phillip Swarts,"A Missouri grand jury that heard testimony from about 60 witnesses over 70 hours declined to indict officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown , sparking riots in Ferguson Monday night and protests nationwide .
St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury ’ s decision Monday in an unusual late-night press conference that decried reporting that included “ lack of accurate detail , ” inconsistent and conflicting eyewitness accounts and “ interviews on social media . ”
The grand jury decided “ no probable cause exists ” to bring any charges against Officer Wilson , who is white , Mr. McCulloch said .
“ They are the only people who have heard and examined all of the evidence and all the witnesses , ” he said of the grand jurors during a 30-minute announcement that panned reporting in the case .
The grand jury of nine whites and three blacks met 25 times over three months and heard testimony from three medical examiners .
President Obama made a statement from the White House in which he appealed for calm at almost the exact instant rioting broke out in Ferguson .
SEE ALSO : Analysis : The first Ferguson indictment goes to … the news media
While “ America isn ’ t everything it could be , ” people must respect that the decision was the grand jury ’ s to make , he said .
“ We are a nation built on the rule of law ” and “ there ’ s never an excuse for violence . ”
The Brown family said in a statement released through their attorneys that they were “ profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequences of his actions . ”
The family , which was informed of the decision earlier Monday , also asked that people “ please keep your protests peaceful , ” and said “ let ’ s not just make noise ; let ’ s make a difference . ”
Shortly after the 9 p.m. announcement , authorities released more than 1,000 pages of grand jury documents , including Officer Wilson ’ s testimony .
Officer Wilson told jurors that he initially encountered Brown and a friend walking in the street and , when he told them to move to a sidewalk , Brown responded with an expletive .
Officer Wilson then noticed that Brown had a handful of cigars , “ and that ’ s when it clicked for me , ” he said , referring to a radio report minutes earlier of a robbery at a nearby convenience store .
Officer Wilson said he asked a dispatcher to send additional police , and then backed his vehicle up in front of Brown and his friend . As he tried to open the door , Officer Wilson said Brown slammed it shut .
The officer said he pushed Brown with the door and Brown hit him in the face . Officer Wilson told grand jurors he was thinking : “ What do I do not to get beaten inside my car . ”
“ I drew my gun , ” Officer Wilson told the grand jury . “ I said , ‘ Get back or I ’ m going to shoot you . ’
“ He immediately grabs my gun and says , ‘ You are too much of a pussy to shoot me , ’ ” Officer Wilson told grand jurors . He said Brown grabbed the gun with his right hand , twisted it and “ digs it into my hip . ”
Asked why he felt the need to pull his gun , Wilson told grand jurors he was concerned another punch to his face could “ knock me out or worse . ”
After shots were fired in the vehicle , Brown fled and Officer Wilson gave chase . At some point , Brown turned around to face the officer .
Witness accounts were conflicted about whether Brown walked , stumbled or charged back toward Officer Wilson before he was fatally wounded , Mr. McCulloch said . There were also differing accounts of how or whether Brown ’ s hands were raised . His body fell about 153 feet from Wilson ’ s vehicle .
The long-awaited decision was greeted with hundreds of protesters in front of the police station in Ferguson .
But protests in Ferguson quickly turned violent . Bottles and rocks were being thrown and some cars overturned and burned , including at least one assault on a police car .
There also were reports of multiple gunshots , a large fight and images of looting . Police ordered protesters to disperse and began using tear gas when some refused .
Protesters said one woman had a heart attack , and then was gassed by police as others attempted to carry her to safety . There was no official confirmation of casualties .
Demonstrations broke out around the nation — Times Square , South-Central Los Angeles , and U Street and the White House in Washington , D.C .

St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury’s decision Monday in an unusual late-night press conference that decried reporting that included “lack of accurate detail,” inconsistent and conflicting eyewitness accounts and “interviews on social media.”

The grand jury decided “no probable cause exists” to bring any charges against Officer Wilson, who is white, Mr. McCulloch said.

“They are the only people who have heard and examined all of the evidence and all the witnesses,” he said of the grand jurors during a 30-minute announcement that panned reporting in the case.

The grand jury of nine whites and three blacks met 25 times over three months and heard testimony from three medical examiners.

President Obama made a statement from the White House in which he appealed for calm at almost the exact instant rioting broke out in Ferguson.

While “America isn’t everything it could be,” people must respect that the decision was the grand jury’s to make, he said.

“We are a nation built on the rule of law” and “there’s never an excuse for violence.”

The Brown family said in a statement released through their attorneys that they were “profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequences of his actions.”

The family, which was informed of the decision earlier Monday, also asked that people “please keep your protests peaceful,” and said “let’s not just make noise; let’s make a difference.”

Shortly after the 9 p.m. announcement, authorities released more than 1,000 pages of grand jury documents, including Officer Wilson’s testimony.

Officer Wilson told jurors that he initially encountered Brown and a friend walking in the street and, when he told them to move to a sidewalk, Brown responded with an expletive.

Officer Wilson then noticed that Brown had a handful of cigars, “and that’s when it clicked for me,” he said, referring to a radio report minutes earlier of a robbery at a nearby convenience store.

Officer Wilson said he asked a dispatcher to send additional police, and then backed his vehicle up in front of Brown and his friend. As he tried to open the door, Officer Wilson said Brown slammed it shut.

The officer said he pushed Brown with the door and Brown hit him in the face. Officer Wilson told grand jurors he was thinking: “What do I do not to get beaten inside my car.”

“I drew my gun,” Officer Wilson told the grand jury. “I said, ‘Get back or I’m going to shoot you.’

“He immediately grabs my gun and says, ‘You are too much of a pussy to shoot me,’” Officer Wilson told grand jurors. He said Brown grabbed the gun with his right hand, twisted it and “digs it into my hip.”

Asked why he felt the need to pull his gun, Wilson told grand jurors he was concerned another punch to his face could “knock me out or worse.”

After shots were fired in the vehicle, Brown fled and Officer Wilson gave chase. At some point, Brown turned around to face the officer.

Witness accounts were conflicted about whether Brown walked, stumbled or charged back toward Officer Wilson before he was fatally wounded, Mr. McCulloch said. There were also differing accounts of how or whether Brown’s hands were raised. His body fell about 153 feet from Wilson’s vehicle.

The long-awaited decision was greeted with hundreds of protesters in front of the police station in Ferguson.

But protests in Ferguson quickly turned violent. Bottles and rocks were being thrown and some cars overturned and burned, including at least one assault on a police car.

There also were reports of multiple gunshots, a large fight and images of looting. Police ordered protesters to disperse and began using tear gas when some refused.

Protesters said one woman had a heart attack, and then was gassed by police as others attempted to carry her to safety. There was no official confirmation of casualties.

Demonstrations broke out around the nation — Times Square, South-Central Los Angeles, and U Street and the White House in Washington, D.C.

Officer Wilson had been in talks with the Ferguson Police Department about possibly resigning, but it is unclear how the grand jury’s verdict may affect those discussions.

Rep. John Lewis, Georgia Democrat and a civil-rights icon, took to Twitter to implore people not to resort to violence.

President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have been meeting with younger civil rights activists who are on the front-line in Missouri. The young activists are taking the lead in the churches, the schools, the community meetings in Ferguson. Those young people have led difficult conversations about the importance of moving past anger at the lack of any sanction against the policeman for shooting an unarmed young man.

More On This...

Incredibly, the best leadership on the scene has come from the family of the murdered teen.

Michael Brown’s family issued a statement right after the prosecutor announced that the grand jury was not going to indict the officer. They said they are “profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions.”

They then spoke about the need for “positive change…[the] need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen.” They specifically called for requiring the police to wear body cameras and then they added “please keep your protests peaceful.”

“Answering violence with violence is not the appropriate reaction – Let’s not just make noise, let’s make a difference,” their statement read.

As the black father of two boys and a grandson I can only imagine the pain being felt by young Michael Brown’s parents. If anyone could be forgiven for lashing out, crying out in rage it would be Michael Brown, Sr.

Instead President Obama read Mr. Brown’s words calling for people to avoid violence: “Hurting and destroying others is not the answer,” Mr. Brown said a week ago, setting the stage for a constructive response no matter what the grand jury decided.

President Obama added another quote from Mr. Brown: “I do not want my son’s death to be in vain. I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone.”

That “positive change,” is not advanced by riots.

It breaks my heart to see televised images of violence from Ferguson, Missouri juxtaposed next to President Obama, the first black president.

The president represents black power beyond anyone’s imagination just a few years ago. He inspires young black people to dream of fulfilling their dreams. Here is a black man with a seat at the head of the American table of leadership and that means the world’s leadership.

But he is now weighed down by the troubled history of American race relations and the failure of established black civil rights and political leadership. So President Obama had to step into vacuum of national civil rights leadership and appeal for peace on the streets all the way from the White House.

Street violence, riots, only plays into the hands of racial provocateurs who are too weak to engage in the constant, on-going struggle for equal rights and protections for black people. Those self-promoters are never around to clean up after a riot destroys a black neighborhood and tears at the trust between good people of all races.

Some television stations, too, have practically called for riots. They are so self-serving that some have identified them as fans of “Riot Porn.” They want the cheap thrills that come with stereotyping black people as violent and the high ratings that come with racial tensions. Their anchors want to be seen in the middle of the fray.

But as the “Last Poets,” a 60s group of black musicians once said: “The revolution will not be televised.” The riots of the 1960s and the 1990s riots that followed the Rodney King verdict are proof that riots don’t advance justice for black people.

I wrote a history of the civil rights movement – “Eyes on the Prize- America’s Civil Rights Years 1954-1965” and one clear lesson I learned from my research remains to me to this day. The people with the most guns and bombs did not win the civil rights struggle.

Leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., won with the thunderous power of non-violence. They appealed to Christian conscience. They shared their humanity and a shared patriotism, a belief in the Founding Fathers’ promise that “All men are created equal.”

The people who engineered the greatest social movement in American history engaged the political process. They talked, they pressured, they protested. They used incredible speeches, music and art to change hearts and open minds.

Attorney General Holder offered the same conclusion last week. “History has… shown us that the most successful and enduring movements for change are those that adhere to non-aggression and non-violence,” Holder said in a video given to young people active in trying to create change and avoid violence in Missouri.

Real change comes but it comes from people who work, who stand up, work some more, and work toward a vision of justice that inspires others to work with them.

The lawsuit is an attempt to make sure states can ignore the federal government 's mandate .
The 10 other states joining the lawsuit include Arkansas , Oklahoma , Alabama , Wisconsin , West Virginia , Tennessee , Maine , Louisiana , Utah and Georgia .
They 're asking the courts to declare the directive unlawful , accusing the administration of engineering a `` massive social experiment , flouting the democratic process , and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights . ''
Supporters of the lawsuit argue that in addition to violating privacy and safety rights of women and children , the White House directive is a major overreach of power .
`` Simply put , the Obama administration is creating new law , outside the boundaries of the Constitution - making changes only Congress can make , '' Paxton said .
`` I think the problem with the way the Obama administration has carried this out is that they have n't candidly assessed the cost of this type of policy , '' Trotter said on NPR .
`` So we understand that women need privacy . They need safety in places that they frequent . And yet the Obama administration has decided to reinterpret an old law that never included transgender people for over 40 years , '' she said .
Trotter said the president is doing this from a Washington one-size-fits-all edict instead of going through Congress and having a national discussion .
Some schools are now worried if they do n't comply , they will lose funding .
`` We do n't have a rule of law if we can reinterpret a more than 40-year-old law and say that the plain language , the black letter of the law is meaningless because someone has become enlightened about it , '' Trotter said .
Texas ' lieutenant governor previously went as far as to say the state is willing to give up the $ 10 billion it receives in federal education dollars rather than comply .
The directive from the U.S. Justice and Education Departments represents an escalation in what the Obama administration calls a civil rights issue .
`` This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we , as a people and as a country , have enacted to protect them - indeed , to protect all of us , '' U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said .
This is n't the only legal fight over transgender rights . Earlier this month the Justice Department and the state of North Carolina sued each other over a state law curbing public restroom access for transgender people .
The question of whether federal civil rights law protects those who identify as transgender has no definitive answer and will likely be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court .
Still , schools that refuse to comply with the Obama administration 's directive could very likely be hit with civil rights lawsuits from the government and a cutoff from federal aid to education .","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with attorneys general in 10 other states, are suing the Obama administration over the president's directive to allow transgender students to use whatever bathroom that matches their gender preference.

The question of whether federal civil rights law protects those who identify as transgender has no definitive answer and will likely be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Still, schools that refuse to comply with the Obama administration's directive could very likely be hit with civil rights lawsuits from the government and a cutoff from federal aid to education.",www1.cbn.com,right,q4W8FW61SttIAfoE

North Carolina has repealed portions of the state's controversial ""bathroom bill,"" including the requirement that trans people use the bathroom that matches their birth certificate, member station WUNC reports.

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said he has signed the repeal measure, which he said is ""not perfect"" but is ""an important step forward.""

At a news conference on Thursday he said the compromise repeal, which leaves in place a temporary prohibition on local anti-discrimination measures, was a necessary compromise with a Republican-controlled Legislature.

LGBT activists quickly denounced the proposal, which would limit the ability of local officials to extend protections to transgender citizens for several years.

Cooper acknowledged that he was frustrated, even as he defended the compromise.

""Under HB2 that kind of justice was permanently denied,"" Cooper said, whereas under the compromise it's only delayed. ""I wish it were sooner than 2020, I really do.""

The compromise has also angered some conservatives who supported the original measure. One senator who supported the bill spoke during the Senate debate on Thursday, calling it ""at best a punt; at worst, a betrayal of principle,"" Tiberii reports.

Cooper, who eked out a win over former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in November's election, said he supports the bill.

The agreement was reached shortly before a deadline that would have caused North Carolina to lose the option of hosting NCAA basketball championships, Reuters reports.

The college athletic association and other civic and business groups had taken steps to sanction or boycott North Carolina because of the law.

It's not yet clear whether the deal will be sufficient for the NCAA.

Lawmakers passed HB2 in March 2016 under McCrory. In addition to the bathroom restrictions, the law also limits localities' ability to pass nondiscrimination protections and minimum wage measures.

State lawmakers passed the measure in response to a Charlotte ordinance that would have protected the rights of transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to their gender identity.

Chad Griffin, president of the LGBT rights organization Human Rights Campaign, tweeted that the deal was a ""state-wide prohibition on equality"" and ""doubles down on discrimination.""

Previous deals to repeal HB2 have fallen apart.

This message supported the idea of getting the human rights declaration of the United Nations to expose the unfair , vicious treatment of black people in America . Malcolm X replied that he was eager to meet Martin Luther King , Jr.—as soon as the next afternoon . If they had met that day and worked together , the radical King would be well known .

On April 4 , 1968 , in Memphis—the last day of his life—Martin Luther King , Jr. , phoned Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta with the title of his Sunday sermon : “ Why America May Go to Hell. ” If he had preached this sermon , the radical King would be well known .
Yet in Dr. King ’ s own time , he would say repeatedly , “ I am nevertheless greatly saddened . . . that the inquirers have not really known me , my commitment , or my calling. ” It is no accident that just prior to King ’ s death , 72 percent of whites and 55 percent of blacks disapproved of his opposition to the Vietnam War and his efforts to eradicate poverty in America . When much of the black leadership attacked or shunned him , King replied , “ What you ’ re saying may get you a foundation grant but it won ’ t get you into the kingdom of truth . ”
In short , Martin Luther King , Jr. , refused to sell his soul for a mess of pottage . He refused to silence his voice in his quest for unarmed truth and unconditional love . For King , the condition of truth was to allow suffering to speak ; for him , justice was what love looks like in public . In King ’ s eyes , too many black leaders sacrificed the truth for access to power or reduced sacrificial love and service to selfish expediency and personal gain . This spiritual blackout among black leaders resulted in their use and abuse by the white political and economic establishment that constituted a kind of “ conspiracy against the poor. ” This spiritual blackout—this lack of integrity and courage—primarily revealed a deep fear , failure of nerve , and spinelessness on behalf of black leaders . They too often were sycophants , cheerleaders , or bootlickers for big monied interests , even as the boots were crushing poor and working people . In stark contrast to this cowardice , King stated to his staff , “ I ’ d rather be dead than afraid . ”
Although much of America did not know the radical King—and too few know today—the FBI and US government did . They called him “ the most dangerous man in America. ” They knew Reverend King was a revolutionary Christian , sincere in his commitment and serious in his calling . They knew he was a product of a black prophetic tradition , full of fire in his bones , love in his heart , light in his mind , and courage in his soul . Martin Luther King , Jr. , was the major threat to the US government and the American establishment because he dared to organize and mobilize black rage over past and present crimes against humanity targeting black folk and other oppressed people .
Any such black awakening can either yield hatred and revenge or love and justice . This is why the prophetic words of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel still haunt us : “ The whole future of America will depend upon the impact and influence of Dr. King. ” The fundamental question is : Does America have the capacity to hear and heed the radical King or must America sanitize King in order to evade and avoid his challenge ?
King indeed had a dream . But it was not the American dream . King ’ s dream was rooted in the American Dream—it was what the quest for life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness looked like for people enslaved and Jim Crowed , terrorized , traumatized , and stigmatized by American laws and American citizens . The litmus test for realizing King ’ s dream was neither a black face in the White House nor a black presence on Wall Street . Rather , the fulfillment of his dream was for all poor and working people to live lives of decency and dignity .
King ’ s dream of a more free and democratic America and world had morphed into , in his words , “ a nightmare , ” owing to the persistence of “ racism , poverty , militarism , and materialism. ” He called America a “ sick society. ” At one point , King cried out in despair , “ I have found out that all that I have been doing in trying to correct this system in America has been in vain . I am trying to get at the roots of it to see just what ought to be done . The whole thing will have to be done away with. ” He said to his dear brother Harry Belafonte days before his , King ’ s , death , “ Are we integrating into a burning house ? ” He was weary of pervasive economic injustice , cultural decay , and political paralysis . He was not an American Gibbon chronicling the decline and fall of the American empire but a courageous and visionary Christian blues man , fighting with style and love in the face of the four catastrophes he identified , which are still with us today .
Militarism is an imperial catastrophe that has produced a military-industrial complex and national security state and warped the country ’ s priorities and stature ( as with the immoral drones dropping bombs on innocent civilians ) . Materialism is a spiritual catastrophe , promoted by a corporate-media multiplex and a culture industry that has hardened the hearts of hard-core consumers and coarsened the consciences of would-be citizens . Clever gimmicks of mass distraction yield a cheap soulcraft of addicted and self-medicated narcissists .
Racism is a moral catastrophe , most graphically seen in the prison-industrial complex and targeted police surveillance in black and brown ghettos rendered invisible in public discourse . Arbitrary uses of the law in the name of the “ war ” on drugs have produced , in legal scholar Michelle Alexander ’ s well-known phrase , a new Jim Crow of mass incarceration . And poverty is an economic catastrophe , inseparable from the power of greedy oligarchs and avaricious plutocrats indifferent to the misery of poor children , elderly and disabled citizens , and working people .
The radical King was a warrior for peace on the domestic and global battlefields . He was a staunch anti-colonial and anti-imperial thinker and fighter . His revolutionary commitment to nonviolent resistance in America and abroad tried to put a brake on the escalating militarism running amok across the globe . As a decade-long victim of the vicious and vindictive FBI , King was a radical libertarian as well as having closeted democratic socialist leanings . His commitment to the precious rights and liberties for all was profound .
For King , dissent did not mean disloyalty—in fact , dissent was a high form of patriotism . When he said that the US government was “ the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today , ” he was not trashing America . He was telling the painful truth about a country he loved . King was never anti-American ; he was always anti-injustice in America and anywhere else . Love of truth and love of country could go hand-in-hand . Needless to say , under the policies of the National Security Agency and Obama administration , King could have been subject to detention without trial and assassination by executive decree ( owing to his links to “ terrorists ” of his day , such as Nelson Mandela ) .
The radical King was a spiritual giant who tried to shatter the callousness and indifference of his fellow citizens . Following his dear friend and comrade Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel , King believed that indifference to evil is more evil than evil itself . And materialism , with its attendants hedonism and egotism , produces sleepwalkers bereft of compassion and zombies deficient in love . This spiritual crisis is not reducible to politics or economics . It is rooted in the relative decline of integrity , honesty , decency , and virtue , due in large part to the role of big money in American life . This coldhearted obsession with manipulation and domination drives our ecological catastrophe-in-the-making and our possible military Armageddon .
The radical King was a moral titan with profound allegiance to his roots—the black prophetic tradition and black freedom struggle . His genuine commitment to the dignity of whites , as well as to peoples of all hues , never overshadowed or downplayed his deep commitment to black people . For King , the struggle against the legacy of white supremacy was never a strategic move or tactical afterthought ; rather , it was a profound existential and moral matter of great urgency . King knew that white supremacy , in various forms , was a global phenomenon . It remains shot through our hearts and minds , institutions and structures , smart phones and unwise politicians . The modes of racist domination—from barbaric slavery to bestial Jim Crow , Sr. , to cruel Jim Crow , Jr.—are never reducible to individual prejudice or personal bias . Empire , white supremacy , capitalism , patriarchy , and homophobia are linked in complex ways , and our struggles against them require moral consistency and systemic analyses .
The radical King was a democratic socialist who sided with poor and working people in the class struggle taking place in capitalist societies . This class struggle may be visible or invisible , manifest or latent . But it rages on in a fight over resources , power , and space . In the past thirty years we have witnessed a top-down , one-sided class war against poor and working people in the name of a morally bankrupt policy of deregulating markets , lowering taxes , and cutting spending for those who are already socially neglected and economically abandoned . America ’ s two main political parties , each beholden to big money , offer merely alternative versions of oligarchic rule . The radical King was neither Marxist nor communist , but he did understand the role of class analysis in his focus on poor and working people .
He always had a healthy suspicion of all politicians—of any color— owing to his critique of legalized bribery and normalized corruption in money-saturated American politics . He noted , “ I have come to think of my role as one which operates outside the realm of partisan politics . . . . I feel I should serve as a conscience of all the parties and all of the people. ” This critical attitude toward politicians was deepened when he worked to register thousands of people to elect the first black mayor in modern times , Carl Stokes , in Cleveland in 1967 , yet was uninvited to join the stage for the victory celebration .
Needless to say , the rich legacy of the radical King in the age of Obama celebrates the symbolic breakthrough of a black president and keeps track of the right-wing backlash against him . Yet the bailout for banks , record profits for Wall Street , and giant budget cuts on the backs of the vulnerable rather than mortgage relief for homeowners , jobs with a living wage , and investment in education , infrastructure , and housing reveal the plutocratic domination of the Obama administration . The dream of the radical King for the first black president surely was not a Wall Street presidency , drone presidency , and surveillance presidency with a vanishing black middle class , devastated black working class , and desperate black poor people clinging to fleeting symbols and empty rhetoric .
I shall never forget the first question I asked Barack Obama when he called to solicit my support : “ What is the relation of your presidential policies to the legacy of Martin Luther King , Jr. ? ” He replied —in hours of dialogue—that the relation was strong . And I agreed to lend critical support . After sixty-five events , from Iowa to Ohio , in 2008 , I knew that most of his advisers were not part of the King legacy . And Obama ’ s betrayal of what the radical King stands for became undeniable .
Sadly , the damage done by Obama apologists—often for money , access , and status—is immeasurable and nearly unforgivable . For the first time in American history , black citizens are the most pro-war in American society . Black churches are among the weakest in prison ministry—even given the disproportionately high percentage of black prisoners . Black schools are under attack from profiteering enterprises . Forty percent of black children live in poverty . Aside from a few exceptions , black musicians are more and more marginal in popular culture . Black deaths , especially among young people , are out of control . In other words , the Obama apologists who hide and conceal Wall Street crimes , imperial crimes , new Jim Crow crimes , and surveillance lies in order to protect the first black president have much to account for . And a health-care bill—a bonanza for big insurance and drug companies alongside access to new consumers—falls far short of the mark .
The response of the radical King to our catastrophic moment can be put in one word : revolution—a revolution in our priorities , a reevaluation of our values , a reinvigoration of our public life , and a fundamental transformation of our way of thinking and living that promotes a transfer of power from oligarchs and plutocrats to everyday people and ordinary citizens .
The radical King was first and foremost a revolutionary Christian—a black Baptist minister and pastor whose intellectual genius and rhetorical power was deployed in the name of the Gospel of Jesus Christ . King understood this good news to be primarily radical love in freedom and radical freedom in love , a fallible enactment of the Beloved Community or finite embodiment of the Kingdom of God . King ’ s radical love can be heard in John Coltrane ’ s “ A Love Supreme ” or the Isley Brothers ’ “ Caravan of Love. ” This radical love of an intensely hated people is both liberating and contagious , just as this radical freedom of a thoroughly unfree people is both emancipating and infectious .
The radical King was the most significant and effective organic intellectual in the latter half of the twentieth century whose fundamental motif was radical love . King ’ s radical love was Christocentric in content and black in character . Like the Christocentric language of the Black Church that produced the radical King—Jesus as the Bright and Morning Star against the backdrop of the pitch darkness of the night , as water in dry places , a companion in loneliness , a doctor to the sick , a rock in a wearied land—his Christocentrism exemplifies the intimate and dependent relationship between God and person and between God and a world-forsaken people . The black character of King ’ s radical love was its roots in the indescribable terror and inimitable trauma of being black in white supremacist America , during slavery , Jim Crow , Sr. , or Jim Crow , Jr .
King ’ s work and witness is a kind of prophetic pneumatology in motion—a kinetic orality , passionate physicality , and combative spirituality that wedded mind to movement , soul to sustenance , and body to empowerment . Like his most worthy theological precursor , Howard Thurman , King pulled from the rich insights of Western thinkers , yet he elevated the lived experiences of wounded , scarred , and bruised bodies of enslaved and Jim-Crowed black peoples to enact radical love .
King ’ s radical love put a premium on artistic performance and existential praxis . His sermons were performances that authorized an alternative reality to the way the world is . His living radiated a radical tenderness , subversive sweetness , and militant gentleness . He found great joy in serving others .
Like his great contemporary Dorothy Day , the Catholic saint who looked at the world through the lens of her heart , Dr. King understood radical love as a form of death—a relentless self-examination in which a fearful , hateful , egoistic self dies daily to be reborn into a courageous , loving , and sacrificial self . For both Day and King , this radical love flows from an imitation of Christ , a response to an invitation of self-surrender in order to emerge fully equipped to fight for justice in a cold and cruel world of domination and exploitation . The scandal of the Cross is precisely the unstoppable and unsuffocatable love that keeps moving in a blood-soaked history , even in our catastrophic times . There is no radical King without his commitment to radical love .
This book unearths a radical King that we can no longer sanitize . His revolutionary witness—embodied in anti-imperial , anti-colonial , anti-racist , and democratic socialist sentiments—was grounded in his courage to think , his courage to love , and his courage to die . Could it be that we know so little of the radical King because such courage defies our market-driven world ?

The dream of the radical King for the first black president surely was not a Wall Street presidency, drone presidency, and surveillance presidency with a vanishing black middle class, devastated black working class, and desperate black poor people clinging to fleeting symbols and empty rhetoric.

I shall never forget the first question I asked Barack Obama when he called to solicit my support: “What is the relation of your presidential policies to the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.?” He replied —in hours of dialogue—that the relation was strong. And I agreed to lend critical support. After sixty-five events, from Iowa to Ohio, in 2008, I knew that most of his advisers were not part of the King legacy. And Obama’s betrayal of what the radical King stands for became undeniable.

Sadly, the damage done by Obama apologists—often for money, access, and status—is immeasurable and nearly unforgivable. For the first time in American history, black citizens are the most pro-war in American society. Black churches are among the weakest in prison ministry—even given the disproportionately high percentage of black prisoners. Black schools are under attack from profiteering enterprises. Forty percent of black children live in poverty. Aside from a few exceptions, black musicians are more and more marginal in popular culture. Black deaths, especially among young people, are out of control. In other words, the Obama apologists who hide and conceal Wall Street crimes, imperial crimes, new Jim Crow crimes, and surveillance lies in order to protect the first black president have much to account for. And a health-care bill—a bonanza for big insurance and drug companies alongside access to new consumers—falls far short of the mark.

The response of the radical King to our catastrophic moment can be put in one word: revolution—a revolution in our priorities, a reevaluation of our values, a reinvigoration of our public life, and a fundamental transformation of our way of thinking and living that promotes a transfer of power from oligarchs and plutocrats to everyday people and ordinary citizens.

The radical King was first and foremost a revolutionary Christian—a black Baptist minister and pastor whose intellectual genius and rhetorical power was deployed in the name of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. King understood this good news to be primarily radical love in freedom and radical freedom in love, a fallible enactment of the Beloved Community or finite embodiment of the Kingdom of God. King’s radical love can be heard in John Coltrane’s “A Love Supreme” or the Isley Brothers’ “Caravan of Love.” This radical love of an intensely hated people is both liberating and contagious, just as this radical freedom of a thoroughly unfree people is both emancipating and infectious.

The radical King was the most significant and effective organic intellectual in the latter half of the twentieth century whose fundamental motif was radical love. King’s radical love was Christocentric in content and black in character. Like the Christocentric language of the Black Church that produced the radical King—Jesus as the Bright and Morning Star against the backdrop of the pitch darkness of the night, as water in dry places, a companion in loneliness, a doctor to the sick, a rock in a wearied land—his Christocentrism exemplifies the intimate and dependent relationship between God and person and between God and a world-forsaken people. The black character of King’s radical love was its roots in the indescribable terror and inimitable trauma of being black in white supremacist America, during slavery, Jim Crow, Sr., or Jim Crow, Jr.

King’s work and witness is a kind of prophetic pneumatology in motion—a kinetic orality, passionate physicality, and combative spirituality that wedded mind to movement, soul to sustenance, and body to empowerment. Like his most worthy theological precursor, Howard Thurman, King pulled from the rich insights of Western thinkers, yet he elevated the lived experiences of wounded, scarred, and bruised bodies of enslaved and Jim-Crowed black peoples to enact radical love.

King’s radical love put a premium on artistic performance and existential praxis. His sermons were performances that authorized an alternative reality to the way the world is. His living radiated a radical tenderness, subversive sweetness, and militant gentleness. He found great joy in serving others.

Like his great contemporary Dorothy Day, the Catholic saint who looked at the world through the lens of her heart, Dr. King understood radical love as a form of death—a relentless self-examination in which a fearful, hateful, egoistic self dies daily to be reborn into a courageous, loving, and sacrificial self. For both Day and King, this radical love flows from an imitation of Christ, a response to an invitation of self-surrender in order to emerge fully equipped to fight for justice in a cold and cruel world of domination and exploitation. The scandal of the Cross is precisely the unstoppable and unsuffocatable love that keeps moving in a blood-soaked history, even in our catastrophic times. There is no radical King without his commitment to radical love.

This book unearths a radical King that we can no longer sanitize. His revolutionary witness—embodied in anti-imperial, anti-colonial, anti-racist, and democratic socialist sentiments—was grounded in his courage to think, his courage to love, and his courage to die. Could it be that we know so little of the radical King because such courage defies our market-driven world?

Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton has labelled the US grand jury system ""broken"" and called on the federal government to address it.

Earlier the US justice department said it will investigate the death of a black man placed in an apparent chokehold by a New York police officer.

Activists have called for a march in Washington next week as a result.

The justice department found a systemic pattern of reckless and inappropriate use of force by officers in Cleveland, a report released on Thursday said.

""We saw too many incidents in which officers accidentally shot someone either because they fired their guns accidentally or because they shot the wrong person,"" the report said.

The public is served by a robust debate online.

Mark Zuckerberg clearly hasn’t gotten the memo.

The founder of Facebook persists in defending free expression, even though free speech has fallen decidedly out of fashion.

His reward for adhering to what once would have been a commonsensical, if not banal, view of the value of the free exchange of ideas is to get vilified for running a hate-speech machine and to get boycotted by major American companies.

In a speech at Georgetown University last fall, Zuckerberg stated that it’s important “we hold each other’s right to express our views and be heard above our own desire to always get the outcomes we want.” He noted that free speech has been central to the worldwide fight for democracy. He hailed Supreme Court jurisprudence that has strengthened First Amendment protections.

We ’ re the younger service , the more progressive service , ” says Coretta Gray , a former officer in the Air Force Judge Advocate General 's Corps . “ We ’ re in a better position to lead than almost any other service . ”
One encouraging conclusion of the GAO report is that , though Black service members across all military branches were more likely to be prosecuted , they were no more likely to be convicted .
In the Air Force , efforts to address racial disparities have included efforts to recruit more Black officers : Last month the Air Force increased the number of full-tuition scholarships available at historically Black colleges and universities by roughly 60 % . The service has also launched “ unconscious bias ” training .
The military is under pressure to fix racial disparities within its justice system , after the U.S. Government Accountability Office report concluded that within the military , allegations against Black service members are more than twice as likely to be brought to a court-martial hearing as those against white service members .
Two years ago , the U.S. military decided to prosecute a Black service member for being six minutes late to a meeting , bringing his case to a court-martial hearing and , ultimately , a conviction .
“ That ’ s a decision that truly should not have been made , ” retired Col. Don Christensen , who previously served as the Air Force ’ s chief prosecutor , told lawmakers in a House Armed Services Committee hearing last month , citing the incident as evidence of racial bias inherent in the U.S. military justice system . “ I have never seen anybody court-martialed for the sole offense of being six minutes late to a meeting – other than this African American . ”
Though he never prosecuted anyone he thought was innocent , he says , nor did he ever see any of his colleagues doing this , Colonel Christensen , who now runs the service member advocacy group Protect Our Defenders , says the problem is that white troops are “ getting the benefit of the doubt , whether based upon the relationship , implicit bias , explicit bias , whatever it was , ” while Black troops aren ’ t .
A U.S. Government Accountability Office report released last year backs these concerns . It concluded that within the military , allegations against Black service members are more than twice as likely to be brought to a court-martial hearing as those against white service members .
Now the Defense Department is under pressure to find out what is going wrong and to fix it . “ This report raises difficult questions – questions that demand answers , ” Lt. Gen. Charles Pede , judge advocate general for the U.S. Army , told lawmakers . “ Sitting here today , we do not have those answers . ”
In the wake of the GAO report , lawmakers added a provision in the most recent defense budget requiring all services to track the same data on racial disparities within the military justice system , to root out causes and find solutions . Critics point out that there has been ample missed opportunity to do just that , however : Pentagon studies over the years have concluded that racial disparities since 1972 were “ consistent and persistent and getting worse . ”
It was as America mobilized for World War II that U.S. military leaders became increasingly concerned about racism in its ranks . Black troops assigned to Southern bases “ had no right to freedom from harassment and physical violence , in large part because the military police frequently chose to attack rather than protect them , ” notes Douglas Bristol , associate professor and specialist in Black military history at the University of Southern Mississippi .
In a disturbingly discriminatory incident typical of the era , three Black soldiers in Houston were having drinks on their night off base when a white policeman called them the n-word . One of the GIs corrected him . “ I am not a n * soldier – we are American soldiers , ” he said . The cop told the Black troops that if they objected again he would kill them . When the cop called for backup , a white MP responded to the scene , telling the Black soldiers that they were in the South where they were “ n * s and would be treated as such. ” The three soldiers were thrown in jail , charged with inciting to riot , which was “ not an entirely bad outcome considering that armed white MPs frequently patrolled the Black neighborhoods of Houston and viciously beat Black soldiers , ” Dr. Bristol says .
Top military commanders generally dismissed racial discrimination as an unavoidable problem from civilian life until , that is , it began posing a threat to the war effort . When anger over mistreatment caused riots to break out among Black troops at bases throughout the U.S. – among U.S. troops executed after courts-martial in Europe , 80 % were Black , though they comprised only 10 % of U.S. forces – Gen. George Marshall , then-Army chief of staff , threatened to fire commanders who did not “ personally and vigorously ” address racism . He also ordered better training for MPs , the use of Black MPs , and new grievance procedures for Black troops , Dr. Bristol says . “ The new policies worked , and although incidents still occurred , their frequency and number diminished greatly . ”
But while the military has taken “ tremendous strides ” to end institutional racism , it still has “ a long way to go towards addressing ” racial disparities in its ranks , says retired Maj. Coretta Gray , who was inspired to join the Air Force after her mom served as a military nurse and her dad as a space and missiles officer . “ My anticipation going in was that it would be just like anywhere else in America – yes , we have issues with race , but that it ’ s more of a meritocracy . ”
While she was serving in the Air Force as a judge advocate general , or lawyer , however , Major Gray , who is Black , saw disparities in how Black and white troops were treated . Though most supervisors “ don ’ t want to tear everybody up or to be prejudiced , ” they do behave in ways that are , often inadvertently , discriminatory , she says .
As the Air Force began to dig into their data , they found two offenses most likely to show discipline disparities by race . One is marijuana use , and the other is known as “ failure to go , ” or being late for work or a meeting . Marijuana charges are “ usually ” the result of random urinalysis , based on the generation of social security numbers by health services , says Ann Stefanek , chief of Air Force Media Operations .
The “ failure to go ” charges gave Air Force officials pause . “ Is the white supervisor treating Black and white airmen the same the first time they ’ re late for work ? Maybe the young white airmen from an area with limited diversity encounters a Black airman for the first time , and maybe the way they deal with each other is completely different , ” Ms. Stefanek says .
For her part , Major Gray says , when she took part in regular meetings with commanders on the status of discipline in various units , “ I ’ ve literally heard in that meeting , ‘ These Black airmen just get in trouble more . ’ ”
The disciplinary record may actually bear that out , she adds , but the charges often hinge on how minor infractions of new service members are handled by young supervisors . One airman may be punished for going AWOL , for example , while another may be told , “ Hey , you better get yourself back to base before you ’ re declared AWOL , ” Major Gray notes . “ I don ’ t think we arm those front-line supervisors with enough training . ”
As a result , young supervisors may treat discipline “ less professionally and more like a social club , ” she says . “ It ’ s about whether ‘ I know you and we go out on weekends and you helped me move , ’ versus ‘ You get this paperwork because I only see you at work and we don ’ t connect . ’ ”
For troops inclined towards racism , it can also be a chance for “ personal prejudice to have a ton of room to run , ” she says . This might include giving a new recruit they don ’ t like “ all the bad tasks , making them work overtime , punishing them for not wearing their [ hat ] before they go outside – all the high school bullying stuff , but with real consequences . ”
If people complain about unequal treatment , they can easily be gaslit , Major Gray says . “ They ’ re told , ‘ You took that wrong , ’ or ‘ I ’ m sure they were just joking , ’ or ‘ There was some other reason you didn ’ t get that particular job or training opportunity. ’ Sometimes it ’ s , ‘ They just don ’ t like your attitude . ’
“ But why is it that it ’ s all these Black females who have an attitude ? Some have told me , ‘ I was literally sitting in my resting face , and he told me I had an attitude . ’ ”
There ’ s often a legitimate reason for disciplinary action , particularly among new troops , and “ of course you should be on time to meetings , ” Ms. Gray says , “ so these cases for the most part run in a way that it ’ s hard to point out any racism directly . ”
The biggest step the military could take toward substantiating some of these biases , whether conscious or unconscious , is through the tracking of low-level administrative paperwork – the letters of counseling , admonishment , and reprimand – that generally don ’ t account for courts-martial in themselves , but when they accumulate can be used to build a bigger case for a denied promotion or dismissal .
“ I can already hear people groaning , ‘ Oh , another metric to track , ” Ms. Gray says . “ But the perception is that you ’ re not going to get the benefit of the doubt if you ’ re Black . I ’ ve seen it . ”
Col. Bill Orr , associate director of the Air Force judiciary and a retired JAG and military trial judge , agrees , particularly since the racial disparities overwhelmingly crop up among younger troops . His department plans to begin tracking this data , he says . Adds Ms. Stefanek , “ We acknowledge that the numbers tell a story , and we need to get to the bottom of why those numbers reflect what they do . ”
It doesn ’ t help military justice , officials say , that the officer corps isn ’ t more diverse . For example , when he retired in 2014 , Col. Christensen told lawmakers , only 1 in 124 colonels in the Air Force JAG Corps were Black . Throughout the Pentagon , 78 % of officers are white , and 8 % are Black . There are two African American four-star generals in the U.S. military .
Colonel Orr , who is Black , says he remembers what it feels like to be the only Black officer in the room . “ I see new JAGs go through the same thing and you ’ re trying to convince them to stay. ” He tells them , “ I wouldn ’ t have spent 30-something years in the Air Force if I didn ’ t think this is a good place to be . They need to have the impression that somebody does care – that somebody does understand what it ’ s like to be the only person in the room . ”
In the wake of the HASC hearing , the Air Force last month increased the number of full-tuition scholarships available at historically black colleges and universities by roughly 60 % , in an effort to get more Black officers into its ranks .
The Air Force has also launched unconscious bias training , designed to point out inadvertent ways in which service members and leaders may be perpetuating racism . It will be an important “ conversation starter , ” Colonel Orr says . “ It will help keep people from committing unforced errors . ”
One encouraging conclusion of the GAO report is that in terms of convictions and punishment , there is no statistical difference between Black and white troops , “ except for Black service members in the Navy were less likely to be dismissed or discharged after a conviction , ” Brenda Farrell , director of the GAO ’ s Defense Capabilities and Management Team , told lawmakers .
In other words , she said , though Black service members were more likely to be prosecuted , they were no more likely – and in some cases , less likely – to be convicted . “ That makes sense from what I saw , ” Major Gray says . “ Once you make it to the court-martial and have all eyes on it , it evens out . It shows that the system works – not always , but mostly . ”

This bodes well for future initiatives to address racial disparity , analysts add . “ I think the Air Force can fix this . We ’ re the younger service , the more progressive service , ” Major Gray says . “ We ’ re in a better position to lead than almost any other service . ”
It will be an ongoing effort , top military officials say . “ Our struggle against racism and other forms of discrimination can not be viewed as finite battles , ” Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Rockwell , judge advocate general for the Air Force , told lawmakers . “ Rather our approach must be infinite , a constant struggle for betterment . ”","This may bode well for future initiatives. “I think the Air Force can fix this. We’re the younger service, the more progressive service,” says Coretta Gray, a former officer in the Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps. “We’re in a better position to lead than almost any other service.”

One encouraging conclusion of the GAO report is that, though Black service members across all military branches were more likely to be prosecuted, they were no more likely to be convicted.

In the Air Force, efforts to address racial disparities have included efforts to recruit more Black officers: Last month the Air Force increased the number of full-tuition scholarships available at historically Black colleges and universities by roughly 60%. The service has also launched “unconscious bias” training.

The military is under pressure to fix racial disparities within its justice system, after the U.S. Government Accountability Office report concluded that within the military, allegations against Black service members are more than twice as likely to be brought to a court-martial hearing as those against white service members.

Two years ago, the U.S. military decided to prosecute a Black service member for being six minutes late to a meeting, bringing his case to a court-martial hearing and, ultimately, a conviction.

“That’s a decision that truly should not have been made,” retired Col. Don Christensen, who previously served as the Air Force’s chief prosecutor, told lawmakers in a House Armed Services Committee hearing last month, citing the incident as evidence of racial bias inherent in the U.S. military justice system. “I have never seen anybody court-martialed for the sole offense of being six minutes late to a meeting – other than this African American.”

Though he never prosecuted anyone he thought was innocent, he says, nor did he ever see any of his colleagues doing this, Colonel Christensen, who now runs the service member advocacy group Protect Our Defenders, says the problem is that white troops are “getting the benefit of the doubt, whether based upon the relationship, implicit bias, explicit bias, whatever it was,” while Black troops aren’t.

A U.S. Government Accountability Office report released last year backs these concerns. It concluded that within the military, allegations against Black service members are more than twice as likely to be brought to a court-martial hearing as those against white service members.

Now the Defense Department is under pressure to find out what is going wrong and to fix it. “This report raises difficult questions – questions that demand answers,” Lt. Gen. Charles Pede, judge advocate general for the U.S. Army, told lawmakers. “Sitting here today, we do not have those answers.”

In the wake of the GAO report, lawmakers added a provision in the most recent defense budget requiring all services to track the same data on racial disparities within the military justice system, to root out causes and find solutions. Critics point out that there has been ample missed opportunity to do just that, however: Pentagon studies over the years have concluded that racial disparities since 1972 were “consistent and persistent and getting worse.”

A legacy of discrimination

It was as America mobilized for World War II that U.S. military leaders became increasingly concerned about racism in its ranks. Black troops assigned to Southern bases “had no right to freedom from harassment and physical violence, in large part because the military police frequently chose to attack rather than protect them,” notes Douglas Bristol, associate professor and specialist in Black military history at the University of Southern Mississippi.

In a disturbingly discriminatory incident typical of the era, three Black soldiers in Houston were having drinks on their night off base when a white policeman called them the n-word. One of the GIs corrected him. “I am not a n* soldier – we are American soldiers,” he said. The cop told the Black troops that if they objected again he would kill them. When the cop called for backup, a white MP responded to the scene, telling the Black soldiers that they were in the South where they were “n*s and would be treated as such.” The three soldiers were thrown in jail, charged with inciting to riot, which was “not an entirely bad outcome considering that armed white MPs frequently patrolled the Black neighborhoods of Houston and viciously beat Black soldiers,” Dr. Bristol says.

Top military commanders generally dismissed racial discrimination as an unavoidable problem from civilian life until, that is, it began posing a threat to the war effort. When anger over mistreatment caused riots to break out among Black troops at bases throughout the U.S. – among U.S. troops executed after courts-martial in Europe, 80% were Black, though they comprised only 10% of U.S. forces – Gen. George Marshall, then-Army chief of staff, threatened to fire commanders who did not “personally and vigorously” address racism. He also ordered better training for MPs, the use of Black MPs, and new grievance procedures for Black troops, Dr. Bristol says. “The new policies worked, and although incidents still occurred, their frequency and number diminished greatly.”

But while the military has taken “tremendous strides” to end institutional racism, it still has “a long way to go towards addressing” racial disparities in its ranks, says retired Maj. Coretta Gray, who was inspired to join the Air Force after her mom served as a military nurse and her dad as a space and missiles officer. “My anticipation going in was that it would be just like anywhere else in America – yes, we have issues with race, but that it’s more of a meritocracy.”

A double standard

While she was serving in the Air Force as a judge advocate general, or lawyer, however, Major Gray, who is Black, saw disparities in how Black and white troops were treated. Though most supervisors “don’t want to tear everybody up or to be prejudiced,” they do behave in ways that are, often inadvertently, discriminatory, she says.

As the Air Force began to dig into their data, they found two offenses most likely to show discipline disparities by race. One is marijuana use, and the other is known as “failure to go,” or being late for work or a meeting. Marijuana charges are “usually” the result of random urinalysis, based on the generation of social security numbers by health services, says Ann Stefanek, chief of Air Force Media Operations.

The “failure to go” charges gave Air Force officials pause. “Is the white supervisor treating Black and white airmen the same the first time they’re late for work? Maybe the young white airmen from an area with limited diversity encounters a Black airman for the first time, and maybe the way they deal with each other is completely different,” Ms. Stefanek says.

For her part, Major Gray says, when she took part in regular meetings with commanders on the status of discipline in various units, “I’ve literally heard in that meeting, ‘These Black airmen just get in trouble more.’”

The disciplinary record may actually bear that out, she adds, but the charges often hinge on how minor infractions of new service members are handled by young supervisors. One airman may be punished for going AWOL, for example, while another may be told, “Hey, you better get yourself back to base before you’re declared AWOL,” Major Gray notes. “I don’t think we arm those front-line supervisors with enough training.”

As a result, young supervisors may treat discipline “less professionally and more like a social club,” she says. “It’s about whether ‘I know you and we go out on weekends and you helped me move,’ versus ‘You get this paperwork because I only see you at work and we don’t connect.’”

For troops inclined towards racism, it can also be a chance for “personal prejudice to have a ton of room to run,” she says. This might include giving a new recruit they don’t like “all the bad tasks, making them work overtime, punishing them for not wearing their [hat] before they go outside – all the high school bullying stuff, but with real consequences.”

If people complain about unequal treatment, they can easily be gaslit, Major Gray says. “They’re told, ‘You took that wrong,’ or ‘I’m sure they were just joking,’ or ‘There was some other reason you didn’t get that particular job or training opportunity.’ Sometimes it’s, ‘They just don’t like your attitude.’

“But why is it that it’s all these Black females who have an attitude? Some have told me, ‘I was literally sitting in my resting face, and he told me I had an attitude.’”

There’s often a legitimate reason for disciplinary action, particularly among new troops, and “of course you should be on time to meetings,” Ms. Gray says, “so these cases for the most part run in a way that it’s hard to point out any racism directly.”

The biggest step the military could take toward substantiating some of these biases, whether conscious or unconscious, is through the tracking of low-level administrative paperwork – the letters of counseling, admonishment, and reprimand – that generally don’t account for courts-martial in themselves, but when they accumulate can be used to build a bigger case for a denied promotion or dismissal.

civil_rights,New York Times - News,0,http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/us/politics/for-president-obama-a-complex-calculus-of-race-and-politics.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0,"For President, a Complex Calculus of Race and Politics ",2012-10-21,Jodi Kantor,"“ Tragically , it seems the president feels boxed in by his blackness , ” the radio and television host Tavis Smiley wrote in an e-mail . “ It has , at times , been painful to watch this particular president ’ s calibrated , cautious and sometimes callous treatment of his most loyal constituency , ” he continued , adding that “ African-Americans will have lost ground in the Obama era . ”
Such criticism leaves the president feeling resentful and betrayed , aides said , by those he believes should be his allies . The accusations are “ an assault on his being , ” said David Axelrod , his chief strategist — not to mention a discomfiting twist in a re-election fight in which the turnout of black voters , who express overwhelming loyalty to the president but also some disappointment , could sway the result .
But like an actor originating a role on Broadway , Mr. Obama has been performing a part that no one else has ever played , and close observers say they can see him becoming as assured on race in public as he is in private conversation . In 2009 , the new president ’ s statement on the arrest of a black Harvard professor by a white police officer set off days of negative headlines ; in 2012 , he gave a commanding but tender lament over the killing of a black teenager , Trayvon Martin , by a white man .
“ As he ’ s gotten more comfortable being president , he ’ s gotten more comfortable being him , ” said Brian Mathis , an Obama fund-raiser .
Asked when they could sense that shift , several advisers and friends mentioned the waning hours of Mr. Obama ’ s birthday party in the summer of 2011 . As the hour grew late , many of the white guests left , and the music grew “ blacker and blacker , ” as the comedian Chris Rock later told an audience . Watching African-American entertainers and sports stars do the Dougie to celebrate a black president in a house built by slaves , Mr. Rock said , “ I felt like I died and went to black heaven . ”
The president , guests recalled , seemed free of calibration or inhibition . He danced with relative abandon , other guests ribbing him about his moves , everyone swaying to Stevie Wonder under a portrait of George Washington .
In the White House , Mr. Obama has relied on a long-term strategy on race and politics that he has been refining throughout his career .
As far back as 1995 , former colleagues at the University of Chicago remember him talking about moving away from the old politics of grievance and using common economic interests to bind diverse coalitions . “ He argued that if political action and political speeches are tailored solely to white audiences , minorities will withdraw , just as whites often recoil when political action and speeches are targeted to racial minority audiences , ” recalled William Julius Wilson , now a sociologist at Harvard .
Mr. Wilson had turned the world of social policy on its head by arguing that class was becoming more determinative than race in America and pointing out that race-specific remedies were less politically feasible than economic policies that benefited a broad range of people . The young politician absorbed Mr. Wilson ’ s ideas , which matched his own experience as a community organizer and a person whose own life did not fit neat racial categories .
Mr. Obama now presides over a White House that constantly projects cross-racial unity . When discussing in interviews what image the Obamas want to project , aides use one word more than any other : “ inclusive. ” Concerts of Motown and civil-rights-era songs have been stocked with musicians of many races , and in introducing them , the president emphasizes how the melodies brought disparate Americans together . Though the Memphis sanitation workers were involved in a shattering moment of the civil rights struggle — Dr. King was assassinated after going to support their strike — they were invited to the White House for a labor event , not a race-oriented one .
Many of the president ’ s most critical domestic policy decisions have disproportionately benefited African-Americans : stimulus money that kept public sector workers employed , education grants to help underperforming schools and a health care overhaul that will cover tens of millions of uninsured Americans . But he invariably frames those as policies intended to help Americans of all backgrounds .
“ If you really want to get something done , you can ’ t put it in a way that will kill it before it gets going , ” Mr. Obama said in one meeting , according to the Rev . Al Sharpton . “ We have to deal with the specific problems of different groups — blacks , women , gays and lesbians , immigrants — in a way that doesn ’ t allow people to put these wedges in , ” Mr. Sharpton recalled the president saying in another .
That approach , along with the memories of the toxic campaign battles over Mr. Obama ’ s former pastor , the Rev . Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , has resulted in a White House that often appears to tiptoe around race .
Debra Lee , the chairman and chief executive of Black Entertainment Television , requested interviews with the Obamas in 2009 , but press aides told her that they did not want the first couple on BET in the first six months of the administration , she said in an interview . ( They appeared later . )
“ There was all this caution and concern because we were in the midst of a great American experiment , ” one former aide said . Another aide remembered palpable nervousness about the artwork the Obamas chose for their private quarters in the White House , including some with race-specific messages .
In private , White House aides frequently dissect the racial dynamics of the presidency , asking whether Representative Joe Wilson , Republican of South Carolina , would have yelled “ You lie ! ” at a white president during an address to Congress or what Tea Party posters saying “ Take Back Our Country ” really mean . Michelle Obama , often called the glue in her husband ’ s relationship with black voters , sometimes remarks publicly or privately about the pressures of being the first black first lady .

Her husband is more circumspect , particularly on the question of whether some of his opposition is fueled by race . Aides say the president is well aware that some voters say they will never be comfortable with him , as well as the occasional flashes of racism on the campaign trail , such as the “ Put the White Back in the White House ” T-shirt spotted at a recent Mitt Romney rally . But they also say he is disciplined about not reacting because doing so could easily backfire .
“ The president knows that some people may choose to be divided by differences — race , gender , religion — but his focus is on bringing people together , ” Valerie Jarrett , a senior adviser , wrote in an e-mail .
Even when Newt Gingrich called him a “ food stamp president ” during the Republican primaries , the most the president did was shoot confidants a meaningful look — “ the way he will cock his head , an exaggerated smile , like ‘ I ’ m not saying but I ’ m saying , ’ ” one campaign adviser said .
To blacks who accuse him of not being aggressive on race , Mr. Obama has a reply : “ I ’ m not the president of black America , ” he has said . “ I ’ m the president of the United States of America . ”
That statement “ makes me want to vomit , ” Cornel West , an activist and Union Theological Seminary professor , said in an interview . “ Did you say that to the business round table ? ” he asked rhetorically . “ Do you say that to Aipac ? ” he said , referring to a pro-Israel lobbying group .
Members of the Congressional Black Caucus , with whom the president has a contentious relationship , have echoed the charges that Mr. Obama is insufficiently attentive to African-Americans , even threatening at times to sandbag his agenda .
Even some of Mr. Obama ’ s black supporters privately express the same anxiety , in more muted form . At the first meeting of his top campaign donors last year , some black donors were dismayed when officials handed out cards with talking points on the administration ’ s achievements for various groups — women , Jews , gays and lesbians — and there was no card for African-Americans .
The accusation that Mr. Obama does not care about black suffering appears to carry little weight with the African-American public , and yet it tears at the president , say aides , friends and supporters .
After a 2010 speech at the National Urban League , he approached Mr. West . “ He just came at me tooth and nail , ” Mr. West said . “ Are you saying I ’ m not a progressive ? ” Mr. West recalled the president asking .
Mellody Hobson , an Obama fund-raiser , explained why the accusation was painful .
“ You expect your family to give you the benefit of the doubt , ” she said .
Shortly before his 2009 inauguration , Barack Obama took his family to see the Lincoln Memorial . “ First African-American president , better be good , ” a 10-year-old Malia Obama told her father , who repeated the story later , a rare acknowledgment of the symbolic shadow he casts .
For all of Mr. Obama ’ s caution , he is on a mission : to change stereotypes of African-Americans , aides and friends say . Six years ago , he told his wife and a roomful of aides that he wanted to run for the White House to change children ’ s perceptions of what was possible . He had other ambitions for the presidency , of course , but he was also embarking on an experiment in which the Obamas would put themselves and their children on the line to help erase centuries of negative views .
While Mr. Obama resists being the president of black America , he does want to change black America , aides say — to break apart long-held beliefs about what African-Americans can and can not do . The president , who appointed Lisa P. Jackson and Charles F. Bolden Jr. as the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA , wants to encourage black achievement in science and engineering , even urging black ministers to preach about the need to study those subjects .
Mr. Obama knows that the next presidential candidate of color may be judged by his own performance , added Charles J. Ogletree , a Harvard law professor . And Mr. Obama ’ s desire to win re-election in part because he is the first black president is “ so implicit it ’ s just like breathing , ” one White House adviser said .
On rare occasions , Mr. Obama allows others a glimpse of the history , expectations and hope he carries with him . At the funeral of the civil rights leader Dorothy Height in 2010 , he wept openly . Again and again , those close to him say , Mr. Obama is moved by the grace with which other blacks who broke the color barrier behaved under pressure .
When Ruby Bridges Hall went to see the famous Norman Rockwell portrait of her marching into school , which Mr. Obama had hung just outside the Oval Office , the president opened up a bit . The painting shows a 6-year-old Ms. Hall in an immaculate white dress walking calmly into school , a hurled tomato and a racial slur on the wall behind her .
The president asked Ms. Hall , now 58 , how she summoned up such courage at that age and said he sometimes found his daughters staring at the portrait . “ I really think they see themselves in this little girl , ” he said , according to an interview with Ms. Hall .
“ Doing the work we do , it gets really lonely , ” Ms. Hall said . “ I felt like we understood each other because we belong to the same club . ”","“Tragically, it seems the president feels boxed in by his blackness,” the radio and television host Tavis Smiley wrote in an e-mail. “It has, at times, been painful to watch this particular president’s calibrated, cautious and sometimes callous treatment of his most loyal constituency,” he continued, adding that “African-Americans will have lost ground in the Obama era.”

But they also say he is disciplined about not reacting because doing so could easily backfire.

“The president knows that some people may choose to be divided by differences — race, gender, religion — but his focus is on bringing people together,” Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser, wrote in an e-mail.

Even when Newt Gingrich called him a “food stamp president” during the Republican primaries, the most the president did was shoot confidants a meaningful look — “the way he will cock his head, an exaggerated smile, like ‘I’m not saying but I’m saying,’ ” one campaign adviser said.

To blacks who accuse him of not being aggressive on race, Mr. Obama has a reply: “I’m not the president of black America,” he has said. “I’m the president of the United States of America.”

That statement “makes me want to vomit,” Cornel West, an activist and Union Theological Seminary professor, said in an interview. “Did you say that to the business round table?” he asked rhetorically. “Do you say that to Aipac?” he said, referring to a pro-Israel lobbying group.

Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, with whom the president has a contentious relationship, have echoed the charges that Mr. Obama is insufficiently attentive to African-Americans, even threatening at times to sandbag his agenda.

Even some of Mr. Obama’s black supporters privately express the same anxiety, in more muted form. At the first meeting of his top campaign donors last year, some black donors were dismayed when officials handed out cards with talking points on the administration’s achievements for various groups — women, Jews, gays and lesbians — and there was no card for African-Americans.

The accusation that Mr. Obama does not care about black suffering appears to carry little weight with the African-American public, and yet it tears at the president, say aides, friends and supporters.

After a 2010 speech at the National Urban League, he approached Mr. West. “He just came at me tooth and nail,” Mr. West said. “Are you saying I’m not a progressive?” Mr. West recalled the president asking.

Mellody Hobson, an Obama fund-raiser, explained why the accusation was painful.

“You expect your family to give you the benefit of the doubt,” she said.

Out to Change Stereotypes

Shortly before his 2009 inauguration, Barack Obama took his family to see the Lincoln Memorial. “First African-American president, better be good,” a 10-year-old Malia Obama told her father, who repeated the story later, a rare acknowledgment of the symbolic shadow he casts.

For all of Mr. Obama’s caution, he is on a mission: to change stereotypes of African-Americans, aides and friends say. Six years ago, he told his wife and a roomful of aides that he wanted to run for the White House to change children’s perceptions of what was possible. He had other ambitions for the presidency, of course, but he was also embarking on an experiment in which the Obamas would put themselves and their children on the line to help erase centuries of negative views.

While Mr. Obama resists being the president of black America, he does want to change black America, aides say — to break apart long-held beliefs about what African-Americans can and cannot do. The president, who appointed Lisa P. Jackson and Charles F. Bolden Jr. as the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, wants to encourage black achievement in science and engineering, even urging black ministers to preach about the need to study those subjects.

Mr. Obama knows that the next presidential candidate of color may be judged by his own performance, added Charles J. Ogletree, a Harvard law professor. And Mr. Obama’s desire to win re-election in part because he is the first black president is “so implicit it’s just like breathing,” one White House adviser said.

On rare occasions, Mr. Obama allows others a glimpse of the history, expectations and hope he carries with him. At the funeral of the civil rights leader Dorothy Height in 2010, he wept openly. Again and again, those close to him say, Mr. Obama is moved by the grace with which other blacks who broke the color barrier behaved under pressure.

When Ruby Bridges Hall went to see the famous Norman Rockwell portrait of her marching into school, which Mr. Obama had hung just outside the Oval Office, the president opened up a bit. The painting shows a 6-year-old Ms. Hall in an immaculate white dress walking calmly into school, a hurled tomato and a racial slur on the wall behind her.

The president asked Ms. Hall, now 58, how she summoned up such courage at that age and said he sometimes found his daughters staring at the portrait. “I really think they see themselves in this little girl,” he said, according to an interview with Ms. Hall.

As midnight approaches, the tension here gets thicker. Everyone fears that just like Monday, things could turn violent at any moment.

Outside the City Hall, crowds flip a police cruiser on its side briefly, break out its windows, then set it on fire. Police move in quickly to put it out. They use pepper gas and tell the crowd over loudspeakers to disperse.

""Refuse to leave and you will be subject to arrest,"" the voice says.

""We are bringing more resources to Ferguson and other parts of the region to prevent a repetition of the lawlessness experienced overnight,"" the governor said. ""We must do better and we will.""

Nationwide protests

Demonstrations devolved into chaos late Monday after it was announced that the grand jury had decided not to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Brown. Wilson, a white police officer, shot and killed Brown, a black teenager, on August 9.

In Ferguson, buildings were burned. Stores were looted and shots were fired. Activists also took to streets across the country, with dozens and dozens of protests in several states.

""They have given us no justice! We will give them no peace,"" protesters chanted as they massed in front of the Underground Atlanta shopping district in Atlanta.

The timing is most likely not a coincidence . Sessions ' 25-page memo discusses concerns about when the federal government may or may not impose mandates that violate the religious beliefs of businesses , and one of his points is bluntly titled `` Americans do not give up their freedom of religion by participating in the marketplace , partaking of the public square , or interacting with government . '' It references the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case rejecting contraception mandates .
The memo itself does not specifically reference gay or transgender people , but given that its instructions are about how Department of Justice agencies should take religious freedom issues in mind when enforcing laws , contracting , and distributing grants , there was an immediate concern from LGBT activist groups and allies that this was the `` permission to discriminate '' they 've suspected the administration had been planning all along , but had not yet come .
Chad Griffin , president of the Human Rights Campaign , certainly did n't hold back in blasting the potential impact on gay and transgender people : `` This blatant attempt to further Donald Trump 's cynical and hateful agenda will enable systematic , government-wide discrimination that will have a devastating impact on LGBTQ people and their families . Donald Trump and Mike Pence have proven they will stop at nothing to target the LGBTQ community and drag our nation backwards . We will fight them every step of the way . ''
It 's actually not terribly clear , though , that this memo makes much of a difference in how the current Justice Department will tackle LGBT discrimination issues because of how it is already tackling LGBT issues .
Understand , the Justice Department under Sessions is already reversing many of the positions it held under President Barack Obama . The Justice Department is now taking the position that federal civil rights laws do not include gay and transgender discrimination under the aegis of sex-based discrimination . The Trump administration has already retracted the guidance from the Obama administration mandating that schools accommodate transgender students in use of public restrooms and locker rooms . And the Justice Department in an upcoming Supreme Court case has taken the side of a baker in Colorado who declined to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple ( Disclosure : so has the ███ Foundation ) .
The Human Rights Campaign worries about some additional outcomes , though : That government officials themselves will be able to refuse to do their jobs when it comes to dealing with gay or transgender people ( see : Kim Davis ) ; and that federal contractors and faith-based organizations like hospitals would be able to discriminate against LGBT people and be able to refuse to provide services even in a crisis . So forget the wedding cakes : They 're concerned about people getting turned away from hospitals or homeless shelters .
I do n't want to dismiss the possibility of that happening , but it 's important to note that religious freedom laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act do not just give blanket permission for people to violate the law by wrapping themselves in some holy scripture . Sessions knows that , and part of his memo explains what government officials have to show if they 're going to try to overcome a person 's religious objections :
So if the government can make a case that it has a compelling interest ( like protecting public safety ) and that it 's taking the least restrictive means to do so it can require people to obey a law that hospitals not turn away gay or transgender people , for example .
The unanswerable concern , though , is whether a Sessions-run Justice Department actually would act in cases of emergencies or take steps to make sure that government agencies themselves treat LGBT people equally as the law demands when it comes to areas like marriage rights and benefits . If , indeed , a federal government employee refuses to process Social Security claims from somebody in a same-sex marriage , what happens ? Clearly , given that same-sex marriages are legally recognized by the federal government , it can not just refuse claims . Well , it could try , but I predict the courts are not interested in reconsidering the Supreme Court 's ruling on gay marriage recognition and the government would lose .
In that respect , we 'll have to see what the Justice Department actually does . Sessions has been careful to frame his reversals of Obama administrations ' positions as different interpretations of the law not as anti-gay or anti-transgender posturing .

Al Sharpton: Marchers want action, not nostalgia

Standing on the spot where 50 years earlier the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. made ""I have a dream"" the clarion call of the civil rights movement, a broader call for equality rang out Saturday.

Thousands rallied at the National Mall to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic August 28, 1963, March on Washington.

Leaders from civil rights, religious and civic organizations paid tribute to those who fought and continue to fight for racial equality, but the slate of demands today has expanded to other hot-button issues.

Income inequality, discrimination based on sexual orientation and mistreatment of immigrants were all themes espoused by the dozens of speakers.

""I am a daughter of the civil rights movement, and as a daughter I am a beneficiary of all the good that resulted from the hard work, the sweat and tears, and the blood that was shed by the leaders and doers of that movement,"" Jennifer Jones Austin of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies told the crowd. ""And as a daughter and a beneficiary, I am now the burden-bearer of this generation's civil rights movement.""

That burden, she said, includes equal rights for gays and fights against poverty and gun violence.

Attorney General Eric Holder credited King's famous words for providing a foundation for the progress of the civil rights movement.

""Our focus has broadened to include the cause of women, of Latinos, of Asian-Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people with disabilities and of countless others across this great country who still yearn for equality, opportunity and fair treatment,"" he said.

Many speakers invoked the killing of Trayvon Martin as an example of where they see a lack of justice for African-Americans.

Martin Luther King III, son of the civil rights icon, said his father's vision was a nation without racial discrimination. ""But sadly, the tears of Trayvon Martin's mother and father reminds us that far too frequently, the color of one's skin remains a license to profile.""

In 1963, ""we could not have imagined we'd be here 50 years later with a black president and a black attorney general, but that's a measure of how far we have come,"" civil rights activist Julian Bond said. ""But still, we march.""

Minorities have never wished their way to freedom, he said, but have worked their way up, and must continue to do so.

The court in June invalidated the formula used to determine which states or local jurisdictions -- mostly in the South -- could remain under special federal oversight, requiring approval from Washington before they can change voting procedures.

That blunted much of the government's enforcement power in states and localities with a history of discrimination at the polls.

""We didn't forget the price they paid,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said, referring to those on the front lines of the civil rights movement. ""We've fought too hard, our parents shed too much blood, there was too many nights in jail, for you to take our vote from us now.""

Sharpton said organized protests to demand a reinstatement of the provisions are forthcoming.

Kathleen Johnson and Jean McRae were at the first March on Washington 50 years ago, and as the crowd grew on Saturday, they reflected on the span in between.

""It was a wonderful experience (in 1963) because prior to that there were many things going on in the United States that were not right,"" Johnson said.

The injustices that existed in 1963 convinced Johnson and her family and friends to attend the march.

""We had to be there. We had to be a part of it,"" she said.

The fight for equality that the original march embodied remains a work in progress, McRae said, which makes Saturday's event so important.

""We need this, especially now,"" she said.

Both women wore buttons from the march in 1963.

Saturday's event is the first of two rallies to mark the anniversary.

President Barack Obama headlines another event Wednesday, the exact anniversary of the March on Washington, where MLK delivered the now-famous speech at the Lincoln Memorial.

The Wednesday event will include a longer march through Washington and speeches by Obama and former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

When the Supreme Court in 2015 recognized a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, it was a huge step forward for equality, but the ruling didn’t resolve the deep religious divisions over gay marriage that endure.

One of those battles arrives Tuesday at the Supreme Court, a case in which Colorado baker Jack Phillips cites his religious and free expression rights for refusing in 2012 to design a custom cake for a gay couple’s wedding.

It is a landmark battle that, in essence, pits the baker’s right to practice his Christian faith against the rights of Charlie Craig and David Mullins to be free from discrimination as they go about their public lives. Respecting religious rights is one of the nation's fundamental values, but so is respecting the rights of individuals to be treated equally.

OPPOSING VIEW:Here's why I can’t custom-design cakes for same-sex weddings

In front of the justices, the arguments will be couched in the complexities of the First Amendment’s guarantee of free expression: Phillips argues that his artistic cakes express his ideas about marriage and are entitled to full constitutional protection. But the battle also comes down to a simple idea enshrined in American law and values: When you open a business in this country and sell to the public, you agree to abide by public accommodation laws.

On those grounds, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and a state appeals court ruled against Phillips. And unless the Supreme Court decides to turn its back on that core principle of equality, it should do the same.

For the court to rule otherwise would open the door to discrimination by all sorts of vendors who claim artistic expression: photographers, chefs, suit and dress designers, florists and wedding planners, to name a few.

While the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of religion and expression are both fundamental rights, neither is unlimited. An old saying, “Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man’s nose begins,” is apropos. Phillips has an absolute right to his religious beliefs, but when the practice of his religion infringes on the rights of others to equal treatment, it goes too far.

In the past, the Supreme Court has set limits on freedom of speech and religion. The court has repeatedly ruled that constitutional rights do not nullify neutral laws on everything from racial equality to taxes. An Amish farmer, for example, refused to pay Social Security taxes for workers based on his religious belief that the community and not the government should care for the elderly and needy. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1982 that by becoming an employer, the farmer freely entered into commercial activity and accepted certain limits on the exercise of his beliefs.

And so it is with Phillips.

Forty-five states have public accommodation laws that prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, ancestry and religion. Twenty-two also prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Colorado is one of them.

Phillips and his lawyers try to make a distinction: The baker isn’t discriminating against gay people because he’s willing to sell them anything off his store shelves, but he is not willing to use his artistry to celebrate their marriage. No doubt he is sincere.

Even so, the distinction does not change the fact that Mullins and Craig and others will be summarily turned away, if the court rules for Phillips. Of course they can get a cake somewhere else, which Mullins and Craig did. That's not the point. They were humiliated and treated as second-class citizens when Phillips turned them away.

In passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Senate recognized that discrimination ""is about the humiliation, frustration and embarrassment that a person must surely feel when he is told that he is unacceptable as a member of the public because of his race or color.” Or, today, because he loves someone of the same sex and chooses to get married.

Allowing that sort of unequal treatment is not what America is about. The public will be better served if the Supreme Court puts a stop to it now.

During a doctor ’ s office visit in February , she was asked to list her emergency contacts . Johns , a preschool teacher in Seattle , wrote down two people -- Chris and Joan -- and identified both as her “ partners. ” They are two of the four romantic interests Johns has been involved with for many years .
“ ‘ Oh , that ’ s so dirty , ’ ” Johns recalled the receptionist saying . “ And the receptionist literally stepped back from me , in a doctor ’ s office . ”
Johns , 58 , is a polyamorist . She follows a non-monogamous lifestyle in which multiple partners give each other consent to date and have sex with others . Johns ’ s longest polyamorous relationship has lasted 36 years , twice as long as her former marriage to a polyamorous man . She talks openly about her partners to her preschool students and others .
“ I have lost jobs , I ’ ve lost an apartment , I ’ ve lost a car loan , ” because of her lifestyle , Johns said . “ I ’ ve lost friendly relations with neighbors . ”
Despite the acceptance of campus hook-up culture and Tinder-arranged trysts , more intentional forms of consensual non-monogamy – which can include polygamy , polyamory , open marriages , group marriages , swinging and “ relationship anarchy ” – are highly stigmatized . Such behavior is widely considered to be abusive , immoral , or emotionally stunted . People in such relationships not only face rudeness and public shaming , they also lack legal protections against discrimination in employment , housing and child custody disputes .
Polyamorists distinguish their lifestyle from cheating and adultery because , they say , it hinges on the consent of all parties , and can involve unmarried people . Activists say such behavior is more common than many people presume . Some studies suggest that as many as a fifth of Americans have engaged in consensual non-monogamy at some point in their lives . The studies show that at any given time , an estimated 4 % to 5 % of the population is in a consensually non-monogamous relationship .
Katie Hill in a pro-equality appearance in California -- before her fledgling congressional career was brought up short by allegations of being involved in a “ throuple ” including a staffer .
While the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing are expected to put a temporary damper on polyamory , those numbers could rise if the social disincentives were removed – in part because some adulterers and cheaters could become consensual non-monogamists .
Activists are moving to dismantle the legal and social barriers , and say their goals are beginning to take shape .
They are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people , gays , lesbians , women and blacks . Not too long ago , those marginalized groups were also viewed as unnatural , depraved or inferior , until negative judgments became socially unacceptable and often illegal .
The aspirations of non-monogamists don ’ t sound like such a moonshot in an increasingly tolerant society where a transgender man can menstruate and experience childbirth , and Pete Buttigieg , a gay man married to another man , can make a serious run for U.S. president .
As the topic breaks into the mainstream , some churches are beginning to grapple with the issue , and polyamorous students are forming university clubs and organizing events . Last fall polyamory got attention , some of it sympathetic , when California Rep. Katie Hill , was forced to resign over allegations she was having an affair with a campaign staffer in a “ throuple ” with her then-husband . A recent TV episode of “ House Hunters '' featured three adults searching for a home to build their polyamorous nest , and Hollywood celebrities are opening up about their polyamorous lifestyles as well .
Lifestyle personality Aubrey Marcus says he has been in an open relationship with his fiance Whitney Miller since 2013 . He gives advice on ethical non-monogamy on his website .
“ There is plenty of evidence that consensual non-monogamy is an emerging civil rights movement , ” said Heath Schechinger , a counseling psychologist at the University of California , Berkeley , and co-chair of the Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force , recently created within the American Psychological Association . “ I 've heard from a number of people advocating for relationship structure diversity over the past 20 years who are elated about this issue finally gaining traction . ”
Activists are already working with elected officials in more than a dozen local governments , especially in California , to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class , “ relationship structure , ” said Berkeley psychologist and poly activist Dave Doleshal .
Most efforts are at the informal stage but the city of Berkeley did consider a formal proposal to extend protections in housing , employment , business practices , city facilities or education to swingers , polyamorists and other non-monogamists . The proposal stalled last year amid concerns that it would have required employers to provide health insurance to numerous sexual and romantic partners outside of marriage .
Pro-polyamory marchers in San Francisco in 2004 . Especially in California , there are moves afoot to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class : “ relationship structure . ”
Undaunted by that setback , advocates continue to generate a body of ideas and theories that normalize non-monogamy as a form of positive sexuality -- and possibly an identity -- following a script followed by other marginalized groups . Their efforts have led to reassessments of non-monogamy in the psychological and legal fields , contending the relationships are emotionally healthy and ethical , and thus forging a social movement with a shared identity , shared vocabulary , shared history and a shared desire for full recognition .
Over the past two decades , nearly 600 academic papers have been written on the subject of non-monogamy , according to one count , including an assessment of the benefits to children in polyamorous families . Such research creates a body of scholarship to counteract ingrained social attitudes that poly advocates call prejudices and misconceptions . At the same time , the field has spawned more than 50 books , mostly written by women , said Kenneth Haslam , 85 , a retired anesthesiologist and polyamorist in Durham , N.C. , who helped create the polyamory history archive at the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington , Ind .
Brian Watson , author of “ Annals of Pornographie : How Porn Became ‘ Bad ’ ” ( 2016 ) , is co-authoring a book on non-monogamy throughout history . He said it will feature 50 to 100 prominent figures , such as Victor Hugo and Virginia Woolf , and is deliberately modeled on earlier works about famous gay people .
Just as women ’ s rights grew from feminist legal theory and LGBTQ rights from queer theory , non-monogamy is also developing its own historiography , scholarship and theoretical frameworks .
The polyamory flag . Advocates are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people , gays , lesbians , women and blacks .
Still , it 's not easy to pinpoint a polyamorist profile . They are less likely to identify as heterosexual or to conform to gender norms , but academic studies and anecdotal evidence do n't tell a single story . While some non-monogamists consider themselves neo-pagans , anarchists or socialists , others are libertarians or outwardly conventional suburbanites . Some studies say the lifestyle attracts more men , others say more women ; some say it appeals to affluent whites , others say a polyamorist 's average annual income is under $ 40,000 .
In the legal arena , sympathetic scholars are arguing for the extension of legal reforms adopted in family law in recent decades in response to the continued erosion of the nuclear family , which is no longer America ’ s dominant family structure .
At least a dozen states now recognize or allow for the possibility of a child having more than two parents , an accommodation for surrogate parents , grandparents , stepparents and other nontraditional families , according to a February legal article by Edward Stein , a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York .
These expansions of the legal concept of family are potential pathways for non-monogamous families to win legal rights of their own , Stein said . Another potential legal opening could be the existing precedents in domestic partnerships and civil unions that were set up locally for gays and lesbians before same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 . In both cases , legal victories for one group could be extended to another group , a common way that legal developments happen , he said .
The first steps would likely have to be decriminalizing of adultery in the 38 states that don ’ t distinguish between consensual and non-consensual non-monogamy . The prohibition of adultery is comparable to anti-sodomy laws whose repeal by the Supreme Court in 2003 cleared an obstacle for recognizing gay marriage , Stein said .
The 1961 science fiction classic often cited as an inspiration by non-monogamists .
“ I think what we will see is a lot of chipping away at the edges of some of the restrictions we put on what a family is and what a family does , ” said Janet W. Hardy , who has written on polyamory for more than 20 years . “ When the legal challenge comes – and it will – I don ’ t think it will be from people who identify themselves as poly . I think it will come from blended families and some of the other ways that we are reforming around the idea of family that are legally challenging . ”
One such example was a recent effort by Hartford , Conn. , authorities to evict eight adults and three children living as a single family in a 6,000-square-foot mansion .
The combined family was not polyamorous , said their lawyer , Peter Goselin , but shared financial , domestic and child-rearing responsibilities . In 2014 the city alleged a violation of its zoning rules for single-family homes , but after two years of litigation , the city dropped its case .
The joint owners and residents of the home claimed a constitutional right to define a family . The octet ’ s lawsuit against the city includes a brief history of communal family living , from Iroquois longhouses , which housed up to 20 family units , to the communes , cooperatives and collective households of the 19th and 20th centuries .
“ They saw the implications of it , ” Goselin said . “ Privately they said to me we know this would be encouraging to a lot of people who are in polyamorous relationships . ”
Advocates say that the warnings against the perils of non-monogamy echo the now-debunked concerns about same-sex marriage .
“ All of the well-known objections made against multi-person intimate relationships can be made against same- or opposite-sex monogamy as well , resulting in an indefensible double standard , ” Ronald C. Den Otter , a political science professor at California Polytechnic Institute wrote in a 2015 article in the Emory Law Review . “ Sadly , many two-person intimate relationships are dysfunctional , and a closer , more brutally honest look at them should not inspire confidence in their superiority . ”
Once changes get under way , things can move quickly . The rise of the modern gay rights movement in the mid-20th century led to a decision by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973 to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders ( gender dysphoria was de-pathologized in 2012 ) . Those medical reversals are seen as analogous to the American Psychological Association ’ s creation last year of its Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force , formed to destigmatize such relationships and explore changes in public policy .
Schechinger , the task force co-chair , said it ’ s much easier to stereotype and hate a marginalized group when people in the normative majority operate by stereotypes and misinformation .
“ That ’ s part of what the task force is seeking to accomplish – to gather empirical data , promote accurate information about CNM relationships , and ask if these relationships are causing harm or are not , ” he said . “ And what are the implications on society for promoting a one-size-fits-all model versus promoting people being in touch with what ’ s the good fit for them . ”
As with the debates over human nature during the gay rights struggle , non-monogamy advocates are also raising the possibility that desiring multiple sexual partners is less a lifestyle choice and more of a sexual orientation . But there can be little doubt that non-monogamy , the norm in the animal kingdom , is natural , and that monogamy is a cultural ideal that developed in humans .
But the yen for sexual variety and adventure competes with an equally insistent bugbear : jealousy . And some believe that “ green-eyed monster of jealousy ” is the more powerful force , making it unlikely that most people could tolerate consensual non-monogamy for their partners and accept it is a social norm .
Kay Hymowitz : “ Normalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to ‘ privilege ’ male desire . ”
“ In the long run there ’ s going to be some resistance because it ’ s threatening to everybody else , because they recognize the desire for multiple partners is something they have , too , ” said David Barash , a zoologist and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle , and author of “ The Myth of Monogamy : Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People ” ( 2001 ) . “ They recognize it touches something within themselves that they ’ d rather keep hidden . And something in their partner that they don ’ t want to acknowledge , either . ”
Kay Hymowitz , a scholar at the conservative Manhattan Institute , is also skeptical . Her concern is the unintended harmful consequences of disrupting long-established social norms developed to ensure that men commit to rearing their own children , and that powerful , wealthy men don ’ t hoard women and create a deficit of available options for other males . “ Normalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to ‘ privilege ’ male desire , ” she said . “ I know , I know : There are women who believe strongly in consensual non-monogamy [ and who ] may truly be happier in those relationships than they would be in vanilla relationships . Good for them . But they are a small minority . ”
Hymowitz said that the individual rights of polyamorists , swingers and commune members have to be weighed against the greater social interest , and that case has yet to be made .
“ You ’ re creating one more arrangement that will be less stable for children and less permanent , ” she said . We have enough problems as it is keeping couples together . ”
Nonetheless , longer life expectancies , greater personal freedoms for women , dating apps and the internet are transforming sexual expectations and sexual opportunities , said Elisabeth “ Eli ” Sheff , CEO of Sheff Consulting in Chattanooga , Tenn. , which specializes in sex and gender minorities , and provides expert witness services and relationship coaching . She ’ s also the author of the 2014 book , “ The Polyamorists Next Door : Inside Multiple-Partner Relationships and Families , ” based on a longitudinal study of more than 500 polyamorists .
“ We don ’ t live in a monogamous society . We live in a society in which people pretend monogamy is the norm , ” said Johns , the Seattle polyamorist who offered the poly mantra that it ’ s possible to romantically love more than one friend just as it ’ s possible to love more than one child .
Non-monogamy has a long history , more ancient than King David ’ s multiple wives and concubines in the Old Testament . Today ’ s non-monogamists often cite as their inspiration novelist Robert Heinlein ’ s treatment of the subject in his 1961 sci-fi classic “ Stranger in a Strange Land. ” Gay men are sometimes hailed as trend setters because they are accustomed to flexible “ monogamish ” marital arrangements that allow for outside dalliances .
The Bible includes numerous instances of non-monogamy , including King Solomon , depicted in his old age being led astray into idolatry by his wives .
One of the primary texts associated with the contemporary movement is Janet W. Hardy and Dossie Easton ’ s 1997 “ The Ethical Slut ” which lays out the best practices for what advocates hold up as consensual , ethical and responsible non-monogamy .
“ I don ’ t think it has ever had the groundswell that it has now , ” said Hardy , who now is running into polyamorous adults brought up by polyamorous parents . “ A lot of us are second-generation now . ”
Poly activists point to many parallels between earlier movements that were born underground and operated under the radar : secret clubs , insider argot , referral networks for poly-friendly therapists , doctors and lawyers . The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom 's Kink and Poly Aware Professionals referral list includes about 300 lawyers , said Susan Wright , the Baltimore-based organization 's executive director .
The world of polyamory overlaps with the subculture of kink and BDSM , which refers to the erotic practices of bondage , domination , submission and sadomasochism . As a sign of the movement ’ s maturation , some now embrace the kind of middle-class respectability that made gay marriage palatable to mainstream society .
`` We ’ re a very boring and respectable couple ! '' polyamorist Carrie Ichikawa Jenkins beamed to The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2017 . Jenkins , a University of British Columbia philosophy professor , has a husband and a boyfriend , both of whom teach at UBC . The Chronicle article paints a portrait of the polyamorous triad in domestic hues befitting Norman Rockwell : “ On the wall hang sepia-toned photographs of someone ’ s relatives . On the front porch are a swing and a coffee table with an ashtray on it . ”

The civil rights concerns of the non-monogamous and other minorities are dissimilar in some ways . Unlike earlier civil rights movements , non-monogamy has the potential of affecting a majority of the population , since membership in the group is theoretically open to everyone .
“ In a way , poly is a deeper threat to the dominant culture than gay culture , ” said Geoffrey Miller , a polyamorist in an open marriage and a psychology professor at the University of New Mexico .
Miller , a member of the APA task force , compares the state of non-monogamy movement to gay rights in 1966 , in the calm before the storm of the Stonewall Riots , the 1969 protests that launched the modern gay rights movement . The closeted movement had about 50 organizations in the late 1960s but exploded to 1,000 by the mid-1970s , said John D ’ Emilio , a retired professor at the University of Illinois , Chicago , who taught on the history of sexuality and the LGBTQ movement , and is co-author of “ Intimate Matters : A History of Sexuality in America ” ( 1988 ) .
Conservatives had long warned that redefining marriage to allow same-sex unions would throw open the door to allowing any kind of marriage , from polygamy to incest . Those arguments reached a crescendo when gay marriage was winding its way through the legal system , en route to the 2015 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage . In that 5-4 decision , Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissenting opinion warning of what was to come .
“ It is striking how much of the majority ’ s reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage , ” Roberts wrote . “ Why would there be any less dignity in the bond between three people who , in exercising their autonomy , seek to make the profound choice to marry ? ”
Robert P. George , law professor : `` We have quickly gone from , ‘ It will never happen , ’ to ‘ You ’ re a bigot for thinking there is anything wrong with it . ’ ”
Princeton professor of jurisprudence Robert George was among those who warned of the slippery slope . In a 2015 article , he predicted that the civil rights challenges were inevitable , but initially judges would “ swat away on procedural grounds the first few constitutional challenges to marriage laws. ” Gradually the legal objections will give way to the force of logical consistency .
He told RealClearInvestigations in an email that this process is often characterized by indignant dismissal of the logical implications , followed by total capitulation .
“ Of course , advocates of revising the law denounced us not only as ‘ bigots ’ but as ‘ scare-mongers , ’ ” George said . “ There was , they insisted , no ‘ slippery slope ’ from same-sex marriage to polyamory . The two concepts had nothing to do with each other .
“ I could see that this was nonsense — often disingenuous nonsense , ” George said . “ So I am not in the least surprised to see what is happening now . We have quickly gone from , ‘ It will never happen , ’ to ‘ You ’ re a bigot for thinking there is anything wrong with it . ’ ”","It was only a few months ago that someone last treated Cassie Johns like a freak.

During a doctor’s office visit in February, she was asked to list her emergency contacts. Johns, a preschool teacher in Seattle, wrote down two people -- Chris and Joan -- and identified both as her “partners.” They are two of the four romantic interests Johns has been involved with for many years.

“‘Oh, that’s so dirty,’” Johns recalled the receptionist saying. “And the receptionist literally stepped back from me, in a doctor’s office.”

Johns, 58, is a polyamorist. She follows a non-monogamous lifestyle in which multiple partners give each other consent to date and have sex with others. Johns’s longest polyamorous relationship has lasted 36 years, twice as long as her former marriage to a polyamorous man. She talks openly about her partners to her preschool students and others.

But her forthrightness has a price.

“I have lost jobs, I’ve lost an apartment, I’ve lost a car loan,” because of her lifestyle, Johns said. “I’ve lost friendly relations with neighbors.”

Despite the acceptance of campus hook-up culture and Tinder-arranged trysts, more intentional forms of consensual non-monogamy – which can include polygamy, polyamory, open marriages, group marriages, swinging and “relationship anarchy” – are highly stigmatized. Such behavior is widely considered to be abusive, immoral, or emotionally stunted. People in such relationships not only face rudeness and public shaming, they also lack legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing and child custody disputes.

Polyamorists distinguish their lifestyle from cheating and adultery because, they say, it hinges on the consent of all parties, and can involve unmarried people. Activists say such behavior is more common than many people presume. Some studies suggest that as many as a fifth of Americans have engaged in consensual non-monogamy at some point in their lives. The studies show that at any given time, an estimated 4% to 5% of the population is in a consensually non-monogamous relationship.

While the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing are expected to put a temporary damper on polyamory, those numbers could rise if the social disincentives were removed – in part because some adulterers and cheaters could become consensual non-monogamists.

Activists are moving to dismantle the legal and social barriers, and say their goals are beginning to take shape.

They are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people, gays, lesbians, women and blacks. Not too long ago, those marginalized groups were also viewed as unnatural, depraved or inferior, until negative judgments became socially unacceptable and often illegal.

The aspirations of non-monogamists don’t sound like such a moonshot in an increasingly tolerant society where a transgender man can menstruate and experience childbirth, and Pete Buttigieg, a gay man married to another man, can make a serious run for U.S. president.

As the topic breaks into the mainstream, some churches are beginning to grapple with the issue, and polyamorous students are forming university clubs and organizing events. Last fall polyamory got attention, some of it sympathetic, when California Rep. Katie Hill, was forced to resign over allegations she was having an affair with a campaign staffer in a “throuple” with her then-husband. A recent TV episode of “House Hunters"" featured three adults searching for a home to build their polyamorous nest, and Hollywood celebrities are opening up about their polyamorous lifestyles as well.

Lifestyle personality Aubrey Marcus says he has been in an open relationship with his fiance Whitney Miller since 2013. He gives advice on ethical non-monogamy on his website.

“There is plenty of evidence that consensual non-monogamy is an emerging civil rights movement,” said Heath Schechinger, a counseling psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-chair of the Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force, recently created within the American Psychological Association. “I've heard from a number of people advocating for relationship structure diversity over the past 20 years who are elated about this issue finally gaining traction.”

Activists are already working with elected officials in more than a dozen local governments, especially in California, to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class, “relationship structure,” said Berkeley psychologist and poly activist Dave Doleshal.

Most efforts are at the informal stage but the city of Berkeley did consider a formal proposal to extend protections in housing, employment, business practices, city facilities or education to swingers, polyamorists and other non-monogamists. The proposal stalled last year amid concerns that it would have required employers to provide health insurance to numerous sexual and romantic partners outside of marriage.

Pro-polyamory marchers in San Francisco in 2004. Especially in California, there are moves afoot to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class: “relationship structure.”

Undaunted by that setback, advocates continue to generate a body of ideas and theories that normalize non-monogamy as a form of positive sexuality -- and possibly an identity -- following a script followed by other marginalized groups. Their efforts have led to reassessments of non-monogamy in the psychological and legal fields, contending the relationships are emotionally healthy and ethical, and thus forging a social movement with a shared identity, shared vocabulary, shared history and a shared desire for full recognition.

And, yes, there is already a polyamory pride flag.

Over the past two decades, nearly 600 academic papers have been written on the subject of non-monogamy, according to one count , including an assessment of the benefits to children in polyamorous families. Such research creates a body of scholarship to counteract ingrained social attitudes that poly advocates call prejudices and misconceptions. At the same time, the field has spawned more than 50 books, mostly written by women, said Kenneth Haslam, 85, a retired anesthesiologist and polyamorist in Durham, N.C., who helped create the polyamory history archive at the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Ind.

Brian Watson, author of “Annals of Pornographie: How Porn Became ‘Bad’” (2016), is co-authoring a book on non-monogamy throughout history. He said it will feature 50 to 100 prominent figures, such as Victor Hugo and Virginia Woolf, and is deliberately modeled on earlier works about famous gay people.

Just as women’s rights grew from feminist legal theory and LGBTQ rights from queer theory, non-monogamy is also developing its own historiography, scholarship and theoretical frameworks.

The polyamory flag. Advocates are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people, gays, lesbians, women and blacks.

Still, it's not easy to pinpoint a polyamorist profile. They are less likely to identify as heterosexual or to conform to gender norms, but academic studies and anecdotal evidence don't tell a single story. While some non-monogamists consider themselves neo-pagans, anarchists or socialists, others are libertarians or outwardly conventional suburbanites. Some studies say the lifestyle attracts more men, others say more women; some say it appeals to affluent whites, others say a polyamorist's average annual income is under $40,000.

In the legal arena, sympathetic scholars are arguing for the extension of legal reforms adopted in family law in recent decades in response to the continued erosion of the nuclear family, which is no longer America’s dominant family structure.

At least a dozen states now recognize or allow for the possibility of a child having more than two parents, an accommodation for surrogate parents, grandparents, stepparents and other nontraditional families, according to a February legal article by Edward Stein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York.

These expansions of the legal concept of family are potential pathways for non-monogamous families to win legal rights of their own, Stein said. Another potential legal opening could be the existing precedents in domestic partnerships and civil unions that were set up locally for gays and lesbians before same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015. In both cases, legal victories for one group could be extended to another group, a common way that legal developments happen, he said.

The first steps would likely have to be decriminalizing of adultery in the 38 states that don’t distinguish between consensual and non-consensual non-monogamy. The prohibition of adultery is comparable to anti-sodomy laws whose repeal by the Supreme Court in 2003 cleared an obstacle for recognizing gay marriage, Stein said.

The 1961 science fiction classic often cited as an inspiration by non-monogamists.

“I think what we will see is a lot of chipping away at the edges of some of the restrictions we put on what a family is and what a family does,” said Janet W. Hardy, who has written on polyamory for more than 20 years. “When the legal challenge comes – and it will – I don’t think it will be from people who identify themselves as poly. I think it will come from blended families and some of the other ways that we are reforming around the idea of family that are legally challenging.”

One such example was a recent effort by Hartford, Conn., authorities to evict eight adults and three children living as a single family in a 6,000-square-foot mansion.

The combined family was not polyamorous, said their lawyer, Peter Goselin, but shared financial, domestic and child-rearing responsibilities. In 2014 the city alleged a violation of its zoning rules for single-family homes, but after two years of litigation, the city dropped its case.

The joint owners and residents of the home claimed a constitutional right to define a family. The octet’s lawsuit against the city includes a brief history of communal family living, from Iroquois longhouses, which housed up to 20 family units, to the communes, cooperatives and collective households of the 19th and 20th centuries.

“They saw the implications of it,” Goselin said. “Privately they said to me we know this would be encouraging to a lot of people who are in polyamorous relationships.”

Advocates say that the warnings against the perils of non-monogamy echo the now-debunked concerns about same-sex marriage.

“All of the well-known objections made against multi-person intimate relationships can be made against same- or opposite-sex monogamy as well, resulting in an indefensible double standard,” Ronald C. Den Otter, a political science professor at California Polytechnic Institute wrote in a 2015 article in the Emory Law Review. “Sadly, many two-person intimate relationships are dysfunctional, and a closer, more brutally honest look at them should not inspire confidence in their superiority.”

Once changes get under way, things can move quickly. The rise of the modern gay rights movement in the mid-20th century led to a decision by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973 to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders (gender dysphoria was de-pathologized in 2012). Those medical reversals are seen as analogous to the American Psychological Association’s creation last year of its Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force, formed to destigmatize such relationships and explore changes in public policy.

Schechinger, the task force co-chair, said it’s much easier to stereotype and hate a marginalized group when people in the normative majority operate by stereotypes and misinformation.

“That’s part of what the task force is seeking to accomplish – to gather empirical data, promote accurate information about CNM relationships, and ask if these relationships are causing harm or are not,” he said. “And what are the implications on society for promoting a one-size-fits-all model versus promoting people being in touch with what’s the good fit for them.”

As with the debates over human nature during the gay rights struggle, non-monogamy advocates are also raising the possibility that desiring multiple sexual partners is less a lifestyle choice and more of a sexual orientation. But there can be little doubt that non-monogamy, the norm in the animal kingdom, is natural, and that monogamy is a cultural ideal that developed in humans.

And some believe that “green-eyed monster of jealousy” is the more powerful force, making it unlikely that most people could tolerate consensual non-monogamy for their partners and accept it is a social norm.

Kay Hymowitz: “Normalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to ‘privilege’ male desire.”

“In the long run there’s going to be some resistance because it’s threatening to everybody else, because they recognize the desire for multiple partners is something they have, too,” said David Barash, a zoologist and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, and author of “The Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People” (2001). “They recognize it touches something within themselves that they’d rather keep hidden. And something in their partner that they don’t want to acknowledge, either.”

Kay Hymowitz, a scholar at the conservative Manhattan Institute, is also skeptical. Her concern is the unintended harmful consequences of disrupting long-established social norms developed to ensure that men commit to rearing their own children, and that powerful, wealthy men don’t hoard women and create a deficit of available options for other males. “Normalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to ‘privilege’ male desire,” she said. “I know, I know: There are women who believe strongly in consensual non-monogamy [and who] may truly be happier in those relationships than they would be in vanilla relationships. Good for them. But they are a small minority.”

The White House called the decision by Lewis and Thompson not to attend “unfortunate.”

Trump concluded his remarks by saying: “Today we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality justice and peace.”",www.reuters.com,center,cPSCyxpW2JzmMBSv

Speaking to a crowd of about 40,000 at the Edmund Pettus bridge where marchers were attacked by state troopers in 1965 , Mr. Obama said it ’ s a “ common mistake ” for Americans to believe that “ racism is banished. ” He pointed to this week ’ s Justice Department report that found widespread patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson , Missouri , police department .
“ We just need to open our eyes , and ears , and hearts , to know that this nation ’ s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us , ” Mr. Obama said . “ Citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago — the protection of the law . ”
About 10 minutes into Mr. Obama ’ s speech , a group of protestors carrying signs such as “ stop the violence ” began to bang a drum and chant “ we want change , ” drowning out his remarks for part of the crowd . The chanting drew angry reactions from some in the audience until police moved the protesters away .
Mr. Obama drew a connection between the events of 50 years ago and his current efforts to reform the criminal justice system .
“ Together , we can address unfair sentencing , and overcrowded prisons , and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men , and rob the nation of too many men who could be good dads , and good workers , and good neighbors , ” he said .
The president also praised the marchers of long ago , including Rep. John Lewis , Georgia Democrat , for serving as catalysts of change for the better .
“ The change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African-Americans who run boardrooms , who sit on the bench , who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities ; from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office , ” Mr. Obama said . “ Because of what they did , the doors of opportunity swung open not just for black folks , but for every American . What they did here will reverberate through the ages . ”
Thousands gathered in Selma to mark the anniversary of the march , a landmark event of the civil rights movement that led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . First lady Michelle Obama , former President George W. Bush and about 100 members of Congress also attended the event .
Speaker John Boehner , Ohio Republican , didn ’ t attend but issued a statement on the anniversary .
“ Today , 50 years after the Selma to Montgomery marches began , the House honors the brave foot soldiers who risked their lives to secure the blessings of liberty for all Americans , ” Mr. Boehner said .
Mr. Obama said the clash on the bridge was “ a contest to determine the true meaning of America . ”
“ In one afternoon fifty years ago , so much of our turbulent history – the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war ; the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow ; the death of four little girls in Birmingham , and the dream of a Baptist preacher – all that history met on this bridge , ” Mr. Obama said .
The president used the occasion to criticize voter ID laws in many Republican-controlled states , and the Supreme Court decision in 2013 to strike down a key section of the Voting Rights Act . The ruling allowed nine mostly southern states to change their election laws without advance federal approval .
“ Fifty years after Selma , there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote , ” Mr. Obama said . “ As we speak , more of such laws are being proposed . Meanwhile , the Voting Rights Act , the culmination of so much blood and sweat and tears , the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence , stands weakened , its future subject to political rancor . How can that be ? ”
Noting that the Voting Rights Act has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support , the president added , “ One hundred members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it . If we want to honor this day , let these hundred go back to Washington , and gather four hundred more , and together , pledge to make it their mission to restore the law this year . ”
Mr. Obama also chastised voter apathy , saying too many citizens today are taking for granted the sacrifices of the civil-rights marchers of a half-century ago .
“ What is our excuse today for not voting ? ” he asked . “ How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought ? ”
Although he was not a foot soldier in the civil-rights movement , the president said that he benefited from its achievements . And Mr. Obama inserted his own 2008 campaign slogan into the historical mix of popular phrases that have signified revolutionary changes .
“ The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word ‘ We , ’ ” Mr. Obama said . “ We The People . We Shall Overcome . Yes We Can . Fifty years from Bloody Sunday , our march is not yet finished . But we are getting closer . ”

Speaking Thursday at a women ’ s conference in Massachusetts , Mrs. Clinton prefaced her remarks by talking about the criminal justice system , which has come under the spotlight in the wake of a grand jury ’ s decision not to pursue charges against a New York City police officer in the choking death of an unarmed black man and a separate grand jury ’ s declining to indict a Ferguson police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man .
“ I know that a lot of hearts are breaking , and we are asking ourselves , ‘ Aren ’ t these our sons ? Aren ’ t these our brothers ? ’ ” Mrs. Clinton said . “ Those families and those communities , and our country , deserve a full and fair accounting , as well as whatever substantive reforms are necessary to ensure equality , justice , and respect for every citizen . ”
On Wednesday , news broke that a grand jury would not indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the choking death of unarmed 43-year-old Eric Garner over the summer on Staten Island . That followed the recent decision of a grand jury not to bring criminal charges against white police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson .
Mrs. Clinton , seen as a frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination if she runs , said that more broadly , “ each of us ” has to grapple with some “ hard truths ” about “ race and justice in America . ”
“ Because despite all the progress we ’ ve made together , African-Americans , most particularly African-American men , are still more likely to be stopped and searched by police , charged with crimes , and sentenced to longer prison terms , ” she said .
She pointed out that the U.S. has less than 5 percent of world ’ s population and almost 25 percent of the world ’ s total prison population , but said the discrepancy is not because Americans are more violent or criminal .
“ But it is because we have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance , and I personally hope that these tragedies give us the opportunity to come together as a nation to find our balance again , ” she said .
All over the country , she said , there are “ creative and effective ” police departments that keep people safe without relying on excessive force or incarceration and that there exist officers who inspire trust and confidence , rather than fear and frustration .
“ So let ’ s learn from the best examples . Let ’ s invest in what works , let ’ s make sure that federal funds to state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices , rather than buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets or contribute to unnecessary force or arrests , ” she said , drawing applause .

But that isn’t stopping groups spanning the ideological spectrum and representing an array of interests from seizing on the 50th anniversary of his march on Washington to champion their individual causes — no matter how tenuous the nexus to King’s legacy of battling racial injustice might seem.

( PHOTOS: Scenes from March on Washington)

Everyone wants a piece of the King action, which started Saturday with a march retracing the 1963 route and continues Wednesday with a day of speeches commemorating the civil rights icon at the Lincoln Memorial.

Gun control advocates who have been protesting Florida’s so-called stand your ground laws trekked north to participate. Advocates for D.C. statehood held a rally at the District of Columbia War Memorial. The Republican National Committee is hosting a luncheon Monday to discuss the party’s outreach to African-Americans.

Even Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban hosted auditions in Washington last week for minority small business owners to be on his TV show, “Shark Tank.” Organizers explained that it corresponds with “a new shift in the movement from civil rights to economic rights.”

Martin Luther King III, the civil rights leader’s oldest living child, said he’s not concerned that all of this dilutes his father’s core message. His goal this week, he said, is “to arouse a new coalition of conscience” that can counter the energy of the tea party movement.

King III said the recent Supreme Court ruling dismantling a key part of the Voting Rights Act, as well as rising income inequality and the Trayvon Martin shooting, have reminded communities of color that they need to protest in the streets and lobby Congress for action.

“This is not a commemoration, but it is a continuation of the movement that my father helped lead,” he told POLITICO.

Alveda King worries that tying specific social causes to her uncle diminishes his overarching significance. She said he was “an imperfect human who served a perfect God” and wants the celebrations to focus on a unifying message of love.

“There are so many definitions of, ‘What does civil rights mean?’ … It’s a natural thing that people would say, ‘Surely this is what Martin Luther King was marching for,’” said Alveda King, who has her own ministry and is active in a group called Priests for Life. “Fifty years have showed us that fighting for causes will not unite us.”

The gay community has closely aligned itself with the tributes. Multiple events honor the late Bayard Rustin, who helped organize the 1963 march and was openly gay, and a coalition of more than 40 groups signed an open letter calling for “clear federal laws barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.”

The answer is to the White House . Obama 's presidency is about smaller , less inspiring questions than his 2008 campaign .
Obama 's presidency is bounded by the limits of the office and the demands of the moment . It is about what America needs to do right now — the next budget , the next bill , next year 's taxes , the last war . Candidates can muse . Presidents must govern .
Obama 's 2008 campaign was about what kind of country America is ; how to read its past to best guide its future . His speech in Selma — which is really worth reading in its entirety — was among the best of his presidency precisely because it had almost nothing to do with his presidency ; it was a return to the central topic of his campaign .
Historians who want to understand Obama will find few better summations than the two paragraphs at the core of this speech :
We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable , or that racial division is inherent to America . If you think nothing 's changed in the past fifty years , ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or L.A. of the Fifties . Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing 's changed . Ask your gay friend if it 's easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago . To deny this progress — our progress — would be to rob us of our own agency ; our responsibility to do what we can to make America better . Of course , a more common mistake is to suggest that racism is banished , that the work that drew men and women to Selma is complete , and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the `` race card '' for their own purposes . We do n't need the Ferguson report to know that 's not true . We just need to open our eyes , and ears , and hearts , to know that this nation 's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us . We know the march is not yet over , the race is not yet won , and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as much .
Those 230 words are a precise distillation of Obama 's view of America , and the role politics must play in it .
The first paragraph is Obama 's case for hope : America is improving ; it has always been improving , and to deny that improvement is to steal from Americans a belief in their country that they have more than earned . `` To deny this progress — our progress — would be to rob us of our own agency , '' he said .
The second paragraph is Obama 's case for change : America 's sins are not vanquished ; its hatreds remain real ; its racism still breathes . `` We know the march is not yet over , '' Obama said , `` the race is not yet won , and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as much .

Hope and change . These are the two ideas that form the steady core of Obama 's politics . But , more than that , they are the two ideas that define , for Obama , what kind of country America is — and what it means to serve it .
Obama 's critics question his love for the country he governs . `` I do not believe — and I know this is a horrible thing to say — but I do not believe that the president loves America , '' former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in February . They look at Obama 's steady belief that America is not yet good enough , not yet pure enough , not yet perfect enough , and they see a skeptic , not a patriot .
In this speech , Obama 's answer to this criticism was direct :
Fellow marchers , so much has changed in fifty years . We 've endured war , and fashioned peace . We 've seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives , and take for granted convenience our parents might scarcely imagine . But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship , that willingness of a 26 year-old deacon , or a Unitarian minister , or a young mother of five , to decide they loved this country so much that they 'd risk everything to realize its promise . That 's what it means to love America . That 's what it means to believe in America . That 's what it means when we say America is exceptional .
There is an implicit radicalism in what Obama is saying here . To believe America is good enough is to abandon the tradition of criticism and activism that has made America great .
Obama 's answer to Giuliani is that Giuliani has mistaken uncritical adoration for the hard work required of true love . Patriotism is active , not passive . Those who love America prove it by working to perfect America . They continue marching .","President Obama's supporters sometimes wonder where the inspirational candidate of 2008 has gone. The answer is to the White House. Obama's presidency is about smaller, less inspiring questions than his 2008 campaign.

Obama's presidency is bounded by the limits of the office and the demands of the moment. It is about what America needs to do right now — the next budget, the next bill, next year's taxes, the last war. Candidates can muse. Presidents must govern.

Obama's 2008 campaign was about what kind of country America is; how to read its past to best guide its future. His speech in Selma — which is really worth reading in its entirety — was among the best of his presidency precisely because it had almost nothing to do with his presidency; it was a return to the central topic of his campaign.

Historians who want to understand Obama will find few better summations than the two paragraphs at the core of this speech:

We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, or that racial division is inherent to America. If you think nothing's changed in the past fifty years, ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or L.A. of the Fifties. Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing's changed. Ask your gay friend if it's easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago. To deny this progress — our progress — would be to rob us of our own agency; our responsibility to do what we can to make America better. Of course, a more common mistake is to suggest that racism is banished, that the work that drew men and women to Selma is complete, and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the ""race card"" for their own purposes. We don't need the Ferguson report to know that's not true. We just need to open our eyes, and ears, and hearts, to know that this nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us. We know the march is not yet over, the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as much.

Those 230 words are a precise distillation of Obama's view of America, and the role politics must play in it.

The first paragraph is Obama's case for hope: America is improving; it has always been improving, and to deny that improvement is to steal from Americans a belief in their country that they have more than earned. ""To deny this progress — our progress — would be to rob us of our own agency,"" he said.

The second paragraph is Obama's case for change: America's sins are not vanquished; its hatreds remain real; its racism still breathes. ""We know the march is not yet over,"" Obama said, ""the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as much.""

Hope and change. These are the two ideas that form the steady core of Obama's politics. But, more than that, they are the two ideas that define, for Obama, what kind of country America is — and what it means to serve it.

Obama's critics question his love for the country he governs. ""I do not believe — and I know this is a horrible thing to say — but I do not believe that the president loves America,"" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in February. They look at Obama's steady belief that America is not yet good enough, not yet pure enough, not yet perfect enough, and they see a skeptic, not a patriot.

In this speech, Obama's answer to this criticism was direct:

Fellow marchers, so much has changed in fifty years. We've endured war, and fashioned peace. We've seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives, and take for granted convenience our parents might scarcely imagine. But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship, that willingness of a 26 year-old deacon, or a Unitarian minister, or a young mother of five, to decide they loved this country so much that they'd risk everything to realize its promise. That's what it means to love America. That's what it means to believe in America. That's what it means when we say America is exceptional.

There is an implicit radicalism in what Obama is saying here. To believe America is good enough is to abandon the tradition of criticism and activism that has made America great.

Obama's answer to Giuliani is that Giuliani has mistaken uncritical adoration for the hard work required of true love. Patriotism is active, not passive. Those who love America prove it by working to perfect America. They continue marching.",www.vox.com,left,NWQ0uPAwBNZJd3FB

civil_rights,New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2019/07/16/ag-barr-made-decision-to-not-bring-charges-against-eric-garner-cop-official/,Barr made decision to not bring charges against Eric Garner cop: official,2019-07-16,,"The decision to not prosecute NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Eric Garner ’ s death was ultimately made by Attorney General William Barr himself — because of “ insufficient evidence ” in the case , Brooklyn ’ s top prosecutor announced Tuesday .
US Attorney Richard Donoghue said that after an extensive five-year investigation , the Department of Justice couldn ’ t prove that Pantaleo “ acted in willful violation of the law ” — while noting that Garner was not in a chokehold when he repeatedly gasped , “ I can ’ t breathe . ”
“ For anyone to die under circumstances like this is a tremendous loss . For the family to suffer as this family has only compounds that loss , ” Donoghue said at a press conference . “ But these unassailable facts are separate and distinct from whether a federal crime has been committed . And the evidence here does not support charging Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo or any other officer with a federal criminal civil rights violation . ”
He later said , “ Significantly , Officer Pantaleo was not engaged in a chokehold on Mr. Garner when he said he could not breathe , and neither Officer Pantaleo nor any other officer applied a chokehold to Mr. Garner after he first said he could not breathe . ”
The decision to not bring civil rights charges against Pantaleo comes the day before the statute of limitations in the case was to set to expire — and the fifth anniversary of Garner ’ s death on July 17 , 2014 .
Prosecutors met with Garner ’ s family and their advisers Tuesday morning ahead of announcing the decision , which leaked about 90 minutes beforehand .
Donoghue said the government was tasked with the uphill battle of proving beyond a reasonable doubt “ that an officer willfully used more force than he reasonably could have believed was necessary under the circumstances . ”
He also pointed to a disagreement among medical experts as to the cause of Garner ’ s death . One medical examiner ruled his death a homicide , while another couldn ’ t conclusively say whether the chokehold was the cause .
Two other medical experts said the heart attack Garner suffered could ’ ve stemmed from a number of causes .
“ This is significant because it casts doubt upon whether the chokehold itself caused Mr. Garner ’ s death , ” Donoghue said .
Donoghue said the investigation relied heavily on video of the encounter between Garner and the officers — who were attempting to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes .
“ The video shows that the officers ’ initial actions were in accordance with established police tactics and procedures , but that the situation deteriorated as it progressed , ” he said .
Pantaleo used “ two approved NYPD tactics ” involving force to subdue Garner , who was resisting arrest — an “ arm bar ” and a “ rear takedown ” or “ seat belt . ”
It was the latter maneuver that caused Garner to lose balance and fall backward with Pantaleo , whose body slammed against a store window .
“ It appears that , in response to that collision , and to maintain a hold on Mr. Garner , Officer Pantaleo wrapped his left arm around Mr. Garner ’ s neck , resulting in what was , in effect , a chokehold , ” Donoghue said .
Donoghue said the “ significant difference in size and weight ” between the two men contributed to the difficulty in placing Garner under arrest . Garner was 6 feet 2 and weighed close to 400 pounds , while Pantaleo is “ considerably smaller , ” according to Donoghue .
Pantaleo ’ s lawyer Stu London said “ it is always a tragedy when there is a loss of life ” — but defended his client ’ s actions that day .
“ Officer Pantaleo utilized NYPD approved techniques to make the arrest in this case , ” London said . “ Officer Pantaleo is gratified that the Justice Department took the time to carefully review the actual evidence in this case rather than the lies and inaccuracies which have followed this case since its inception . ”
A Staten Island grand jury declined to prosecute Pantaleo in 2014 .
The cop underwent an NYPD disciplinary trial recently , though a ruling has not yet been issued .
In a statement , NYPD spokesman Phil Walzak said the DOJ ’ s decision doesn ’ t affect the departmental proceeding .
“ Commissioner [ James ] O ’ Neill is now awaiting the report and recommendation from the Deputy Commissioner of Trials , after which he will make the final determination on the matter , ” Walzak said . “ In order to ensure the integrity of the process , the NYPD will not comment further at this time . ”
Pantaleo , who was stripped of his badge and gun , has been on desk duty since Garner ’ s death .
In a statement , Police Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch said the feds ’ decision to not prosecute Pantaleo clears his name .
“ Scapegoating a good and honorable officer , who was doing his job in the manner he was taught , will not heal the wounds this case has caused for our entire city , ” Lynch said . “ We firmly believe that if the NYPD decides the disciplinary case on the facts , free of improper political influence , that Police Officer Pantaleo , will be fully exonerated of any wrongdoing . ”
Meanwhile , Fred Davie , the chair of the city Civilian Complaint Review Board , which brought the case against Pantaleo in his departmental trial , called on O ’ Neill to fire the cop .
“ Our last hope for justice in this case lies with the police commissioner , ” Davie said . “ CCRB prosecutors presented evidence at trial that showed — unequivocally — that Officer Pantaleo engaged in misconduct worthy of termination . The evidence directly contradicts the statements made earlier today by the United States attorney for the Eastern District . ”","The decision to not prosecute NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Eric Garner’s death was ultimately made by Attorney General William Barr himself — because of “insufficient evidence” in the case, Brooklyn’s top prosecutor announced Tuesday.

Forward to Memphis.

This could be any old day for Mathews, a struggling local beautician. She is driving through Memphis in her gray and black Buick Electra, a boat-like sedan known as a Deuce and a Quarter for its 225-inch length, more than 18 feet.

Any old day — except today riding next to her in the front seat is Martin Luther King Jr. Abernathy, Young and Lee are in the back seat, and Cotton is in a Lincoln behind them.

Mathews looks into the rearview mirror and tenses up again.

Despite her admonitions to Redditt at the airport, the police follow.

Meticulously, they log King's day:

11:20 a.m. — Arrives at the Lorraine Motel, a two-story motor court inn in Downtown's gloomy warehouse district that opened years earlier at the height of segregation as the Lorraine Hotel and caters to black people. King and Abernathy check into Room 306 along the second-floor balcony. Cotton is next door in Room 307. Young and Lee are downstairs.

12:05 p.m. — Leaves for a meeting at Rev. James Lawson's Centenary United Methodist Church in South Memphis. There, a large gathering of pastors and supporters discuss the anticipated march next week as word trickles in that the city has convinced a judge to issue an injunction.

2:15 p.m. — The meeting breaks up and Mathews drives King back to the Lorraine.

The police have a duty to be watching, to keep law and order, but their mission is murky. Some officers were assigned for security, to protect King. But Redditt and his partner, Willie Richmond, have more specific orders — to keep an eye on King's movements.

“The reason for the surveillance being ordered was because Dr. King was a controversial figure” and because he'd “been meeting with local black militants,” a police report said.

It's a great injustice to Mathews, an attractive woman who favors glittery earrings, permed hair and stylish coats, and could be mistaken for a pastor's wife or a tea club socialite, yet at heart is a fiery activist.

In a way, she is the Rosa Parks of Memphis.

All lives matter. As do Second Amendment rights.

Which is why the killing of 32-year-old Philando Castile last July was disturbing, and the acquittal of St. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer Jeronimo Yanez, this past Friday, so troubling.

Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who live-streamed the chilling aftermath of the shooting on her cell phone, assumed the traffic stop was for a broken tail-light. But Officer Yanez, four years on the force, stopped Castile believing he might be the perpetrator of a recent robbery. Castile was not; he was merely the same race (black), roughly the same age, and had the same hair-style (dreadlocks).

Of course, many men in the Twin Cities metro area fit those characteristics.

Much about the incident remains unclear and in dispute. What seems indisputable is this: Philando Castile told the Latino officer that he was carrying a gun, for which he had a concealed carry permit. That doesn’t sound like an admission someone would make if planning to whip out that pistol and start blasting away.

Also certain is the fact that Officer Yanez fired seven times into the automobile carrying Castile, Reynolds and Reynolds’ four-year-old daughter. Five bullets struck Castile, two in the heart. One bullet barely missed the toddler strapped into a car seat in the back. Castile later died at a local hospital.

The audio on the cellphone footage, which began after the shots were fired, has Yanez yelling: “I told him not to reach for it! I told him to get his hand out.”

“You told him to get his I.D., sir, his driver’s license,” Ms. Reynolds responds, almost eerily calm. “Please don’t tell me, please don’t tell me my boyfriend is gone. Please don’t tell me he’s gone. Please Jesus, no.”

Yanez was charged with second-degree manslaughter and reckless discharge of a firearm. The officer testified in court that he fired his weapon after seeing part of the gun emerging from Castile’s pocket. Reynolds told jurors that Castile was slowly pulling out his wallet in response to Officer Yanez’s request, definitely not his handgun.

The jury was initially deadlocked, ten jurors voting to acquit and two to convict. But the judge urged them to continue deliberating. Though whites outnumbered African Americans on the jury five to one, some jurors told reporters that the two jurors initially favoring conviction were not the two black jurors.

Late in the deliberations, the jury requested to again review several videos introduced into evidence. The two videos the judge allowed them to re-watch were an interview of Diamond Reynolds and the dash-cam recording from the police car. The dash-cam recording has not been released to the public.

Last Friday, the jury unanimously acquitted Officer Yanez of all three charges.

Mistakes happen. Deadly ones, even. One can certainly sympathize with the plight of police fearing for their safety at traffic stops, which they know can turn deadly in an instant. Yet, law enforcement officers cannot go around blowing away innocent people because they are scared.

A young man who worked as a supervisor at a public school cafeteria and had no criminal record is dead. Many others — black and white — are dead in incidents that suspiciously lack good explanations. There is nothing in our American “can-do” spirit that accepts fatal errors. Especially repeated ones.

What to do?

Let’s outfit police with body cameras. And let’s write the rules for those cameras — as voters in Ferguson, Missouri, did last April by passing a ballot initiative — such that (1) police face repercussions for not having the cameras on, and (2) the footage is made publicly available, so people know there will be accountability and no cover-ups.

Then-President Obama’s Justice Department investigated the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson and found that Brown was at fault, as the aggressor, not the police officer. Had body cam footage been publicly released the riots that followed may not have erupted. Citizens would have been saved millions in property damage and spared the divide along racial and political lines all across the nation.

In other instances, body cams might help convict the cops.

Still, even with body camera footage available, it seems difficult to gain convictions against police when they clearly err by killing innocent folks. Numerous cases of police shooting unarmed men have been caught on video and yet either not resulted in officers being prosecuted or with officers acquitted of charges.

Like Officer Yanez, the officers are often removed from the police force. But too late.

Police need better training on how to protect both themselves and citizens they encounter. Too much of the current training appears to encourage a warrior ethic of shoot-first and ask-questions-later. In fact, Officer Yanez attended a controversial seminar called the “Bulletproof Warrior” in 2014, which some police forces have discouraged their officers from attending.

Yet, even with better training, and with cameras always rolling, the problem won’t be solved completely. I do not have all the answers, but as Americans we must find those answers.

It “aims to promote greater understanding of the systematic oppression of black Mississippians and their fight for equality that transformed the state and nation,” the White House said.",www.foxnews.com,right,X8lGdG1B6fXyqFCG

civil_rights,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2019/0508/When-does-birthright-citizenship-become-citizenship-for-sale,When does birthright citizenship become citizenship for sale?,2019-05-08,Sara Miller Llana,"“ It ’ s an abuse of the system , ” says Joe Peschisolido , a Liberal lawmaker in Richmond . “ It ’ s a business where people are making money off of the goodness of Canadians . ”
“ Birth tourism , ” where wealthy mothers from abroad pay to give birth in Canada , thus getting citizenship for their babies , and then return home , is an increasing phenomenon in Canada . While federal statistics show only 313 births by nonresident mothers in 2016 , new research using hospital financial data puts the number at 3,223 that year . One of 5 births at Richmond Hospital in Richmond , British Columbia , an alleged center for birth tourism , is to nonresident mothers , those figures show .
Granting citizenship based on place of birth is deeply rooted in Canada and the United States , but it is in fact otherwise a rarity among developed nations . And the practice has come under debate across North America in recent years . But unlike in the U.S. , where President Donald Trump 's threats to end the practice have come amid a context of illegal immigration , Canada 's rethink arises over a different concern : birth tourism .
Kerry Starchuk ’ s activism begins with homemade granola cookies – specifically , when she took a plate to her new neighbors .
Except the man and a toddler boy who she heard bouncing a basketball outside , and the two pregnant women with them , hadn ’ t moved into the house next door to hers , where she has lived since 1988 . Visitors from China , they were residing in her neighborhood only temporarily and didn ’ t respond to her greeting . After they awkwardly accepted her cookies , she never saw the group again .
It wasn ’ t the first time she ’ d seen pregnant women coming and going in her neighborhood or heard about why they were there . But the meeting began her personal battle against “ birth tourism , ” where wealthy mothers like the ones she encountered next door pay to give birth , get citizenship for their babies , and return home .
It is an issue gaining prominence across North America , where jus soli , or rules by which citizenship is determined by birthplace , is the standard practice ( yet otherwise rare among developed countries , as in Europe where citizenship is more restricted and often granted along bloodlines ) . An online petition that Ms. Starchuk started against the practice last year , garnering some 11,000 signatures , was supported by a federal Liberal lawmaker representing Richmond . Meanwhile , the federal Conservatives , in opposition during an election year , voted on a motion last summer to tighten laws around birthright citizenship . In the United States , President Donald Trump has said he will end it by executive order .
Mr. Trump ’ s threat drew widespread criticism by critics who call it anti-immigrant pandering . But concerns about citizenship rules span partisan lines . In Canada , a poll from the Angus Reid Institute in March showed that while more believe birthright citizenship is a good policy than a bad one ( 40 % versus 33 % ) , 60 % believed rules needed to be tightened to counter abuse of the system .
Ms. Starchuk , a part-time housecleaner , insists her position is not anti-Chinese or anti-immigrant but is about rules and values , especially in a region where foreign wealth and capital have changed the face of communities . In Richmond , the mothers hail mostly from China , lured by advertisements that sell all-inclusive packages including a stay at a “ birth hotel. ” Other hospitals in Toronto and Montreal have seen increases in mothers from Eastern Europe or Africa . A recent data analysis showed Richmond ’ s local hospital with the highest percentage of births to mothers residing outside Canada .
“ It does undermine me , because I ’ m trying to build community and welcome my neighbors to the neighborhood , ” she says . “ And then I find out it ’ s not a single-family home where there ’ s going to be a new family but an international , underground birth-tourism hotel . ...

“ It ’ s the unfairness of it , ” she says . “ Citizenship is not partisan , Liberal or Conservative , but about Canadian values .

“Birth tourism,” where wealthy mothers from abroad pay to give birth in Canada, thus getting citizenship for their babies, and then return home, is an increasing phenomenon in Canada. While federal statistics show only 313 births by nonresident mothers in 2016, new research using hospital financial data puts the number at 3,223 that year. One of 5 births at Richmond Hospital in Richmond, British Columbia, an alleged center for birth tourism, is to nonresident mothers, those figures show.

Granting citizenship based on place of birth is deeply rooted in Canada and the United States, but it is in fact otherwise a rarity among developed nations. And the practice has come under debate across North America in recent years. But unlike in the U.S., where President Donald Trump's threats to end the practice have come amid a context of illegal immigration, Canada's rethink arises over a different concern: birth tourism.

Kerry Starchuk’s activism begins with homemade granola cookies – specifically, when she took a plate to her new neighbors.

Except the man and a toddler boy who she heard bouncing a basketball outside, and the two pregnant women with them, hadn’t moved into the house next door to hers, where she has lived since 1988. Visitors from China, they were residing in her neighborhood only temporarily and didn’t respond to her greeting. After they awkwardly accepted her cookies, she never saw the group again.

It wasn’t the first time she’d seen pregnant women coming and going in her neighborhood or heard about why they were there. But the meeting began her personal battle against “birth tourism,” where wealthy mothers like the ones she encountered next door pay to give birth, get citizenship for their babies, and return home.

It is an issue gaining prominence across North America, where jus soli, or rules by which citizenship is determined by birthplace, is the standard practice (yet otherwise rare among developed countries, as in Europe where citizenship is more restricted and often granted along bloodlines). An online petition that Ms. Starchuk started against the practice last year, garnering some 11,000 signatures, was supported by a federal Liberal lawmaker representing Richmond. Meanwhile, the federal Conservatives, in opposition during an election year, voted on a motion last summer to tighten laws around birthright citizenship. In the United States, President Donald Trump has said he will end it by executive order.

Mr. Trump’s threat drew widespread criticism by critics who call it anti-immigrant pandering. But concerns about citizenship rules span partisan lines. In Canada, a poll from the Angus Reid Institute in March showed that while more believe birthright citizenship is a good policy than a bad one (40% versus 33%), 60% believed rules needed to be tightened to counter abuse of the system.

Ms. Starchuk, a part-time housecleaner, insists her position is not anti-Chinese or anti-immigrant but is about rules and values, especially in a region where foreign wealth and capital have changed the face of communities. In Richmond, the mothers hail mostly from China, lured by advertisements that sell all-inclusive packages including a stay at a “birth hotel.” Other hospitals in Toronto and Montreal have seen increases in mothers from Eastern Europe or Africa. A recent data analysis showed Richmond’s local hospital with the highest percentage of births to mothers residing outside Canada.

“It does undermine me, because I’m trying to build community and welcome my neighbors to the neighborhood,” she says. “And then I find out it’s not a single-family home where there’s going to be a new family but an international, underground birth-tourism hotel. ... It’s like selling citizenship.”

An abuse of the system?

The issue under debate in Canada, which established citizenship rules under the 1947 Canadian Citizenship Act, is largely about the power of foreign money and how it devalues citizenship. The debate in the U.S., on the other hand, sometimes targets so-called anchor babies but revolves around undocumented migration. It was rekindled last fall with Mr. Trump’s threat, which has been highly polarizing.

The national conversations converge around questions of fairness and the changes people fear and perceive around them.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Joe Peschisolido, a Liberal lawmaker, says birth tourism is an abuse of the system. 'It's a business where people are making money off of the goodness of Canadians.'

Martha Jones, who wrote “Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America,” says that citizenship is always an evolving political question.

‘It’s the unfairness of it’

He was disgusted by them,2020-01-19,Bob Hennelly,"`` We also realize that the problems of racial injustice and economic injustice can not be solved without a radical redistribution of political and economic power . '' —Martin Luther King Jr. , 1967
This Martin Luther King Jr. Day comes as moderate Democrats , falling in line behind former vice president Joe Biden , are warning that the party risks re-electing Donald Trump if it nominates too radical a candidate for president — by which they mean someone like Senators Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren .
This so-called moderate world view is underpinned by the belief that , over the arc of this nation 's history , we have been striving for and realizing a `` more perfect union '' through disciplined incrementalism and market capitalism .
Some pundits extol this as the great virtue of American moderation .
And yet , a glance at Martin Luther King Jr. 's actual words reveals the civil rights leader saw such moderation as a `` fantasy of self-deception and comfortable vanity . ''
From a Birmingham jail cell , he wrote he was `` gravely disappointed with the white moderate '' that he saw as `` the Negro 's great stumbling block , '' as much or more so than ardent segregationists or even the KKK . The white moderate , he observed , lived `` by a mythical concept of time '' and constantly advised `` the Negro to wait for a 'more convenient season . ' Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will . Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection . ''
As King saw it , the American embrace of moderation in his time was enabled by a belief `` that American society is essentially hospitable to fair play and to steady growth toward a middle-class Utopia embodying racial harmony . But unfortunately , this is a fantasy of self-deception and comfortable vanity . ''
In grade school , I was indoctrinated with this same moderate narrative — that we were on the conveyor belt of socio-economic progress that was a through line from Lexington and Concord , through Gettysburg , and on to the beaches of Normandy .
In this airbrushed history , America expiated its original sin of slavery with the massive bloodletting that was our Civil War . Scroll forward to 2008 , and we have elected the first American African American president .
Perhaps too slow , argue the moderates , but progress none the less .
But our actually history as it was lived , but too often not remembered , reveals that every civil rights breakthrough is accompanied by reactionary blowback . We saw it after the Civil War , with the abandonment of Reconstruction by a federal government that fell captive to capital interests and its own deeply embedded racist world view .
Scroll forward a century : the same happened in response to the passage of landmark federal civil and voting rights legislation . And as with the murder of Lincoln after the Emancipation Proclamation , the white supremacist terrorist rage murdered Dr. King and so many others .
And similarly , after the two-term presidency of President Obama , the election of Trump was the blowback .
There is a pattern here , one that has been flagged by writers like Michelle Alexander and Ta-Nehisi Coates . In 2020 , there can be no excuse for not seeing it .
In the southern states after the Civil War , African Americans ' post-emancipation hopes for freedom were crushed when , as Ta-Nehisi Coates reminds us , Lincoln was assassinated by a white supremacist and replaced in White House with Andrew Johnson , another white supremacist .
It was Johnson , Coates observed , who curtailed `` virtually all rights black people enjoyed '' which cleared the way for white Southerners to `` pillage black labor… .. through a century-long campaign of domestic terrorism , and that for most of that history the federal government looked the other way , while state and local governments were complicit . ''
Coates continues : `` I have spent the past two years somewhat concerned about the effects of national amnesia , largely because I believe that a problem can not be effectively treated without being effectively diagnosed . I do n't know how you diagnose the problem of racism in America without understanding the actual history . ''
As historian Howard Zinn writes in `` A People 's History of the United States , '' after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment — which prohibited states from denying former slaves their right to vote — there were two African Americans in the U.S. Senate and twenty members of the U.S. House of Representatives .
At the local , county and state level there were 2,000 African American elected to office , including 600 to state legislatures in the south .
`` The southern white oligarchy used its economic power to organize the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist groups , '' writes Zinn . `` Northern politicians began to weigh the vantage of the political support of impoverished blacks-maintained in voting and office only by force [ union troops ] — against the more stable situation of a South returned to white supremacy , accepting Republican dominance and business legislation . It was only a matter of time before blacks would be reduced once again to conditions not far from slavery . ''
This terror campaign included not only 4,000 hangings , but the rape of women , the burning of churches and the razing of entire neighborhoods . In response to this , African Americans moved into America 's booming northern industrial cities by the millions .
The Great Migration spurred a massive increase in the African American communities in northern cities . In just ten years , between 1910 and 1920 , New York 's black population increased by 60 percent , Chicago 's by 148 percent , Philadelphia 's by 500 percent . Detroit spiked 611 percent .
As Spencer Crew , an historian for the National Museum of American History , described it , the change of scenery and easy employment thanks to war time production did not bring prosperity — but a different kind of poverty .
`` While job opportunities were readily available in most cities , these jobs were at the lower end of the occupational ladder , '' writes Crew . `` Northern labor unions generally did not accept Afro-Americans as members and often threatened to strike companies where nonunion workers performed union jobs . Even when Afro-American workers acquired better paying jobs during the war , many of them had to relinquish these jobs once the war ended . ''
As a result , African Americans `` typically wound up in dirty , backbreaking , unskilled , and low-paying occupations . '' `` These were the least desirable jobs in most industries , but the ones employers felt best suited their black workers , '' Crew notes . `` On average , more than eight of every ten Afro-American men worked as unskilled laborers in foundries , in the building trades , in meatpacking companies , on the railroads , or as servants , porters , janitors , cooks , and cleaners . ''
And moving from the south to the north meant they fell prey to a scarcity of affordable housing that endures to this day .
`` Funneled into certain areas in most northern cities , Afro-Americans have paid nearly twice as much as their white counterparts for equivalent housing , '' according to Crew . `` With the additional financial burden of having to pay higher prices in neighborhood stores for food , clothing , and other necessities , settling in the North was a mixed experience for many migrants . Though they earned better wages in the North , much of the increased income was offset by higher living expenses . ''
In the mid-20th century , American multinationals , encouraged by U.S. tax policy , began to shift manufacturing out of America 's urban core offshore . Thus , the stage was set for the social unrest that would come in the 60s in places like Newark and Detroit . It was in these urban crucibles that the promise of an ascendant civil rights abutted the consequences of generations of poverty and widening income disparity between communities of color and white America .
`` Capitalism is fine — it 's black families that are broken ''
For the federal policy makers in the 1960s , like David Patrick Moynihan , an assistant secretary of labor under President Johnson , the real problem was not capitalism , which had decimated America 's big cities and exploited an African Americans underclass . Rather , the problem was the very nature of the African American family itself , which was increasingly led by single mothers .
In his 1964 report , `` The Negro Family — The Case for National Action , '' he conceded the enduring and systemic toll of the `` virus '' of white supremacy and offered praise for the civil rights movement . Yet , as others have observed , Moynihan blamed the victim for African American poverty . In turn , this would ultimately provide the academic underpinnings for the brand of overpolicing that endures to this day in black neighborhoods .
`` In this new period the expectations of the Negro Americans will go beyond civil rights , '' the Moynihan report states . `` Being Americans , they will now expect that in the near future equal opportunities for them as a group will produce roughly equal results , as compared with other groups . This is not going to happen . Nor will it happen for generations to come unless a new and special effort is made . ''
The report continued : `` There are two reasons . First , the racist virus in the American blood stream still afflicts us : Negroes will encounter serious personal prejudice for at least another generation . Second , three centuries of sometimes unimaginable mistreatment have taken their toll on the Negro people . ''
`` The thesis of this paper is that these events , in combination , confront the nation with a new kind of problem . Measures that have worked in the past , or would work for most groups in the present , will not work here . A national effort is required that will give a unity of purpose to the many activities of the Federal government in this area , directed to a new kind of national goal : the establishment of a stable Negro family structure . ''
To be fair , Moynihan 's report did observe that the Federal minimum wage provided a `` basic income for the individual , but an income well below the poverty line for a couple , much less a family with children '' and that the `` most conspicuous failure of the American social system in the past ten years has been its inadequacy in providing jobs for Negro youth . ''
But by zeroing in on the family and society and not flagging the defects in market capitalism that profited off of black poverty , the power structure now had a rationale to take aim at a `` pathology of poverty '' they had determined afflicted the African American poor .
As Jeff Guo wrote in the Washington Post , President Johnson 's `` War on Poverty '' was followed by a `` War on Crime '' that `` would bulk up police forces with federal money and intensify patrols in urban areas . '' `` This would be the first significant intrusion of the federal government into local law enforcement , and it was the beginning of a long saga of escalating surveillance and control in urban areas , '' Guo writes . He notes that President Johnson `` liken [ ed ] the black urban unrest to a domestic Vietnam . ''
As recounted in historian Elizabeth Hinton 's book `` From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime '' Johnson sent `` military-grade rifles , tanks , riot gear , walkie-talkies , helicopters , and bulletproof vests , '' to local police forces who were afraid of civil unrest from young black men that came from families that liberals like Moynihan had determined were defective and if left unaddressed would be dangerous .
And with President Nixon 's so-called War on Drugs , the stage was set for the mass incarceration of African American men — and with it the tragic collateral social consequences .
We have so deeply internalized structural racism that most politicians easily ignore the fact that between 1980 and 2015 the number of people incarcerated increased from 500,000 to over 2.2 million , according to the NAACP . That means that while the U.S. makes up only 5 percent of the planet 's population , we have 21 percent of the prisoners .
Evidently , we are just not that outraged by it . If people are in jail , there 's some justification for it . Right ?
That 's how former Mayor Mike Bloomberg can joke through his recent The Late Show with Steven Colbert appearance and blithely explain away as merely `` a mistake '' his embrace of race-based profiling where the NYPD illegally stopped and frisked hundreds of thousands of young men of color annually for years .
And with hundreds of millions earmarked as new revenue for hungry broadcast media outlets , do n't expect Bloomberg to be pressed on how he plans on making right the tragic consequences from the NYPD 's unconstitutional actions that led to bad arrests , unjust incarcerations , lost jobs and ruined lives .
This Martin Luther King Jr. Day , pay close attention to the white moderates , like Bloomberg and Biden . Ironically , not only do these men fail to grasp the radical nature of his dream , their past actions actually helped defer it .","""We also realize that the problems of racial injustice and economic injustice cannot be solved without a radical redistribution of political and economic power."" —Martin Luther King Jr., 1967

Syndicated columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote this week that young black men are 21 times more likely to be shot and killed by police than young white men . Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly had a much different take on his show Monday night , offering that more whites are killed by police than blacks .
`` In 2012 , 123 African-Americans were shot dead by police . There are currently more than 43 million blacks living in the U.S.A. , '' O'Reilly said on his program . `` Same year , 326 whites were killed by police bullets . Those are the latest stats available . ''
Two dramatically different statistics -- and they could both be right .
That reality , in part a result of weak local reporting and national data gathering efforts on police homicides , has long frustrated researchers and analysts who say they need to know more about those shootings .
Here 's how the two pundits came to such dramatically different conclusions :
Kristof was citing an analysis by ProPublica , which combed through the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's Supplementary Homicide Report .
The site reported : `` The 1,217 deadly police shootings from 2010 to 2012 captured in the federal data show that blacks , age 15 to 19 , were killed at a rate of 31.17 per million , while just 1.47 per million white males in that age range died at the hands of police . ''
What 's key is that ProPublica narrowed the scope of its analysis to the 15-to-19 age range , and adjusted for population differences to account for the fact that more whites live in the United States than blacks -- both key differences from O'Reilly 's approach .
The Fox News host 's numbers , meanwhile , came from a fatal injury database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
A search in 2012 for deaths caused by `` legal intervention '' as a result of the use of a firearm -- that is , a police shooting -- yields just the numbers O'Reilly cited Monday night . In the 15-19 age range , the database shows 20 white people killed in 2012 and 14 blacks .
The problem , experts say , is that the United States does n't collect accurate statistics and verify nearly enough information to show definitive trends in police shootings .
`` There is n't a mandatory reporting . It is a self-reporting . Almost on the honor system , '' Sunny Hostin , a CNN legal analyst , said on CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' on Tuesday .
`` Although the FBI does have some statistics , most people know that those statistics ca n't even be counted upon , because they are self-reported , '' Hostin said . `` So my suggestion has been all along that we need mandatory reporting from our law enforcement agencies around the country and I think that the number of officer shootings involving young black males is actually much higher than is even self-reported . That 's something that needs to be part of the conversation . ''
Geoff Alpert , a University of South Carolina criminologist , recently told USA Today the FBI 's database can confirm police have shot and killed people -- but provides few other details .
The numbers are self-reported by individual law enforcement agencies and not all local and state agencies participate . Most shootings are marked as justified homicides , with little follow-up .","Story highlights A ProPublica analysis of police shootings shows that young black men are 21 times more likely to be shot and killed than young white men

The Fox News host's numbers, meanwhile, came from a fatal injury database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A search in 2012 for deaths caused by ""legal intervention"" as a result of the use of a firearm -- that is, a police shooting -- yields just the numbers O'Reilly cited Monday night. In the 15-19 age range, the database shows 20 white people killed in 2012 and 14 blacks.

The problem, experts say, is that the United States doesn't collect accurate statistics and verify nearly enough information to show definitive trends in police shootings.

""There isn't a mandatory reporting. It is a self-reporting. Almost on the honor system,"" Sunny Hostin, a CNN legal analyst, said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" on Tuesday.

""Although the FBI does have some statistics, most people know that those statistics can't even be counted upon, because they are self-reported,"" Hostin said. ""So my suggestion has been all along that we need mandatory reporting from our law enforcement agencies around the country and I think that the number of officer shootings involving young black males is actually much higher than is even self-reported. That's something that needs to be part of the conversation.""

Geoff Alpert, a University of South Carolina criminologist, recently told USA Today the FBI's database can confirm police have shot and killed people -- but provides few other details.

The numbers are self-reported by individual law enforcement agencies and not all local and state agencies participate. Most shootings are marked as justified homicides, with little follow-up.",www.cnn.com,left,NxpaUPFo85sNiOje

I never shy away from the Jesus-King comparisons , because I remain clear that there was Jesus and there was Christ , and King was no Christ . But he loved people , and served them , and died for them .

There are films that galvanize movements. As I sat, watching “Selma,” I knew this film would be one of them. The first major studio film from the first black woman to win best director at the Sundance Film Festival, ""Selma"" is action-packed, majestic, funny and soul-wrenching all at the same time. This film that centers ordinary, everyday people, in the place where they lived, doing their work, loving on the leaders they chose, fighting to change the world, is a breath of fresh air to a civil rights narrative that so often lionizes Dr. King, positioning him as savior, as Christ, rather than perhaps as a more human, radical, revolutionary Jesus.

civil_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/27/us-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-employees-/,"Bureaucrats gone wild: Feds describe racial hostility, discrimination inside new Obama agency",2014-08-27,Kelly Riddell,"America ’ s newest federal agency , charged with regulating financial institutions to prevent another hostile economic downturn , is having troubles regulating hostilities and discrimination among its own employees .
Evidence gathered by congressional investigators , internal agency documents and ███ interviews with workers discloses scores of cases of U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau employees seeking protection from racially offensive , sexist or discriminatory behavior , including that :
• A naturalized U.S. citizen , with more than a decade of service with the U.S. government , was called an “ f ’ ing foreigner ” by management .
• A department was internally dubbed “ the Plantation ” because of the number of blacks working in it — all supervised by white managers — without any obvious promotional track or way to get transferred .
• White employees were twice as likely to get the most favorable personnel ratings in employee reviews , as were minorities .
• Managers intimidated and retaliated against employees for voicing complaints or offering an alternative point of view — from denying vacation requests to hiring unqualified friends to supervise jobs and then asking subordinates to train them .
Evidence of discriminatory pay practices in the agency ’ s own statistics have even resulted in promises by management of emergency pay raises for minority workers to create more parity , the documents show .
It ’ s not the storyline that America ’ s newest federal agency wanted at its inception .
CFPB , the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , was created by then-Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and then-Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts .
The latter two Democrats pushed through legislation in Congress named after them that created the agency to protect consumers from predatory banks and lending institutions blamed for the 2007-2009 financial crisis . And Ms. Warren , now considered by some as a potential presidential candidate in 2016 , became its first leader .
Since then , the agency has been a political football , roundly opposed by Republicans as an excessive regulatory power play and embraced by liberals who saw it as a necessary fix to a financial system gone awry .
Away from the political fray on Capitol Hill , dozens of workers at the CFPB say the bureau ’ s lack of accountability is enabling managers to create their own minifiefdoms , stock the ranks with inexperienced and unqualified friends and retaliate against anybody who disagrees with their agenda .
The House Committee on Financial Services began airing some of the problems at hearings earlier this spring , bringing to light a situation that has simmered for months out of public view .
CFPB acknowledges its employees ’ complaints about a hostile working environment and says it is working with the National Treasury Employees Union — which represents CFPB employees — to settle worker protests and iron out new performance reviews , which are at the heart of many of the protests .
The agency ’ s director , Richard Cordray , testified last month it has been challenging to create an agency from the ground up over the last three years , and working conditions for some have been “ especially difficult . ”
“ I am committed to ensuring that all Bureau employees are treated fairly and that they receive the respect and dignity they deserve , ” Mr. Cordray told the House Financial Services ’ Oversight and Investigations subcommittee on July 30 .
Still , current CFBP employees say more work needs to be done and that some thought Mr. Cordray ’ s testimony to be both impenitent and out of touch with what ’ s actually happening at the bureau .
“ Anybody who asks questions or doesn ’ t just take orders gets discriminated against , ” Ali Naraghi , a bank examiner in the CFPB ’ s southeast region , told The ███ in an interview . “ What CFPB does internally to its staff is contrary to all of their objectives and the mission of the agency . ”
Mr. Naraghi , a naturalized citizen of Persian descent , alleges he was called a “ f ’ ing foreigner ” by his superiors because he vocalized discrepancies in the way the CFPB was conducting its bank examinations compared with the way it was done at the Federal Reserve , where Mr. Naraghi served for 14 years .
As a bank examiner , Mr. Naraghi holds a top government position , drawing in a salary of more than $ 100,000 . He and other examiners essentially audit private banks for compliance with federal law .
At the Federal Reserve , Mr. Naraghi earned top performance marks and promotions — winning an excellence award for mortgage servicing . At the CFPB he ’ s been graded at the lowest level in his performance reviews and has remained stagnant in his position since he started at the agency in 2011 .
Newly in his position , Mr. Naraghi raised concerns to management that the CFPB wasn ’ t using a risk model — a uniform institutionalized measuring stick — to evaluate banks ’ performance against one another . Because of this , he felt many examinations were skewed either in favor of what the institution dictated or to the examiner ’ s own preconceived notions .
What the examinations weren ’ t — he pointed out both to his manager and later to Congress in testimony — were objective .
“ The only thing consistent within the CFPB is that it ’ s inconsistent , ” said Mr. Naraghi , who still holds his position as he works out his complaint with the agency . “ They want us to be like a private that salutes the major and does whatever they say — but everybody has something to add . ”
He said he wasn ’ t trying to criticize the way CFPB was conducting its investigations , only voicing ways to make them better . His manager didn ’ t view it that way .
After being subpoenaed by the congressional committee to testify in June , the agency tried to silence Mr. Naraghi by demanding lawmakers strike or bar his opening statement . The effort failed .
In his opening testimony , Mr. Naraghi said the very employee relations office that is supposed to help aggrieved employees was “ broken and is more harmful than helpful to employees who suffer discrimination or retaliation . ”
In response , CFPB spokeswoman Jen Howard said , on average , CFPB employees are more satisfied with their management compared with other government agencies .
According to a survey taken by CFPB and released to The Times , 72 percent of CFPB employees say they have a “ high level of respect for my organization ’ s senior leaders , ” compared to 54 percent governmentwide .
Seventy-five percent of CFPB employees either agree or strongly agree that “ My supervisor/team leader is committed to a workforce representative of all segments of society , ” compared with 64 percent governmentwide , the agency said .
Despite his discrimination complaint , Mr. Naraghi doesn ’ t question CFPB ’ s mission — he very much stands up for the agency and the work it is doing . He sought employment at the CFPB after listening to Ms. Warren , the agency ’ s first head and now a U.S. senator , describe the agency ’ s goals of protecting consumers when she was pushing for it as a university professor .
“ My in-laws in Mississippi had been taken advantage of by a fly-by-night mortgage company , ” said Mr. Naraghi . “ I believe in our mission . That ’ s why I came . We can do a lot of good , but breaking the law to enforce the law isn ’ t cool in my opinion . ”
Part of the concern is CFPB ’ s treatment of minorities , women and workers over the age of 40 , Mr. Naraghi and other unnamed employees said . Also , the divide between management and the bargaining unit is vast , leaving those outside the higher ranks feeling helpless and without recourse .
Last year , within the CFPB , white employees were twice as likely to receive the highest rating at the bureau as compared to black or Hispanic employees , according to the CFPB ’ s own performance management reviews , which were requested and made public by the union NTEU .
The odds were similarly stacked against workers over the age of 40 , said Ben Konop , executive vice president at the NTEU in his May testimony to the committee .
“ And ratings continued to be badly skewed in favor of management when compared with the ratings of the bargaining unit , who do the bulk of the work at the bureau , ” Mr. Konop said .
In 2013 CFPB employees filed 115 official grievances through the union — a particularly high amount for an agency with only 1,300 employees .
Complaints range from managers denying vacation requests in retaliation for comments they don ’ t like to dismissing internal requests for promotions and hiring unqualified friends instead who then needed training and supervision from those in lesser positions , according to current employees .
Some of these complaints were addressed by management at CFPB ’ s “ All Hands ” spring meeting — an agencywide conference that is used for training and team building .
In a presentation obtained from the conference by The Times , internal management laid bare the discrepancies in pay and performance between minorities and their white counterparts and committed to compensate employees for the difference .
“ In the absence of a definitive root cause , we have decided to compensate employees to remediate statistical disparities caused by our prior performance management system and to bargain with NTEU to change it going forward , ” the presentation said .
The NTEU , for its part , will continue its effort to uncover and eliminate any unfair treatment at the bureau , NTEU National President Colleen M. Kelley said in a statement to The Times .
“ Since NTEU began representing CFPB employees , we raised and pressed management on addressing employee concerns about disparate treatment and other workplace issues through collective bargaining and the grievance process , ” Ms. Kelley said .
Last month , improvements were made in the agency ’ s telework policy , employee relocation policy and career ladder positions , Ms. Kelley said . The agency has also agreed to move away from its current performance system and form a task force that will focus on redesigning it , she said .
Agency employees say the pay increases are just restitution , but because almost everyone got bonuses and promotions , it just raised the playing field instead of equalizing it .
In addition , high-level employees — such as examiners with pay grades above a certain threshold — were exempt from the pay increases . In terms of the redesigned performance reviews , the true test will be in the coming months and years , employees said .
What angers them the most , however , is the fact that many managers who have a history of employee complaints and discrimination are still holding their jobs and , in some cases , intimidating others not to come forward , according to multiple employees , some of whom only spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation .
Angela Martin , a senior CFPB enforcement attorney , accused a supervisor of retaliating against her after she filed a workers complaint with human resources .
Mrs. Martin alleges her supervisor threatened to bring counterclaims against her if she went forward with her complaint , then isolated her , diminished her job duties and held her accountable for work while preventing her from being involved in the preparation of that work .
Mrs. Martin — who solidly believes in the agency ’ s mission — was a former private practice attorney and Army veteran who specialized in representing military families in consumer fraud cases .
“ Employees have told me of alarming stories of maltreatment that resulted when they opposed the mismanagement and when they asserted their individual rights , ” Mrs. Martin , a mother of five , told Congress in April . “ Certain managers have adopted an authoritarian , untouchable , unaccountable and unanswerable management style . ”
An external audit done at the request of the bureau agreed with Mrs. Martin ’ s claims , and the CFPB settled with her this summer . She currently holds a new position at the agency and no longer interacts with her former supervisor .
However , CFPB launched a new investigation into Mrs. Martin ’ s claims — hiring yet another independent third-party examiner last month — to re-examine her case . The new probe has had a chilling effect on those thinking about coming forward with their own grievances , employees said .
It was Mrs. Martin who first made the claims of the department ’ s so-called “ Plantation ” where black employees were sent with no clear course of promotions or career track . Formally , the department is called the Office of Consumer Response Intake Section .
“ There is an entire section in Consumer Response Intake that is 100 percent African-American , even the contractors , and it is called ‘ The Plantation , ’ ” Mrs. Martin testified . “ And people tell me it ’ s very hard to leave The Plantation . You must be extremely savvy , or you must [ have ] somebody else [ help you ] to get out . And I will note , you can not say education is a factor , because there are licensed attorneys and [ people with ] advanced master ’ s degrees working there . ”
Jen Howard , a spokeswoman at CFPB , says Mrs. Martin ’ s claims contained inaccurate information .
“ There have been over 50 promotions within the Intake Section , and over 90 percent of the employees in the section who have received at least one promotion are minorities , ” said Ms. Howard in a written response .
“ Three employees in the section have been promoted to supervisory roles outside of the section but within Consumer Response , all of whom are African-American . Four employees in the section have been promoted from ‘ Intake Specialist ’ to ‘ Intake Team Lead , ’ all of whom are African-American , ” she said .
Nonetheless , the accusations are so serious and widespread that the Government Accountability Office announced this month that it will begin an investigation into CFPB ’ s organizational culture and management practices .
The investigation was requested by Rep. Patrick T. McHenry , North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee , which held the hearings ; by Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling , Texas Republican ; and Consumer Subcommittee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito , West Virginia Republican .
Since hearings began in April , Mr. McHenry said his office has heard from more than 32 employees complaining about maltreatment at the agency .
“ The treatment of women and minorities at the CFPB is deplorable , ” Mr. McHenry said in a statement to The Times . “ Unfortunately , due to the unique structure of the bureau — leaving it free from both congressional and executive branch oversight — there is little that can be done to stop these rogue agency leaders .
“ While my subcommittee will continue its oversight efforts , ultimately it is Director Cordray ’ s responsibility to realize the depth of these issues and finally address the suffering of so many CFPB employees , ” he said .
For now , Mr. Naraghi , and the many more like him who came forward anonymously , are both negotiating their cases with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and trying to navigate the tricky management system to steer clear of retaliation .
Some employees interviewed by The Times have since left the agency , giving up hope of any major institutional change in the near future .
CFPB management “ tried to sully my record — they wanted me to sign a settlement with them and clear them of any wrongdoing . I ’ m not going to do that , ” said Mr. Naraghi , who is waiting on a hearing date for his grievance case . “ What ’ s right is right . I don ’ t want to bring down the CFPB , but I do have a serious problem with its management . ”","America’s newest federal agency, charged with regulating financial institutions to prevent another hostile economic downturn, is having troubles regulating hostilities and discrimination among its own employees.

Evidence gathered by congressional investigators, internal agency documents and Washington Times interviews with workers discloses scores of cases of U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau employees seeking protection from racially offensive, sexist or discriminatory behavior, including that:

• A naturalized U.S. citizen, with more than a decade of service with the U.S. government, was called an “f’ing foreigner” by management.

• A department was internally dubbed “the Plantation” because of the number of blacks working in it — all supervised by white managers — without any obvious promotional track or way to get transferred.

• White employees were twice as likely to get the most favorable personnel ratings in employee reviews, as were minorities.

• Managers intimidated and retaliated against employees for voicing complaints or offering an alternative point of view — from denying vacation requests to hiring unqualified friends to supervise jobs and then asking subordinates to train them.

Evidence of discriminatory pay practices in the agency’s own statistics have even resulted in promises by management of emergency pay raises for minority workers to create more parity, the documents show.

It’s not the storyline that America’s newest federal agency wanted at its inception.

CFPB, the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, was created by then-Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and then-Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts.

The latter two Democrats pushed through legislation in Congress named after them that created the agency to protect consumers from predatory banks and lending institutions blamed for the 2007-2009 financial crisis. And Ms. Warren, now considered by some as a potential presidential candidate in 2016, became its first leader.

Since then, the agency has been a political football, roundly opposed by Republicans as an excessive regulatory power play and embraced by liberals who saw it as a necessary fix to a financial system gone awry.

Manager fiefdoms

Away from the political fray on Capitol Hill, dozens of workers at the CFPB say the bureau’s lack of accountability is enabling managers to create their own minifiefdoms, stock the ranks with inexperienced and unqualified friends and retaliate against anybody who disagrees with their agenda.

The House Committee on Financial Services began airing some of the problems at hearings earlier this spring, bringing to light a situation that has simmered for months out of public view.

CFPB acknowledges its employees’ complaints about a hostile working environment and says it is working with the National Treasury Employees Union — which represents CFPB employees — to settle worker protests and iron out new performance reviews, which are at the heart of many of the protests.

The agency’s director, Richard Cordray, testified last month it has been challenging to create an agency from the ground up over the last three years, and working conditions for some have been “especially difficult.”

“I am committed to ensuring that all Bureau employees are treated fairly and that they receive the respect and dignity they deserve,” Mr. Cordray told the House Financial Services’ Oversight and Investigations subcommittee on July 30.

Still, current CFBP employees say more work needs to be done and that some thought Mr. Cordray’s testimony to be both impenitent and out of touch with what’s actually happening at the bureau.

“Anybody who asks questions or doesn’t just take orders gets discriminated against,” Ali Naraghi, a bank examiner in the CFPB’s southeast region, told The Washington Times in an interview. “What CFPB does internally to its staff is contrary to all of their objectives and the mission of the agency.”

The Naraghi case

Mr. Naraghi, a naturalized citizen of Persian descent, alleges he was called a “f’ing foreigner” by his superiors because he vocalized discrepancies in the way the CFPB was conducting its bank examinations compared with the way it was done at the Federal Reserve, where Mr. Naraghi served for 14 years.

As a bank examiner, Mr. Naraghi holds a top government position, drawing in a salary of more than $100,000. He and other examiners essentially audit private banks for compliance with federal law.

At the Federal Reserve, Mr. Naraghi earned top performance marks and promotions — winning an excellence award for mortgage servicing. At the CFPB he’s been graded at the lowest level in his performance reviews and has remained stagnant in his position since he started at the agency in 2011.

Newly in his position, Mr. Naraghi raised concerns to management that the CFPB wasn’t using a risk model — a uniform institutionalized measuring stick — to evaluate banks’ performance against one another. Because of this, he felt many examinations were skewed either in favor of what the institution dictated or to the examiner’s own preconceived notions.

What the examinations weren’t — he pointed out both to his manager and later to Congress in testimony — were objective.

“The only thing consistent within the CFPB is that it’s inconsistent,” said Mr. Naraghi, who still holds his position as he works out his complaint with the agency. “They want us to be like a private that salutes the major and does whatever they say — but everybody has something to add.”

He said he wasn’t trying to criticize the way CFPB was conducting its investigations, only voicing ways to make them better. His manager didn’t view it that way.

After being subpoenaed by the congressional committee to testify in June, the agency tried to silence Mr. Naraghi by demanding lawmakers strike or bar his opening statement. The effort failed.

In his opening testimony, Mr. Naraghi said the very employee relations office that is supposed to help aggrieved employees was “broken and is more harmful than helpful to employees who suffer discrimination or retaliation.”

Satisfaction survey higher

In response, CFPB spokeswoman Jen Howard said, on average, CFPB employees are more satisfied with their management compared with other government agencies.

According to a survey taken by CFPB and released to The Times, 72 percent of CFPB employees say they have a “high level of respect for my organization’s senior leaders,” compared to 54 percent governmentwide.

Seventy-five percent of CFPB employees either agree or strongly agree that “My supervisor/team leader is committed to a workforce representative of all segments of society,” compared with 64 percent governmentwide, the agency said.

Despite his discrimination complaint, Mr. Naraghi doesn’t question CFPB’s mission — he very much stands up for the agency and the work it is doing. He sought employment at the CFPB after listening to Ms. Warren, the agency’s first head and now a U.S. senator, describe the agency’s goals of protecting consumers when she was pushing for it as a university professor.

“My in-laws in Mississippi had been taken advantage of by a fly-by-night mortgage company,” said Mr. Naraghi. “I believe in our mission. That’s why I came. We can do a lot of good, but breaking the law to enforce the law isn’t cool in my opinion.”

Racial gaps

Part of the concern is CFPB’s treatment of minorities, women and workers over the age of 40, Mr. Naraghi and other unnamed employees said. Also, the divide between management and the bargaining unit is vast, leaving those outside the higher ranks feeling helpless and without recourse.

Last year, within the CFPB, white employees were twice as likely to receive the highest rating at the bureau as compared to black or Hispanic employees, according to the CFPB’s own performance management reviews, which were requested and made public by the union NTEU.

The odds were similarly stacked against workers over the age of 40, said Ben Konop, executive vice president at the NTEU in his May testimony to the committee.

“And ratings continued to be badly skewed in favor of management when compared with the ratings of the bargaining unit, who do the bulk of the work at the bureau,” Mr. Konop said.

In 2013 CFPB employees filed 115 official grievances through the union — a particularly high amount for an agency with only 1,300 employees.

Complaints range from managers denying vacation requests in retaliation for comments they don’t like to dismissing internal requests for promotions and hiring unqualified friends instead who then needed training and supervision from those in lesser positions, according to current employees.

Some of these complaints were addressed by management at CFPB’s “All Hands” spring meeting — an agencywide conference that is used for training and team building.

In a presentation obtained from the conference by The Times, internal management laid bare the discrepancies in pay and performance between minorities and their white counterparts and committed to compensate employees for the difference.

“In the absence of a definitive root cause, we have decided to compensate employees to remediate statistical disparities caused by our prior performance management system and to bargain with NTEU to change it going forward,” the presentation said.

Union involvement

The NTEU, for its part, will continue its effort to uncover and eliminate any unfair treatment at the bureau, NTEU National President Colleen M. Kelley said in a statement to The Times.

“Since NTEU began representing CFPB employees, we raised and pressed management on addressing employee concerns about disparate treatment and other workplace issues through collective bargaining and the grievance process,” Ms. Kelley said.

Last month, improvements were made in the agency’s telework policy, employee relocation policy and career ladder positions, Ms. Kelley said. The agency has also agreed to move away from its current performance system and form a task force that will focus on redesigning it, she said.

Agency employees say the pay increases are just restitution, but because almost everyone got bonuses and promotions, it just raised the playing field instead of equalizing it.

In addition, high-level employees — such as examiners with pay grades above a certain threshold — were exempt from the pay increases. In terms of the redesigned performance reviews, the true test will be in the coming months and years, employees said.

What angers them the most, however, is the fact that many managers who have a history of employee complaints and discrimination are still holding their jobs and, in some cases, intimidating others not to come forward, according to multiple employees, some of whom only spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Authoritarian style

Angela Martin, a senior CFPB enforcement attorney, accused a supervisor of retaliating against her after she filed a workers complaint with human resources.

Mrs. Martin alleges her supervisor threatened to bring counterclaims against her if she went forward with her complaint, then isolated her, diminished her job duties and held her accountable for work while preventing her from being involved in the preparation of that work.

Mrs. Martin — who solidly believes in the agency’s mission — was a former private practice attorney and Army veteran who specialized in representing military families in consumer fraud cases.

“Employees have told me of alarming stories of maltreatment that resulted when they opposed the mismanagement and when they asserted their individual rights,” Mrs. Martin, a mother of five, told Congress in April. “Certain managers have adopted an authoritarian, untouchable, unaccountable and unanswerable management style.”

An external audit done at the request of the bureau agreed with Mrs. Martin’s claims, and the CFPB settled with her this summer. She currently holds a new position at the agency and no longer interacts with her former supervisor.

However, CFPB launched a new investigation into Mrs. Martin’s claims — hiring yet another independent third-party examiner last month — to re-examine her case. The new probe has had a chilling effect on those thinking about coming forward with their own grievances, employees said.

‘The Plantation’

It was Mrs. Martin who first made the claims of the department’s so-called “Plantation” where black employees were sent with no clear course of promotions or career track. Formally, the department is called the Office of Consumer Response Intake Section.

“There is an entire section in Consumer Response Intake that is 100 percent African-American, even the contractors, and it is called ‘The Plantation,’” Mrs. Martin testified. “And people tell me it’s very hard to leave The Plantation. You must be extremely savvy, or you must [have] somebody else [help you] to get out. And I will note, you cannot say education is a factor, because there are licensed attorneys and [people with] advanced master’s degrees working there.”

Jen Howard, a spokeswoman at CFPB, says Mrs. Martin’s claims contained inaccurate information.

“There have been over 50 promotions within the Intake Section, and over 90 percent of the employees in the section who have received at least one promotion are minorities,” said Ms. Howard in a written response.

“Three employees in the section have been promoted to supervisory roles outside of the section but within Consumer Response, all of whom are African-American. Four employees in the section have been promoted from ‘Intake Specialist’ to ‘Intake Team Lead,’ all of whom are African-American,” she said.

Nonetheless, the accusations are so serious and widespread that the Government Accountability Office announced this month that it will begin an investigation into CFPB’s organizational culture and management practices.

The investigation was requested by Rep. Patrick T. McHenry, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee, which held the hearings; by Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, Texas Republican; and Consumer Subcommittee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia Republican.

Since hearings began in April, Mr. McHenry said his office has heard from more than 32 employees complaining about maltreatment at the agency.

“The treatment of women and minorities at the CFPB is deplorable,” Mr. McHenry said in a statement to The Times. “Unfortunately, due to the unique structure of the bureau — leaving it free from both congressional and executive branch oversight — there is little that can be done to stop these rogue agency leaders.

“While my subcommittee will continue its oversight efforts, ultimately it is Director Cordray’s responsibility to realize the depth of these issues and finally address the suffering of so many CFPB employees,” he said.

For now, Mr. Naraghi, and the many more like him who came forward anonymously, are both negotiating their cases with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and trying to navigate the tricky management system to steer clear of retaliation.

Some employees interviewed by The Times have since left the agency, giving up hope of any major institutional change in the near future.

CFPB management “tried to sully my record — they wanted me to sign a settlement with them and clear them of any wrongdoing. I’m not going to do that,” said Mr. Naraghi, who is waiting on a hearing date for his grievance case. “What’s right is right. I don’t want to bring down the CFPB, but I do have a serious problem with its management.”

Justification for shooting

Ferguson: Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilson's gun, and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where Wilson was, where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officer.

She says the Supreme Court, in a stroke, has eviscerated the Voting Rights Act

Brazile: President Obama must convince polarized Congress to save the act by fixing it

Voter ID laws show threats to rights remain, and Congress must pass new act, she says

In an earthshaking 1965 speech to Congress and to the nation, President Lyndon Johnson spoke directly to the sinister forces that had restricted black Americans' right to vote across the South -- laying out the goals of the Voting Rights Act in the form of a command to this shameful cabal.

""Open your polling places to all your people. Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin. Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land,"" Johnson thundered. ""There is no constitutional issue here. The command of the Constitution is plain."" The speech stirred the country, moved the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to tears and secured this essential law's passage.

Today, if President Barack Obama wants to save the Voting Rights Act following Tuesday's shameful Supreme Court ruling , then he faces an even bigger challenge than Johnson did: He's got to convince a much more hostile Congress that the act is worth saving.

Donna Brazile

Hanging in the balance is the very foundation of American civil rights law. On Tuesday, nearly 50 years after Johnson's historic speech, the five conservative members of the Supreme Court eviscerated the Voting Rights Act in a single stroke. Why? According to the majority opinion, apparently it's because the discriminatory anti-voter rules the act prohibits aren't as much of a problem as they were before the law was passed.

If you're trying to think up a way to illustrate how completely nuts that is, don't worry, because Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg already put it best in her dissent. Striking down this essential part of the act, Ginsburg wrote, ""is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.""

Of course, Johnson was right in 1965, and he's just as right today. These protections are vital and necessary. There is no right more sacrosanct to the very foundations of our nation than the right to vote, and threats to equal voting loom every time we turn a blind eye. Constant vigilance is required to safeguard it, and for half a century the Voting Rights Act was a watchful guardian. But now that Section 5's ""pre-clearance"" formula has been made irrelevant, it falls to Congress to fix it.

Don't expect the conservative-controlled House of Representatives to jump at the chance though. Just last year, during the 2012 election cycle, Republican elected officials in states across the country pushed deeply hostile voter ID laws that disproportionately limit minority voters. Sometimes, the Republicans were even explicit that the purpose of these laws was to put victories in the ""R"" column. And all that took place with a full and complete Voting Rights Act still on the books.

Now it's up to Obama to make a new case for a new Voting Rights Act. Of course, there's nothing partisan about equality in the ballot box. The act's great virtue is that it barred discrimination no matter which way it was directed. It was an equal opportunity shield from injustice -- protecting you no matter who you voted for or what you looked like.

It is a crying shame that the Supreme Court left a key part of Johnson's legacy in tatters. But today, Obama -- and every fair-minded American -- should look to the spirit of Johnson and King and pass a new Voting Rights Act that will stand the test of time. We can't wait. Election Day is just around the corner.

The event was an homage to a generation of activists that endured fire hoses , police abuse and indignities to demand equality for African Americans . But there was a strong theme of unfinished business .
`` This is not the time for nostalgic commemoration , '' said Martin Luther King III , the oldest son of the slain civil rights leader . `` Nor is this the time for self-congratulatory celebration . The task is not done . The journey is not complete . We can and we must do more . ''

Rep. John Lewis , D-Ga. , the only surviving speaker from the 1963 March on Washington , railed against a recent Supreme Court decision that effectively erased a key anti-discrimination provision of the Voting Rights Act .

Lynda Chambers , 58 , gave up a day 's pay to attend because her retail job does not provide paid vacation . Even as a 7-year-old at the time of the original march , she felt alienated and deprived of her rights . Remembering those feelings , she said , she was compelled to make the trip Saturday .

Longtime activist Al Sharpton , now a MSNBC host , implored young black men to respect women and reminded them that two of the leading figures in the civil rights movement of the 1960s were women .
Speakers frequently mentioned persistent high unemployment among blacks , which is about twice that of white Americans , and the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida .

Then , people crowded the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and could get close to King to hear his `` I Have a Dream '' speech . Saturday 's speakers were also on the memorial 's steps , but metal barriers kept people away from the reflecting pool and only a small group of attendees was allowed near the memorial Saturday .

Williamson, Yuval Levin, Andrew C. Mccarthy","The new racism : Skin color has become the most important factor in the college-application process .
There are many reasons that conservatives rallied so strongly around Jeff Sessions in his recent conflict with President Trump . Last night , we gained another reason to be glad that he runs the Department of Justice .
The New York Times reported that it obtained a document indicating that the DOJ was looking for lawyers who were interested in “ investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions. ” Despite the lack of any racial emphasis whatsoever , the Times described the intent as “ redirecting resources ” to protect “ white applicants . ”
I ’ d describe it differently . I ’ d say the DOJ is enforcing the law . And if you think white applicants would be the prime beneficiary of fair enforcement , you ’ re sadly mistaken . The true victims of affirmative action are our Asian-American citizens .
In 2015 and 2016 , Asian-American groups filed complaints against a number of elite American colleges , and these complaints presented evidence of a truly stunning level of race-based discrimination in higher education . For example , they alleged that Asian Americans have the “ lowest acceptance rate for each SAT test-score bracket. ” To gain admission to college , Asian-American students had to score 140 points higher than white students , 270 points higher than Hispanic students , and 450 points higher than black students .
Compounding the problem , the complaints presented strong evidence of prohibited quotas . As the Asian-American population expanded , its college-admission rate stagnated — in much the same way that anti-Semitic administrators used to place caps on Jewish students .
At Yale , for example , from 2001 to 2008 the percentage of Asian-American students never exceeded 13.80 percent of the student body or dropped below 13.50 percent — an unbelievable almost decade-long fluctuation of only 0.3 percent . The caps change over time ( they increase and decrease ) , but they ’ re always there .
The complaints rightly assail the damage caused by the quotas and the obvious and extreme higher standards applied to Asian-American students :
The discriminatory practices by Yale , Brown , Dartmouth , and other Ivy League colleges have caused tremendous harm to students in the Asian-American community , including stress/mental health issues ; pressure to study more as the bar is raised higher ; lack of trust in American institutions ; self-identification crises ; and fortification of racial barriers . For each and every Asian-American college applicant , such discrimination engenders a feeling that , being Asian American , he or she is somehow less American than peers of other racial backgrounds .
I can understand why . I ’ ve seen this discrimination with my own eyes .

The new racism: Skin color has become the most important factor in the college-application process.

There are many reasons that conservatives rallied so strongly around Jeff Sessions in his recent conflict with President Trump. Last night, we gained another reason to be glad that he runs the Department of Justice.

The New York Times reported that it obtained a document indicating that the DOJ was looking for lawyers who were interested in “investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions.” Despite the lack of any racial emphasis whatsoever, the Times described the intent as “redirecting resources” to protect “white applicants.”

I’d describe it differently. I’d say the DOJ is enforcing the law. And if you think white applicants would be the prime beneficiary of fair enforcement, you’re sadly mistaken. The true victims of affirmative action are our Asian-American citizens.

In 2015 and 2016, Asian-American groups filed complaints against a number of elite American colleges, and these complaints presented evidence of a truly stunning level of race-based discrimination in higher education. For example, they alleged that Asian Americans have the “lowest acceptance rate for each SAT test-score bracket.” To gain admission to college, Asian-American students had to score 140 points higher than white students, 270 points higher than Hispanic students, and 450 points higher than black students.

Compounding the problem, the complaints presented strong evidence of prohibited quotas. As the Asian-American population expanded, its college-admission rate stagnated — in much the same way that anti-Semitic administrators used to place caps on Jewish students.

At Yale, for example, from 2001 to 2008 the percentage of Asian-American students never exceeded 13.80 percent of the student body or dropped below 13.50 percent — an unbelievable almost decade-long fluctuation of only 0.3 percent. The caps change over time (they increase and decrease), but they’re always there.

The complaints rightly assail the damage caused by the quotas and the obvious and extreme higher standards applied to Asian-American students:

The discriminatory practices by Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, and other Ivy League colleges have caused tremendous harm to students in the Asian-American community, including stress/mental health issues; pressure to study more as the bar is raised higher; lack of trust in American institutions; self-identification crises; and fortification of racial barriers. For each and every Asian-American college applicant, such discrimination engenders a feeling that, being Asian American, he or she is somehow less American than peers of other racial backgrounds.

I can understand why. I’ve seen this discrimination with my own eyes. As I’ve written before, I served for a time on the admissions committee at Cornell Law School, and there was a crystal-clear racial, ethnic, and ideological hierarchy. Asian students faced the toughest admissions challenge, then white students, then Hispanics; black students had to clear the lowest academic hurdle. In fact, there was discrimination even within ethnic groups. The committee preferred Mexican Americans to Cuban Americans. It preferred Filipino applicants to Chinese. And it absolutely preferred minority applicants who indicated a commitment to social justice over those who indicated a desire for economic success.

Moreover, in practice, affirmative action often increases the admissions chances of wealthy black and Hispanic kids over poor Asian Americans and poor whites. White students are dinged for their alleged “privilege,” but what privilege do Asian-Americans students enjoy? After all, there are still Japanese Americans alive today who spent time in internment camps. The legacy and pain of discrimination is very real, and it’s compounded by academic standards that explicitly tell Asian-American students that they have to do more and achieve more than anyone else to enjoy the same access to American higher education.

Left-wing regulators have essentially and improperly rewritten Title VI so that colleges may take the Orwellian step of discriminating to allegedly “end” discrimination.

Football players intended to take the field in preparation for their game against Brigham Young University on Saturday.

But something was very different at the University of Missouri campus.

Students on Tuesday woke up to what protesters call a small but important victory: a weeks-long protest movement that ousted both the university president and the school's chancellor.

African-American students at Missouri have long complained of a mealy-mouthed response by school leaders in dealing with racism on the overwhelmingly white Columbia campus. Black student leaders have conveyed their displeasure over students openly using racial slurs and other incidents.

""This is just a beginning in dismantling systems of oppression in higher education, specifically the UM system,"" said Marshall Allen, a member of the protest group Concerned Student 1950.

Wolfe's resignation

The speed of Wolfe's resignation shocked many. As late as Sunday, Wolfe didn't sound like a man who planned to leave his job, putting out a statement expressing a desire to have an ""ongoing dialogue to address these very complex, societal issues.""

But the tide had already turned against him Saturday night, when about 30 black members of the Missouri Tigers football team declared in a tweet that they wouldn't play until Wolfe was gone. By Sunday, more members of the team, black and white, and head coach Gary Pinkel publicly backed the players, and the media started paying attention.

The incidents

Though the protesting students and some faculty say racial problems on campus go back decades, the current crisis took flight back in September, when Student Government President Payton Head took to Facebook to complain about bigotry and anti-homosexual and anti-transgender attitudes at the school after people riding in the back of a pickup truck screamed racial slurs at him.

""For those of you who wonder why I'm always talking about the importance of inclusion and respect, it's because I've experienced moments like this multiple times at THIS university, making me not feel included here,"" he wrote.

And once again , the bull 's eye is the 1965 Voting Rights Act , widely viewed as the most effective and successful civil rights legislation in American history . Upheld five times by the court , the law now appears to be on life support .
The provision at issue in Wednesday 's case applies only to specific parts of the country where discriminatory voting procedures were once rampant . It covers all of nine states , mainly in the South , plus parts of seven other states . To head off discriminatory voting procedures before they happen , the law requires covered areas to get approval from federal officials before changes can take place . So , for example , if an Alabama town wants to change polling places , or to change from an elected board to an appointed board , or to annex another part of the county , it has to first get permission from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington , D.C .
Congress came up with the formula in 1965 to cover areas of the country that had a history of blatant , even violent discrimination in voting ; but the formula has not been changed since 1975 , and it still relies on election data from 1972 . That 's the crux of the issue before the court now : whether times have changed so much that Congress , in reauthorizing the law in 2006 without updating the formula , violated the Constitution .
The congressional vote in 2006 was overwhelmingly and astonishingly bipartisan , with the Senate voting unanimously to extend the law and the House voting 390-33 .
`` What the 12,000 pages of hearing [ testimony ] showed '' is that for many of the jurisdictions , `` there still was pervasive discrimination , '' says Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin , who led weeks of hearings in the House as chairman of the Judiciary Committee .
Under the law , any jurisdiction with a clean record for 10 years could bail out , and some have done just that . There is also a provision to bail in jurisdictions that can be shown in court to have consistently misbehaved . But basically the law was unchanged — all the areas that had been subject to preclearance before 2006 still were — and Congress simply extended it for another 25 years .
That prompted a legal challenge . But when it reached the Supreme Court in 2009 , the justices dodged the major issue in the case , ruling instead on a lesser question . At the same time , though , Chief Justice John Roberts ' opinion for the court expressed serious doubt as to whether the law was justified anymore , and it all but invited a future challenge if Congress did not act to change the coverage formula .
Congress , of course , did not act , and now the issue is back in a case brought by Shelby County , Ala. , a once rural and now more suburban community south of Birmingham .
Frank `` Butch '' Ellis has been the Shelby County attorney since 1964 , the year before the Voting Rights Act was enacted .
`` The South has changed , '' he says , adding that there is no more discrimination in the South than anywhere else . `` There 's probably bits of it everywhere , but there 's no evidence that it 's more prevalent in these covered jurisdictions than it is in the noncovered jurisdictions . That 's our complaint . ''
`` Shelby County still advertises itself as the heart of the Heart of Dixie , and that tells you that some things have not changed , or at least have n't changed enough to take the bandage off the wound , '' says Pam Karlan , a voting-rights expert who has written a friend of the court brief on behalf of Rep. Sensenbrenner and a bipartisan group of lawmakers involved in the 2006 reauthorization .
She notes that Shelby County could escape the preclearance requirement if it could show it had a clean record for 10 years , but the county ca n't make that showing . She points , for example , to a municipality within the county called Calera .
When Calera `` redrew the boundaries for their city council districts , they did it to make sure that the one black member of the city council could n't be re-elected , '' Karlan says .
That black council member , Ernest Montgomery , says he did n't even know that there was an effort to change his district until after the Justice Department rejected the change .
County Attorney Ellis , however , forcefully objects to the notion that Shelby County tried to use artifice to prevent a black candidate from winning an election . He notes that in a county that is 90 percent white , there have been multiple elections in which black candidates defeated white candidates .
`` In any race , you show where you had a minority candidate happen to lose , I can show you two where they won with a 90 percent white population , '' Ellis says . He maintains that because the Voting Rights Act has not been updated in its coverage formula since 1975 , the law amounts to an unjustified violation of states ' equal sovereignty .
`` All of our states are equally sovereign , and if you 're going to impose a current burden , '' he argues , `` you 've got to have a current justification . You ca n't use a justification that 's 49 years old . ''
Defenders of the law counter that the post-Civil War amendments to the Constitution explicitly give Congress the power to enact appropriate legislation to enforce and protect the right to vote .
As for Shelby County 's equality argument , it treats the Constitution `` as if it 's about equal protection for the states , not about equal protection for people , '' Karlan says .
The Shelby County case is a microcosm of what the legal debate over the Voting Rights Act is all about .
`` The case has enormous real and symbolic significance , '' observes NYU law professor Richard Pildes . At the same time , it `` symbolizes different things to different people . '' To some , he says , `` the case is all about whether there continue to be any problems with race in voting in these parts of the country . '' To others , `` the case symbolizes whether the political process today can recognize that anything significant has changed with respect to race and politics '' in the South .
To Alabama Solicitor General John Neiman , for instance , it makes no sense that Congress in 2006 simply extended the law without looking at how things have changed in the South and other covered areas . The problem `` in terms of the outright defiance by officials of federal voting rights '' that Congress was concerned with in 1965 just does n't exist anymore , he says .
But Rep. Sensenbrenner disagrees : `` Almost the entire Congress was convinced that [ the states ] had n't cleaned up their act . ''
The Supreme Court , however , has hinted strongly that it is not similarly convinced .
In 2009 , when the high court upheld the Voting Rights Act , Chief Justice Roberts seemed to foreshadow many of the arguments that will be made by Shelby County on Wednesday .
`` Things have changed in the South , '' Roberts said in announcing the decision . The `` burdens '' imposed by the law `` must be justified by current needs . '' The Voting Rights Act , he said , `` differentiates between the states in ways that are in tension with our fundamental tradition of equal sovereignty among the states . '' And , he added that these distinctions `` may no longer be justified by current conditions . ''
To Sherrilyn Ifill , president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , those sentiments are just plain scary . She says that without preclearance , known as Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act , there is no way to challenge all of the legal twists and turns that can be used to deny minorities the right to vote and be represented .
`` The reality is without Section 5 , you ca n't keep up , '' Ifill said . `` We ca n't keep up . No civil rights organization could keep up with all the minute changes that could happen in thousands of jurisdictions throughout this country , and that 's why Congress created it .

Congressional Action

The congressional vote in 2006 was overwhelmingly and astonishingly bipartisan, with the Senate voting unanimously to extend the law and the House voting 390-33.

""What the 12,000 pages of hearing [testimony] showed"" is that for many of the jurisdictions, ""there still was pervasive discrimination,"" says Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who led weeks of hearings in the House as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

At the same time, though, Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion for the court expressed serious doubt as to whether the law was justified anymore, and it all but invited a future challenge if Congress did not act to change the coverage formula.

'The South Has Changed'

Congress, of course, did not act, and now the issue is back in a case brought by Shelby County, Ala., a once rural and now more suburban community south of Birmingham.

Frank ""Butch"" Ellis has been the Shelby County attorney since 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act was enacted.

""There's probably bits of it everywhere, but there's no evidence that it's more prevalent in these covered jurisdictions than it is in the noncovered jurisdictions. That's our complaint.""

Others disagree with that assessment.

""Shelby County still advertises itself as the heart of the Heart of Dixie, and that tells you that some things have not changed, or at least haven't changed enough to take the bandage off the wound,"" says Pam Karlan, a voting-rights expert who has written a friend of the court brief on behalf of Rep.

County Attorney Ellis, however, forcefully objects to the notion that Shelby County tried to use artifice to prevent a black candidate from winning an election. He notes that in a county that is 90 percent white, there have been multiple elections in which black candidates defeated white candidates.

""In any race, you show where you had a minority candidate happen to lose, I can show you two where they won with a 90 percent white population,"" Ellis says. He maintains that because the Voting Rights Act has not been updated in its coverage formula since 1975, the law amounts to an unjustified violation of states' equal sovereignty.

""All of our states are equally sovereign, and if you're going to impose a current burden,"" he argues, ""you've got to have a current justification. You can't use a justification that's 49 years old.""

Significance Of Case

Defenders of the law counter that the post-Civil War amendments to the Constitution explicitly give Congress the power to enact appropriate legislation to enforce and protect the right to vote.

As for Shelby County's equality argument, it treats the Constitution ""as if it's about equal protection for the states, not about equal protection for people,"" Karlan says.

The Shelby County case is a microcosm of what the legal debate over the Voting Rights Act is all about.

""The case has enormous real and symbolic significance,"" observes NYU law professor Richard Pildes. At the same time, it ""symbolizes different things to different people."" To some, he says, ""the case is all about whether there continue to be any problems with race in voting in these parts of the country."" To others, ""the case symbolizes whether the political process today can recognize that anything significant has changed with respect to race and politics"" in the South.

To Alabama Solicitor General John Neiman, for instance, it makes no sense that Congress in 2006 simply extended the law without looking at how things have changed in the South and other covered areas. The problem ""in terms of the outright defiance by officials of federal voting rights"" that Congress was concerned with in 1965 just doesn't exist anymore, he says.

But Rep. Sensenbrenner disagrees: ""Almost the entire Congress was convinced that [the states] hadn't cleaned up their act.""

High Court's View?

The Supreme Court, however, has hinted strongly that it is not similarly convinced.

In 2009, when the high court upheld the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice Roberts seemed to foreshadow many of the arguments that will be made by Shelby County on Wednesday.

""Things have changed in the South,"" Roberts said in announcing the decision. The ""burdens"" imposed by the law ""must be justified by current needs."" The Voting Rights Act, he said, ""differentiates between the states in ways that are in tension with our fundamental tradition of equal sovereignty among the states."" And, he added that these distinctions ""may no longer be justified by current conditions.""

To Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, those sentiments are just plain scary. She says that without preclearance, known as Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, there is no way to challenge all of the legal twists and turns that can be used to deny minorities the right to vote and be represented.

""The reality is without Section 5, you can't keep up,"" Ifill said. ""We can't keep up. No civil rights organization could keep up with all the minute changes that could happen in thousands of jurisdictions throughout this country, and that's why Congress created it.""",www.npr.org,center,znVFleonfAWdssOc

AMY GOODMAN : Today is the federal holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King . He was born January 15th , 1929 . He was assassinated April 4th , 1968 , at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis , Tennessee . He was just 39 years old . While Dr. King is primarily remembered as a civil rights leader , he also championed the cause of the poor , organizing the Poor People ’ s Campaign to address issues of economic justice . Dr. King was also a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy and the Vietnam War .
In 1964 , Dr. King became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize . Days before he received that award in Oslo , Norway , Dr. King traveled to London . On December 7th , 1964 , Dr. King gave a speech sponsored by the British group Christian Action about the civil rights struggle in the United States , as well as the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa . The speech was recorded by Saul Bernstein , who was working as the European correspondent for Pacifica Radio . Bernstein ’ s recording was recently discovered by Brian DeShazor , director of the Pacifica Radio Archives . This is that address by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr .
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. : I want to talk with you mainly about our struggle in the United States and , before taking my seat , talk about some of the larger struggles in the whole world and some of the more difficult struggles in places like South Africa . But there is a desperate , poignant question on the lips of people all over our country and all over the world . I get it almost everywhere I go and almost every press conference . It is a question of whether we are making any real progress in the struggle to make racial justice a reality in the United States of America . And whenever I seek to answer that question , on the one hand , I seek to avoid an undue pessimism ; on the other hand , I seek to avoid a superficial optimism . And I try to incorporate or develop what I consider a realistic position , by admitting on the one hand that we have made many significant strides over the last few years in the struggle for racial justice , but by admitting that before the problem is solved we still have numerous things to do and many challenges to meet . And it is this realistic position that I would like to use as a basis for our thinking together tonight as we think about the problem in the United States . We have come a long , long way , but we have a long , long way to go before the problem is solved .
Now let us notice first that we ’ ve come a long , long way . And I would like to say at this point that the Negro himself has come a long , long way in re-evaluating his own intrinsic worth . Now , in order to illustrate this , a little history is necessary . It was in the year 1619 when the first Negro slaves landed on the shores of America . And they were brought there from the soils of Africa . Unlike the pilgrim fathers who landed at Plymouth a year later , they were brought there against their wills . And throughout slavery , the Negro was treated in a very inhuman fashion . He was a thing to be used , not a person to be respected . The United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in 1857 known as the Dred Scott decision , which well illustrated this whole idea and which well illustrated what existed at that time , for in this decision the Supreme Court of the United States said , in substance , that the Negro is not a citizen of the United States , he is merely property subject to the dictates of his owner . And it went on to say that the Negro has no rights that the white man is bound to respect . This was the idea that prevailed during the days of slavery .
With the growth of slavery , it became necessary to give some justification for it . You know , it seems to be a fact of life that human beings can not continue to do wrong without eventually reaching out for some thin rationalization to clothe an obvious wrong in the beautiful garments of righteousness . And this is exactly what happened during the days of slavery . There were those who even misused the Bible and religion to give some justification for slavery and to crystallize the patterns of the status quo . And so it was argued from some pulpits that the Negro was inferior by nature because of Noah ’ s curse upon the children of Ham . Then , the apostle Paul ’ s dictum became a watchword : “ Servants be obedient to your master. ” And one brother had probably read the logic of the great philosopher Aristotle . You know , Aristotle did a great deal to bring into being what we now know as formal logic in philosophy . And in formal logic , there is a big word known as the syllogism , which has a major premise , a minor premise and a conclusion . And so , this brother decided to put his argument for the inferiority of the Negro in the framework of an Aristotelian syllogism . He could say all men are made in the image of God—this was a major premise . Then came the minor premise : God , as everybody knows , is not a Negro , therefore the Negro is not a man . This was the kind of reasoning that prevailed .
While living with the conditions of slavery and then , later , segregation , many Negroes lost faith in themselves . Many came to feel that perhaps they were less than human . Many came to feel that they were inferior . This , it seems to me , is the greatest tragedy of slavery , the greatest tragedy of segregation , not merely what it does to the individual physically , but what it does to one psychologically . It scars the soul of the segregated as well as the segregator . It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority , while leaving the segregated with a false sense of inferiority . And this is exactly what happened .
Then something happened to the Negro , and circumstances made it possible and necessary for him to travel more—the coming of the automobile , the upheavals of two world wars , the Great Depression . And so his rural plantation background gradually gave way to urban industrial life . His economic life was gradually rising through the growth of industry , the development of organized labor and expanded educational opportunities . And even his cultural life was gradually rising through the steady decline of crippling illiteracy . All of these forces conjoined to cause the Negro in America to take a new look at himself . Negro masses all over began to re-evaluate themselves .
And then something else happened , along with all of this : The Negro in the United States turned his eyes and his mind to Africa , and he noticed the magnificent drama of independence taking place on the stage of African history . And noticing the developments and noticing what was happening and noticing what was being done on the part of his black brothers and sisters in Africa gave him a new sense of dignity in the United States and a new sense of self-respect . The Negro came to feel that he was somebody . His religion revealed to him that God loves all of his children and that all men are made in his image , and that the basic thing about a man is not his specificity , but his fundamentum , not the texture of his hair or the color of his skin , but his eternal dignity and worth .
And so the Negro in America could now cry out unconsciously with the eloquent poet , “ Fleecy locks , and black complexion can not forfeit nature ’ s claim ; Skin may differ , but affection dwells in black and white the same , ” and , “ Were I so tall as to reach the pole , or to grasp the ocean at a span , I must be measured by my soul ; the mind is the standard of the man. ” And with this new sense of dignity and this new sense of self-respect , a new Negro came into being with a new determination to suffer , to struggle , to sacrifice , and even to die , if necessary , in order to be free . And this reveals that we have come a long , long way since 1619 .
But if we are to be true to the facts , it is necessary to say that not only has the Negro re-evaluated his own intrinsic worth , the whole nation has come a long , long way in extending the frontiers of civil rights . I would like to mention just a few things that have happened in our country which reveal this . Fifty years ago , or even 25 years ago , a year hardly passed when numerous Negroes were not brutally lynched by some vicious mob . Fortunately , lynchings have about ceased today . If one would go back to the turn of the century , you would find that in the Southern part of the United States you had very few Negroes registered to vote . By 1948 , that number had leaped to about 750,000 ; 1960 , it had leaped to 1,200,000 . And when we went into the presidential election just a few weeks ago , that number had leaped to more than two million . We went into that election with more than two million Negroes registered to vote in the South , which meant that we in the civil rights movement , by working hard , have been able to add more than 800,000 new Negroes as registered voters in the last three years . This reveals that we have made strides .
Then , when we look at the question of economic justice , there ’ s much to do , but we can at least say that some strides have been made . The average Negro wage earner who is employed today in the United States earns 10 times more than the average Negro wage earner of 12 years ago . And the national income of the Negro is now at a little better than $ 28 billion a year , which is all—more than all of the exports of the United States and more than the national budget of Canada . This reveals that we have made some strides in this area .
But probably more than anything else—and you ’ ve read about it so much here and all over the world , I ’ m sure—we have noticed a gradual decline , and even demise , of the system of racial segregation . Now , the legal history of racial segregation had its beginning in 1896 . Many people feel that racial segregation has been a reality in the United States a long , long time , but the fact is that this was a rather recent phenomenon in our country , just a little better than 60 years old . And it had its legal beginning with a decision known as the Plessy v. Ferguson decision , which said , in substance , that separate but equal facilities could exist , and it made the doctrine of separate but equal the law of the land . We all know what happened as a result of the old Plessy doctrine : There was always the strict enforcement of the separate , without the slightest intention to abide by the equal . And the Negro ended up being plunged into the abyss of exploitation , where he experienced the bleakness of nagging injustice .
And then something marvelous happened . The Supreme Court of our nation in 1954 examined the legal body of segregation , and on May 17th of that year pronounced it constitutionally dead . It said , in substance , that the old Plessy doctrine must go , that separate facilities are inherently unequal , and that the segregated child on the basis of his race is to deny that child equal protection of the law . And so , we ’ ve seen many changes since that momentous decision was rendered in 1954 , that came as a great beacon light of hope into millions of disinherited people all over our nation .
Then something else happened , which brought joy to all of our hearts . It happened this year . It was last year , after the struggle in Birmingham , Alabama , that the late President Kennedy came to realize that there was a basic issue that our country had to grapple with . With a sense of concern and a sense of immediacy , he made a great speech , a few days before—rather , it was really on the same day that the University of Alabama was to be integrated , and Governor Wallace stood in the door and tried to block that integration . Mr. Kennedy had to have the National Guard federalized . He stood before the nation and said in eloquent terms the problem which we face in the area of civil rights is not merely a political issue , it is not merely an economic issue , it is , at bottom , a moral issue . It is as old as the scriptures and as modern as the Constitution . It is a question of whether we will treat our Negro brothers as we ourselves would like to be treated .
And on the heels of that great speech , he went in , recommended to the Congress of our nation the most comprehensive civil rights bill ever recommended by any president of our great nation . Unfortunately , after many months of battle , and for a period we got a little tired of that—you know , there are some men in our country who like to talk a lot . Maybe you read about the filibuster . And you know they get bogged down in the paralysis of analysis , and they will just go on and on and on . And they wanted to talk that bill to death .
But President Lyndon Johnson got to work . He started calling congressmen and senators in and started meeting day in and day out with influential people in the country and making it clear that that bill had to pass , as a tribute to the late President Kennedy , but also as a tribute to the greatness of the country and as an expression of its dedication to the American dream . And it was that great day last summer that that bill came into being , and it was on July 2nd that Mr. Johnson signed that bill and it became the law of the land .
And so , in America now , we have a civil rights bill . And I ’ m happy to report to you that , by and large , that bill is being implemented in communities all across the South . We have seen some surprising levels of compliance , even in some communities in the state of Mississippi . And whenever you can find anything right in Mississippi , things are getting better .
AMY GOODMAN : Dr. Martin Luther King , speaking in London , December 7 , 1964 . We ’ ll return to the speech after this break .
AMY GOODMAN : This is ███ ! , democracynow.org , The War and Peace Report . I ’ m Amy Goodman . In this ███ ! exclusive , we return to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his own words from a recording recently discovered the Pacifica Radio Archives . This is from December 7th , 1964 , in London , just days before Dr. King received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo , Norway .
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. : We can never forget the fact that just this summer three civil rights workers were brutally murdered near Philadelphia , Mississippi . All of this reveals to us that we have not achieved the level of brotherhood—we have not achieved the brotherhood that we need and that we must have in our nation . We still have a long , long way to go .
I mentioned voter registration and the fact that we have been able to add about 800,000 new registered voters in the last two or three years , the fact that it ’ s over two million now . I guess that sounded like real progress , and it does represent some progress . But let me give you the other side , and that is the fact that there are still more than 10 million Negroes living in the Southern part of the United States , and some six million of the Negroes living in the Southern part of the United States are of voting age , and yet only two million are registered . This means that four million remain unregistered , not merely because they are apathetic , not because they are complacent—this may be true of some few—but because all types of conniving methods are still being used to keep Negroes from becoming registered voters . Complex literacy tests are given , which make it almost impossible for anybody to pass the test , even if he has a Ph.D. degree in any field or a law degree from the best law schools of the world . And then actual economic reprisals are often taken out against Negroes who seek to register and vote in some of the Black Belt counties of Mississippi and Alabama and other places . Then , some are actually faced with physical violence , and sometimes physical death . This reveals that we have a great deal that must be done in this area .
I mentioned economic justice , and I am sure that that figure , $ 28 billion , sounded very large . That ’ s a lot of money . But then I must go on and give you the other side , if I am to be honest about the picture . That is a fact that 42 percent of the Negro families of the United States still earn less than $ 2,000 a year , while just 16 percent of the white families earn less than $ 2,000 a year ; 21 percent of the Negro families of America earn less than $ 1,000 a year , while just 5 percent of the white families earn less than $ 1,000 a year . And then we face the fact that 88 percent of the Negro families of America earn less than $ 5,000 a year , while just 58 percent of the white families earn less than $ 5,000 a year . So we can see that there is still a great gulf between the haves , so to speak , and the have-nots . And if America is to continue to grow and progress and develop and move on toward its greatness , this problem must be solved .
Now , this economic problem is getting more serious because of many forces alive in our world and in our nation . For many years , Negroes were denied adequate educational opportunities . For many years , Negroes were even denied apprenticeship training . And so , the forces of labor and industry so often discriminated against Negroes . And this meant that the Negro ended up being limited , by and large , to unskilled and semi-skilled labor . Now , because of the forces of automation and cybernation , these are the jobs that are now passing away . And so , the Negro wakes up in a city like Detroit , Michigan , and discovers that he is 28 percent of the population and about 72 percent of the unemployed . Now , in order to grapple with that problem , our federal government will have to develop massive retraining programs , massive public works programs , so that automation can be a blessing , as it must be to our society , and not a curse .
Then the other thing when we think of this economic problem , we must think of the fact that there is nothing more dangerous than to build a society with a segment in that society which feels that it has no stake in the society , and nothing more dangerous than to build a society with a number of people who see life as little more than a long and desolate corridor with no exit sign . They end up with despair because they have no jobs , because they can ’ t educate their children , because they can ’ t live in a nice home , because they can ’ t have adequate health facilities .
We always hear of the various reasons why and the various myths concerning integration and why integration shouldn ’ t come into being . Those people who argue against integration at this point often say , “ Well , if you integrate the public schools , for instance , you will pull the white race back a generation. ” And they like to talk about the cultural lag in the Negro community . And then they go on to say , “ Now , you know , the Negro is a criminal , and he has the highest crime rate in any city that you can find in the United States. ” And the arguments go on ad infinitum why integration shouldn ’ t come into being .
But I think there ’ s an answer to that , and that is that if there is cultural lag in the Negro community—and there certainly is—this lag is there because of segregation and discrimination . It ’ s there because of long years of slavery and segregation . Criminal responses are not racial , but environmental . Poverty , economic deprivation , social isolation and all of these things breed crime , whatever the racial group may be . And it is a torturous logic to use the tragic results of racial segregation as an argument for the continuation of it . It is necessary to go back . And so it is necessary to see this and to go all out to make economic justice a reality all over our nation .
I mentioned that racial segregation is about dead in the United States , but it ’ s still with us . We are about past the day of legal segregation . We have about ended de jure segregation , where the laws of the nation or of a particular state can uphold it , because of the civil rights bill and the Supreme Court ’ s decision and other things . We have passed the day when the Negro can ’ t eat at a lunch counter , with the exception of a few isolated situations , or where the Negro can ’ t check in a motel or hotel . We are fastly passing that day . But there is another form of segregation coming up . It is coming up through housing discrimination , joblessness and the de facto segregation in the public schools . And so the ghettoized conditions that exist make for many problems , and it makes for a hardcore , de facto segregation that we must grapple with on a day-to-day basis . And so , this is the problem that we face , and this is a problem that we are forced to deal with . And we are going to deal with it in a determined way . I am absolutely convinced that segregation is on its deathbed , and those who represent it , whether they be in the United States or whether they be in London , England , the system is on its deathbed .
But certainly , we all know that if democracy is to live in any nation , segregation must die . And as I ’ ve tried to say all over America , we ’ ve got to get rid of segregation not merely because it will help our image—it certainly will help our image in the world . We ’ ve got to get rid of segregation not merely because it will appeal to Asian and African people—and this certainly will be helpful , this is important . But in the final analysis , racial discrimination must be uprooted from American society and from every society , because it is morally wrong . So it is necessary to go all out and develop massive action programs to get rid of racial segregation .
Now I would like to mention one or two ideas that circulate in our society—and they probably circulate in your society and all over the world—that keep us from developing the kind of action programs necessary to get rid of discrimination and segregation . One is what I refer to as the myth of time . There are those individuals who argue that only time can solve the problem of racial injustice in the United States , in South Africa or anywhere else ; you ’ ve got to wait on time . And I know they ’ ve said to us so often in the States and to our allies in the white community , “ Just be nice and be patient and continue to pray , and in 100 or 200 years the problem will work itself out. ” We have heard and we have lived with the myth of time . The only answer that I can give to that myth is that time is neutral . It can be used either constructively or destructively . And I must honestly say to you that I ’ m convinced that the forces of ill will have often used time much more effectively than the forces of goodwill . And we may have to repent in this generation , not merely for the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people , but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around saying , “ Wait on time . ”
And somewhere along the way it is necessary to see that human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability . It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals who are willing to be co-workers with God . And without this hard work , time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation . And so we must help time , and we must realize that the time is always ripe to do right . This is so vital , and this is so necessary .
Now , the other myth that gets around a great deal in our nation and , I ’ m sure , in other nations of the world is the idea that you can ’ t solve the problems in the realm of human relations through legislation ; you can ’ t solve the housing problem and the job problem and all of these other problems through legislation ; you ’ ve got to change the heart . We had a presidential candidate just recently who spoke about this a great deal . And I think Mr. Goldwater sincerely believed that you couldn ’ t anything through legislation , because he voted against everything in the Senate , including the civil rights bill . And he said all over the nation throughout the election that we don ’ t need legislation , that legislation can ’ t deal with this problem . But he was nice enough to say that you ’ ve got to change the heart .
Now I want to at least go halfway with Brother Goldwater at that point . I think he ’ s right . If we ’ re going to get this problem solved in America and all over the world , ultimately , people must change their hearts where they have prejudices . If we are going to solve the problems facing mankind , I would be the first to say that every white person must look down deep within and remove every prejudice that may be there , and come to see that the Negro , and the colored peoples , generally , must be treated right , not merely because the law says it , but because it is right and because it is natural . I agree with this 100 percent . And I ’ m sure that if the problem is to be solved , ultimately , men must be obedient not merely to that which can be enforced by the law , but they must rise to the majestic heights of being obedient to the unenforceable .
But after saying all of that , I must go on to the other side . This is where I must leave Mr. Goldwater and others who believe that legislation has no place . It may be true that you can ’ t legislate integration , but you can legislate desegregation . It may be true that morality can not be legislated , but behavior can be regulated . It may be true that the law can ’ t change the heart , but it can restrain the heartless . It may be true that the law can ’ t make a man love me , but it can restrain him from lynching me . And I think that ’ s pretty important also .
AMY GOODMAN : Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , speaking in London on December 7 , 1964 . We ’ ll return to that speech after this break .
AMY GOODMAN : This is ███ ! , democracynow.org , The War and Peace Report . I ’ m Amy Goodman . In this ███ ! exclusive , we return to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his own words from a recording recently discovered by the Pacifica Radio Archive , the speech given in London , December 7 , 1964 , just days before Dr. King received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo , Norway .
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. : Now , as you know , we have been engaged in the United States in a massive struggle to make desegregation and , finally , integration a reality . And in that struggle , there has been an undergirding philosophy : the philosophy of nonviolence , the philosophy and method of nonviolent resistance . And I ’ d like to say just a few words about the method or the philosophy that has undergirded our struggle . And first I want to say that I ’ m still convinced that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom and justice . It has a way of disarming the opponent , exposing his moral defenses . It weakens his morale , and at the same time it works on his conscience , and he just doesn ’ t know how to handle it . If he doesn ’ t beat you , wonderful . If he beats you , you develop the quiet courage of accepting blows without retaliating . If he doesn ’ t put you in jail , wonderful . Nobody with any sense loves to go to jail . But if he puts you in jail , you go in that jail and transform it from a dungeon of shame to a haven of freedom and human dignity . Even if he tries to kill you , you develop the inner conviction that there is something so dear , something so precious , something so eternally true , that they are worth dying for . And if a man has not discovered something that he will die for , he isn ’ t fit to live . And this is what the nonviolent discipline says .
And then the other thing about it is that it gives the individual a way of struggling to secure moral ends through moral means . One of the great debates of history has been over the whole question of ends and means . All the way back from the days of Plato ’ s dialogues coming on up through Machiavelli and others , there have been those individuals who argued that the end justifies the means . But in a real sense , the nonviolent philosophy comes along and says that the end is pre-existent in the means . The means represent the ideal in the making and the end in process . And so that in the long run of history , immoral means can not bring about moral ends . Somehow man must come to the point that he sees the necessity of having ends and means cohering , so to speak . And this is one of the things that is basic in the nonviolent philosophy at its best . It gives one a way and a method of struggle which says that you can seek to secure moral ends through moral means .
It also says that it is possible to struggle against an evil , unjust system , with all your might and with all your heart , and even hate that unjust system , but yet you maintain an attitude of active goodwill and understanding and even love for the perpetrators of that evil system . And this is the most misunderstood aspect of nonviolence . And this is where those who don ’ t want to follow the nonviolent method say a lot of bad things to those of us who talk about love . But I still go on and believe in it , because I am still convinced that it is love that makes the world go round , and somehow this kind of love can be a powerful force for social change .
I ’ m not talking about a weak love . I ’ m not talking about emotional bosh here . I ’ m not talking about some sentimental quality . I ’ m not talking about an affectionate response . It would be nonsense to urge oppressed people to love their violent oppressors in an affectionate sense , and I have never advised that . When Jesus said , “ Love your enemies , ” I ’ m happy he didn ’ t say , “ Like your enemies. ” It ’ s pretty difficult to like some people . But love is greater than like . Love is understanding creative , redemptive goodwill for all men . Theologians talk about this kind of love with the Greek word agape , which is a sort of overflowing love that seeks nothing in return . And when one develops this , you rise to the position of being able to love the person who does the evil deed , while hating the deed that the person does . And I believe that this can be done . Psychiatrists are telling us now that hatred is a dangerous force , not merely for the hated , but also the hater . Many of the strange things that happen in the subconscious , many of the inner conflicts , are rooted in hate . And so they are saying , “ Love or perish. ” This is why Erich Fromm can write a book entitled The Art of Loving , arguing that love is the supreme unifying force of life . And so it is wonderful to have a method of struggle where it is possible to stand up against segregation , to stand up against colonialism with all of your might , and yet not hate the perpetrators of these unjust systems . And I believe firmly that it is through this kind of powerful nonviolent action , this kind of love that organizes itself into mass action , that we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation and the world into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood . Certainly this is the great challenge facing us .
Now , I think that nonviolence can work not only in the situation that we find in our country , not only with the magnificent example that we have in India , expressed through the marvelous work of Mohandas K. Gandhi , but I think it can work in ways and in circumstances that we haven ’ t seen it or we haven ’ t used it before . And in this context , I would like to say something about South Africa . And I ’ d like to read just a statement that I have written here so that I ’ ll be sure that I ’ ll say everything that I have in mind about the South African situation without missing anything .
I understand there are here tonight South Africans , some of whom have been involved in the long struggle for freedom there . In our struggle for freedom and justice in the United States , which has also been so long and difficult , we feel a powerful sense of identification with those in the far more deadly struggle for freedom in South Africa . We know how Africans there , and their friends of other races , strove for half a century to win their freedom by nonviolent methods . We have honored Chief Lutuli for his leadership , and we know how this nonviolence was only met by increasing violence from the state , increasing repression , culminating in the shootings at Sharpeville and all that has happened since .
Clearly there is much in Mississippi and Alabama to remind the South Africans of their own country , yet even in Mississippi we can organize to register Negro voters . We can speak to the press . We can , in short , organize the people in nonviolent action . But in South Africa , even the mildest form of nonviolent resistance meets with years of imprisonment , and leaders over many years have been restricted and silenced and imprisoned . We can understand how in that situation people felt so desperate that they turned to other methods , such as sabotage .
Today , great leaders , like Nelson Mandela and Robert Sobukwe , are among the many hundreds wasting away in Robben Island prison . Against a massive , armed and ruthless state , which uses torture and sadistic forms of interrogation to crush human beings , even driving some to suicide , the militant opposition inside South Africa seems for the moment to be silenced . The mass of the people seems to be contained , seems for the moment unable to break from the oppression . I emphasize the word “ seems ” because we can imagine what emotions and plans must be seething below the calm surface of that prosperous police state . We know what emotions are seething in the rest of Africa , and indeed all over the world . The dangers of a race war , of these dangers we have had repeated and profound warning .
It is in this situation , with the great mass of South Africans denied their humanity , their dignity , denied opportunity , denied all human rights ; it is in this situation , with many of the bravest and best South Africans serving long years in prison , with some already executed ; in this situation we in America and Britain have a unique responsibility , for it is we , through our investments , through our governments ’ failure to act decisively , who are guilty of bolstering up the South African tyranny .
Our responsibility—our responsibility presents us with a unique opportunity : We can join in the one form of nonviolent action that could bring freedom and justice to South Africa , the action which African leaders have appealed for , in a massive movement for economic sanctions . In a world living under the appalling shadow of nuclear weapons , do we not recognize the need to perfect the use of economic pressures ? Why is trade regarded by all nations and all ideologies as sacred ? Why does our government and your government in Britain refuse to intervene effectively now , as if only when there is a bloodbath in South Africa—or a Korea or a Vietnam—will they recognize a crisis ? If the United Kingdom and the United States decided tomorrow morning not to buy South African goods , not to buy South African gold , to put an embargo on oil , if our investors and capitalists would withdraw their support for that racial tyranny that we find there , then apartheid would be brought to an end . Then the majority of South Africans of all races could at last build the shared society they desire .
And so this is a challenge facing the nations of the world . And God grant that we will meet this challenge and be a part of that great creative movement that will seek to bring about change and transform those dark yesterdays of man ’ s inhumanity to man into bright tomorrows of justice and peace and goodwill . And may I say to you that the problem of racial injustice is not limited to any one nation . We know now that this is a problem spreading all over the globe . And right here in London and right here in England , you know so well that thousands and thousands of colored people are migrating here from many , many lands—from the West Indies , from Pakistan , from India , from Africa . And they have the just right to come to this great land , and they have the just right to expect justice and democracy in this land . And England must be eternally vigilant . For if not , the same kind of ghettos will develop that we have in the Harlems of the United States . The same problems of injustice , the same problems of inequality in jobs will develop . And so I say to you that the challenge before every citizen of goodwill of this nation is to go all out to make democracy a reality for everybody , so that everybody in this land will be able to live together and that all men will be able to live together as brothers .
You know , there are certain words in every academic discipline that soon become stereotypes and clichés . Every academic discipline has its technical vocabulary . Modern psychology has a word that is probably used more than any other word in modern psychology . It is the word “ maladjusted. ” You ’ ve heard that word . This is the ringing cry of modern child psychology . And certainly we all want to live well-adjusted lives in order to avoid neurotic and schizophrenic personalities . But I must say to you this evening , my friends , as I come to a close , that there are some things in my own nation , and there are some things in the world , to which I am proud to be maladjusted and to which I call upon all men of goodwill to be maladjusted until the good society is realized . I must honestly say to you that I never intend to become adjusted to segregation , discrimination , colonialism and these particular forces . I must honestly say to you that I never intend to adjust myself to religious bigotry . I must honestly say to you that I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few . I must say to you tonight that I never intend to become adjusted to the madness of militarism and the self-defeating effects of physical violence , for in a day when Sputniks and explorers are dashing through outer space and guided ballistic missiles are carving highways of death through the stratosphere , no nation can win a war . It is no longer the choice between violence and nonviolence ; it is either nonviolence or non-existence . And the alternative to disarmament , the alternative to a greater suspension of nuclear tests , the alternative to strengthening the United Nations and thereby disarming the whole world , may well be a civilization plunged into the abyss of annihilation . And I assure you that I will never adjust to the madness of militarism .
You see , it may well be that our whole world is in need at this time for a new organization—the International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment—men and women—men and women who will be as maladjusted as the Prophet Amos , who in the midst of the injustices of his day could cry out in words that echo across the centuries , “ Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream ” ; as maladjusted as the late Abraham Lincoln , the great president of our nation , who had the vision to see that the United States could not survive half-slave and half-free ; as maladjusted as Thomas Jefferson , who , in the midst of an age amazingly adjusted to slavery , could etch across the pages of history words lifted to cosmic proportions : “ We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness ” ; as maladjusted as Jesus of Nazareth , who could say to the men and women of his day , “ He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword. ” And through such maladjustment , we will be able to emerge from the long and desolate midnight of man ’ s inhumanity to man into the bright and glittering daybreak of freedom and justice .
May I say to you that I still believe that mankind will rise up to the occasion . In spite of the darkness of the hour , in spite of the difficulties of the moment , in spite of these days of emotional tension , when the problems of the world are gigantic in extent and chaotic in detail , I still have faith in the future , and I still believe that we can build this society of brotherhood and this society of peace .
We have a song that we sing in our movement , and we have joined hands to sing it so often , beyond/behind jail bars . I can remember times that we have been in jail cells made for 12 people , and yet you would find some 15 or 20 there , and yet we could go on and lift our voices and sing it . I mentioned it yesterday afternoon as I was preaching at St. Paul ’ s . “ We shall overcome . We shall overcome . Deep in my heart I do believe we shall overcome. ” And somehow I believe that mankind will overcome , and I believe that the forces of evil will be defeated . I believe this because Carlyle is right : “ No lie can live forever. ” I believe that we shall overcome because William Cullen Bryant is right : Truth crushed to earth will rise again . I believe that we shall overcome because James Russell Lowell is right : “ Truth forever on the scaffold / Wrong forever on the throne . / Yet that scaffold sways the future , / And behind the then unknown / Standeth God within the shadow , / Keeping watch above his own . ”
With this faith , we will be able to adjourn the counsels of despair and bring new light into the dark chambers of pessimism . With this faith , we will be able to transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of peace and brotherhood . With this faith , we will be able to speed up the day when all of God ’ s children—black men and white men , Jews and Gentiles , Protestants and Catholics , Hindus and Muslims , theists and atheists—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual , “ Free at last ! Free at last ! Thank God Almighty , we are free at last ! ”
We have a long , long way to go before this problem is solved , but thank God we ’ ve made strides . We ’ ve come a long , long way , before I close by quoting the words of an old Negro slave preacher , who didn ’ t quite have his grammar and diction right , but who uttered words of great symbolic profundity : “ Lord , we ain ’ t what we want to be . We ain ’ t what we ought to be . We ain ’ t what we gon na be . But , thank God , we ain ’ t what we was. ” Thank you .

AMY GOODMAN: Today is the federal holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King. He was born January 15th, 1929. He was assassinated April 4th, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was just 39 years old. While Dr. King is primarily remembered as a civil rights leader, he also championed the cause of the poor, organizing the Poor People’s Campaign to address issues of economic justice. Dr. King was also a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy and the Vietnam War.

In 1964, Dr. King became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Days before he received that award in Oslo, Norway, Dr. King traveled to London. On December 7th, 1964, Dr. King gave a speech sponsored by the British group Christian Action about the civil rights struggle in the United States, as well as the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. The speech was recorded by Saul Bernstein, who was working as the European correspondent for Pacifica Radio. Bernstein’s recording was recently discovered by Brian DeShazor, director of the Pacifica Radio Archives. This is that address by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: I want to talk with you mainly about our struggle in the United States and, before taking my seat, talk about some of the larger struggles in the whole world and some of the more difficult struggles in places like South Africa. But there is a desperate, poignant question on the lips of people all over our country and all over the world. I get it almost everywhere I go and almost every press conference. It is a question of whether we are making any real progress in the struggle to make racial justice a reality in the United States of America. And whenever I seek to answer that question, on the one hand, I seek to avoid an undue pessimism; on the other hand, I seek to avoid a superficial optimism. And I try to incorporate or develop what I consider a realistic position, by admitting on the one hand that we have made many significant strides over the last few years in the struggle for racial justice, but by admitting that before the problem is solved we still have numerous things to do and many challenges to meet. And it is this realistic position that I would like to use as a basis for our thinking together tonight as we think about the problem in the United States. We have come a long, long way, but we have a long, long way to go before the problem is solved.

Now let us notice first that we’ve come a long, long way. And I would like to say at this point that the Negro himself has come a long, long way in re-evaluating his own intrinsic worth. Now, in order to illustrate this, a little history is necessary. It was in the year 1619 when the first Negro slaves landed on the shores of America. And they were brought there from the soils of Africa. Unlike the pilgrim fathers who landed at Plymouth a year later, they were brought there against their wills. And throughout slavery, the Negro was treated in a very inhuman fashion. He was a thing to be used, not a person to be respected. The United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in 1857 known as the Dred Scott decision, which well illustrated this whole idea and which well illustrated what existed at that time, for in this decision the Supreme Court of the United States said, in substance, that the Negro is not a citizen of the United States, he is merely property subject to the dictates of his owner. And it went on to say that the Negro has no rights that the white man is bound to respect. This was the idea that prevailed during the days of slavery.

With the growth of slavery, it became necessary to give some justification for it. You know, it seems to be a fact of life that human beings cannot continue to do wrong without eventually reaching out for some thin rationalization to clothe an obvious wrong in the beautiful garments of righteousness. And this is exactly what happened during the days of slavery. There were those who even misused the Bible and religion to give some justification for slavery and to crystallize the patterns of the status quo. And so it was argued from some pulpits that the Negro was inferior by nature because of Noah’s curse upon the children of Ham. Then, the apostle Paul’s dictum became a watchword: “Servants be obedient to your master.” And one brother had probably read the logic of the great philosopher Aristotle. You know, Aristotle did a great deal to bring into being what we now know as formal logic in philosophy. And in formal logic, there is a big word known as the syllogism, which has a major premise, a minor premise and a conclusion. And so, this brother decided to put his argument for the inferiority of the Negro in the framework of an Aristotelian syllogism. He could say all men are made in the image of God—this was a major premise. Then came the minor premise: God, as everybody knows, is not a Negro, therefore the Negro is not a man. This was the kind of reasoning that prevailed.

While living with the conditions of slavery and then, later, segregation, many Negroes lost faith in themselves. Many came to feel that perhaps they were less than human. Many came to feel that they were inferior. This, it seems to me, is the greatest tragedy of slavery, the greatest tragedy of segregation, not merely what it does to the individual physically, but what it does to one psychologically. It scars the soul of the segregated as well as the segregator. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority, while leaving the segregated with a false sense of inferiority. And this is exactly what happened.

Then something happened to the Negro, and circumstances made it possible and necessary for him to travel more—the coming of the automobile, the upheavals of two world wars, the Great Depression. And so his rural plantation background gradually gave way to urban industrial life. His economic life was gradually rising through the growth of industry, the development of organized labor and expanded educational opportunities. And even his cultural life was gradually rising through the steady decline of crippling illiteracy. All of these forces conjoined to cause the Negro in America to take a new look at himself. Negro masses all over began to re-evaluate themselves.

And then something else happened, along with all of this: The Negro in the United States turned his eyes and his mind to Africa, and he noticed the magnificent drama of independence taking place on the stage of African history. And noticing the developments and noticing what was happening and noticing what was being done on the part of his black brothers and sisters in Africa gave him a new sense of dignity in the United States and a new sense of self-respect. The Negro came to feel that he was somebody. His religion revealed to him that God loves all of his children and that all men are made in his image, and that the basic thing about a man is not his specificity, but his fundamentum, not the texture of his hair or the color of his skin, but his eternal dignity and worth.

And so the Negro in America could now cry out unconsciously with the eloquent poet, “Fleecy locks, and black complexion cannot forfeit nature’s claim; Skin may differ, but affection dwells in black and white the same,” and, “Were I so tall as to reach the pole, or to grasp the ocean at a span, I must be measured by my soul; the mind is the standard of the man.” And with this new sense of dignity and this new sense of self-respect, a new Negro came into being with a new determination to suffer, to struggle, to sacrifice, and even to die, if necessary, in order to be free. And this reveals that we have come a long, long way since 1619.

But if we are to be true to the facts, it is necessary to say that not only has the Negro re-evaluated his own intrinsic worth, the whole nation has come a long, long way in extending the frontiers of civil rights. I would like to mention just a few things that have happened in our country which reveal this. Fifty years ago, or even 25 years ago, a year hardly passed when numerous Negroes were not brutally lynched by some vicious mob. Fortunately, lynchings have about ceased today. If one would go back to the turn of the century, you would find that in the Southern part of the United States you had very few Negroes registered to vote. By 1948, that number had leaped to about 750,000; 1960, it had leaped to 1,200,000. And when we went into the presidential election just a few weeks ago, that number had leaped to more than two million. We went into that election with more than two million Negroes registered to vote in the South, which meant that we in the civil rights movement, by working hard, have been able to add more than 800,000 new Negroes as registered voters in the last three years. This reveals that we have made strides.

Then, when we look at the question of economic justice, there’s much to do, but we can at least say that some strides have been made. The average Negro wage earner who is employed today in the United States earns 10 times more than the average Negro wage earner of 12 years ago. And the national income of the Negro is now at a little better than $28 billion a year, which is all—more than all of the exports of the United States and more than the national budget of Canada. This reveals that we have made some strides in this area.

But probably more than anything else—and you’ve read about it so much here and all over the world, I’m sure—we have noticed a gradual decline, and even demise, of the system of racial segregation. Now, the legal history of racial segregation had its beginning in 1896. Many people feel that racial segregation has been a reality in the United States a long, long time, but the fact is that this was a rather recent phenomenon in our country, just a little better than 60 years old. And it had its legal beginning with a decision known as the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which said, in substance, that separate but equal facilities could exist, and it made the doctrine of separate but equal the law of the land. We all know what happened as a result of the old Plessy doctrine: There was always the strict enforcement of the separate, without the slightest intention to abide by the equal. And the Negro ended up being plunged into the abyss of exploitation, where he experienced the bleakness of nagging injustice.

And then something marvelous happened. The Supreme Court of our nation in 1954 examined the legal body of segregation, and on May 17th of that year pronounced it constitutionally dead. It said, in substance, that the old Plessy doctrine must go, that separate facilities are inherently unequal, and that the segregated child on the basis of his race is to deny that child equal protection of the law. And so, we’ve seen many changes since that momentous decision was rendered in 1954, that came as a great beacon light of hope into millions of disinherited people all over our nation.

Then something else happened, which brought joy to all of our hearts. It happened this year. It was last year, after the struggle in Birmingham, Alabama, that the late President Kennedy came to realize that there was a basic issue that our country had to grapple with. With a sense of concern and a sense of immediacy, he made a great speech, a few days before—rather, it was really on the same day that the University of Alabama was to be integrated, and Governor Wallace stood in the door and tried to block that integration. Mr. Kennedy had to have the National Guard federalized. He stood before the nation and said in eloquent terms the problem which we face in the area of civil rights is not merely a political issue, it is not merely an economic issue, it is, at bottom, a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and as modern as the Constitution. It is a question of whether we will treat our Negro brothers as we ourselves would like to be treated.

And on the heels of that great speech, he went in, recommended to the Congress of our nation the most comprehensive civil rights bill ever recommended by any president of our great nation. Unfortunately, after many months of battle, and for a period we got a little tired of that—you know, there are some men in our country who like to talk a lot. Maybe you read about the filibuster. And you know they get bogged down in the paralysis of analysis, and they will just go on and on and on. And they wanted to talk that bill to death.

But President Lyndon Johnson got to work. He started calling congressmen and senators in and started meeting day in and day out with influential people in the country and making it clear that that bill had to pass, as a tribute to the late President Kennedy, but also as a tribute to the greatness of the country and as an expression of its dedication to the American dream. And it was that great day last summer that that bill came into being, and it was on July 2nd that Mr. Johnson signed that bill and it became the law of the land.

And so, in America now, we have a civil rights bill. And I’m happy to report to you that, by and large, that bill is being implemented in communities all across the South. We have seen some surprising levels of compliance, even in some communities in the state of Mississippi. And whenever you can find anything right in Mississippi, things are getting better.

AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Martin Luther King, speaking in London, December 7, 1964. We’ll return to the speech after this break.

[break]

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman. In this Democracy Now! exclusive, we return to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his own words from a recording recently discovered the Pacifica Radio Archives. This is from December 7th, 1964, in London, just days before Dr. King received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway.

REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: We can never forget the fact that just this summer three civil rights workers were brutally murdered near Philadelphia, Mississippi. All of this reveals to us that we have not achieved the level of brotherhood—we have not achieved the brotherhood that we need and that we must have in our nation. We still have a long, long way to go.

I mentioned voter registration and the fact that we have been able to add about 800,000 new registered voters in the last two or three years, the fact that it’s over two million now. I guess that sounded like real progress, and it does represent some progress. But let me give you the other side, and that is the fact that there are still more than 10 million Negroes living in the Southern part of the United States, and some six million of the Negroes living in the Southern part of the United States are of voting age, and yet only two million are registered. This means that four million remain unregistered, not merely because they are apathetic, not because they are complacent—this may be true of some few—but because all types of conniving methods are still being used to keep Negroes from becoming registered voters. Complex literacy tests are given, which make it almost impossible for anybody to pass the test, even if he has a Ph.D. degree in any field or a law degree from the best law schools of the world. And then actual economic reprisals are often taken out against Negroes who seek to register and vote in some of the Black Belt counties of Mississippi and Alabama and other places. Then, some are actually faced with physical violence, and sometimes physical death. This reveals that we have a great deal that must be done in this area.

I mentioned economic justice, and I am sure that that figure, $28 billion, sounded very large. That’s a lot of money. But then I must go on and give you the other side, if I am to be honest about the picture. That is a fact that 42 percent of the Negro families of the United States still earn less than $2,000 a year, while just 16 percent of the white families earn less than $2,000 a year; 21 percent of the Negro families of America earn less than $1,000 a year, while just 5 percent of the white families earn less than $1,000 a year. And then we face the fact that 88 percent of the Negro families of America earn less than $5,000 a year, while just 58 percent of the white families earn less than $5,000 a year. So we can see that there is still a great gulf between the haves, so to speak, and the have-nots. And if America is to continue to grow and progress and develop and move on toward its greatness, this problem must be solved.

Now, this economic problem is getting more serious because of many forces alive in our world and in our nation. For many years, Negroes were denied adequate educational opportunities. For many years, Negroes were even denied apprenticeship training. And so, the forces of labor and industry so often discriminated against Negroes. And this meant that the Negro ended up being limited, by and large, to unskilled and semi-skilled labor. Now, because of the forces of automation and cybernation, these are the jobs that are now passing away. And so, the Negro wakes up in a city like Detroit, Michigan, and discovers that he is 28 percent of the population and about 72 percent of the unemployed. Now, in order to grapple with that problem, our federal government will have to develop massive retraining programs, massive public works programs, so that automation can be a blessing, as it must be to our society, and not a curse.

Then the other thing when we think of this economic problem, we must think of the fact that there is nothing more dangerous than to build a society with a segment in that society which feels that it has no stake in the society, and nothing more dangerous than to build a society with a number of people who see life as little more than a long and desolate corridor with no exit sign. They end up with despair because they have no jobs, because they can’t educate their children, because they can’t live in a nice home, because they can’t have adequate health facilities.

We always hear of the various reasons why and the various myths concerning integration and why integration shouldn’t come into being. Those people who argue against integration at this point often say, “Well, if you integrate the public schools, for instance, you will pull the white race back a generation.” And they like to talk about the cultural lag in the Negro community. And then they go on to say, “Now, you know, the Negro is a criminal, and he has the highest crime rate in any city that you can find in the United States.” And the arguments go on ad infinitum why integration shouldn’t come into being.

But I think there’s an answer to that, and that is that if there is cultural lag in the Negro community—and there certainly is—this lag is there because of segregation and discrimination. It’s there because of long years of slavery and segregation. Criminal responses are not racial, but environmental. Poverty, economic deprivation, social isolation and all of these things breed crime, whatever the racial group may be. And it is a torturous logic to use the tragic results of racial segregation as an argument for the continuation of it. It is necessary to go back. And so it is necessary to see this and to go all out to make economic justice a reality all over our nation.

I mentioned that racial segregation is about dead in the United States, but it’s still with us. We are about past the day of legal segregation. We have about ended de jure segregation, where the laws of the nation or of a particular state can uphold it, because of the civil rights bill and the Supreme Court’s decision and other things. We have passed the day when the Negro can’t eat at a lunch counter, with the exception of a few isolated situations, or where the Negro can’t check in a motel or hotel. We are fastly passing that day. But there is another form of segregation coming up. It is coming up through housing discrimination, joblessness and the de facto segregation in the public schools. And so the ghettoized conditions that exist make for many problems, and it makes for a hardcore, de facto segregation that we must grapple with on a day-to-day basis. And so, this is the problem that we face, and this is a problem that we are forced to deal with. And we are going to deal with it in a determined way. I am absolutely convinced that segregation is on its deathbed, and those who represent it, whether they be in the United States or whether they be in London, England, the system is on its deathbed.

But certainly, we all know that if democracy is to live in any nation, segregation must die. And as I’ve tried to say all over America, we’ve got to get rid of segregation not merely because it will help our image—it certainly will help our image in the world. We’ve got to get rid of segregation not merely because it will appeal to Asian and African people—and this certainly will be helpful, this is important. But in the final analysis, racial discrimination must be uprooted from American society and from every society, because it is morally wrong. So it is necessary to go all out and develop massive action programs to get rid of racial segregation.

Now I would like to mention one or two ideas that circulate in our society—and they probably circulate in your society and all over the world—that keep us from developing the kind of action programs necessary to get rid of discrimination and segregation. One is what I refer to as the myth of time. There are those individuals who argue that only time can solve the problem of racial injustice in the United States, in South Africa or anywhere else; you’ve got to wait on time. And I know they’ve said to us so often in the States and to our allies in the white community, “Just be nice and be patient and continue to pray, and in 100 or 200 years the problem will work itself out.” We have heard and we have lived with the myth of time. The only answer that I can give to that myth is that time is neutral. It can be used either constructively or destructively. And I must honestly say to you that I’m convinced that the forces of ill will have often used time much more effectively than the forces of goodwill. And we may have to repent in this generation, not merely for the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around saying, “Wait on time.”

And somewhere along the way it is necessary to see that human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals who are willing to be co-workers with God. And without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation. And so we must help time, and we must realize that the time is always ripe to do right. This is so vital, and this is so necessary.

Now, the other myth that gets around a great deal in our nation and, I’m sure, in other nations of the world is the idea that you can’t solve the problems in the realm of human relations through legislation; you can’t solve the housing problem and the job problem and all of these other problems through legislation; you’ve got to change the heart. We had a presidential candidate just recently who spoke about this a great deal. And I think Mr. Goldwater sincerely believed that you couldn’t anything through legislation, because he voted against everything in the Senate, including the civil rights bill. And he said all over the nation throughout the election that we don’t need legislation, that legislation can’t deal with this problem. But he was nice enough to say that you’ve got to change the heart.

Now I want to at least go halfway with Brother Goldwater at that point. I think he’s right. If we’re going to get this problem solved in America and all over the world, ultimately, people must change their hearts where they have prejudices. If we are going to solve the problems facing mankind, I would be the first to say that every white person must look down deep within and remove every prejudice that may be there, and come to see that the Negro, and the colored peoples, generally, must be treated right, not merely because the law says it, but because it is right and because it is natural. I agree with this 100 percent. And I’m sure that if the problem is to be solved, ultimately, men must be obedient not merely to that which can be enforced by the law, but they must rise to the majestic heights of being obedient to the unenforceable.

But after saying all of that, I must go on to the other side. This is where I must leave Mr. Goldwater and others who believe that legislation has no place. It may be true that you can’t legislate integration, but you can legislate desegregation. It may be true that morality cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated. It may be true that the law can’t change the heart, but it can restrain the heartless. It may be true that the law can’t make a man love me, but it can restrain him from lynching me. And I think that’s pretty important also.

AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., speaking in London on December 7, 1964. We’ll return to that speech after this break.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman. In this Democracy Now! exclusive, we return to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his own words from a recording recently discovered by the Pacifica Radio Archive, the speech given in London, December 7, 1964, just days before Dr. King received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway.

REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Now, as you know, we have been engaged in the United States in a massive struggle to make desegregation and, finally, integration a reality. And in that struggle, there has been an undergirding philosophy: the philosophy of nonviolence, the philosophy and method of nonviolent resistance. And I’d like to say just a few words about the method or the philosophy that has undergirded our struggle. And first I want to say that I’m still convinced that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom and justice. It has a way of disarming the opponent, exposing his moral defenses. It weakens his morale, and at the same time it works on his conscience, and he just doesn’t know how to handle it. If he doesn’t beat you, wonderful. If he beats you, you develop the quiet courage of accepting blows without retaliating. If he doesn’t put you in jail, wonderful. Nobody with any sense loves to go to jail. But if he puts you in jail, you go in that jail and transform it from a dungeon of shame to a haven of freedom and human dignity. Even if he tries to kill you, you develop the inner conviction that there is something so dear, something so precious, something so eternally true, that they are worth dying for. And if a man has not discovered something that he will die for, he isn’t fit to live. And this is what the nonviolent discipline says.

And then the other thing about it is that it gives the individual a way of struggling to secure moral ends through moral means. One of the great debates of history has been over the whole question of ends and means. All the way back from the days of Plato’s dialogues coming on up through Machiavelli and others, there have been those individuals who argued that the end justifies the means. But in a real sense, the nonviolent philosophy comes along and says that the end is pre-existent in the means. The means represent the ideal in the making and the end in process. And so that in the long run of history, immoral means cannot bring about moral ends. Somehow man must come to the point that he sees the necessity of having ends and means cohering, so to speak. And this is one of the things that is basic in the nonviolent philosophy at its best. It gives one a way and a method of struggle which says that you can seek to secure moral ends through moral means.

It also says that it is possible to struggle against an evil, unjust system, with all your might and with all your heart, and even hate that unjust system, but yet you maintain an attitude of active goodwill and understanding and even love for the perpetrators of that evil system. And this is the most misunderstood aspect of nonviolence. And this is where those who don’t want to follow the nonviolent method say a lot of bad things to those of us who talk about love. But I still go on and believe in it, because I am still convinced that it is love that makes the world go round, and somehow this kind of love can be a powerful force for social change.

I’m not talking about a weak love. I’m not talking about emotional bosh here. I’m not talking about some sentimental quality. I’m not talking about an affectionate response. It would be nonsense to urge oppressed people to love their violent oppressors in an affectionate sense, and I have never advised that. When Jesus said, “Love your enemies,” I’m happy he didn’t say, “Like your enemies.” It’s pretty difficult to like some people. But love is greater than like. Love is understanding creative, redemptive goodwill for all men. Theologians talk about this kind of love with the Greek word agape, which is a sort of overflowing love that seeks nothing in return. And when one develops this, you rise to the position of being able to love the person who does the evil deed, while hating the deed that the person does. And I believe that this can be done. Psychiatrists are telling us now that hatred is a dangerous force, not merely for the hated, but also the hater. Many of the strange things that happen in the subconscious, many of the inner conflicts, are rooted in hate. And so they are saying, “Love or perish.” This is why Erich Fromm can write a book entitled The Art of Loving, arguing that love is the supreme unifying force of life. And so it is wonderful to have a method of struggle where it is possible to stand up against segregation, to stand up against colonialism with all of your might, and yet not hate the perpetrators of these unjust systems. And I believe firmly that it is through this kind of powerful nonviolent action, this kind of love that organizes itself into mass action, that we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation and the world into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. Certainly this is the great challenge facing us.

Now, I think that nonviolence can work not only in the situation that we find in our country, not only with the magnificent example that we have in India, expressed through the marvelous work of Mohandas K. Gandhi, but I think it can work in ways and in circumstances that we haven’t seen it or we haven’t used it before. And in this context, I would like to say something about South Africa. And I’d like to read just a statement that I have written here so that I’ll be sure that I’ll say everything that I have in mind about the South African situation without missing anything.

I understand there are here tonight South Africans, some of whom have been involved in the long struggle for freedom there. In our struggle for freedom and justice in the United States, which has also been so long and difficult, we feel a powerful sense of identification with those in the far more deadly struggle for freedom in South Africa. We know how Africans there, and their friends of other races, strove for half a century to win their freedom by nonviolent methods. We have honored Chief Lutuli for his leadership, and we know how this nonviolence was only met by increasing violence from the state, increasing repression, culminating in the shootings at Sharpeville and all that has happened since.

Clearly there is much in Mississippi and Alabama to remind the South Africans of their own country, yet even in Mississippi we can organize to register Negro voters. We can speak to the press. We can, in short, organize the people in nonviolent action. But in South Africa, even the mildest form of nonviolent resistance meets with years of imprisonment, and leaders over many years have been restricted and silenced and imprisoned. We can understand how in that situation people felt so desperate that they turned to other methods, such as sabotage.

Today, great leaders, like Nelson Mandela and Robert Sobukwe, are among the many hundreds wasting away in Robben Island prison. Against a massive, armed and ruthless state, which uses torture and sadistic forms of interrogation to crush human beings, even driving some to suicide, the militant opposition inside South Africa seems for the moment to be silenced. The mass of the people seems to be contained, seems for the moment unable to break from the oppression. I emphasize the word “seems” because we can imagine what emotions and plans must be seething below the calm surface of that prosperous police state. We know what emotions are seething in the rest of Africa, and indeed all over the world. The dangers of a race war, of these dangers we have had repeated and profound warning.

It is in this situation, with the great mass of South Africans denied their humanity, their dignity, denied opportunity, denied all human rights; it is in this situation, with many of the bravest and best South Africans serving long years in prison, with some already executed; in this situation we in America and Britain have a unique responsibility, for it is we, through our investments, through our governments’ failure to act decisively, who are guilty of bolstering up the South African tyranny.

Our responsibility—our responsibility presents us with a unique opportunity: We can join in the one form of nonviolent action that could bring freedom and justice to South Africa, the action which African leaders have appealed for, in a massive movement for economic sanctions. In a world living under the appalling shadow of nuclear weapons, do we not recognize the need to perfect the use of economic pressures? Why is trade regarded by all nations and all ideologies as sacred? Why does our government and your government in Britain refuse to intervene effectively now, as if only when there is a bloodbath in South Africa—or a Korea or a Vietnam—will they recognize a crisis? If the United Kingdom and the United States decided tomorrow morning not to buy South African goods, not to buy South African gold, to put an embargo on oil, if our investors and capitalists would withdraw their support for that racial tyranny that we find there, then apartheid would be brought to an end. Then the majority of South Africans of all races could at last build the shared society they desire.

And so this is a challenge facing the nations of the world. And God grant that we will meet this challenge and be a part of that great creative movement that will seek to bring about change and transform those dark yesterdays of man’s inhumanity to man into bright tomorrows of justice and peace and goodwill. And may I say to you that the problem of racial injustice is not limited to any one nation. We know now that this is a problem spreading all over the globe. And right here in London and right here in England, you know so well that thousands and thousands of colored people are migrating here from many, many lands—from the West Indies, from Pakistan, from India, from Africa. And they have the just right to come to this great land, and they have the just right to expect justice and democracy in this land. And England must be eternally vigilant. For if not, the same kind of ghettos will develop that we have in the Harlems of the United States. The same problems of injustice, the same problems of inequality in jobs will develop. And so I say to you that the challenge before every citizen of goodwill of this nation is to go all out to make democracy a reality for everybody, so that everybody in this land will be able to live together and that all men will be able to live together as brothers.

You know, there are certain words in every academic discipline that soon become stereotypes and clichés. Every academic discipline has its technical vocabulary. Modern psychology has a word that is probably used more than any other word in modern psychology. It is the word “maladjusted.” You’ve heard that word. This is the ringing cry of modern child psychology. And certainly we all want to live well-adjusted lives in order to avoid neurotic and schizophrenic personalities. But I must say to you this evening, my friends, as I come to a close, that there are some things in my own nation, and there are some things in the world, to which I am proud to be maladjusted and to which I call upon all men of goodwill to be maladjusted until the good society is realized. I must honestly say to you that I never intend to become adjusted to segregation, discrimination, colonialism and these particular forces. I must honestly say to you that I never intend to adjust myself to religious bigotry. I must honestly say to you that I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I must say to you tonight that I never intend to become adjusted to the madness of militarism and the self-defeating effects of physical violence, for in a day when Sputniks and explorers are dashing through outer space and guided ballistic missiles are carving highways of death through the stratosphere, no nation can win a war. It is no longer the choice between violence and nonviolence; it is either nonviolence or non-existence. And the alternative to disarmament, the alternative to a greater suspension of nuclear tests, the alternative to strengthening the United Nations and thereby disarming the whole world, may well be a civilization plunged into the abyss of annihilation. And I assure you that I will never adjust to the madness of militarism.

You see, it may well be that our whole world is in need at this time for a new organization—the International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment—men and women—men and women who will be as maladjusted as the Prophet Amos, who in the midst of the injustices of his day could cry out in words that echo across the centuries, “Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream”; as maladjusted as the late Abraham Lincoln, the great president of our nation, who had the vision to see that the United States could not survive half-slave and half-free; as maladjusted as Thomas Jefferson, who, in the midst of an age amazingly adjusted to slavery, could etch across the pages of history words lifted to cosmic proportions: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness”; as maladjusted as Jesus of Nazareth, who could say to the men and women of his day, “He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword.” And through such maladjustment, we will be able to emerge from the long and desolate midnight of man’s inhumanity to man into the bright and glittering daybreak of freedom and justice.

May I say to you that I still believe that mankind will rise up to the occasion. In spite of the darkness of the hour, in spite of the difficulties of the moment, in spite of these days of emotional tension, when the problems of the world are gigantic in extent and chaotic in detail, I still have faith in the future, and I still believe that we can build this society of brotherhood and this society of peace.

We have a song that we sing in our movement, and we have joined hands to sing it so often, beyond/behind jail bars. I can remember times that we have been in jail cells made for 12 people, and yet you would find some 15 or 20 there, and yet we could go on and lift our voices and sing it. I mentioned it yesterday afternoon as I was preaching at St. Paul’s. “We shall overcome. We shall overcome. Deep in my heart I do believe we shall overcome.” And somehow I believe that mankind will overcome, and I believe that the forces of evil will be defeated. I believe this because Carlyle is right: “No lie can live forever.” I believe that we shall overcome because William Cullen Bryant is right: Truth crushed to earth will rise again. I believe that we shall overcome because James Russell Lowell is right: “Truth forever on the scaffold / Wrong forever on the throne. / Yet that scaffold sways the future, / And behind the then unknown / Standeth God within the shadow, / Keeping watch above his own.”

With this faith, we will be able to adjourn the counsels of despair and bring new light into the dark chambers of pessimism. With this faith, we will be able to transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of peace and brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to speed up the day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, Hindus and Muslims, theists and atheists—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!”

We have a long, long way to go before this problem is solved, but thank God we’ve made strides. We’ve come a long, long way, before I close by quoting the words of an old Negro slave preacher, who didn’t quite have his grammar and diction right, but who uttered words of great symbolic profundity: “Lord, we ain’t what we want to be. We ain’t what we ought to be. We ain’t what we gonna be. But, thank God, we ain’t what we was.” Thank you.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday restored common sense as well as the word of the Constitution by upholding Michigan’s ban of racial preferences in state college admissions. Michigan voters had put the ban in their state constitution, ordering state colleges and universities not to “discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.”

Jawando,"Endnotes and citations are available in the PDF and Scribd versions .
From the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown , to the heavily militarized police response , to the protests in the wake of Brown ’ s death , to the failure of the grand jury to indict Officer Darren Wilson for his role in the shooting , the events in Ferguson , Missouri , have turned up the heat on a long simmering debate over the persistent inequalities in our criminal justice system . Other recent events have made the urgent need to act even more clear : In Staten Island , New York , a grand jury decided not to indict New York Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo for causing the death of another unarmed black man , Eric Garner , even though the officer ’ s actions were caught on tape . Days earlier , a police officer shot and killed Tamir Rice , a 12-year-old in Cleveland , Ohio , while he played with a toy gun .
At the center of this debate has been a conversation about inequities in the basic functioning of the criminal justice system—including police practices , the use of force and aggressive policing , arrest and prosecution policies , the severity of criminal sentences , and the disparate impact many of these policies have on communities of color . Little wonder there is a deep-seated sentiment within communities of color that the criminal justice system is inherently rigged against them and that the institutions supposedly designed to protect them are failing them , or even worse , targeting them . Moreover , the gap between black and white views on law enforcement , the criminal justice system , and race relations in this country only seems to be growing . This ever-widening gulf further complicates our attempts to understand exactly what is at issue in cases such as the deaths of Brown and Garner , the failure of the grand juries in those cases to indict the officers responsible , and the opportunity to think through ideas and options for concrete solutions to address the underlying problems .
While reflection is important after moments such as this , we are now tasked with the obligation of figuring out how to move forward , learn from these incidents , and turn a moment of anger and frustration into an opportunity to make positive change in our criminal justice system . Much of this work is already underway . Following the unrest in Ferguson , President Barack Obama announced a three-year , $ 263 million package to increase police officers ’ use of body-worn cameras and expand local law-enforcement training . The president is preparing to issue an executive order calling for additional oversight of various federal programs that provide military surplus equipment to local law-enforcement agencies and for the establishment of a presidential taskforce examining crime reduction and efforts to build public trust . Additionally , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the release of updated Department of Justice , or DOJ , guidance , for federal law-enforcement agencies that will create rigorous new standards and robust safeguards that seek to end racial profiling by federal law enforcement . Another promising development from the Obama administration includes the DOJ announcement that it “ has enlisted a team of criminal justice researchers to study racial bias in law enforcement in five American cities and recommend strategies to address the problem. ” These data will not only help inform smart and more effective policing models , but they will also help to close some of the looming racial divides by identifying prejudiced behavior and developing processes to address bias in all aspects of policing .
These are excellent steps , but they are not a panacea . More must be done to implement new innovations in policing and other aspects of the justice system that will improve police accountability and reduce the degree to which the harshest aspects of criminal justice fall disproportionately on communities of color . The United States needs to embrace a smarter approach to criminal justice that recognizes that the propensity to focus on race is not the answer to create safe communities . The failure to ensure that our judicial and legal systems treat all Americans equally has divided too many of our communities . We must give voice to the legitimate and widespread concerns about trust in the criminal justice process . As Americans , we have a responsibility to build inclusive communities where families thrive and where compassion , not fear , is the core value .
This issue brief offers four ideas to reform the criminal justice system , including improved police training ; data collection and accountability ; repairing the fractured relationship between police and community ; and , in instances where lives are taken , the promise of a diligent , independent , and thorough investigation and prosecution , when appropriate . This is certainly not intended as a final assessment of what needs to be done to reform policing and the criminal justice system in the United States , but rather as an opening salvo in an ongoing conversation about crime and justice in this country .
1 . Increase the use of special prosecutors in police misconduct investigations
In recent weeks , the role of the prosecutor and the grand jury system has come under intense scrutiny . The failure of grand juries to indict either Officer Darren Wilson for his role in Brown ’ s death or Staten Island Officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in Garner ’ s death have raised significant questions about the ability of local prosecutors to remain impartial in cases involving local law enforcement in the same jurisdiction . Prosecutors rely on local police officers to make arrests , investigate cases , interrogate suspects , and testify at trial . Police officers , in turn , rely on prosecutors to convert their arrests into convictions and assist with investigations . The prosecutor ’ s office is charged with responsibility for prosecutions in its jurisdiction . However , in most instances of fatalities involving officers , “ prosecutors generally use special grand juries … to investigate and gather evidence before determining if an arrest and indictment are warranted. ” In cases involving alleged police misconduct , questions about prosecutors ’ sympathies for the defendant—sympathies that may prevent the prosecutor from being an effective advocate for the state—provide an opportunity to consider alternatives to address perceived conflicts of interests .
The Cato Institute ’ s “ National Police Misconduct Reporting Project ” shows 4,861 unique reports of misconduct in 2010 , including 127 fatalities associated with excessive force . Additionally , according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , 70 percent of black people who have experienced the use of police force against them feel that the force was excessive . Black people are three to five times more likely than whites to believe that police misconduct frequently occurs in their city , and black Americans are three times more likely to say that it occurs very often in their neighborhood . As discussed below , no precise figures exist for the number of people killed by the police in the United States , but police departments each year voluntarily report about 420 “ justifiable police homicides ” to the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Rarely do deaths involving police lead to murder or manslaughter charges . Philip Stinson , a criminologist at Bowling Green State University , has found that between 2005 and 2011 , 41 officers were charged with murder or manslaughter for on-duty shootings , but police departments reported 2,600 justifiable homicides to the FBI .
The perception , real or perceived , is that local prosecutors have far too great of an interest to protect and justify the actions of local law enforcement . The perceived bias in the system has led to the erosion of trust that is needed to build public safety between law enforcement and local communities , suggesting that viable alternatives should be considered .
Some states have established permanent special prosecutors ’ offices . Maryland handles a variety of cases , from violations of election law to police misconduct , through an independent special prosecutor . In 1972 , the state of New York created a special prosecutor ’ s office to explore police corruption in New York City . According to the New York Law Journal , the special prosecutor ’ s office in New York “ established a remarkable track record in fairly , objectively and successfully investigating and prosecuting police officers and others in the criminal justice system suspected of criminality. ” In 1990 , the office was disbanded , but recently , there have been calls to reinstate the office to investigate and potentially prosecute alleged police brutality cases that result in the death of an unarmed subject .
There are several approaches employed in states across the country that could serve as a model for reform . States could provide state attorney generals additional prosecutorial authority over fatalities involving police and create permanent “ special prosecutors ” that are housed within the state office of the attorney general to provide a level of insulation from local law enforcement . As suggested by Joshua Deahl , an appellate attorney with the District of Columbia ’ Public Defender Service , the special prosecutor ’ s responsibilities could “ be limited to the oversight , investigation and prosecution of police or public official misconduct , keeping them independent from other policing functions. ” Alternatively , states such as Wisconsin have “ officer-involved-death ” statutes . In Wisconsin , this requires that at least two independent investigators examine cases .
Finally , automatic referral outside the jurisdiction in fatal cases involving police is a possibility . In that instance , a prosecutor from outside the jurisdiction in question would lead the investigation . The requirement of an independent , outside party could address perceived conflict of interest issues with local officials . Whether by state statute requiring an out-of-jurisdiction investigator or state executive action automatically assigning fatalities cases involving police to attorney generals or special prosecutors , all states should adopt practices to ensure that all investigations of homicides involving police are conducted by a neutral prosecutor other than the office that typically works with the police department that is the subject of the investigation .
2 . Enhance the collection of data on fatalities involving police
In the immediate aftermath of the deaths of Brown and Garner , many commentators , community members , and policymakers around the country asked what should be relatively easy questions to answer : How often do police officers kill unarmed individuals ? Are the deaths of Brown and Garner isolated incidents or examples of a larger trend of inappropriate use of force by police officers in communities around the country , and are communities of color disproportionately affected ?
Unfortunately , these are not easy questions to answer . As a number of reporters discovered over the past few months , there are significant gaps in the collection and analysis of data related to fatalities involving officers ; these gaps make it very difficult to assess the scope of the problem either nationwide or in individual states and localities . The primary source for data about homicides in the United States is the FBI ’ s Uniform Crime Reporting , or UCR , program , through which federal , state , and local police agencies voluntarily report information about certain designated crimes , including homicides . Police agencies are asked to submit more detailed information about homicides , including demographic information about the victim and offender , the type of weapon used , the relationship between the perpetrator and offender , and some limited information about the circumstances of the killing , such as whether the homicide occurred during the commission or attempted commission of a felony . As part of this Supplementary Homicide Report , the FBI also collects information about deaths of individuals deemed “ justified , ” which includes two categories of homicides : felons killed by law-enforcement officers in the line of duty and felons killed by private individuals during the commission of a felony .
There are a number of problems with these data . First , police departments ’ reporting of homicide data to the UCR program is voluntary . And because police departments are not required to submit these data , many choose not to . For example , Florida does not provide any data to the UCR program , and other states submit these data in a piecemeal and incomplete fashion . So while FBI data tell us that between 2009 and 2013 , law-enforcement officers killed 2,102 felons nationwide in the line of duty and used firearms in 99 percent of these cases , this is likely a very incomplete total count of fatalities involving police . Indeed , a comparison with another source of homicide data—the Centers for Disease Control , which compiles information on deaths based on death certificates—demonstrates the limitations of the FBI data . For 2012 , the FBI reports 426 justifiable homicides nationwide ; the CDC reports 550 such fatalities . Although these two sources use slightly different definitions , the disparity between the two numbers helps demonstrate the scope of the data gap . Additionally , the FBI only counts homicides by police officers that are deemed justified , so deaths by officers that do not fall into that category—such as shootings in which an officer is determined to have acted criminally—will not be included in the FBI count . Second , the data that local police agencies voluntarily provided to the FBI about officer-involved fatalities include limited information about the context and circumstances of those incidents and what immediately precipitated the fatal event , including whether the victim was armed .
But even with this incomplete data set , there is evidence of a racial disparity in instances of police shootings of civilians . An analysis of FBI Supplementary Homicide data conducted by the independent , nonprofit news service ProPublica found that from 2010 to 2012 , police killed young black men at much higher rates than their white peers : 31.17 per million for black males between the ages of 15 and 19 versus 1.47 per million for white males in the same age group . This analysis found that young black men in this age group were 21 times more likely to be shot by police than young white men . Reporters from Vox , a news website , obtained more detailed information from the FBI about each of the justifiable homicides reported in 2012 and found that a disproportionate number of reported felons who were killed by police were black .
In order to develop smart laws and policies to address law enforcement ’ s inappropriate and illegal use of force , we need to understand the scope and nature of the problem . The federal government must improve data collection and require state and local law enforcement to provide detailed information about deaths caused by police officers . On December 11 , 2014 , Congress passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 , a bill that would mandate such reporting by states and would give the U.S. attorney general the discretion to reduce federal law-enforcement funding to states that fail to comply by as much as 10 percent . This legislation would require states to submit demographic information about the victim , details about the time and location of the death , the law-enforcement agency involved , and “ a brief description of the circumstances surrounding the death. ” The attorney general would then be required to conduct a study of this information in order to “ determine means by which such information can be used to reduce the number of such deaths . ”
This legislation would be a significant step forward in addressing the current data gap on fatalities involving police , and President Obama should sign it into law as soon as possible . However , in order for this legislation to have the maximum beneficial impact , the administration must implement detailed regulations outlining exactly what kind of information about each of these incidents are required to be reported under the catch-all language in the legislation to ensure that states are reporting crucial information—including whether the victim was armed , whether the officer or officers involved had any relevant disciplinary history related to the use of force , and other key details regarding events precipitating the fatal event . Additionally , the regulations should provide that , absent “ extraordinary circumstances , ” the attorney general will exercise the discretion to impose the 10 percent funding penalty on states that fail to comply by the second year that the law is in effect .
The next Congress should also act to expand the reporting mandate on states to include full participation in the FBI Supplementary Homicide Report to provide details on all homicides in a jurisdiction , not just those involving police . This information would provide a crucial baseline for understanding homicides in the states and help inform law-enforcement practices going forward . In particular , states should be required to provide information about homicides in which individuals invoke “ stand-your-ground ” defenses , another area in which there is an extreme paucity of reliable data .
3 . Implement implicit bias training for all federal law-enforcement officers and state and local police involved in federal task forces
“ Black Lives Matter ” is one of the most evocative statements being chanted from protesters participating in demonstrations in the wake of the recent killings of Michael Brown , Eric Garner , and Tamir Rice . The statement itself has become a point of contention , but the statement speaks to perhaps the most important and most difficult issue that has arisen out of the recent protests : the subtle and stark differences that make up white and black experiences in America . While these divisions are often felt writ large by communities of color , the disparities seem to be particularly acute between white and black individuals , and the data seem to support these perceptions . The discrepancies in outcomes with similar circumstances between races can be interpreted through the lens of implicit bias . Researchers who seek to measure implicit biases often point to psychological and neurological factors inherent in unconscious racial associations . This has shown , as one researcher recently noted , “ that hidden biases operating largely under the scope of human consciousness influence the way that we see and treat others , even when we are determined to be fair and objective. ” Findings show that implicit bias can be contradictory to an individual ’ s stated beliefs . The presence of implicit bias has been used to explain disparities among races in both access to and quality of health care , treatment in the criminal justice system , and housing .
For instance , despite reporting very little explicit bias , approximately two-thirds of the nation ’ s health clinicians were found to harbor a statistically significant implicit bias against blacks and Latinos . Additionally , unconscious views about race help explain the disproportionate arrest and incarceration of African Americans for drug offenses . Research shows that although whites engage in drug offenses at rates higher than blacks do , blacks are almost four times more likely to be arrested for these offenses compared to whites . The data also reveal that black men were sent to prison on drug charges at 11.8 times the rate of white men , and black women are sent to prison on drug charges at 4.8 times the rate of white women .
Likewise , the realm of housing shows a striking racially based implicit bias when African Americans look to rent or buy housing . When renting , blacks were told about the availability of 11.4 percent fewer units as compared to whites and shown 4.2 percent fewer units . When it came to home buying , blacks were also told about 17 percent fewer homes than whites and shown 17.7 percent fewer homes .
According to David R. Williams , a Harvard sociologist , the “ frightening point ” is that because implicit bias is “ an automatic and unconscious process , people who engage in this unthinking discrimination are not aware of the fact that they do it. ” A 2012 study found that officers were quicker to shoot an armed black person and slower to refrain from shooting an unarmed black person than they were with members of any other racial group . Similar results were found in a study of the Denver , Colorado , police department . When asked to press a button labeled “ shoot ” or “ don ’ t shoot , ” Denver police officers were “ uniformly faster to shoot an armed black target , relative to an armed white target , and uniformly faster to press the ‘ Don ’ t shoot ’ button for an unarmed white target , relative to an unarmed black target . ”
If these are indeed unconscious reactions , what can actually be done about implicit bias , especially in policing ? There are promising policies available that may mitigate the effects of bias . A key element is training . Training recommendations do not reduce bias ; rather , they raise consciousness about them . Research has suggested that by making one aware of unconscious biases , these malleable biases may be reduced . The federal government should require training on implicit bias in police academies and ongoing state and local departmental training as a condition of federal grants . Law-enforcement recruits should be challenged to identify key police decisions and scenarios that are at greatest risk of manifesting bias—such as traffic stops , consent searches , reasonable suspicion to frisk , and other procedures—and then reflect on the potential impact of implicit bias on their perceptions and behaviors in those scenarios . Furthermore , seasoned officers should be similarly challenged at in-service and other training venues .
In addition , police departments should be encouraged to take steps to increase diversity among law-enforcement professionals . The federal government should condition receipt of certain grant funding by state and local law-enforcement agencies—perhaps funding for surplus military equipment—on the implementation of hiring and retention policies designed to increase diversity in police departments . Ideally , the composition of personnel should reflect the diversity of the community that is serves . Finally , law-enforcement agencies need to eschew colorblindness and acknowledge real group and individual differences , such as through ongoing diversity and multiculturalism training . Research suggests that a colorblind ideology generates greater amounts of implicit bias than a multicultural perspective does .
The day-to-day operations of police departments across the country are largely handled at the state and local level . The federal government does have a role in local policing , primarily through the provision of federal funding for law enforcement for a variety of programs such as crime deterrence initiatives , hiring of officers , purchasing equipment , training , and creation of cross-jurisdiction task forces . A Brennan Center for Justice analysis found that at least $ 3.8 billion is given to state and local governments each year in federal criminal justice grants . The federal government also becomes involved when a complaint is made to the Department of Justice Office of Civil Rights about issues relating to police officer conduct . The complaints regard either an individual incident in which an officer allegedly violated the civil rights of a community member or an incident in which an entire police department has engaged in a “ pattern or practice ” of violating the civil rights of the community . In those cases , the DOJ conducts extensive investigations and , upon finding violations of civil rights , commences or threatens litigation against the offending jurisdictions , which often results in consent decrees that reform police practices in the jurisdiction .
However , the DOJ engages in relatively little proactive activity to shape police practices on the ground in communities across the country . While the DOJ may enter into a detailed consent decree with a particular jurisdiction that outlines specific policies and practices that officers must implemented on the ground , it does not offer this guidance on a broader basis to law-enforcement agencies across the country . The DOJ should take a more proactive role in providing guidance to local police agencies about best practices—for issues such as use of force , racially discriminatory practices , or officer accountability—before police department practices deteriorate to the point of systematically violating the civil rights of members of the community . While the DOJ has issued some general guidance for police departments over the years , there are certainly lessons learned from pattern and practice investigations of individual police departments—along with innovative new policies and practices that have arisen from those investigations—that could and should be shared with law enforcement across the country . In recent months , the DOJ has done more of this by issuing guidance to law enforcement on maintaining order during protests and the appropriate circumstances under which federal officers may consider a person ’ s race or ethnicity .
The DOJ should take a more active approach in setting expectations for police conduct nationwide and ensure compliance with those standards by conditioning participation in federal task forces on the adoption of certain standards , policies , and training and through penalties in federal funding . The Brennan Center recently released a report offering an innovative new approach for rethinking federal funding for law enforcement called “ Success-Oriented Funding ” that would better connect provision of federal funding with achievement of clearly-established goals . The federal government has an obligation to ensure that police officers in communities around the country are not violating the civil rights of the people they are charged to serve and protect and should be more proactive in ensuring that police agencies are properly training and supervising their officers before individual misconduct rises to the level of systemic violations of civil rights .
These four recommendations , along with President Obama ’ s recent actions , are among a set of reforms that are needed to address injustice and inequalities in the criminal justice system , particularly with respect to police misconduct . The challenges that the criminal justice system face , however , do not operate in a vacuum ; but rather , they reflect broader challenges in our culture and in our democracy . Ferguson , Missouri—where even though “ two in three Ferguson residents are black , the city government is almost entirely white ” —underscores the lack of representation of people of color and raises significant concerns over a lack of reflective representation in our democracy .
One new challenge in ensuring full civic participation of people of color is an increasing trend in laws and practices that restrict voter access . In 2013 , the U.S. Supreme Court ’ s Shelby County v. Holder ruling weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 . November 4 , 2014 , marked the first Election Day in 50 years in which voters went to the polls without many important protections . As a result , many states imposed suppressive new voting laws that make it harder for eligible voters to cast their ballots . Unsurprisingly , the 2014 election had the worst voter turnout in 72 years . Suppressive voter laws also affect the composition of local grand juries . In many states , the list generated for juror selection uses the names of registered voters . State laws that make it harder to register to vote—by limiting same-day registration , imposing stringent voter ID laws , and eliminating the so-called “ golden week ” when voters can register and immediately cast ballots—deleteriously prevent potential jurors from appearing on juror lists . This dilutes the pool of potential grand jurors and inaccurately reflects the make up of local communities . The lack of diversity on the grand juries in Ferguson and Staten Island underscores this lack of reflectiveness .
The current lack of political representation for communities of color undermines trust in government , disadvantages depressed communities , and creates the context for racial tension . This threatens our democracy . Racial and ethnic diversity in elected office can result in positive policy changes for all Americans . Instead of crafting more barriers to representation and excluding communities from the juror ’ s box , we should actively seek to promote opportunities for participation in civic life . Instead of denying the right to vote , we should strive to engage all citizens in our democracy . Addressing efforts to curtail the right to vote and to limit participation in the democratic process are crucial to promoting the kinds of robust democratic institutions and rebuilding the public ’ s confidence in those institutions to both reform and build confidence in policing and prosecution . Poverty , lack of representation , and perceived bias of local law enforcement combine to create a combustible situation that presents significant challenges to communities across the country . We should make every effort to address these challenges and strive to make a more inclusive , fair , and just America .

From the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, to the heavily militarized police response, to the protests in the wake of Brown’s death, to the failure of the grand jury to indict Officer Darren Wilson for his role in the shooting, the events in Ferguson, Missouri, have turned up the heat on a long simmering debate over the persistent inequalities in our criminal justice system. Other recent events have made the urgent need to act even more clear: In Staten Island, New York, a grand jury decided not to indict New York Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo for causing the death of another unarmed black man, Eric Garner, even though the officer’s actions were caught on tape. Days earlier, a police officer shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old in Cleveland, Ohio, while he played with a toy gun.

At the center of this debate has been a conversation about inequities in the basic functioning of the criminal justice system—including police practices, the use of force and aggressive policing, arrest and prosecution policies, the severity of criminal sentences, and the disparate impact many of these policies have on communities of color. Little wonder there is a deep-seated sentiment within communities of color that the criminal justice system is inherently rigged against them and that the institutions supposedly designed to protect them are failing them, or even worse, targeting them. Moreover, the gap between black and white views on law enforcement, the criminal justice system, and race relations in this country only seems to be growing. This ever-widening gulf further complicates our attempts to understand exactly what is at issue in cases such as the deaths of Brown and Garner, the failure of the grand juries in those cases to indict the officers responsible, and the opportunity to think through ideas and options for concrete solutions to address the underlying problems.

While reflection is important after moments such as this, we are now tasked with the obligation of figuring out how to move forward, learn from these incidents, and turn a moment of anger and frustration into an opportunity to make positive change in our criminal justice system. Much of this work is already underway. Following the unrest in Ferguson, President Barack Obama announced a three-year, $263 million package to increase police officers’ use of body-worn cameras and expand local law-enforcement training. The president is preparing to issue an executive order calling for additional oversight of various federal programs that provide military surplus equipment to local law-enforcement agencies and for the establishment of a presidential taskforce examining crime reduction and efforts to build public trust. Additionally, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the release of updated Department of Justice, or DOJ, guidance, for federal law-enforcement agencies that will create rigorous new standards and robust safeguards that seek to end racial profiling by federal law enforcement. Another promising development from the Obama administration includes the DOJ announcement that it “has enlisted a team of criminal justice researchers to study racial bias in law enforcement in five American cities and recommend strategies to address the problem.” These data will not only help inform smart and more effective policing models, but they will also help to close some of the looming racial divides by identifying prejudiced behavior and developing processes to address bias in all aspects of policing.

These are excellent steps, but they are not a panacea. More must be done to implement new innovations in policing and other aspects of the justice system that will improve police accountability and reduce the degree to which the harshest aspects of criminal justice fall disproportionately on communities of color. The United States needs to embrace a smarter approach to criminal justice that recognizes that the propensity to focus on race is not the answer to create safe communities. The failure to ensure that our judicial and legal systems treat all Americans equally has divided too many of our communities. We must give voice to the legitimate and widespread concerns about trust in the criminal justice process. As Americans, we have a responsibility to build inclusive communities where families thrive and where compassion, not fear, is the core value.

This issue brief offers four ideas to reform the criminal justice system, including improved police training; data collection and accountability; repairing the fractured relationship between police and community; and, in instances where lives are taken, the promise of a diligent, independent, and thorough investigation and prosecution, when appropriate. This is certainly not intended as a final assessment of what needs to be done to reform policing and the criminal justice system in the United States, but rather as an opening salvo in an ongoing conversation about crime and justice in this country.

1. Increase the use of special prosecutors in police misconduct investigations

In recent weeks, the role of the prosecutor and the grand jury system has come under intense scrutiny. The failure of grand juries to indict either Officer Darren Wilson for his role in Brown’s death or Staten Island Officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in Garner’s death have raised significant questions about the ability of local prosecutors to remain impartial in cases involving local law enforcement in the same jurisdiction. Prosecutors rely on local police officers to make arrests, investigate cases, interrogate suspects, and testify at trial. Police officers, in turn, rely on prosecutors to convert their arrests into convictions and assist with investigations. The prosecutor’s office is charged with responsibility for prosecutions in its jurisdiction. However, in most instances of fatalities involving officers, “prosecutors generally use special grand juries … to investigate and gather evidence before determining if an arrest and indictment are warranted.” In cases involving alleged police misconduct, questions about prosecutors’ sympathies for the defendant—sympathies that may prevent the prosecutor from being an effective advocate for the state—provide an opportunity to consider alternatives to address perceived conflicts of interests.

The Cato Institute’s “National Police Misconduct Reporting Project” shows 4,861 unique reports of misconduct in 2010, including 127 fatalities associated with excessive force. Additionally, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 70 percent of black people who have experienced the use of police force against them feel that the force was excessive. Black people are three to five times more likely than whites to believe that police misconduct frequently occurs in their city, and black Americans are three times more likely to say that it occurs very often in their neighborhood. As discussed below, no precise figures exist for the number of people killed by the police in the United States, but police departments each year voluntarily report about 420 “justifiable police homicides” to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Rarely do deaths involving police lead to murder or manslaughter charges. Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University, has found that between 2005 and 2011, 41 officers were charged with murder or manslaughter for on-duty shootings, but police departments reported 2,600 justifiable homicides to the FBI.

The perception, real or perceived, is that local prosecutors have far too great of an interest to protect and justify the actions of local law enforcement. The perceived bias in the system has led to the erosion of trust that is needed to build public safety between law enforcement and local communities, suggesting that viable alternatives should be considered.

Some states have established permanent special prosecutors’ offices. Maryland handles a variety of cases, from violations of election law to police misconduct, through an independent special prosecutor. In 1972, the state of New York created a special prosecutor’s office to explore police corruption in New York City. According to the New York Law Journal, the special prosecutor’s office in New York “established a remarkable track record in fairly, objectively and successfully investigating and prosecuting police officers and others in the criminal justice system suspected of criminality.” In 1990, the office was disbanded, but recently, there have been calls to reinstate the office to investigate and potentially prosecute alleged police brutality cases that result in the death of an unarmed subject.

There are several approaches employed in states across the country that could serve as a model for reform. States could provide state attorney generals additional prosecutorial authority over fatalities involving police and create permanent “special prosecutors” that are housed within the state office of the attorney general to provide a level of insulation from local law enforcement. As suggested by Joshua Deahl, an appellate attorney with the District of Columbia’ Public Defender Service, the special prosecutor’s responsibilities could “be limited to the oversight, investigation and prosecution of police or public official misconduct, keeping them independent from other policing functions.” Alternatively, states such as Wisconsin have “officer-involved-death” statutes. In Wisconsin, this requires that at least two independent investigators examine cases.

Finally, automatic referral outside the jurisdiction in fatal cases involving police is a possibility. In that instance, a prosecutor from outside the jurisdiction in question would lead the investigation. The requirement of an independent, outside party could address perceived conflict of interest issues with local officials. Whether by state statute requiring an out-of-jurisdiction investigator or state executive action automatically assigning fatalities cases involving police to attorney generals or special prosecutors, all states should adopt practices to ensure that all investigations of homicides involving police are conducted by a neutral prosecutor other than the office that typically works with the police department that is the subject of the investigation.

2. Enhance the collection of data on fatalities involving police

In the immediate aftermath of the deaths of Brown and Garner, many commentators, community members, and policymakers around the country asked what should be relatively easy questions to answer: How often do police officers kill unarmed individuals? Are the deaths of Brown and Garner isolated incidents or examples of a larger trend of inappropriate use of force by police officers in communities around the country, and are communities of color disproportionately affected?

Unfortunately, these are not easy questions to answer. As a number of reporters discovered over the past few months, there are significant gaps in the collection and analysis of data related to fatalities involving officers; these gaps make it very difficult to assess the scope of the problem either nationwide or in individual states and localities. The primary source for data about homicides in the United States is the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting, or UCR, program, through which federal, state, and local police agencies voluntarily report information about certain designated crimes, including homicides. Police agencies are asked to submit more detailed information about homicides, including demographic information about the victim and offender, the type of weapon used, the relationship between the perpetrator and offender, and some limited information about the circumstances of the killing, such as whether the homicide occurred during the commission or attempted commission of a felony. As part of this Supplementary Homicide Report, the FBI also collects information about deaths of individuals deemed “justified,” which includes two categories of homicides: felons killed by law-enforcement officers in the line of duty and felons killed by private individuals during the commission of a felony.

There are a number of problems with these data. First, police departments’ reporting of homicide data to the UCR program is voluntary. And because police departments are not required to submit these data, many choose not to. For example, Florida does not provide any data to the UCR program, and other states submit these data in a piecemeal and incomplete fashion. So while FBI data tell us that between 2009 and 2013, law-enforcement officers killed 2,102 felons nationwide in the line of duty and used firearms in 99 percent of these cases, this is likely a very incomplete total count of fatalities involving police. Indeed, a comparison with another source of homicide data—the Centers for Disease Control, which compiles information on deaths based on death certificates—demonstrates the limitations of the FBI data. For 2012, the FBI reports 426 justifiable homicides nationwide; the CDC reports 550 such fatalities. Although these two sources use slightly different definitions, the disparity between the two numbers helps demonstrate the scope of the data gap. Additionally, the FBI only counts homicides by police officers that are deemed justified, so deaths by officers that do not fall into that category—such as shootings in which an officer is determined to have acted criminally—will not be included in the FBI count. Second, the data that local police agencies voluntarily provided to the FBI about officer-involved fatalities include limited information about the context and circumstances of those incidents and what immediately precipitated the fatal event, including whether the victim was armed.

But even with this incomplete data set, there is evidence of a racial disparity in instances of police shootings of civilians. An analysis of FBI Supplementary Homicide data conducted by the independent, nonprofit news service ProPublica found that from 2010 to 2012, police killed young black men at much higher rates than their white peers: 31.17 per million for black males between the ages of 15 and 19 versus 1.47 per million for white males in the same age group. This analysis found that young black men in this age group were 21 times more likely to be shot by police than young white men. Reporters from Vox, a news website, obtained more detailed information from the FBI about each of the justifiable homicides reported in 2012 and found that a disproportionate number of reported felons who were killed by police were black.

In order to develop smart laws and policies to address law enforcement’s inappropriate and illegal use of force, we need to understand the scope and nature of the problem. The federal government must improve data collection and require state and local law enforcement to provide detailed information about deaths caused by police officers. On December 11, 2014, Congress passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013, a bill that would mandate such reporting by states and would give the U.S. attorney general the discretion to reduce federal law-enforcement funding to states that fail to comply by as much as 10 percent. This legislation would require states to submit demographic information about the victim, details about the time and location of the death, the law-enforcement agency involved, and “a brief description of the circumstances surrounding the death.” The attorney general would then be required to conduct a study of this information in order to “determine means by which such information can be used to reduce the number of such deaths.”

This legislation would be a significant step forward in addressing the current data gap on fatalities involving police, and President Obama should sign it into law as soon as possible. However, in order for this legislation to have the maximum beneficial impact, the administration must implement detailed regulations outlining exactly what kind of information about each of these incidents are required to be reported under the catch-all language in the legislation to ensure that states are reporting crucial information—including whether the victim was armed, whether the officer or officers involved had any relevant disciplinary history related to the use of force, and other key details regarding events precipitating the fatal event. Additionally, the regulations should provide that, absent “extraordinary circumstances,” the attorney general will exercise the discretion to impose the 10 percent funding penalty on states that fail to comply by the second year that the law is in effect.

The next Congress should also act to expand the reporting mandate on states to include full participation in the FBI Supplementary Homicide Report to provide details on all homicides in a jurisdiction, not just those involving police. This information would provide a crucial baseline for understanding homicides in the states and help inform law-enforcement practices going forward. In particular, states should be required to provide information about homicides in which individuals invoke “stand-your-ground” defenses, another area in which there is an extreme paucity of reliable data.

3. Implement implicit bias training for all federal law-enforcement officers and state and local police involved in federal task forces

“Black Lives Matter” is one of the most evocative statements being chanted from protesters participating in demonstrations in the wake of the recent killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice. The statement itself has become a point of contention, but the statement speaks to perhaps the most important and most difficult issue that has arisen out of the recent protests: the subtle and stark differences that make up white and black experiences in America. While these divisions are often felt writ large by communities of color, the disparities seem to be particularly acute between white and black individuals, and the data seem to support these perceptions. The discrepancies in outcomes with similar circumstances between races can be interpreted through the lens of implicit bias. Researchers who seek to measure implicit biases often point to psychological and neurological factors inherent in unconscious racial associations. This has shown, as one researcher recently noted, “that hidden biases operating largely under the scope of human consciousness influence the way that we see and treat others, even when we are determined to be fair and objective.” Findings show that implicit bias can be contradictory to an individual’s stated beliefs. The presence of implicit bias has been used to explain disparities among races in both access to and quality of health care, treatment in the criminal justice system, and housing.

For instance, despite reporting very little explicit bias, approximately two-thirds of the nation’s health clinicians were found to harbor a statistically significant implicit bias against blacks and Latinos. Additionally, unconscious views about race help explain the disproportionate arrest and incarceration of African Americans for drug offenses. Research shows that although whites engage in drug offenses at rates higher than blacks do, blacks are almost four times more likely to be arrested for these offenses compared to whites. The data also reveal that black men were sent to prison on drug charges at 11.8 times the rate of white men, and black women are sent to prison on drug charges at 4.8 times the rate of white women.

Likewise, the realm of housing shows a striking racially based implicit bias when African Americans look to rent or buy housing. When renting, blacks were told about the availability of 11.4 percent fewer units as compared to whites and shown 4.2 percent fewer units. When it came to home buying, blacks were also told about 17 percent fewer homes than whites and shown 17.7 percent fewer homes.

According to David R. Williams, a Harvard sociologist, the “frightening point” is that because implicit bias is “an automatic and unconscious process, people who engage in this unthinking discrimination are not aware of the fact that they do it.” A 2012 study found that officers were quicker to shoot an armed black person and slower to refrain from shooting an unarmed black person than they were with members of any other racial group. Similar results were found in a study of the Denver, Colorado, police department. When asked to press a button labeled “shoot” or “don’t shoot,” Denver police officers were “uniformly faster to shoot an armed black target, relative to an armed white target, and uniformly faster to press the ‘Don’t shoot’ button for an unarmed white target, relative to an unarmed black target.”

If these are indeed unconscious reactions, what can actually be done about implicit bias, especially in policing? There are promising policies available that may mitigate the effects of bias. A key element is training. Training recommendations do not reduce bias; rather, they raise consciousness about them. Research has suggested that by making one aware of unconscious biases, these malleable biases may be reduced. The federal government should require training on implicit bias in police academies and ongoing state and local departmental training as a condition of federal grants. Law-enforcement recruits should be challenged to identify key police decisions and scenarios that are at greatest risk of manifesting bias—such as traffic stops, consent searches, reasonable suspicion to frisk, and other procedures—and then reflect on the potential impact of implicit bias on their perceptions and behaviors in those scenarios. Furthermore, seasoned officers should be similarly challenged at in-service and other training venues.

In addition, police departments should be encouraged to take steps to increase diversity among law-enforcement professionals. The federal government should condition receipt of certain grant funding by state and local law-enforcement agencies—perhaps funding for surplus military equipment—on the implementation of hiring and retention policies designed to increase diversity in police departments. Ideally, the composition of personnel should reflect the diversity of the community that is serves. Finally, law-enforcement agencies need to eschew colorblindness and acknowledge real group and individual differences, such as through ongoing diversity and multiculturalism training. Research suggests that a colorblind ideology generates greater amounts of implicit bias than a multicultural perspective does.

4. Increase the federal government’s oversight of police conduct

The day-to-day operations of police departments across the country are largely handled at the state and local level. The federal government does have a role in local policing, primarily through the provision of federal funding for law enforcement for a variety of programs such as crime deterrence initiatives, hiring of officers, purchasing equipment, training, and creation of cross-jurisdiction task forces. A Brennan Center for Justice analysis found that at least $3.8 billion is given to state and local governments each year in federal criminal justice grants. The federal government also becomes involved when a complaint is made to the Department of Justice Office of Civil Rights about issues relating to police officer conduct. The complaints regard either an individual incident in which an officer allegedly violated the civil rights of a community member or an incident in which an entire police department has engaged in a “pattern or practice” of violating the civil rights of the community. In those cases, the DOJ conducts extensive investigations and, upon finding violations of civil rights, commences or threatens litigation against the offending jurisdictions, which often results in consent decrees that reform police practices in the jurisdiction.

However, the DOJ engages in relatively little proactive activity to shape police practices on the ground in communities across the country. While the DOJ may enter into a detailed consent decree with a particular jurisdiction that outlines specific policies and practices that officers must implemented on the ground, it does not offer this guidance on a broader basis to law-enforcement agencies across the country. The DOJ should take a more proactive role in providing guidance to local police agencies about best practices—for issues such as use of force, racially discriminatory practices, or officer accountability—before police department practices deteriorate to the point of systematically violating the civil rights of members of the community. While the DOJ has issued some general guidance for police departments over the years, there are certainly lessons learned from pattern and practice investigations of individual police departments—along with innovative new policies and practices that have arisen from those investigations—that could and should be shared with law enforcement across the country. In recent months, the DOJ has done more of this by issuing guidance to law enforcement on maintaining order during protests and the appropriate circumstances under which federal officers may consider a person’s race or ethnicity.

The DOJ should take a more active approach in setting expectations for police conduct nationwide and ensure compliance with those standards by conditioning participation in federal task forces on the adoption of certain standards, policies, and training and through penalties in federal funding. The Brennan Center recently released a report offering an innovative new approach for rethinking federal funding for law enforcement called “Success-Oriented Funding” that would better connect provision of federal funding with achievement of clearly-established goals. The federal government has an obligation to ensure that police officers in communities around the country are not violating the civil rights of the people they are charged to serve and protect and should be more proactive in ensuring that police agencies are properly training and supervising their officers before individual misconduct rises to the level of systemic violations of civil rights.

Conclusion

These four recommendations, along with President Obama’s recent actions, are among a set of reforms that are needed to address injustice and inequalities in the criminal justice system, particularly with respect to police misconduct. The challenges that the criminal justice system face, however, do not operate in a vacuum; but rather, they reflect broader challenges in our culture and in our democracy. Ferguson, Missouri—where even though “two in three Ferguson residents are black, the city government is almost entirely white”—underscores the lack of representation of people of color and raises significant concerns over a lack of reflective representation in our democracy.

One new challenge in ensuring full civic participation of people of color is an increasing trend in laws and practices that restrict voter access. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court’s Shelby County v. Holder ruling weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. November 4, 2014, marked the first Election Day in 50 years in which voters went to the polls without many important protections. As a result, many states imposed suppressive new voting laws that make it harder for eligible voters to cast their ballots. Unsurprisingly, the 2014 election had the worst voter turnout in 72 years. Suppressive voter laws also affect the composition of local grand juries. In many states, the list generated for juror selection uses the names of registered voters. State laws that make it harder to register to vote—by limiting same-day registration, imposing stringent voter ID laws, and eliminating the so-called “golden week” when voters can register and immediately cast ballots—deleteriously prevent potential jurors from appearing on juror lists. This dilutes the pool of potential grand jurors and inaccurately reflects the make up of local communities. The lack of diversity on the grand juries in Ferguson and Staten Island underscores this lack of reflectiveness.

The current lack of political representation for communities of color undermines trust in government, disadvantages depressed communities, and creates the context for racial tension. This threatens our democracy. Racial and ethnic diversity in elected office can result in positive policy changes for all Americans. Instead of crafting more barriers to representation and excluding communities from the juror’s box, we should actively seek to promote opportunities for participation in civic life. Instead of denying the right to vote, we should strive to engage all citizens in our democracy. Addressing efforts to curtail the right to vote and to limit participation in the democratic process are crucial to promoting the kinds of robust democratic institutions and rebuilding the public’s confidence in those institutions to both reform and build confidence in policing and prosecution. Poverty, lack of representation, and perceived bias of local law enforcement combine to create a combustible situation that presents significant challenges to communities across the country. We should make every effort to address these challenges and strive to make a more inclusive, fair, and just America.
