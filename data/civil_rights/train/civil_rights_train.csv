Kim Davis -- the Rowan County , Kentucky Clerk who earlier today brazenly defied the Supreme Court 's order to issue marriage licenses citing `` God 's authority '' -- has been ordered to stand before U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Thursday and explain why she should n't be jailed and fined for her actions .

(CNN) -- When a black man dies at the hands of a white police officer, not often is there video evidence that could end the speculation and show what happened.

In the case of John Crawford III, there is video evidence -- and Walmart needs to release the tape to the public immediately.

Crawford was 22 years old when he and his girlfriend went to the Walmart last month in Beavercreek, a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. They planned to pick up the ingredients for s'mores for a family cookout. Crawford had two young children.

While browsing, he picked up an unpackaged BB gun from one of the store shelves, and continued shopping. A man named Ronald Ritchie saw him and called 911. A black man was ""walking around with a gun in the store,"" and ""pointing it at people,"" Ritchie told them.

A few minutes later, Crawford was dead -- shot on sight by police. His last words? ""It's not real."" The gun was a toy, and it was unloaded.

(Absurdly, if Crawford had been carrying a loaded assault weapon in a threatening manner, it would have been legal under Ohio's open carry laws. This is exactly why gun safety advocates like myself have so long criticized these laws for creating a culture of fear.)

Was Ritchie more likely to see phantom danger and call the cops because Crawford was a black man? Were those cops more likely to pull the trigger -- by all accounts, without warning Crawford -- because Crawford was black? In other words, is Crawford dead today because he was black in America?

The answer is clearly: Yes. But not for the reasons you think -- and that is why it is all the more important that this tape see the light of day.

Our modern conception of racism is as a binary condition. You are either racist -- a monster, the epitome of bigotry -- or no racist at all. Night and day. Good and evil. Dare I say, black and white.

But that is not what science tells us. Flash faces up on a screen and ask people to identify which ones are dangerous, and people will subtly pick those with darker skin. Ask them to play a video game where they shoot only bad guys wielding weapons, and they are marginally more likely to ""make a mistake"" when the unarmed figure is black.

Scientists call it ""implicit bias."" And the shocking thing? It appears not just in those who are openly bigoted, but even among believers in racial equality (including many black people ourselves).

In other words, when it comes to racial attitudes, science has proven both right and left wrong. Racism is not a thing of the past; bias still lurks in our minds, despite ourselves. So conservatives are wrong when they insist that race is a non-issue and that everyone should ""move on."" They should really stop accusing anyone who raises the issue of ""just playing the race card."" Science is not on their side.

On the other hand, progressives need to do a better job of acknowledging that MLK's message of inclusion has had a huge impact -- at least at a conscious level. We have moved from a society that condoned slavery and segregation for centuries, to a society in which only a very small number of people are consciously hostile.

That said: racism is a lingering virus -- alive in all of us, transmitted by a culture that devalues black faces. It is too often lethal to those with dark skin on the wrong end of a gun.

I cannot help but think that it could have been me or my two sons shopping for toys. Would my Yale degree stop a bullet? Would the fact that their father is on TV have been enough to save my children?

And step one in that mission is for Walmart to bow to the request of the Crawford family, and the thousands who have signed a Color of Change petition, and release the surveillance tape.

Crawford's family says the video demonstrates that their son was never a threat, and that he was gunned down in cold blood. Even Ronald Ritchie, the man who called the police, has changed his story -- saying that Crawford never pointed a gun at anyone -- after seeing this tape.

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine claims releasing the tape to the public would bias the jury. But he apparently has no problem showing the tape to Ritchie, a witness for the prosecution, to get his facts straight. Nor is he apparently concerned about rampant media speculation that Crawford had a criminal record (the charges were dropped), as if Crawford somehow deserved to be gunned down.

Walmart is the largest employer of black people in the country, and black Americans make up a huge portion of their customers. The retail giant has an obligation to make sure that we feel safe in their stores. If DeWine will not release the video, Walmart should.

Recently, a young woman in New Jersey crashed her BMW into three cars and assaulted a police officer. Officers did not fire a single shot. She was white. She is alive. John Crawford, Michael Brown and so many others are not.

Releasing a tape will not bring John Crawford III or any of the others back. But if it forces us to confront the lingering realities of racial bias, perhaps some good will come of all this.

My love for the stars and stripes runs deep , in part because I 've been living in a state that flew the star and bars for more than a half century . The American flag was never more beautiful than July 4 , 2015 , a few weeks after a Charleston church was shot up . The contrast between the two flags was never more stark .
That 's why I wo n't take a backseat to anyone on love of this country -- and that 's why I know I must support Kaepernick . Because his peaceful protest is n't disrespecting the flag ; it 's honoring it . What 's dishonoring it is the insistence that a peaceful protest to try to create a more just world is the problem . His act is fully in line with Martin Luther King Jr. 's actions , not in opposition to them , as some have argued .
What Kaepernick seems to understand is that major changes do n't happen without a major outcry from the public , and that ca n't happen without a commitment to keeping injustice in the headlines , no matter how many people are made uncomfortable .
South Carolina did n't take down its Confederate flag for more than 50 years , until public unrest made it untenable to keep it flying . And that was only after nine black people were massacred in a church . How many more have to be sacrificed on the side of the road -- how many more human hashtags have to trend -- before we get serious about revamping how we are policed ?
Others around the country , frustrated with the issues Kaepernick has been highlighting , have been watching the overwrought response to his protest in horror . I do n't know if that 's the reason protesters in Charlotte decided to take to the streets . I get the feeling , though , that Charlotte residents would have liked it better if they had woken up this morning to images of hundreds of protesters humbly on their knees rather than hurling rocks and bottles and starting fires in their city .
But when you hate a man for peacefully protesting , what options do you leave for others wanting to end injustice , too ?","Issac Bailey has been a journalist in South Carolina for two decades and was most recently the primary columnist for The Sun News in Myrtle Beach.

My love for the stars and stripes runs deep, in part because I've been living in a state that flew the star and bars for more than a half century. The American flag was never more beautiful than July 4, 2015, a few weeks after a Charleston church was shot up. The contrast between the two flags was never more stark.

That's why I won't take a backseat to anyone on love of this country -- and that's why I know I must support Kaepernick. Because his peaceful protest isn't disrespecting the flag; it's honoring it. What's dishonoring it is the insistence that a peaceful protest to try to create a more just world is the problem. His act is fully in line with Martin Luther King Jr.'s actions, not in opposition to them, as some have argued.

What Kaepernick seems to understand is that major changes don't happen without a major outcry from the public, and that can't happen without a commitment to keeping injustice in the headlines, no matter how many people are made uncomfortable.

South Carolina didn't take down its Confederate flag for more than 50 years, until public unrest made it untenable to keep it flying. And that was only after nine black people were massacred in a church. How many more have to be sacrificed on the side of the road -- how many more human hashtags have to trend -- before we get serious about revamping how we are policed?

Others around the country, frustrated with the issues Kaepernick has been highlighting, have been watching the overwrought response to his protest in horror. I don't know if that's the reason protesters in Charlotte decided to take to the streets. I get the feeling, though, that Charlotte residents would have liked it better if they had woken up this morning to images of hundreds of protesters humbly on their knees rather than hurling rocks and bottles and starting fires in their city.

But when you hate a man for peacefully protesting, what options do you leave for others wanting to end injustice, too?",www.cnn.com,left,c7k2et1rnK7vYPDL

First, a story:

Late one night, a man searches for something in a parking lot. On his hands and knees, he crawls around a bright circle of light created by a streetlamp overhead.

A woman passes, stops, takes in the scene.

""What are you looking for? Can I help?""

""My car keys. Any chance you've seen them?""

""You dropped them right around here?""

""Oh, no. I dropped them way over there,"" he says, gesturing vaguely to some faraway spot on the other side of the lot.

""Then why are you looking here?""

The man pauses to consider the question.

""Because this is where the light is.""

New research from the Yale Child Study Center suggests that many preschool teachers look for disruptive behavior in much the same way: in just one place, waiting for it to appear.

The problem with this strategy (besides it being inefficient), is that, because of implicit bias, teachers are spending too much time watching black boys and expecting the worst.

The study

Lead researcher Walter Gilliam knew that to get an accurate measure of implicit bias among preschool teachers, he couldn't be fully transparent with his subjects about what, exactly, he was trying to study.

Implicit biases are just that — subtle, often subconscious stereotypes that guide our expectations and interactions with people.

""We all have them,"" Gilliam says. ""Implicit biases are a natural process by which we take information, and we judge people on the basis of generalizations regarding that information. We all do it.""

Even the most well-meaning teacher can harbor deep-seated biases, whether she knows it or not. So Gilliam and his team devised a remarkable — and remarkably deceptive — experiment.

At a big, annual conference for pre-K teachers, Gilliam and his team recruited 135 educators to watch a few short videos. Here's what they told them:

We are interested in learning about how teachers detect challenging

behavior in the classroom. Sometimes this involves seeing behavior before it becomes problematic. The video segments you are about to view are of preschoolers engaging in various activities. Some clips may or may not contain challenging behaviors. Your job is to press the enter key on the external keypad every time you see a behavior that could become a potential challenge.

Each video included four children: a black boy and girl and a white boy and girl.

Here's the deception: There was no challenging behavior.

While the teachers watched, eye-scan technology measured the trajectory of their gaze. Gilliam wanted to know: When teachers expected bad behavior, who did they watch?

""What we found was exactly what we expected based on the rates at which children are expelled from preschool programs,"" Gilliam says. ""Teachers looked more at the black children than the white children, and they looked specifically more at the African-American boy.""

Indeed, according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Education, black children are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended from preschool than white children. Put another way, black children account for roughly 19 percent of all preschoolers, but nearly half of preschoolers who get suspended.

One reason that number is so high, Gilliam suggests, is that teachers spend more time focused on their black students, expecting bad behavior. ""If you look for something in one place, that's the only place you can typically find it.""

The Yale team also asked subjects to identify the child they felt required the most attention. Forty-two percent identified the black boy, 34 percent identified the white boy, while 13 percent and 10 percent identified the white and black girls respectively.

The vignette

The Yale study had two parts. And, as compelling as the eye-scan results were, Gilliam's most surprising takeaway came later.

He gave teachers a one-paragraph vignette to read, describing a child disrupting a class; there's hitting, scratching, even toy-throwing. The child in the vignette was randomly assigned what researchers considered a stereotypical name (DeShawn, Latoya, Jake, Emily), and subjects were asked to rate the severity of the behavior on a scale of one to five.

White teachers consistently held black students to a lower standard, rating their behavior as less severe than the same behavior of white students.

Gilliam says this tracks with previous research around how people may shift standards and expectations of others based on stereotypes and implicit bias. In other words, if white teachers believe that black boys are more likely to behave badly, they may be less surprised by that behavior and rate it less severely.

Black teachers, on the other hand, did the opposite, holding black students to a higher standard and rating their behavior as consistently more severe than that of white students.

Here's another key finding: Some teachers were also given information about the disruptive child's home life, to see if it made them more empathetic:

[CHILD] lives with his/her mother, his/her 8- and 6-year-old sisters,

and his/her 10-month-old baby brother. His/her home life is turbulent, between having a father who has never been a constant figure in his/her life, and a mother who struggles with depression but doesn't have the resources available to seek help. During the rare times when his/her parents are together, loud and sometimes violent disputes occur between them. In order to make ends meet, [CHILD's] mother has taken on three different jobs, and is in a constant state of exhaustion. [CHILD] and his/her siblings are left in the care of available relatives and neighbors while their mother is at work.

Guess what happened.

Teachers who received this background did react more empathetically, lowering their rating of a behavior's severity — but only if the teacher and student were of the same race.

As for white teachers rating black students or black teachers rating white students?

""If the race of the teacher and the child were different and [the teacher] received this background information, severity rates skyrocketed,"" Gilliam says. ""And the teachers ended up feeling that the behavioral problems were hopeless and that very little could be done to actually improve the situation.""

This result is consistent with previous research on empathy, Gilliam says. ""When people feel some kind of shared connection to folks, when they hear more about their misfortunes, they feel more empathic to them. But if they feel that they are different from each other ... it may actually cause them to perceive that person in a more negative light.""

It's impossible to separate these findings from today's broader, cultural context — of disproportionately high suspension rates for black boys and young men throughout the school years, of America's school-to-prison pipeline, and, most immediately, of the drumbeat of stories about black men being killed by police.

If implicit bias can play a role on our preschool reading rugs and in our classrooms' cozy corners, it no doubt haunts every corner of our society.

Biases are natural, as Gilliam says, but they must also be reckoned with.

The good news, if there is such a thing from work such as this, is that Gilliam and his team were ethically obligated to follow up with every one of the 135 teachers who participated in the study, to come clean about the deception.

Gilliam even gave them an out, letting them withdraw their data — for many of them, the lasting proof of their bias.

Pat McCrory Blames Congress for Transgender Bathroom Controversy,,Philip Elliott,"North Carolina Gov . Pat McCrory , under fire for signing into law a bill that forces transgender residents to use the bathroom that corresponds to their sex at birth , is blaming Congress for not updating the nation ’ s civil rights laws .
In an interview with TIME , the Republican said the patchwork of non-discrimination laws at state and local levels is inconsistent , and the Civil Rights Act could resolve contradictions over discrimination in schools , businesses and government buildings . McCrory , who is facing a tough re-election bid this November , also vowed to continue his fight against President Barack Obama ’ s orders that schools allow transgender students to pick their own restrooms or face a cutoff of federal dollars .
“ As a country , Congress needs to step up and clarify the Civil Rights Act , which hasn ’ t been updated for decades , ” McCrory said by phone on Wednesday . “ A lot of things have changed since then , including the Supreme Court decision on gay marriage . There ’ s been dramatic change . ”
Congress is considering a comprehensive non-discrimination law that would add protections to LGBT Americans . The Equality Act has attracted supporters from both parties , but it ’ s unlikely to make its way to the President ’ s desk before he leaves office early next year .
McCrory said he is aware of that legislation but didn ’ t know enough about it to endorse it . But he said it ’ s time for Congress to do something on the issue on discrimination . “ Congress has been sitting on the sidelines , ” he said . “ Every city and state and town has its own non-discrimination ordinances that are very inconsistent . ”
McCrory signed legislation that effectively undid one of those local policies . Charlotte , N.C. , was among the last major American cities to adopt such a measure—decades after Minneapolis pass the first one in 1975 .

Pat McCrory, under fire for signing into law a bill that forces transgender residents to use the bathroom that corresponds to their sex at birth, is blaming Congress for not updating the nation’s civil rights laws.

In an interview with TIME, the Republican said the patchwork of non-discrimination laws at state and local levels is inconsistent, and the Civil Rights Act could resolve contradictions over discrimination in schools, businesses and government buildings. McCrory, who is facing a tough re-election bid this November, also vowed to continue his fight against President Barack Obama’s orders that schools allow transgender students to pick their own restrooms or face a cutoff of federal dollars.

“As a country, Congress needs to step up and clarify the Civil Rights Act, which hasn’t been updated for decades,” McCrory said by phone on Wednesday. “A lot of things have changed since then, including the Supreme Court decision on gay marriage. There’s been dramatic change.”

Congress is considering a comprehensive non-discrimination law that would add protections to LGBT Americans. The Equality Act has attracted supporters from both parties, but it’s unlikely to make its way to the President’s desk before he leaves office early next year.

McCrory said he is aware of that legislation but didn’t know enough about it to endorse it. But he said it’s time for Congress to do something on the issue on discrimination. “Congress has been sitting on the sidelines,” he said. “Every city and state and town has its own non-discrimination ordinances that are very inconsistent.”

McCrory signed legislation that effectively undid one of those local policies. Charlotte, N.C., was among the last major American cities to adopt such a measure—decades after Minneapolis pass the first one in 1975. Some in the GOP are left scratching their heads over why these are controversial.

“Non-discrimination laws belong at the federal level and they have not been updated,” McCrory said.

LGBT rights advocates have been tough on McCrory and the Republican-led legislature, urging them to scrap a law that, by some estimates, has cost the state’s economy $500 million.

This attention leaves McCrory frustrated.

In the 50 years since the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. articulated the dream of a generation, the United States has seen significant progress toward the ideal of racial equality. But the other half of King’s vision — economic equity for all Americans — remains sadly unfulfilled.

America’s wealth and income gaps have grown to shocking proportions, in no small part due to federal tax and spending policies that have betrayed the great civil rights leader’s ardent hopes for a better society. To many, the quest for economic equality represents the last great frontier in civil rights.

Story Continued Below

As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, political and social progress is clear. Legally mandated racial segregation in the American South has been dismantled. African-Americans have come to occupy positions of power and influence, from the boardroom to the statehouse to the White House. When I was first sworn into the House of Representatives in 1965, I joined just five other African-American members; today, there are 43.

Yet, there is need for continued vigilance. Voter suppression efforts plague modern elections. And Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which gives the federal government power to approve changes to the voting laws of certain states with a history of discrimination, has fallen victim to legal challenge.

But the most obvious failure to achieve equality is in the economic realm. With a few exceptions, U.S. income inequality has consistently worsened since reaching a low in 1968, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Census Bureau. Over that same period, the average African-American household continued to earn about 60 percent of the average white household. The percentage of Americans living in poverty — after dropping to 11 percent in the years immediately following Dr. King’s 1963 speech — was back to 15 percent in 2011.

Wealth disparities are even more glaring. In 2010, the median white household had eight times the assets of the median black household, according to the Urban Institute. These huge discrepancies threaten our democratic institutions because concentrated wealth wields disproportionate political influence.

Although several factors have contributed to these troubling financial disparities, researchers have determined that roughly one-third of this escalating income inequality can be attributed to our skewed tax system and cuts to public services and benefits.

An unfair budget policy contributes to economic inequality in different ways. First, lower tax rates for the wealthy and numerous tax loopholes for large corporations keep money in the pockets of those who need it least. Then, the resulting decline in tax revenue causes Washington to slash investments in everything from job training to education to mass transit — the very resources American families need to pull through tough times and get ahead over the long-term.

To help close these economic gaps, we need reformed tax and spending policies that require everyone to pay a fair share. Ending tax loopholes that encourage individuals and large corporations to hide profits and ship jobs overseas could easily raise $600 billion over the next decade to invest in American communities. Limiting the wealthiest families to the top tax deduction available to middle-class taxpayers (28 percent) could raise an additional $500 billion.

With millions unemployed or underemployed, rather than losing 900,000 more jobs with another round of cuts mandated by the cruel budget “sequester,” we could use this new revenue to invest in America’s future through a national jobs program. My proposal, the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Training Act (H.R. 1000), would put Americans back to work rebuilding our infrastructure and rehabilitating our communities.

Dr. King understood that civil rights included economic rights and that we can never truly form a more perfect union until income, wealth and opportunity are made more equal. On this 50th anniversary of his greatest speech, we come once more to rededicate ourselves to that dream.

civil_rights,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2015/07/14/lets_make_the_south_stop_lying_the_rights_war_on_our_history_and_truth_must_be_defeated_now/,Let's make the South stop lying: The right's war on our history - and truth - must be defeated now,2015-07-14,,"Last Friday , in a muted , five-minute ceremony , an honor guard of gray-clad troopers removed the Confederate flag from South Carolina ’ s state Capitol lawn . The flag ’ s long-running second act -- taken down in 1865 , hoisted back up in 1961 -- holds many lessons . One is that political correctness cuts both ways . The flag ’ s defenders say it stands for `` states ’ rights '' or `` Southern heritage , '' the latter a harmless mix of hospitality , soldierly valor and regional cuisine . For 54 years even some liberals pretended to swallow this lie out of deference to the feelings of those spreading it . We can stop pretending now . It ’ s a big win , to be sure , but it took long enough .
The final vote in the state House was a lopsided 94-20 , but flag apologists didn ’ t go quietly . Debate lasted 13 hours before exhausting itself around 1 a.m. Thursday . The leader of the dead-enders was Republican state Rep. Michael Pitts , a 60-year-old white male , Baptist , retired cop and NRA devotee heretofore best known for backing South Carolina ’ s “ Second Amendment Weekend ” ( in which the state waives sales taxes on rifles and handguns ) and a loopy plan to replace U.S. paper currency with silver and gold coins minted by the state .
Pitt insists Confederate soldiers only knew “ what they heard in the general store , that Northern States were attacking Southern States. ” He said he learned as a child to call the Civil War the `` War of Northern Aggression . '' He didn ’ t say if he calls it something else now , but he did accuse foes of “ scrubbing history. ” It was a favorite theme of flag defenders . Rep. Eric Bedingfield said he ’ d “ bathed this thing in prayer ” and “ called my pastor to pray for me , ” from which he learned “ you can ’ t erase history. ” Rep. J. Gary Simrill accused the removers of “ almost a cultural genocide. ” For sheer oddball color , no one beat Senate Majority Leader Harvey Peeler , who summed things up in these lovely words : `` To remove the flag… and thinking it would change history would be like removing a tattoo from the corpse of a loved one and thinking it would change a loved one ’ s obituary . ''
For 150 years , folks like Pitts , Bedingfield , Simrill and Peeler rewrote the history of the South . When South Carolina declared war on the Union , 57 percent of its citizens were African-American slaves ; all scrubbed from every tale of `` Southern heritage . '' Even the most pious ancestor worshipper knows the Confederate flag is the flag of racism , slavery and sedition . It took years of arduous scrubbing and lies of satanic ingenuity to get anyone to think otherwise . The truth won ’ t be restored overnight .
In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the Emanuel AME church there are efforts across the South to remove Confederate monuments . New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu wants to take down four . Three honor Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G . T. Beauregard . The fourth honors a post-Civil War revolt against Louisiana ’ s reconstruction government by a band of ex-soldiers called the White League . My money is on Landrieu , but the mere fact that such a monument still stands suggests how hard it ’ ll be getting the South to face up to its past . It won ’ t be easy anywhere .
On the day South Carolina voted to lower the flag , the even loonier Republicans in the U.S. House pushed to display it on Confederate Memorial Day -- a holiday in nine states -- and sell it in souvenir shops on federal lands . A fearful John Boehner shut them down , but in the months and years ahead , as the memory of Charleston fades and fewer mayors , governors and House speakers see a need to spend political capital , the fight may get harder . And this is just the fight to keep the state from spreading lies . The harder fight will be to get not just the South but the whole country to commit to telling the truth , and not just about the Civil War .
For years , the right has waged a war on history every bit as relentless as and even more effective than its war on science . George Orwell famously observed that “ who controls the past controls the future. ” In America few outside the political right took his point . It has carried the fight to colleges , media , government and especially public schools . An ineluctable lesson of Charleston is that the left must finally fight back .
As far back as the early ` 80s the religious right sought to elect its people to school boards , often instructing them to conceal their views until after they were elected . Sex education was their top priority , but they also dove into history and other social studies . In her book `` As Texas Goes : How the Lone Star State Hijacked the American Agenda , '' New York Times columnist Gail Collins tells the story of the Texas School Board . Only she could make this chilling tale amusing . Texas is America ’ s second biggest purchaser of textbooks and the state controls the purchasing so publishers have long bowed to its dictates on content .
The board was always conservative but when real fanatics took it over they began furiously rewriting curricula , substituting ideological cant for scholarship wherever possible . 2010 was a banner year for them . They bumped Thomas Jefferson from a list of `` influential thinkers '' —they felt him misguided in the mater of the separation of church and state—but promoted Phyllis Schlafly to take his place . They also encouraged study of George Wallace , the NRA , the Moral Majority , Jefferson Davis ’ inaugural address and the Heritage Foundation and told schools to tell kids Joe McCarthy was right about communists infiltrating government .
The right does its most insidious work in classrooms but it wages war on history almost everywhere . You may recall that in the mid-'90s the Smithsonian planned an exhibit on the Enola Gay , the B29 aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima . The American Legion was instantly up in arms and the rest of the right soon followed . Perhaps they feared word of the bombing would get out or that Trotskyites at the Air and Space Museum would use the incident for propaganda purposes . The exhibit was killed . After 89 brave members of Congress called for his head , the museum ’ s director was forced to resign .
As evidenced by Dylann Roof and millions who share his views if not his soul sickness , the right has been most effective and destructive in reweaving the history of the Confederacy . In a piece in the Washington Post this week , James Loewen describes the decades ’ long work of Southern `` historians ’ '' to turn the Civil War from an insurrection mounted to defend human slavery into a ‘ war between the states ’ sparked in large part by an imperious federal government bent on robbing the South of its liberty .
Loewen reminds us of how hard Civil War apologists work to shape our collective memory . Kentucky is a border state that never joined the confederacy ; 90,000 Kentuckians volunteered for the Union army , nearly triple the number that fought for the rebellion . Today Kentucky has 2 Union monuments and 72 Confederate monuments . It may be that conservatives care more about the past or are more susceptible to nostalgia . But erecting all those monuments took effort . The right is willing to make it because , like Orwell , it sees the point of controlling the past .
Republicans are even fonder of twisting the story of America ’ s birth . In 1984 Ronald Reagan added the word ‘ shining ’ to the phrase `` city on a hill '' from John Winthrop ’ s famed sermon to Puritans bound for Massachusetts . Winthrop ’ s message to his flock was to behave , because the whole world was watching : `` We shall be as a city upon a hill ; the eyes of all people are upon us . '' Reagan ’ s message was almost the exact opposite ; that whatever America did must be good because God chose it to be the envy of all nations , a notion Winthrop would have heard as sinful pride and that helped inspire the reckless self-reverential folderol known as `` American Exceptionalism . '' ( John Kennedy was the first modern president to invoke the sermon . In a lustrous speech in Boston days before his inaugural he perfectly echoed Winthrop ’ s call to rise to the challenge of the hour . ) Our founding has so much to teach us but so much of what is taught now is false .
Since Reagan ’ s death the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project , brainchild of noted social-contract shredder Grover Norquist , has labored to name something after Reagan in every county in America . I ’ d say they ’ re halfway there . They also want his name on currency , and a federal holiday in his honor . Norquist thinks the more stuff he names after Reagan the more taxes he can cut . I think he ’ s right . Such is the power of propaganda .
Of course , the price of propaganda is ignorance . The more we fete Reagan , the harder it is to tell people what a train wreck his fiscal policies were ; harder still to make them believe he ever apologized to Gorbachev for calling Russia an evil empire—he did -- or went to Reykjavik boldly hoping to dismantle both the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals .

The flag’s long-running second act--taken down in 1865, hoisted back up in 1961-- holds many lessons. One is that political correctness cuts both ways. The flag’s defenders say it stands for ""states’ rights""or ""Southern heritage,"" the latter a harmless mix of hospitality, soldierly valor and regional cuisine. For 54 years even some liberals pretended to swallow this lie out of deference to the feelings of those spreading it. We can stop pretending now. It’s a big win, to be sure, but it took long enough.

The final vote in the state House was a lopsided 94-20, but flag apologists didn’t go quietly. Debate lasted 13 hours before exhausting itself around 1 a.m. Thursday. The leader of the dead-enders was Republican state Rep. Michael Pitts, a 60-year-old white male, Baptist, retired cop and NRA devotee heretofore best known for backing South Carolina’s “Second Amendment Weekend” (in which the state waives sales taxes on rifles and handguns) and a loopy plan to replace U.S. paper currency with silver and gold coins minted by the state.

Pitt insists Confederate soldiers only knew “what they heard in the general store, that Northern States were attacking Southern States.” He said he learned as a child to call the Civil War the ""War of Northern Aggression."" He didn’t say if he calls it something else now, but he did accuse foes of “scrubbing history.” It was a favorite theme of flag defenders. Rep. Eric Bedingfield said he’d “bathed this thing in prayer” and “called my pastor to pray for me,” from which he learned “you can’t erase history.” Rep. J. Gary Simrill accused the removers of “almost a cultural genocide.” For sheer oddball color, no one beat Senate Majority Leader Harvey Peeler, who summed things up in these lovely words: ""To remove the flag… and thinking it would change history would be like removing a tattoo from the corpse of a loved one and thinking it would change a loved one’s obituary.""

For 150 years, folks like Pitts, Bedingfield, Simrill and Peeler rewrote the history of the South. When South Carolina declared war on the Union, 57 percent of its citizens were African-American slaves; all scrubbed from every tale of ""Southern heritage."" Even the most pious ancestor worshipper knows the Confederate flag is the flag of racism, slavery and sedition. It took years of arduous scrubbing and lies of satanic ingenuity to get anyone to think otherwise. The truth won’t be restored overnight.

In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the Emanuel AME church there are efforts across the South to remove Confederate monuments. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu wants to take down four. Three honor Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G. T. Beauregard. The fourth honors a post-Civil War revolt against Louisiana’s reconstruction government by a band of ex-soldiers called the White League. My money is on Landrieu, but the mere fact that such a monument still stands suggests how hard it’ll be getting the South to face up to its past. It won’t be easy anywhere.

On the day South Carolina voted to lower the flag, the even loonier Republicans in the U.S. House pushed to display it on Confederate Memorial Day -- a holiday in nine states -- and sell it in souvenir shops on federal lands. A fearful John Boehner shut them down, but in the months and years ahead, as the memory of Charleston fades and fewer mayors, governors and House speakers see a need to spend political capital, the fight may get harder. And this is just the fight to keep the state from spreading lies. The harder fight will be to get not just the South but the whole country to commit to telling the truth, and not just about the Civil War.

For years, the right has waged a war on history every bit as relentless as and even more effective than its war on science. George Orwell famously observed that “who controls the past controls the future.” In America few outside the political right took his point. It has carried the fight to colleges, media, government and especially public schools. An ineluctable lesson of Charleston is that the left must finally fight back.

As far back as the early`80s the religious right sought to elect its people to school boards, often instructing them to conceal their views until after they were elected. Sex education was their top priority, but they also dove into history and other social studies. In her book ""As Texas Goes: How the Lone Star State Hijacked the American Agenda,"" New York Times columnist Gail Collins tells the story of the Texas School Board. Only she could make this chilling tale amusing. Texas is America’s second biggest purchaser of textbooks and the state controls the purchasing so publishers have long bowed to its dictates on content.

The board was always conservative but when real fanatics took it over they began furiously rewriting curricula, substituting ideological cant for scholarship wherever possible. 2010 was a banner year for them. They bumped Thomas Jefferson from a list of ""influential thinkers""—they felt him misguided in the mater of the separation of church and state—but promoted Phyllis Schlafly to take his place. They also encouraged study of George Wallace, the NRA, the Moral Majority, Jefferson Davis’ inaugural address and the Heritage Foundation and told schools to tell kids Joe McCarthy was right about communists infiltrating government.

The right does its most insidious work in classrooms but it wages war on history almost everywhere. You may recall that in the mid-'90s the Smithsonian planned an exhibit on the Enola Gay, the B29 aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The American Legion was instantly up in arms and the rest of the right soon followed. Perhaps they feared word of the bombing would get out or that Trotskyites at the Air and Space Museum would use the incident for propaganda purposes. The exhibit was killed. After 89 brave members of Congress called for his head, the museum’s director was forced to resign.

As evidenced by Dylann Roof and millions who share his views if not his soul sickness, the right has been most effective and destructive in reweaving the history of the Confederacy. In a piece in the Washington Post this week, James Loewen describes the decades’ long work of Southern ""historians’"" to turn the Civil War from an insurrection mounted to defend human slavery into a ‘war between the states’ sparked in large part by an imperious federal government bent on robbing the South of its liberty.

Loewen reminds us of how hard Civil War apologists work to shape our collective memory. Kentucky is a border state that never joined the confederacy; 90,000 Kentuckians volunteered for the Union army, nearly triple the number that fought for the rebellion. Today Kentucky has 2 Union monuments and 72 Confederate monuments. It may be that conservatives care more about the past or are more susceptible to nostalgia. But erecting all those monuments took effort. The right is willing to make it because, like Orwell, it sees the point of controlling the past.

Republicans are even fonder of twisting the story of America’s birth. In 1984 Ronald Reagan added the word ‘shining’ to the phrase ""city on a hill"" from John Winthrop’s famed sermon to Puritans bound for Massachusetts. Winthrop’s message to his flock was to behave, because the whole world was watching: ""We shall be as a city upon a hill; the eyes of all people are upon us."" Reagan’s message was almost the exact opposite; that whatever America did must be good because God chose it to be the envy of all nations, a notion Winthrop would have heard as sinful pride and that helped inspire the reckless self-reverential folderol known as ""American Exceptionalism."" (John Kennedy was the first modern president to invoke the sermon. In a lustrous speech in Boston days before his inaugural he perfectly echoed Winthrop’s call to rise to the challenge of the hour.) Our founding has so much to teach us but so much of what is taught now is false.

Since Reagan’s death the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, brainchild of noted social-contract shredder Grover Norquist, has labored to name something after Reagan in every county in America. I’d say they’re halfway there. They also want his name on currency, and a federal holiday in his honor. Norquist thinks the more stuff he names after Reagan the more taxes he can cut. I think he’s right. Such is the power of propaganda.

Of course, the price of propaganda is ignorance. The more we fete Reagan, the harder it is to tell people what a train wreck his fiscal policies were; harder still to make them believe he ever apologized to Gorbachev for calling Russia an evil empire—he did-- or went to Reykjavik boldly hoping to dismantle both the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals. He did that, too; we just don’t know it.

You’d think a left rife with college professors and other readers of books could fight this battle at least to a draw, but outside academia it barely put up a fight. A few lonely voices—Lewis Lapham and Stacy Schiff spring to mind--urged all who are in any sense progressive-minded to fight those who propagandize history. But up to now it was a tough sell. Among the many horrid lessons of Charleston is a new awareness of the price we pay for our neglect. We know now if we didn’t before just how many stand at the ready to pour hate into the vacuum of ignorance.

To understand why , let ’ s back up . HB2 had two major parts : It overturned and banned local statutes that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity .

But the deal does not fully repeal the other part of HB2 . It does seem to let nondiscrimination laws passed by local governments before HB2 kick back into effect . But it also continues to prohibit local governments from passing nondiscrimination laws until December 1 , 2020 , so cities like Charlotte over the next three years still won ’ t be able to pass a new law that bans discrimination against LGBTQ people . And the deal permanently prevents all government agencies in North Carolina , from local to state , from setting up trans-friendly bathroom or locker room policies , since they ’ ll no longer be allowed to regulate access to these facilities .
Since North Carolina has no statewide nondiscrimination laws protecting LGBTQ people , it will continue to be legal across much of the state for an employer to fire someone , a landlord to evict someone , and a business to kick someone out or engage in other kinds of discrimination solely because of the person ’ s sexual orientation or gender identity .

A House vote could change that",2020-02-26,,"WASHINGTON – The House overwhelmingly passed legislation Wednesday that would make lynching a federal crime , a move supporters said is `` long overdue '' in a country whose history is stained with the atrocities .
“ I can not imagine our nation did not have any federal law against lynching when so many African Americans have been lynched , ” said Rep. Bobby Rush , D-Ill. , a lead sponsor of the bill . “ Lynching was the preferred method of the Ku Klux Klan , the preferred choice of torturing and murdering African Americans . ”
The Emmett Till Antilynching Act is named in memory of a 14-year-old black teenager who was murdered in Mississippi in 1955 . His death was a catalyst for the civil rights movement .
Rush said he proposed the bill at the urging of Jesse Jackson , who called last year to ask whether he knew there wasn ’ t such a law . “ I heard the alarm , ” Rush told ███ .
The House approved the bill 410 to 4 . Voting against the measure were Republican Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas , Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ted Yoho of Florida . Rep. Justin Amash , I-Mich. , also voted no .
'What the hell is wrong with you ? ' Trump slammed by lawmakers after he called impeachment inquiry a 'lynching '
During debate , Democrats and Republicans cited lynchings in their districts and states . `` We can not simply wash away the past , '' said Rep. Don Bacon , R-Neb. , a co-sponsor last year on a bipartisan anti-lynching bill .
Bacon said it 's important to acknowledge `` that evil did occur . ''
Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise , the House GOP whip , said he and other Republicans will try to be added as co-sponsors . “ It shouldn ’ t be partisan . It ’ s not partisan , ” he said . “ I haven ’ t seen anybody who is against this bill . ”
The family of Emmett Till welcomed passage of the anti-lynching bill .
“ With this vote , it will finally be criminalized , and the importance of that can not be overstated , ” said Deborah Watts , a cousin and co-founder of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation . “ Perhaps now the victims who have been crying out from their graves for centuries and their relatives still struggling today can now find some semblance of peace . ”
Watts said her family will continue its fight for justice in Emmett ’ s death .
Rush said he was assured by Senate co-sponsors of a similar bill that if the measure passed in the House , it would quickly be brought up for a vote in the Senate . Supporters hope to have it signed into law by the end of February in honor of Black History Month .
The Senate passed a similar bill last year but has to vote on the version approved by the House on Wednesday . The bipartisan Senate bill was proposed by Democratic Sens . Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Tim Scott , R-S.C .
The bill would add language to the Civil Rights Act of 1968 , making lynching a violation .
“ Lynchings were horrendous , racist acts of violence , '' Harris said . `` For far too long Congress has failed to take a moral stand and pass a bill to finally make lynching a federal crime . ”
For Rush , the legislation is personal . He said he remembers when his mother gathered the family in their home in Chicago and showed the picture of Emmett Till on the cover of Jet Magazine .
The teenager 's mother , Mamie Till Mobley , had an open casket funeral in Chicago to show the world how Till , who had been visiting family in Mississippi , had been beaten and shot in the head . Witnesses said two white men , Roy Bryant and J.W . Milam , kidnapped Till , whose body was found floating in the Tallahatchie River .
“ It changed my life , ” recalled Rush , who was 8 years old . “ It made me much more aware … of the impediments to my life , the racism that permeates in America . ”
Ashraf H.A . Rushdy , a professor at Wesleyan University and the author of “ American Lynching ” and “ The End of American Lynching , ” called it “ the original hate crime . ”
`` It should have its own law , its own section . ... It ’ s the responsible thing to do and the historically accurate thing to do , ” he said .
Supporters said it ’ s been more than 100 years since the House passed an anti-lynching bill that failed in the Senate . They said nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced during the first half of the 20th century .
“ It ’ s not for lack of trying , ” Rushdy said . “ The Senate for 150 years refused to do that . It stopped every single bill , including two that passed the House . ... It 's the Senate that is the body that is failing us . ”
He said the Senate was long controlled by Southern lawmakers , many of whom supported states ' rights and were leery of backing a federal law .
There were symbolic gestures in Congress , he said , including an apology in 2005 for inaction proposed by Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La. , and a joint resolution in 2017 condemning racial violence in Charlottesville , Virginia .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , called the anti-lynchingbill “ long overdue . ”
“ Lynching is a blot on the history of America , ” he said . “ But it ’ s never too late to do the right thing . ''
Rush called it a “ shame ” that such a law has n't passed .
“ To live in a nation where there is no federal statute … was totally reprehensible and unjust , ” he said . “ It really was a failure of our nation and Congress to not eventually prohibit lynching . ”
There were 4,743 lynchings from 1882 to 1968 , according to the national NAACP . Of those , 3,446 were black . Most lynchings took place in the South .
“ Make no mistake : Lynching is terrorism , ’ ’ said Rep. Karen Bass , D-Calif. , chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus .
Rush , who was born in Georgia , said one of his uncles was lynched in a rural part of the state .
“ I ’ m a black man in America , ” he said . “ I just wanted to make sure that I utilize my vantage point as a member of Congress to enact legislation that , for the first time , will make lynching a violation of federal law . ”

“I cannot imagine our nation did not have any federal law against lynching when so many African Americans have been lynched,” said Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., a lead sponsor of the bill. “Lynching was the preferred method of the Ku Klux Klan, the preferred choice of torturing and murdering African Americans.”

The Emmett Till Antilynching Act is named in memory of a 14-year-old black teenager who was murdered in Mississippi in 1955. His death was a catalyst for the civil rights movement.

Rush said he proposed the bill at the urging of Jesse Jackson, who called last year to ask whether he knew there wasn’t such a law. “I heard the alarm,” Rush told USA TODAY.

The House approved the bill 410 to 4. Voting against the measure were Republican Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ted Yoho of Florida. Rep. Justin Amash, I-Mich., also voted no.

During debate, Democrats and Republicans cited lynchings in their districts and states. ""We cannot simply wash away the past,"" said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a co-sponsor last year on a bipartisan anti-lynching bill.

Bacon said it's important to acknowledge ""that evil did occur.""

Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the House GOP whip, said he and other Republicans will try to be added as co-sponsors. “It shouldn’t be partisan. It’s not partisan,” he said. “I haven’t seen anybody who is against this bill.”

The family of Emmett Till welcomed passage of the anti-lynching bill.

“With this vote, it will finally be criminalized, and the importance of that cannot be overstated,” said Deborah Watts, a cousin and co-founder of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation. “Perhaps now the victims who have been crying out from their graves for centuries and their relatives still struggling today can now find some semblance of peace.”

Watts said her family will continue its fight for justice in Emmett’s death.

Rush said he was assured by Senate co-sponsors of a similar bill that if the measure passed in the House, it would quickly be brought up for a vote in the Senate. Supporters hope to have it signed into law by the end of February in honor of Black History Month.

The Senate passed a similar bill last year but has to vote on the version approved by the House on Wednesday. The bipartisan Senate bill was proposed by Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.

The bill would add language to the Civil Rights Act of 1968, making lynching a violation.

“Lynchings were horrendous, racist acts of violence,'' Harris said. ""For far too long Congress has failed to take a moral stand and pass a bill to finally make lynching a federal crime.”

'I'm a black man in America'

For Rush, the legislation is personal. He said he remembers when his mother gathered the family in their home in Chicago and showed the picture of Emmett Till on the cover of Jet Magazine.

The teenager's mother, Mamie Till Mobley, had an open casket funeral in Chicago to show the world how Till, who had been visiting family in Mississippi, had been beaten and shot in the head. Witnesses said two white men, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, kidnapped Till, whose body was found floating in the Tallahatchie River.

“It changed my life,” recalled Rush, who was 8 years old. “It made me much more aware … of the impediments to my life, the racism that permeates in America.”

Ashraf H.A. Rushdy, a professor at Wesleyan University and the author of “American Lynching” and “The End of American Lynching,” called it “the original hate crime.”

""It should have its own law, its own section. ... It’s the responsible thing to do and the historically accurate thing to do,” he said.

Supporters said it’s been more than 100 years since the House passed an anti-lynching bill that failed in the Senate. They said nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced during the first half of the 20th century.

“It’s not for lack of trying,” Rushdy said. “The Senate for 150 years refused to do that. It stopped every single bill, including two that passed the House. ... It's the Senate that is the body that is failing us.”

He said the Senate was long controlled by Southern lawmakers, many of whom supported states' rights and were leery of backing a federal law.

He said many states adopted anti-lynching bills.

There were symbolic gestures in Congress, he said, including an apology in 2005 for inaction proposed by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and a joint resolution in 2017 condemning racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called the anti-lynchingbill “long overdue.”

“Lynching is a blot on the history of America,” he said. “But it’s never too late to do the right thing.""

Rush called it a “shame” that such a law hasn't passed.

“To live in a nation where there is no federal statute … was totally reprehensible and unjust,” he said. “It really was a failure of our nation and Congress to not eventually prohibit lynching.”

There were 4,743 lynchings from 1882 to 1968, according to the national NAACP. Of those, 3,446 were black. Most lynchings took place in the South.

“Make no mistake: Lynching is terrorism,’’ said Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Rush, who was born in Georgia, said one of his uncles was lynched in a rural part of the state.

“I’m a black man in America,” he said. “I just wanted to make sure that I utilize my vantage point as a member of Congress to enact legislation that, for the first time, will make lynching a violation of federal law.”

The history of lynching in the USA

Some congressional lawmakers have pushed to make civil rights landmarks part of the National Park Service – including the Tallahatchie County Courthouse where the two men accused of killing Till were acquitted by an all-white jury.

The effects of this systemic racism show up in almost every meaningful aspect of American life . Black and Latino children are more likely to attend schools that are segregated by both race and income . White families are about six times more wealthy than black families . Just 43.5 percent of black Americans own homes , about 20 percentage points below the national rate . The African-American poverty rate is 27.2 percent , while the white poverty rate is 9.7 percent . In July , national unemployment was at 6.2 percent , but for black people , it was 11.4 percent . And on top of these disparities , there 's America 's baldly racist criminal justice system , which , as Brown 's mother tried to explain after her son 's death , does a thorough job of convincing black youth that their lives are not of value .
The effects of this systemic racism show up in almost every meaningful aspect of American life .
There 's an important conversation to be had about violence in poor black neighborhoods , but not without also talking about the inequality running through all parts of residents ' lives . Unfortunately , many of the people who are clamoring for a bigger spotlight on `` black-on-black crime '' seem uninterested in discussing the past and present policies that have fostered it .
As Coates wrote in a recent essay , `` The politics of respectability are , at their root , the politics of changing the subject — the last resort for those who can not bear the agony of looking their country in the eye . The policy of America has been , for most of its history , white supremacy . The high rates of violence in black neighborhoods do not exist outside of these facts — they evidence them . ''
By zeroing in on urban violence or sagging pants or so-called `` thuggish behavior '' ( a popular theme among Darren Wilson supporters ) — in other words , by blaming racial disparities on black culture — black America 's critics can completely ignore an uncomfortable fact about the US : that racism still exists in our institutions , and its effects are devastating . Brown 's death has sparked a number of important discussions about police brutality , our fundamentally flawed justice system , crime in black communities , and how all of these things are part of a larger national issue . But I fear the people who most need to hear this wo n't be listening .

The Supreme Court ’ s decision upholding Michigan ’ s affirmative-action ban was far from a shock , but it generated considerable strife on the high court , producing five different opinions in which the justices traded charges and countercharges on the polarizing issues at stake .
Tuesday ’ s splintered , 6-2 , ruling continued what appears to be a steady march toward the demise of the use of race in higher education and offered new insight into just how eager some justices are to accelerate — or resist — what appears to be an inexorable trend .
In the panoply of opinions , the justices assumed various roles . Some acted as rhetorical bomb throwers , either for left or right . Others sought to mediate and moderate — or perhaps just gave the appearance of doing so in order to calm others ’ fears . And one liberal justice defected from his ideological cohorts , to their chagrin .
Here are five takeaways from the justices ’ decision holding that voters have the right to implement bans on racial preferences in higher education , hiring and contracting :
Justice Anthony Kennedy ’ s announcement of the court ’ s ruling began in a defensive crouch , flatly denying that the decision was about affirmative action before anyone had the chance even to level the charge .
“ It is important to note what this case is not about . It is not about the constitutionality , or the merits , of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education , ” Kennedy wrote . “ This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved . It is about who may resolve it . ”
Perhaps . But many of the other justices seemed unwilling or unable to cleanly separate the issues .

The Supreme Court’s decision upholding Michigan’s affirmative-action ban was far from a shock, but it generated considerable strife on the high court, producing five different opinions in which the justices traded charges and countercharges on the polarizing issues at stake.

Tuesday’s splintered, 6-2, ruling continued what appears to be a steady march toward the demise of the use of race in higher education and offered new insight into just how eager some justices are to accelerate — or resist — what appears to be an inexorable trend.

Story Continued Below

In the panoply of opinions, the justices assumed various roles. Some acted as rhetorical bomb throwers, either for left or right. Others sought to mediate and moderate — or perhaps just gave the appearance of doing so in order to calm others’ fears. And one liberal justice defected from his ideological cohorts, to their chagrin.

( Also on POLITICO: The woman who killed affirmative action. Twice)

Here are five takeaways from the justices’ decision holding that voters have the right to implement bans on racial preferences in higher education, hiring and contracting:

1. It’s all about affirmative action — or not

Justice Anthony Kennedy’s announcement of the court’s ruling began in a defensive crouch, flatly denying that the decision was about affirmative action before anyone had the chance even to level the charge.

“It is important to note what this case is not about. It is not about the constitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education,” Kennedy wrote. “This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve it.”

Perhaps. But many of the other justices seemed unwilling or unable to cleanly separate the issues.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s 58-page dissent does a deep dive on affirmative action, including three charts from The New York Times and one from The Wall Street Journal showing how enrollment of African-American and Latino students in certain California and Michigan schools declined after race-based preferences were halted.

( Earlier on POLITICO: SCOTUS upholds ban on affirmative action)

“These statistics may not influence the views of some of my colleagues,” Sotomayor wrote. Their desire to end affirmative action, she argued, “ignores the importance of diversity in institutions of higher education and reveals how little my colleagues understand about the reality of race in America.”

Sotomayor sounded like such an advocate for affirmative action that Chief Justice John Roberts wrote his own concurring opinion complaining about what he saw as transparent lobbying on the subject.

“The dissent devotes 11 pages to expounding its own policy preferences in favor of taking race into account in college admissions, while nonetheless concluding that it ‘do[es] not mean to suggest that the virtues of adopting race-sensitive admissions policies should inform the legal question before the Court,’” Roberts scoffed.

And Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, also felt compelled to throw in a few sharp words on affirmative action, noting Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s 2003 observation that use of race in higher education “will no longer be necessary” in 25 years.

“Grutter’s bell may soon toll,” Scalia wrote, referring to that 2003 case. “The battleground for this case is not the constitutionality of race-based admissions — at least not quite.”

2. A win for ballot measures?

For decades the court has said that it judges all kinds of governmental enactments with the same yardstick, be they congressional or state legislation, city council ordinances, mayoral or police orders or ballot measures approved by voters.

But Kennedy’s core opinion in the Michigan case seems to exalt referenda as a kind of direct democracy that the courts should be particularly reluctant to disturb. That might be a problem for same-sex marriage opponents if a future Supreme Court challenge involves a state law or constitutional amendment enacted by voters.

“Michigan voters exercised their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power,” Kennedy wrote. “Michigan voters used the initiative system to bypass public officials who were deemed not responsive to the concerns of a majority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting race-based preferences that raises difficult and delicate issues.”

Some analysts saw Kennedy’s celebration of referenda as notable because for decades many in the legal system viewed such enactments as particularly suspect because they could represent a kind of backlash spurred by ugly motives. Experts also pointed to Kennedy’s roots in California — a state that has long seen robust use of ballot measures.

“The Kennedy plurality opinion [makes] a measure passed by initiative seem more worthy of protection as an expression of a kind of pure majoritarianism — of what people really want,” said University of California at Irvine law professor Rick Hasen. “This doesn’t change the legal standards on judicial review of initiatives, but I do think it sets a mood that says there should not be suspicion of what the majority wants.”

Not in violation of regulations or procedures : in violation of the law . That should result in prosecutions and probably jail time for the wrongdoers , but it won ’ t necessarily .
The IG investigations are a sideshow . The real investigation , being conducted by John Durham , the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut , will be the one that decides whom to indict and will obtain those indictments from one or more grand juries convened for that purpose .
The Comey IG report is interesting for any number of reasons , the first of which is that the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Comey for his intentionally leaking one of his “ private ” memos about conversations with President Trump to a friend . He did so , as we ’ ve known for two years , specifically to have that friend leak it to the New York Times for publication . Comey intended those leaks to have precisely the effect they did : to cause the appointment of a special counsel .
Robert Mueller ’ s subsequent investigation into the ephemeral “ Russia collusion ” investigation failed in what Comey — and the rest of the anti-Trumpers in the Justice Department and the CIA — intended it to do . It didn ’ t remove Trump from office in a “ soft ” coup .
The report demonstrated that Comey serially lied , violated FBI and Justice Department rules and policies , and leaked documents all in his effort to defeat Donald Trump ’ s candidacy and then stymie Trump ’ s presidency . It proved a hundredfold that Trump was entirely justified in firing Comey .
The reason Comey wasn ’ t prosecuted was that the FBI determined that the memo ( s ) he leaked weren ’ t classified .
And who made that judgment ? Four people did , according to the IG report . Among the four were the disgraced duo : then-FBI agent Peter Strzok ( fired ) and his girlfriend , FBI lawyer Lisa Page ( resigned ) . Both proved themselves to be stridently anti-Trump in thousands of text messages between them .
In light of the Strzok/Page involvement in that decision , why didn ’ t the IG make its separate judgment on whether or not the Comey memos should have been classified ?
So what ? Again , the IG ’ s investigation , as interesting as it is , is only a sideshow . The real investigation into Comey , former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe , former special agent Strzok , and the rest of the FBI and CIA malefactors is the one being conducted by a real prosecutor , U.S. Attorney John Durham .
Let ’ s go back to Joe diGenova ’ s statement . If the four FISA Court warrants were obtained illegally , a considerable number of people may be criminally liable .
For more than a year , we have known that the FISA warrants were based on no real evidence of conspiracy or collusion by Trump or anyone in his campaign with any Russians or Russian entities for the purpose of influencing the election . The only information the FBI had and relied upon to get the surveillance warrants from the FISA court was the so-called “ Steele dossier , ” a compilation of opposition research cobbled together by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign .
In the last Congress , Rep. Devin Nunes ( R.-Calif. ) was chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . Nunes ’ s memorandum of January 18 , 2018 ( declassified on February 2 , 2018 , by President Trump ’ s order ) , set out most of what we know about the FBI ’ s abuses of power in obtaining the FISA warrants .
We know that Peter Strzok was , at the relevant times , deputy to the assistant director of the FBI for counterintelligence . Every such search warrant has to be supported by a sworn affidavit setting out the allegations of criminal and/or foreign intelligence activity on which the warrant is based . Strzok and his staff would have prepared the applications for the FISA warrants and either themselves signed the affidavits or prepared them for a superior ’ s signature .
Strzok ’ s boss , now-former Assistant FBI Director for Counterintelligence , Bill Priestap , had to have approved the FISA warrant applications before they went to Comey and others .
According to the Nunes memo , the Steele dossier was not verified by the FBI before it was used as the basis for the FISA warrants ( or at any point afterward , as we learned later ) .
If , as it appears , the FBI used the Steele dossier information in its affidavits — unverified information though it was — those affidavits are ( at least ) false statements , which are punishable under 18 U.S. Code Section 1001 . They were also a fraud on the FISA court .
The Nunes memo says , “ Then-Director James Comey signed three FISA applications in question in behalf of the FBI , and [ then ] Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one . Then DAG Sally Yates , then Acting DAG Dana Boente and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more FISA applications on behalf of DoJ . ”
All of those people had the duty to ensure the FISA warrants were obtained within the law , not in violation of it . Those at the Strzok and Comey levels are clearly at the greatest risk of prosecution on those grounds . But there are many other people who participated in what was pretty clearly a conspiracy to deny Trump the presidency and , after he was elected , to remove him from office .
That conspiracy clearly extended beyond the FBI to the CIA , which ran a large part of the “ Crossfire Hurricane ” investigation . As I wrote in June , the CIA ’ s part of the conspiracy was run by then–CIA Director John Brennan and his protégé , Gina Haspel , who was at the time the CIA ’ s station chief in London . Haspel is now Trump ’ s CIA director .
Haspel ran — or people under her supervision ran — undercover agents who were meeting with Trump campaign personnel .
That is why Haspel and other current and former CIA employees — especially Brennan — are sweating , trying to cover their tracks and certainly lying to John Durham ’ s investigators . That ’ s the investigation that the FBI and CIA malefactors fear , not the IG ’ s .
And their fear is entirely justified . An obscure law that Durham is certain to consider speaks directly to what the FBI and CIA conspirators did . It is part of the civil rights laws .
Under Title 18 U.S. Code Section 242 , “ Whoever , under color of any law , statute , ordinance , regulation , or custom , willfully subjects any person in any State , Territory , Commonwealth , Possession , or District to the deprivation of any rights , privileges , or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States , ” shall be fined and ( or ) imprisoned for up to one year .
The conspirators clearly didn ’ t deprive Donald Trump of the right to run for president , but they tried very hard to do so . Under the federal conspiracy law ( Title 18 U.S. Code Section 371 ) , it is a crime to conspire to commit any other federal crime . It is a felony punishable by up to five years in jail .
The evidence shows , and should be used in court to prove , that at least the leaders of the conspiracy — Strzok , Priestap , Comey , Brennan , and probably Haspel — should all be brought to justice for their abuse of power .
Make no mistake : their abuse of power is the worst in American history . Nothing any president has done even comes close . Durham and Attorney General Barr need to throw the book at them .","Last week’s publication of the Justice Department Inspector General’s report on former FBI director James Comey basically found that he was the leaking, sneaky weasel that he promised President Trump he wouldn’t be.

As I wrote in June, the CIA’s part of the conspiracy was run by then–CIA Director John Brennan and his protégé, Gina Haspel, who was at the time the CIA’s station chief in London. Haspel is now Trump’s CIA director.

Haspel ran — or people under her supervision ran — undercover agents who were meeting with Trump campaign personnel.

That is why Haspel and other current and former CIA employees — especially Brennan — are sweating, trying to cover their tracks and certainly lying to John Durham’s investigators. That’s the investigation that the FBI and CIA malefactors fear, not the IG’s.

And their fear is entirely justified. An obscure law that Durham is certain to consider speaks directly to what the FBI and CIA conspirators did. It is part of the civil rights laws.

Under Title 18 U.S. Code Section 242, “Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any person in any State , Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,” shall be fined and (or) imprisoned for up to one year.

The conspirators clearly didn’t deprive Donald Trump of the right to run for president, but they tried very hard to do so. Under the federal conspiracy law (Title 18 U.S. Code Section 371), it is a crime to conspire to commit any other federal crime. It is a felony punishable by up to five years in jail.

The evidence shows, and should be used in court to prove, that at least the leaders of the conspiracy — Strzok, Priestap, Comey, Brennan, and probably Haspel — should all be brought to justice for their abuse of power.

Make no mistake: their abuse of power is the worst in American history. Nothing any president has done even comes close. Durham and Attorney General Barr need to throw the book at them.",www.spectator.org,right,lv11pYEM2lG21iGo

civil_rights,Al Jazeera,0,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/holdstopping-stateless-challenge-india-citizenship-law-200312071917304.html,Does CAA comply with India's human rights obligations?,,Mia Swart,"Many international legal experts , including the United Nations special rapporteur on minorities , say India 's new citizenship law is discriminatory and are calling for international intervention .
The Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) fast-tracks nationality for non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Pakistan , Bangladesh and Afghanistan but excludes Muslims - a step compared with US President Donald Trump 's Muslim ban .
Fernand de Varennes , the UN special rapporteur on minorities , told ███ that there is a danger that millions of members of minority groups such as Muslims will be denied citizenship .
`` Many have opined that the exclusion of Muslims as a group from the ambit of the law constitutes an extreme example of discriminatory treatment and that the right of equality without discrimination - particularly if it has a 'racial ' element - is one of the fundamental principles of international human rights , '' de Varennes told ███ .
Earlier this month , the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights , Michelle Bachelet , filed an intervention in the Supreme Court to challenge the CAA .
India 's top court is also hearing a petition from Muslims and liberal Indians , who say the law is against the country 's secular constitution . The case has been temporarily suspended because of the lockdown following the coronavirus crisis .
Bachelet 's petition emphasises that sovereign power is not unfettered and that even decisions regarding citizenship have to conform to the principle of non-discrimination .
In February de Varennes and other UN special rapporteurs wrote an `` open letter '' to the Indian government expressing concerns about the discriminatory aspects of the CAA .
The letter highlights that the `` arbitrary '' exclusion of Muslims and other minorities from the NRC would `` perpetuate discrimination against them and perpetuate a climate of uncertainty , including fears of prolonged statelessness , detention or even deportation '' .
The Indian Ministry on External Affairs said that the CAA was an `` internal matter '' of the country and `` no foreign party has any standing on issues pertaining to India 's sovereignty '' .
Experts warn that the CAA , coupled with the proposed National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) , violates international law , specifically the prohibition on rendering people stateless .
Nearly two million people were excluded from a citizenship list in the northeastern state of Assam where the NRC exercise was concluded last year .
`` What the NRC will create is a large group of stateless people , which in itself will run counter to the obligation in international law to prevent statelessness , '' Parvathi Menon , a lecturer at the Erik Castren Institute of International Law and Human Rights at the University of Helsinki , says .
Menon says the Indian government has already violated its international obligations by `` returning '' many Rohingya , claiming that they were `` illegal ' immigrants . Menon points to the position in Assam where `` illegal immigrants '' are now being housed in detention centres .
India 's Hindu nationalist government has deported some Rohingya refugees to Myanmar in violation of the principles of non-refoulement under refugee law . New Delhi , which considers the Muslim refugees a security threat , has vowed to deport them .
According to Indian lawyer Shruti Panday , the NRC places the burden to prove Indian citizenship on the citizen , which could mean that `` every citizen becomes a doubtful citizen '' . The impact on marginalised groups such as Muslims will be particularly detrimental , she says .
The Indian Constitution recognises the right to equality and the equal application of the law . The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which India is a signatory to , specifically prohibits arbitrary deprivation of nationality .
The purpose of Bachelet 's intervention was to highlight the High Commissioner 's concerns that the CAA does not comply with India 's human rights obligations .
The citizenship law , passed last December , sparked nationwide peaceful protests largely led by Muslims , who fear millions of members of the community will be rendered stateless or disenfranchised . Dozens of people , mostly Muslims , have been killed in a police crackdown that has been criticised by rights groups .
The Supreme Court refused to strike down the legislation and gave the government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi time to reply to pleas challenging the constitutionality of the CAA .
Surinder Bhagat , a counseller at the Indian Embassy in Doha , the capital of Qatar , said the CAA does not take away the citizenship of any Indian citizen , including Muslims .
`` The CAA also does not challenge the standard naturalisation process already permitted in Indian law . The process of obtaining citizenship remains open to people of all faiths and of all countries '' , Bhagat told ███ in an email interview .
But in the third week of March , the Ministry of Home Affairs filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that preparation of the NRC was a `` necessary exercise for any sovereign country for mere identification of citizens from non-citizens '' .
It emphasised that it is not `` taking away '' anyone 's citizenship , adding that the CAA `` wo n't affect the legal , democratic or secular rights of people '' .
Priya Pillai , an international lawyer , said that the international community should `` keep the pressure on India '' .
Pillai says she believes the UN High Commissioner 's intervention is a signal of how seriously the issue of citizenship and potential statelessness is being taken by the international community .
`` The impact on regional peace and security can also not be ruled out , especially if there is mass statelessness as a result of the law and policies being pursued '' , says Pillai .","Many international legal experts, including the United Nations special rapporteur on minorities, say India's new citizenship law is discriminatory and are calling for international intervention.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) fast-tracks nationality for non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan but excludes Muslims - a step compared with US President Donald Trump's Muslim ban.

Fernand de Varennes, the UN special rapporteur on minorities, told Al Jazeera that there is a danger that millions of members of minority groups such as Muslims will be denied citizenship.

""Many have opined that the exclusion of Muslims as a group from the ambit of the law constitutes an extreme example of discriminatory treatment and that the right of equality without discrimination - particularly if it has a 'racial' element - is one of the fundamental principles of international human rights,"" de Varennes told Al Jazeera.

'Sovereign power is not unfettered'

Earlier this month, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, filed an intervention in the Supreme Court to challenge the CAA.

India's top court is also hearing a petition from Muslims and liberal Indians, who say the law is against the country's secular constitution. The case has been temporarily suspended because of the lockdown following the coronavirus crisis.

Bachelet's petition emphasises that sovereign power is not unfettered and that even decisions regarding citizenship have to conform to the principle of non-discrimination.

In February de Varennes and other UN special rapporteurs wrote an ""open letter"" to the Indian government expressing concerns about the discriminatory aspects of the CAA.

The letter highlights that the ""arbitrary"" exclusion of Muslims and other minorities from the NRC would ""perpetuate discrimination against them and perpetuate a climate of uncertainty, including fears of prolonged statelessness, detention or even deportation"".

'Internal matter'

The Indian Ministry on External Affairs said that the CAA was an ""internal matter"" of the country and ""no foreign party has any standing on issues pertaining to India's sovereignty"".

Experts warn that the CAA, coupled with the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), violates international law, specifically the prohibition on rendering people stateless.

Nearly two million people were excluded from a citizenship list in the northeastern state of Assam where the NRC exercise was concluded last year.

""What the NRC will create is a large group of stateless people, which in itself will run counter to the obligation in international law to prevent statelessness,"" Parvathi Menon, a lecturer at the Erik Castren Institute of International Law and Human Rights at the University of Helsinki, says.

Menon says the Indian government has already violated its international obligations by ""returning"" many Rohingya, claiming that they were ""illegal' immigrants. Menon points to the position in Assam where ""illegal immigrants"" are now being housed in detention centres.

India's Hindu nationalist government has deported some Rohingya refugees to Myanmar in violation of the principles of non-refoulement under refugee law. New Delhi, which considers the Muslim refugees a security threat, has vowed to deport them.

'Doubtful citizen'

According to Indian lawyer Shruti Panday, the NRC places the burden to prove Indian citizenship on the citizen, which could mean that ""every citizen becomes a doubtful citizen"". The impact on marginalised groups such as Muslims will be particularly detrimental, she says.

The Indian Constitution recognises the right to equality and the equal application of the law. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which India is a signatory to, specifically prohibits arbitrary deprivation of nationality.

The purpose of Bachelet's intervention was to highlight the High Commissioner's concerns that the CAA does not comply with India's human rights obligations.

The citizenship law, passed last December, sparked nationwide peaceful protests largely led by Muslims, who fear millions of members of the community will be rendered stateless or disenfranchised. Dozens of people, mostly Muslims, have been killed in a police crackdown that has been criticised by rights groups.

The Supreme Court refused to strike down the legislation and gave the government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi time to reply to pleas challenging the constitutionality of the CAA.

Transgender people have said bathroom access is one of their “ most pressing challenges , ” Seelman writes in the study , which was published in February in the Journal of Homosexuality . Trans people have reported getting stared at or being asked to leave , something that causes them “ great stress , ” according to researchers . Seelman highlights an earlier study of 93 trans people that found 68 percent had been verbally harassed in bathrooms , and 9 percent were physically assaulted .

Their suicide-attempt rate was also much higher than that of the general U.S. population—47 percent , compared to about 4 percent for all Americans .

“ This suggests that there may be a distinct relationship between the stress of not being able to use bathrooms or gender-appropriate campus housing and one ’ s mental health , ” Seelman writes .
Seelman connects the suicide risk to “ minority stress , ” or the chronically high levels of stress from discrimination that stigmatized groups face .

My old friend Vincent Cannato , an accomplished historian , wrote his first book on John Lindsay , the one-time liberal golden boy and mayor of New York City .

Lindsay to this day has passionate defenders , and when Vin ’ s book came out it was not received well by the Lindsay caucus .

Melissa Harris-Perry waxes paranoid at the Women’s March on Washington.

My old friend Vincent Cannato, an accomplished historian, wrote his first book on John Lindsay, the one-time liberal golden boy and mayor of New York City. The details don’t matter right now, but the gist was that Lindsay was a flawed mayor who contributed to New York’s problems. Lindsay to this day has passionate defenders, and when Vin’s book came out it was not received well by the Lindsay caucus. The upshot of their argument was “Shut up, everything was awesome in New York City, right through Lindsay’s last day, and then the city went to Hell on January 1, 1974.”

The whole episode has been coming to mind of late as the reality of Trump’s victory — and Hillary’s loss — sinks in across the left. For decades, the old joke was that homelessness “spikes” under Republican administrations, solely because the New York Times and Washington Post were blind to the homeless invisible under Democrats but, under Republicans, they are a living indictment of “trickle down economics.” We’ve already seen that the deficit is now a big problem for Paul Krugman, who, a few months ago, insisted that a President Hillary Clinton should do even more stimulus spending.

But what I find particularly jarring is how, 24 hours after Trump was sworn in, the last eight years under the first black president seemed to have vanished from American consciousness and how some people seem to think the racial climate in America is worse than ever, or poised to be.

A case in point. I had the misfortune of catching the end of Melissa Harris-Perry’s poem-essay-thingamabob at the Women’s March on Saturday. The basic set-up is this: She took some students to D.C.

I think this is all really quite inane and morally grotesque. In no way whatsoever — literally, figuratively, theoretically, hypothetically, phantasmagorically — was the Women’s March poised to decide whether or not blacks can be slaves, Japanese Americans interned in concentration camps, women forced into sexual slavery, etc. It’s all unalloyed paranoid nonsense, even if you allow for “poetic” license.

What is remarkable about this applauded drivel is that it collapses this thing sane people call “time” into an undifferentiated mass of collective white male sin and minority suffering. Nothing is forgotten, time heals no wounds. It rejects both the idea of progress and the fact of progress in order to elicit an unjustified and ridiculous emotional response of grievance and oppression.

This is a perspective that Barack Obama himself always rejected, insisting that many on the left refuse to acknowledge the extent of racial progress in this country.

In the present postmodern world, we are told that there is no such thing as a biologically distinct gender. Instead, gender is now socially constructed. It can be defined by the individual in almost any way he or she sees fit.

In the old days, many clinical psychologists would have believed that Caitlyn Jenner — who first came to fame as Olympian Bruce Jenner — is experiencing a well-chronicled psychological state known as transvestism, or the innate pleasure in wearing the clothes and assuming the manners and appearance of the opposite sex.

Caitlyn Jenner, however, identifies as transgendered. But even if the term is new, the condition is not. References to people acting or dressing as if they were members of the opposite sex — or somewhere in between — were commonly found in the works of ancient authors such as Catullus and Petronius. The difference is that the Greeks and Romans saw it as a psychosexual condition, while today’s postmoderns insist that the transgendered have assumed a self-constructed and genuinely new sexual identity.

Have they really?

After all, many female athletes object to the idea that biologically distinct and often bigger and stronger males can declare that they are female and compete as transgendered women in prestigious athletic contests.

Could a younger Bruce Jenner, after winning the men’s decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, have reconstructed his gender identity and won again in 1980 as eligible female competitor Caitlyn?

Would women accept men in women’s attire as females in beauty pageants? Are transgendered CEOs considered feminist trailblazers who chip away at the glass ceiling? Would parents approve of biological males who have declared themselves transgendered females using the same restrooms as their teenage daughters?

Racial identity is becoming no more biologically based than sexual identity.

A number of prominent white people have declared themselves to be of a different race, apparently on the theory that they are transracial. Activist professor Ward Churchill and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren both in the past had falsely claimed Native American heritage.

Rachel Dolezal, a former Africana studies professor and NAACP chapter president, fraudulently asserted that she was African-American. Black Lives Matter organizer Shaun King has been facing allegations that, despite identifying himself as black, he is, in fact, white. Mr. King has also claimed to be a victim of a hate crime perpetrated by supposedly racist whites, though his account of the incident has also been called into question.

Conservatives emphasize the opportunism involved in the construction of assumed racial identities, contending that minority status provides an edge to elites in hiring and admissions. Mr. Churchill, for instance, was hired as a professor without a doctorate. Ms. Warren did not list herself as a minority as a college student and did not officially claim Native American heritage until she was working in the competitive world of academia, where minority professors are highly sought. Presumably, Ms. Dolezal would not have become a chapter president of the NAACP had it been known that she was white. Shaun King translated his racial status into a high-profile activist role.

Liberals countered — at least at first — that the race of Ms. Dolezal and Mr. King did not matter if these well-intentioned souls were furthering progressive causes. If Mr. King constructed himself as black, then perhaps he really was.

But then they were hoisted on their own racial petards.

For a half-century, the engine of diversity preference and affirmative action has been fueled by physically identifiable racial identity — one-drop rules just as reactionary and exclusionary as those of the Old Confederacy. Race was supposedly easily ascertainable, even still in our increasingly intermarried and assimilated society.

The DNA-derived color of one’s skin — not the content of one’s character — usually alone qualified one for affirmative action. If Shaun King or Rachel Dolezal can become black simply by asserting that they are black, are they then eligible for special minority advantages?

That notion is neither idle speculation nor conservative cynicism. Mr. King, for example, received an Oprah Winfrey minority scholarship at Morehouse College. Had he been seen as biologically white, he would never have been frequently interviewed on cable television as a national black leader.

Being white and male supposedly means enjoying innate and undeserved privileged. But now trans-elites reinvent themselves as females or minorities and have access to special advantages or privileges.

We are still fighting the old battle between nature and culture.

Our 21st-century postmodern culture says that we can become whatever we declare ourselves to be. But age-old realities suggest that only nature determines our gender and race.

How odd that progressives publicly insist that we can be what we wish to be, but privately accept the ancient wisdom that we really cannot quite do that — at least not without dropping the accepted criteria for social institutions such as racially based scholarships, female sports programs or affirmative action for women and minorities.

civil_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/28/obama-citing-mlk-calls-economic-justice/,"Obama, citing MLK, calls for economic justice",2013-08-28,Dave Boyer,"Standing on the spot where the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. famously urged Americans not to judge one another by the color of their skin , President Obama said Wednesday that Americans must use the example of the civil rights marchers of 50 years ago to press for his brand of economic justice for the middle class .
“ We must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks could join the ranks of millionaires , ” Mr. Obama said on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . “ It was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard , regardless of race , into the ranks of middle-class life . ”
Reciting many of the same themes from his re-election bid and his budget battles with congressional Republicans , the president said the nation ’ s leaders must attack the problems of income inequality to live up to King ’ s dream of social justice .
“ The position of all working Americans , regardless of color , has eroded , making the dream Dr. King described even more elusive , ” Mr. Obama said . “ Inequality has steadily risen over the decades . ”
As the nation ’ s first black president , Mr. Obama capped a rainy day of rhetoric and music commemorating the 50th anniversary of King ’ s legendary “ I Have a Dream ” speech and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 .
Americans are increasingly pessimistic that progress is being made toward King ’ s goal of racial equality . A Pew Research Center poll this month found that only 26 percent of blacks believe conditions have improved for black Americans in the past five years . The same poll in 2009 said 39 percent of blacks felt conditions were improving .

Mr. Obama noted in his speech , “ The gap in wealth between races has not lessened ; it ’ s grown. ” He later threw in the slogan of his 2008 campaign , saying , “ We might not face the same dangers as 1963 , but the fierce urgency of now remains . ”
The president ’ s arrival was dramatic . He emerged from the interior shadows of the Lincoln Memorial , holding hands with first lady Michelle Obama and descending the marble steps , followed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
Republican former Presidents George H.W . Bush and George W. Bush were invited but couldn ’ t make it , resulting in an all-Democratic presidential cast at the podium .
Mr. Obama praised King ’ s legacy and spoke even more passionately about the civil rights marchers of modest means who fought the struggle decades ago .
“ Because they marched , eventually city councils changed … and Congress changed and , yes , eventually the White House changed , ” Mr. Obama said to cheers . “ America changed for you and for me , and the entire world drew strength from that example . That ’ s the depth that I and millions of Americans owe those maids , those laborers , those porters , those secretaries — folks who could have run a company , maybe , if they had ever had a chance . ”
The president said the courage of those long-ago marchers is an example of how to achieve social goals today , as he gave a plug for his domestic agenda , including an increase of the minimum wage and his health care law .
“ With that courage , we can stand together for good jobs and just wages , ” Mr. Obama said . “ With that courage , we can stand together for the right to health care in the richest nation on earth for every person . ”
A series of speakers including Oprah Winfrey and Caroline Kennedy delivered a litany of liberal themes . Many invoked hot-button issues such as gun control , the shooting death of black teenager Trayvon Martin and the Supreme Court ’ s ruling on voting rights to call for a new era of civil rights activism .
Many of the invited speakers said civil rights in America are on the decline , and some invoked imagery of racial intimidation and the Jim Crow era as they issued calls for economic justice and equality .
The Rev . Al Sharpton said laws today are written differently than in the era of segregation , “ but the results are the same . ”
“ They come with laws that tell people to stand their ground , they come with laws that tell people to stop and frisk , but I come to tell you that just like our mothers and fathers beat Jim Crow , we will beat James Crow Jr. , Esquire , ” Mr. Sharpton said .
Melanie Campbell , CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation , said minorities have made progress over the past 50 years but added , “ We have not arrived . ”
“ Today , racism and inequality does not manifest itself in a white sheet , Jim Crow laws , poll taxes or barking dogs , ” she said . “ But the dogs are still biting in other ways . Today , there are no white sheets . But there are judges in black robes in the U.S. Supreme Court who struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act , opening the floodgates in many states to pass more voter ID laws to block people of color and young people from voting , with the goal of ensuring we never see another black man elected to the president , or woman , of the United States of America . ”
Mr. Carter , 88 , decried the state of minority rights in the U.S. today .
“ I think we all know how Dr. King would have reacted to the Supreme Court striking down a crucial part of the Voting Rights Act , ” he said . “ I think we know how Dr. King would have reacted to America being awash in guns . ”
Mr. Clinton noted that King urged the crowd in 1963 “ to reach across the racial divide . ”
“ And then he dreamed , about an America where all citizens would sit together at the table of brotherhood , ” Mr. Clinton said . “ This march , and that speech , changed America . They opened minds , they melted hearts , and they moved millions , including a 17-year-old boy watching alone at his home in Arkansas . What a debt we owe to those people who came here 50 years ago . ”
He also took a mild swipe at Mr. Obama and Congress when he said King would have wanted leaders today to “ stop complaining about political gridlock ” and put their shoulders to the job of compromise . “ Cooperate and thrive , or fight with each other and fall behind , ” he said .
Mr. Clinton also said King would be horrified at the state of affairs in the U.S. , especially regarding gun violence and voting rights .
“ A great democracy does not make it harder to vote than to buy an assault weapon , ” he said .
Marc Morial , president of the National Urban League , said advocates of civil rights are guilty of dozing in the struggle over the past 50 years .
“ Somewhere along the way , white sheets were traded for button-down white shirts , ” Mr. Morial said . “ Attack dogs and water hoses were traded for Tasers and widespread implementation of stop-and-frisk policies . Nooses were traded for handcuffs . It is time to wake up . ”
Few of the speakers at the podium mentioned Mr. Obama ’ s victories in 2008 or 2012 as the nation ’ s first black president . Rep. Marcia L. Fudge , Ohio Democrat and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus , did say there were only five black lawmakers in Congress in 1963 , compared with 44 today .
The president chided critics who argued that the civil rights gains of the past 50 years were insignificant .
“ To dismiss the magnitude of this progress , to suggest , as some sometimes do , that little has changed — that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years , ” Mr. Obama said . “ But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete . ”
Ms. Winfrey appeared to inadvertently step into the controversy over a quote on the nearby King memorial when she said of the late civil rights leader , “ He was , after all , a drum major for justice . ”
The memorial originally was inscribed with a quote from King that read : “ I was a drum major for justice , peace and righteousness. ” Critics said it was a paraphrase that made King sound egotistical , and the phrase was removed from the monument at great cost .
King said , “ Yes , if you want to say that I was a drum major , say that I was a drum major for justice . Say that I was a drum major for peace . I was a drum major for righteousness . And all of the other things will not matter . ”
Rep. John Lewis , a Georgia Democrat who spoke at the event in 1963 , recalled the joyous optimism of that rally and the greatness of King .
“ Not one incident of violence was reported that day , ” Mr. Lewis said . “ The spirit of Dr. King ’ s words captured the hearts of people , not just in America , but around the world . He changed us forever . Fifty years later , we can ride anywhere we want to ride , stay anywhere we want to stay . ”
But he said there are still “ invisible signs ” of racism .
King ’ s sister , Christine King Farris , 85 , said she was “ awestruck ” by her brother ’ s speech in 1963 .
“ On that day , Martin achieved greatness , ” she said , urging the crowd to carry forward his work . “ Yes , they can slay the dreamer , but no , they can not destroy his immortal dream . ”
She , too , spoke of Trayvon Martin and voting rights as rallying points for civil rights advocates .
Before Mr. Obama spoke , he and others near the podium watched as members of the King family rang the bell from the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham , Ala. , where four girls were killed in a bombing in September 1963 .","Standing on the spot where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. famously urged Americans not to judge one another by the color of their skin, President Obama said Wednesday that Americans must use the example of the civil rights marchers of 50 years ago to press for his brand of economic justice for the middle class.

“We must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks could join the ranks of millionaires,” Mr. Obama said on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. “It was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard, regardless of race, into the ranks of middle-class life.”

Reciting many of the same themes from his re-election bid and his budget battles with congressional Republicans, the president said the nation’s leaders must attack the problems of income inequality to live up to King’s dream of social justice.

“The position of all working Americans, regardless of color, has eroded, making the dream Dr. King described even more elusive,” Mr. Obama said. “Inequality has steadily risen over the decades.”

As the nation’s first black president, Mr. Obama capped a rainy day of rhetoric and music commemorating the 50th anniversary of King’s legendary “I Have a Dream” speech and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963.

Americans are increasingly pessimistic that progress is being made toward King’s goal of racial equality. A Pew Research Center poll this month found that only 26 percent of blacks believe conditions have improved for black Americans in the past five years. The same poll in 2009 said 39 percent of blacks felt conditions were improving.
