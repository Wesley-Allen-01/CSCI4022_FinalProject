“While I am willing to give Mr. Ratcliffe the benefit of the doubt in the hearing, I don’t see what has changed since last summer, when the President decided not to proceed with this nomination over concerns regarding his inexperience, partisanship, and past statements that seemed to embellish his record – including some particularly damaging remarks about whistleblowers, which has long been a bipartisan cause on our committee,” Sen.

Warner was referencing Ratcliffe’s circuitous route to the nomination.

“After questioning him in detail, I concluded that he does have the experience to meet the statutory standard to fill the position.

A Warner aide added that Warner intends to question Ratcliffe on the president’s purging of the intelligence community, as well as the need to preserve its independence to provide the best intelligence and analysis available to policymakers.

The hearing will reflect new safety precautions for the COVID-19 pandemic.

While Burr and Warner are likely to stay throughout the hearing, other senators are expected to enter in pairs to ask questions. Sen. John Cornyn John CornynSenate steps into 'strange' new era Senate GOP leaders skeptical of Trump's payroll tax cut Liberal group endorses Royce West for Texas Senate MORE (R-Texas) is slated to introduce the fellow Texan.

Ratcliffe first captured Trump’s attention when he fiercely grilled FBI officials, including special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerCNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump CNN anchor rips Trump over Stone while evoking Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting The Hill's 12:30 Report: New Hampshire fallout MORE, while sitting on the House Judiciary Committee.

He also defended Trump forcefully during the House’s impeachment hearings. That defense is likely to be the focal point among Democrats who are worried that Trump is politicizing the intelligence agency.

Democrats are also expected to raise Ratcliffe’s experience.

Ratcliffe has served on the House Intelligence Committee for one term, but he is likely to lean heavily on his experience as a U.S. attorney, where he served as the office’s chief of anti-terrorism and national security. According to a review of a document the Senate panel has as part of their vetting process, Ratcliffe worked on 34 national security and terrorism related investigative matters between 2005 and 2008.

Senators might have another reason to confirm Ratcliffe.

Trump earlier this year appointed Richard Grenell, his ambassador to Germany, to the DNI role in an acting capacity. Grenell did not have any intelligence experience prior to his appointment.

Grenell, an aggressive defender of the president who engages in Twitter spats with members of the media and critics, has shaken up and reorganized the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to the concern of both Democrats and Republicans who oversee intelligence matters.

Ratcliffe has sought to defend his record in the run-up to the hearing. He did two television appearances after his nomination to push back at arguments that he is unqualified and too political for the DNI position.

“I have been handling national security issues as far back as 2005,” Ratcliffe told CBS News in one interview in late February. “I have spent four years at the Justice Department in charge of sensitive matters of national security, anti-terrorism investigations. For the last five years I have been legislating almost exclusively on national security issues.”

He also successfully passed bipartisan cyber-focused bills during his time on the House Homeland Security Committee.

Ratcliffe has also faced criticism for statements that cast doubt on the credibility of the origins of the Russia investigation.

But since Ratcliffe’s criticisms, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded a sprawling investigation that found 17 “significant errors and omissions” by law enforcement officials in their efforts to obtain a wiretap on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Ratcliffe, who was one of the earlier GOP voices calling for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reform, is expected to point to these findings as he is pressed on his previous comments about bias and wrongdoing by some of the intelligence agencies that he would lead if confirmed.

coronavirus,Daily Mail,2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8269475/YouTube-accused-censorship-removing-videos-criticize-shutdowns.html,YouTube is accused of censorship after removing videos that criticize shutdowns,2020-04-29,Keith Griffith,"Elon Musk and a host of critics have slammed YouTube for removing a video of two doctors suggesting COVID-19 death tolls are being boosted and urging an end to lockdowns because they do more harm than good .
The site took down the video of news conference featuring Drs . Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi , who run a private urgent-care clinic in Bakersfield , California , on Monday because they claim it violated their user policy by disputing health officials .
But the move has been blasted as censorship and a worrying sign of big tech companies trying to control information during the pandemic and quashing free speech .
Social media giants Facebook and Twitter are also coming under increasing scrutiny for removing posts that they say contain health misinformation or calls to break stay-at-home orders .
The hour-long video with Drs Erickson and Massihi suggesting stay-at-home orders are damaging drew a massive audience , garnering more than five million views before it was removed .
Using testing stats from their urgent care centers , they argue that the mortality rate for coronavirus is minuscule and that lockdowns are disruptive to normal healthcare provision , the functioning of healthy immune systems and are devastating to the economy .
The doctors also share anecdotes , which they say come from colleagues in hospitals , claiming that there is pressure to add COVID-19 as a cause of death to unrelated fatalities to artificially boost the death toll .
'It 's time to open back up . The science says it is . The models we 've been using from predictions , to predict the amount of disease , are not accurate , ' Erikson said in the press conference .
Tesla CEO Musk , an increasingly outspoken critic of lockdowns , shared the video on Twitter before it was taken down , adding the comment , 'Docs make good points . '

'This . Is . Censorship . On what is arguably the most important media platform in the United States , ' tweeted Alex Berenson , a former New York Times reporter who has emerged as one of the strongest skeptics of the lockdowns .
In a blistering opening monologue on Tuesday night , Fox News host Tucker Carlson also railed against the 'ludicrous ' measures by big tech companies to control what they call misinformation during the pandemic .
'When this is all over , it 's likely we 'll look back on this moment , what YouTube just did , as a turning point in the way we live in this country , a sharp break with 250 years of law and custom , ' Carlson said .
'The doctors ' video was produced by a local television channel . It was , in fact a mainstream news story , ' Carlson continued . 'The only justification for taking it down was that the physicians on-screen had reached different conclusions than the people currently in charge . '
Last week , YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki told CNN that 'anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation of our policy . '
'Consider that for a moment , ' Carlson responded . 'As a matter of science , it 's ludicrous . Like everyone else involved in global pandemic policy , the WHO has been wrong in its recommendations . In January , WHO told us that coronavirus could not spread from person-to-person . In March , they told us that face masks did n't work . Those are lies and they were welcome on Google 's platforms . '
Former CNN producer Steve Krakauer said in his Fourth Watch media newsletter that this was an 'egregious censorship effort on the part of YouTube ' that should make all journalists concerned .
He added : 'YouTube can take down this video , of course . But should they ? Absolutely not .
'These doctors were n't calling for people to cough on other citizens . They were n't even questioning whether injecting disinfectant might be a good idea .
'They were using data to suggest a Sweden model of eased lockdown may be effective . That 's not damaging to the public to watch . '

It comes as the debate over reopening intensifies , with many states moving to ease restriction
Facebook is accused of 'colluding with state governments to quash free speech ' Facebook says it will consult with state governments on their lockdown orders and will shut down pages planning anti-quarantine protests if the tech giant determines the gatherings violate those rules . 'Unless government prohibits the event during this time , we allow it to be organized on Facebook . For this same reason , events that defy government ’ s guidance on social distancing aren ’ t allowed on Facebook , ' a spokesperson said on the social network 's policy . Facebook officials said they reached out to states individually to understand their lockdown orders then removed posts that violated those rules . 'We reached out to state officials to understand the scope of their orders , not about removing specific protests on Facebook . We remove the posts when gatherings do not follow the health parameters established by the government and are therefore unlawful , ' a company spokesperson said to DailyMail.com . The tech firm says it will allow protests that abide by social distancing guidelines to go forth , but will shut down the ones that defy those health orders . The social network said it has already removed protest messages in California , New Jersey and Nebraska . The move has led to outrage from Donald Trump Jr and Republican figures like Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley , who claim Facebook is violating Americans ' First Amendment rights .
In a statement to DailyMail.com , a YouTube spokesperson said : 'We quickly remove flagged content that violate our Community Guidelines , including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local healthy authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance . '
'However , content that provides sufficient educational , documentary , scientific or artistic ( EDSA ) context is allowed -- for example , news coverage of this interview with additional context , ' the statement continued .
'From the very beginning of the pandemic , we 've had clear policies against COVID-19 misinformation and are committed to continue providing timely and helpful information at this critical time , ' the company added .

They used that figure to extrapolate an estimate that millions in the state have already contracted the virus , and thus speculate that its mortality rate is much lower that believed .
The doctors speculate that coronavirus has a case fatality rate as low as 0.03 percent , or roughly one-third of the mortality rate of the common flu .
Experts point out that the coronavirus testing the doctors refer to was not random , and was administered mainly to people who had symptoms or believed that they had been exposed .
Randomized antibody testing in New York suggests a case fatality rate of 0.5 to 0.8 percent , or five to eight times higher than the flu .

Dr. Carl Bergstrom , a University of Washington biologist who specializes in infectious disease modeling , likened their extrapolations to 'estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court . '
'They 've used methods that are ludicrous to get results that are completely implausible , ' Bergstrom said .
In a rare statement late Monday , the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine declared they 'emphatically condemn the recent opinions released by Dr. Daniel Erickson and Dr. Artin Messihi . '
'These reckless and untested musings do not speak for medical societies and are inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding COVID-19 , ' the group continued .
'As owners of local urgent care clinics , it appears these two individuals are releasing biased , non-peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public 's health . '
The two doctors tout their support for President Donald Trump , leading some to accuse them of political motivation in their remarks .
Critics of the doctors also point out that non-coronavirus visits to urgent care clinics , such as they one that they own , are down sharply down in the shutdowns , suggesting they may have a financial motive for calling for the restrictions to end .
While criticism of YouTube for removing controversial videos has mostly come from political conservatives , the left has hammered the company for not removing videos fast enough .
Virginia Senator Mark Warner , a Democrat , blasted YouTube on Tuesday over videos promoting a conspiracy theory that accused a US Army reservist in Virginia of being the source of the outbreak in Wuhan , China .
Warner 's office reached out to YouTube on Monday asking why the company had n't taken down all the videos targeting the woman , CNN reported .
'It 's clear that the blanket grant of immunity for sites like YouTube has resulted in platforms that are too big and unresponsive to the harms they promote , ' Warner said , saying Congress need to act .
'Free America Now ' : Billionaire Elon Musk joins protesters demanding COVID-19 lockdowns be lifted
Billionaire Elon Musk has slammed coronavirus lockdown measures by tweeting 'Free America Now ' as he joined protesters from across the country in demanding restrictions be lifted .
The Tesla founder fired off a series of tweets late on Tuesday protesting against the current lockdown restrictions and applauded some states , like Texas , which are now restarting their economies .
Musk 's Twitter outburst came just as he was on the cusp of getting a $ 750 million payout from a bonus scheme that is linked to the electric car-maker 's share price .

Alongside a link to a Wall Street Journal op-ed about whether lockdowns are saving lives , Musk tweeted : 'Give people their freedom back ! '
He also tweeted a link to a story about Texas lifting some restrictions this week , saying : 'Bravo Texas ' .
Musk later clarified , in response to a tweet from one of his followers , that he believed states should be reopening slowly .
'Yes , reopen with care & appropriate protection , but do n't everyone under de facto house arrest , ' he tweeted .
Musk had earlier hit out at Silicon Valley , saying it had become 'Sanctimonious Valley ' and 'too much the moral arbiter of the world ' .

Alongside a link to a Wall Street Journal op-ed about whether lockdowns are saving lives , Musk tweeted : 'Give people their freedom back ! '
Stay-at-home orders issued by governors across the US and subsequent decisions to slowly reopen state economies have turned into highly charged political issues in recent weeks as the shutdowns have hammered the nation 's economy .
People in various states across the country have been protesting against lockdown restrictions .
Meanwhile , shares of Tesla surged 10 percent at the beginning of the week ahead of the release of the company 's quarterly earning report on Wednesday .
A stock slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic led to Tesla having to close its factory near San Francisco at the end of March and furlough workers .
The company originally said it would resume operations on May 4 , but Bay Area health officials on Monday extended shelter-in-place orders to the end of May .
Protesters gathered Tuesday near the North Carolina Legislative Building to protest the current stay-at-home orders issued by Gov . Roy Cooper
People in various states across the country have been protesting against lockdown restrictions . A rally in San Diego , California drew dozens of protesters on Sunday
This week 's stock rally put Tesla 's market capitalization at $ 145 billion . Importantly for Musk , its stock market value reached a six-month average of $ 96 billion .
Hitting a six-month average of $ 100 billion would trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock as part of his two-year-old pay package .
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $ 350.02 each . Taking Monday 's Tesla closing stock price of $ 798.75 as an example , Musk could sell those shares for a profit of $ 758 million .
Musk does not receive a salary or cash bonus - only options that vest based on Tesla 's market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth .","Elon Musk and a host of critics have slammed YouTube for removing a video of two doctors suggesting COVID-19 death tolls are being boosted and urging an end to lockdowns because they do more harm than good.

Warner's office reached out to YouTube on Monday asking why the company hadn't taken down all the videos targeting the woman, CNN reported.

'It's clear that the blanket grant of immunity for sites like YouTube has resulted in platforms that are too big and unresponsive to the harms they promote,' Warner said, saying Congress need to act.

'Free America Now': Billionaire Elon Musk joins protesters demanding COVID-19 lockdowns be lifted

Billionaire Elon Musk has slammed coronavirus lockdown measures by tweeting 'Free America Now' as he joined protesters from across the country in demanding restrictions be lifted.

The Tesla founder fired off a series of tweets late on Tuesday protesting against the current lockdown restrictions and applauded some states, like Texas, which are now restarting their economies.

Musk's Twitter outburst came just as he was on the cusp of getting a $750 million payout from a bonus scheme that is linked to the electric car-maker's share price.

'FREE AMERICA NOW,' the 48-year-old tweeted.

Billionaire Elon Musk has slammed coronavirus lockdown measures by tweeting 'Free America Now' as he joined protesters from across the country in demanding restrictions be lifted

Alongside a link to a Wall Street Journal op-ed about whether lockdowns are saving lives, Musk tweeted: 'Give people their freedom back!'

He also tweeted a link to a story about Texas lifting some restrictions this week, saying: 'Bravo Texas'.

Musk later clarified, in response to a tweet from one of his followers, that he believed states should be reopening slowly.

'Yes, reopen with care & appropriate protection, but don't everyone under de facto house arrest,' he tweeted.

Musk had earlier hit out at Silicon Valley, saying it had become 'Sanctimonious Valley' and 'too much the moral arbiter of the world'.

Musk also tweeted a link to a local news story about Texas lifting some restrictions this week, saying: 'Bravo Texas'

Alongside a link to a Wall Street Journal op-ed about whether lockdowns are saving lives, Musk tweeted: 'Give people their freedom back!'

Stay-at-home orders issued by governors across the US and subsequent decisions to slowly reopen state economies have turned into highly charged political issues in recent weeks as the shutdowns have hammered the nation's economy.

People in various states across the country have been protesting against lockdown restrictions.

Meanwhile, shares of Tesla surged 10 percent at the beginning of the week ahead of the release of the company's quarterly earning report on Wednesday.

A stock slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic led to Tesla having to close its factory near San Francisco at the end of March and furlough workers.

The company originally said it would resume operations on May 4, but Bay Area health officials on Monday extended shelter-in-place orders to the end of May.

Protesters gathered Tuesday near the North Carolina Legislative Building to protest the current stay-at-home orders issued by Gov. Roy Cooper

People in various states across the country have been protesting against lockdown restrictions. A rally in San Diego, California drew dozens of protesters on Sunday

This week's stock rally put Tesla's market capitalization at $145 billion. Importantly for Musk, its stock market value reached a six-month average of $96 billion.

Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion would trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock as part of his two-year-old pay package.

Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. Taking Monday's Tesla closing stock price of $798.75 as an example, Musk could sell those shares for a profit of $758 million.

Musk does not receive a salary or cash bonus - only options that vest based on Tesla's market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth.",www.dailymail.co.uk,right,AVtHkveaiUedvzg6

“ What in the hell are we doing , ” Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Tex . ) asked his colleagues at the lunch with White House officials , according to several participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the exchange . Cruz was incensed at the push among his colleagues to boost spending levels even more .
The whole process now appears likely to spill into August , something the White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to avoid , because it would mean more than 20 million Americans would lose emergency unemployment benefits when they expire at the end of this month . They have not mapped out a plan for what would happen to these people as the pandemic ’ s turmoil continues to weigh on the U.S. economy .
The White House did not go into the talks with a preset strategy or a list of proposals that they knew GOP lawmakers would rally behind . This miscalculation created immediate problems . Numerous demands the White House had tried to formulate over the weekend were erased within hours .
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that the goal was to keep the spending bill around $ 1 trillion , but by Tuesday he had abandoned that mantra . White House officials also backed away from demands for cuts to testing and health funds , and they retreated after a barrage of criticism of President Trump ’ s tax cut demand .
“ I think we ’ re going to spend what we need to spend , and we ’ re going to make sure we don ’ t spend more than that , ” Mnuchin said .
Democrats pointed fingers at the Republican infighting and said the White House and GOP leaders were unprepared to handle the country ’ s mounting economic and health care challenges . House Democrats passed a $ 3 trillion spending bill in May that would send another round of stimulus checks , provide more money to states , and help hospitals , among other things , but the White House has vowed to block it .
“ Republicans are in complete disarray , ” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) said . “ Totally incompetent . Totally in disarray . Totally at war with one another . ”
In an effort to bridge differences , Mnuchin , White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow met with Senate Republicans over lunch . But that led to little progress , as Republicans made clear to Mnuchin and Meadows that they were not supportive of Trump ’ s insistence on a payroll tax cut or curbed funding for coronavirus tests and the CDC . Mnuchin on Monday had insisted the payroll tax idea was in the bill , but he didn ’ t even bring it up during the lunch as the opposition snowballed , two people briefed on the interaction said .
“ We haven ’ t reached a conclusion on anything , ” Sen. John Neely Kennedy ( R-La . ) said when the lunch ended .
Meadows acknowledged the discontent , telling reporters , “ Well as you can imagine , any time you have Senate Republicans there , you have a number of different thoughts on what should or should not happen . ”
The White House and Senate Republican leaders had tried over the weekend to put together a joint deal to bring to Democrats , but those efforts did not lead to a unified GOP position . Talks bogged down over Trump ’ s insistence for the tax cut , something he has pushed since last year to force into law without any success . Some also bristled at Trump ’ s insistence for curbing coronavirus testing funds and a new requirement that aid to schools would be contingent on reopening plans .
Underlying the confusion surrounding the GOP stimulus package are tensions among Trump administration officials about their priorities .
Trump is being represented on Capitol Hill by Mnuchin and Meadows , a tandem that hasn ’ t brokered a deal jointly with Congress before . Trump has for months privately worried that Mnuchin , his chief negotiator with Democrats , was giving away too much to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) , leading conservative lawmakers to push for Meadows to have a more active role in the current round of talks . Before joining the White House , Meadows was a congressman and leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus . Mnuchin , meanwhile , has a background as a banker and a Hollywood producer with few ties to the conservative movement .
On Tuesday , Meadows sat toward the back of the room and deferred to Mnuchin as he led the conversation with the GOP senators , according to two people aware of the meeting granted anonymity to share private conversations . Mnuchin discussed the importance of sending another round of stimulus checks and providing more money for the Paycheck Protection Program .
Mnuchin also told reporters it was important for lawmakers to reach an agreement before the supplemental increase in unemployment benefits runs out by the end of this month . Republican lawmakers , including Trump , have consistently bashed that benefit increase because they believe it makes it more lucrative for workers to stay home than reenter the labor market , but Mnuchin stressed the importance of providing some financial cushion for the jobless .
“ Our objective is to try to get something done before the enhanced unemployment insurance expires . There ’ s a lot of people who are still out of work , ” Mnuchin said . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) told reporters , though , that it was very unlikely a deal would be reached by the end of next week , laughing and saying “ no ” when asked if that was possible .
Within hours on Tuesday , it became clear the White House was already backpedaling on several of their demands — before negotiations with Democrats had even begun . Mnuchin and Meadows met with Senate Republican appropriators in the morning and appeared convinced to reverse course on the funding curbs , as Republicans had sought $ 25 billion for states for testing and tracing that the administration had initially opposed .
“ We ’ re moving in the right direction on all fronts ... We are making good progress , ” said Sen. Roy Blunt ( R-Mo . ) , a senior Appropriations Committee member , when asked about the disagreement over money for testing .
Participants cautioned talks were ongoing and nothing had been finalized .
White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that the White House is seeking “ targeted ” money for testing , saying that “ we ’ re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense , not just dumping money into a pot that contains $ 10 billion . ”
Some experts said lawmakers should both approve more money and have the administration send it out more quickly .
“ States have been using some of this money , but the problem is that it ’ s not enough and easy for the states to draw down , ” said Sam Hammond , a policy expert at the Niskanen Center , a think tank that has been working with Senate Republicans on bolstering testing . “ The scale of the problem will require a lot more money than they have so far . ”
These programs are just one part of what the administration and McConnell had envisioned as a $ 1 trillion package that is likely to be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the election .
After attending the Senate Republican conference lunch the White House envoys met with Pelosi and Schumer .
“ We will begin our conversations today . It is my hope that we can resolve our differences and have a bill by the end of next week , ” Pelosi told fellow Democrats on a conference call Tuesday morning , according to a person on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations .
There has been little GOP enthusiasm for the payroll tax cut plan , even though Trump has said he might not sign a bill that doesn ’ t include it . And GOP leaders are expecting a hard sell Tuesday but appear unwavering . Only a small handful of Senate Republicans — including Sens . Lindsey O. Graham ( S.C. ) and Steve Daines ( Mont . ) have endorsed the payroll tax cut as a sound policy .
But multiple senators and aides said Mnuchin didn ’ t even talk about the payroll tax cut in the Senate GOP lunch . Instead he was confronted by multiple complaints about the size of the emerging package , with some lawmakers who had voted for the $ 2 trillion Cares Act in March saying they couldn ’ t support the new package if it exceeds $ 1 trillion .
Inside the lunch , GOP senators voiced discontent over several components of the emerging aid package , whether it involved provisions pushed by the administration and the apparent ballooning size of the plan , according to multiple officials directly familiar with the private gathering . All of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the closed-door discussion .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley ( R-Iowa ) argued against the payroll tax cut , making the case that no voters would notice the tax relief and that he was skeptical that the policy changes could even be implemented before October .
Though the payroll tax cut remains a top priority of Trump , his top lieutenants inside the meeting made little apparent effort to sell the policy on Republican senators , who largely remain opposed to the proposal .
Electoral politics were also in consideration . Sen. Tom Cotton ( R-Ark . ) urged other GOP senators to be attentive to what Republicans in competitive reelection bids are hearing on the ground from voters , and made the case that if the GOP loses the majority , Democrats in control will implement policies that are much more costly to the national debt . So spending a bit more money now in a rescue bill that would aid Republicans in their races would be cheaper in the long run , he argued . Cotton is also up for reelection this November but is not considered to be in a competitive race .
But Cotton ’ s viewpoint appeared to clash with that of Cruz , who vigorously warned against spending too much money over on the package .
Cruz said the GOP should be focused on a safe restart of the economy and warned that if the economy remains shuttered in November , that Democrats will win both the White House and the Senate and that Republican senators , who usually meet in the ornate Mansfield room in the Capitol , will “ be meeting in a much smaller lunch room . ”
Mnuchin , who met with Republican senators before he was to huddle with the Democratic leaders , stressed to the GOP lawmakers that he will not launch into negotiations this afternoon with Democrats and that he would be in more of a listening mode with them .
Earlier , McConnell gave some details of the emerging GOP plan Tuesday in remarks on the Senate floor .
He said it would include $ 105 billion to help schools reopen , another round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses , more stimulus checks to individual Americans , incentives for hiring and retaining workers , and reimbursement for businesses to establish safety measures .
“ The American job market needs another shot of adrenaline , ” McConnell said . “ Senate Republicans are laser-focused on getting American workers their jobs back . ”
Trump has already enacted four laws that provided close to $ 3 trillion in new tax cuts and spending to try to help the economy and health-care industry navigate the coronavirus pandemic . The economy remains really weak , however , with an unemployment rate of 11.1 percent and roughly 20 million people collecting unemployment benefits . Lawmakers are split over what to do next . When he was heading into a meeting with Senate appropriators , Meadows was asked about the highest price tag they could agree to .
“ Obviously everybody looks at a trillion-dollar stimulus plan as the goal , but that ’ s going to be up to the senators and the House , ” Meadows said . “ It ’ s going to be a Senate- and House-led process . ”
Mnuchin said he would be there to see the talks through , having been through numerous rounds of frantic negotiations in the past .","Other Republican lawmakers appeared mortified about the growing size of the spending bill, bickering over which policies to remove and warning that miscalculations could allow Democrats to seize control of the White House and Senate in November.

“Obviously everybody looks at a trillion-dollar stimulus plan as the goal, but that’s going to be up to the senators and the House,” Meadows said. “It’s going to be a Senate- and House-led process.”

The shuffle at the top of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has brought administration staffing back into the spotlight .

Overall , the turnover for the “ A ” team of Cabinet officials and other top appointees in the first three years of the Trump administration has been 82 % , according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution ’ s Kathryn Dunn Tenpas .

The administration ’ s filling of top positions has improved since the president ’ s first year in office , when many remained vacant for months .

coronavirus,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/04/coronavirus-response-sweden-avoids-isolation-economic-ruin/,Has Sweden Found the Right Solution to the Coronavirus?,2020-04-06,"John Fund, Joel Hay, Zachary Evans, Daniel Tenreiro, Dan Mclaughlin, Matthew Scully, Kyle Smith, John Hirschauer, David Harsanyi, Jim Geraghty","A street with less pedestrian traffic than usual as a result of the coronavirus outbreak in Stockholm , Sweden , April 1 , 2020 . ( TT News Agency/Fredrik Sandberg via Reuters )
Unlike other countries , it has so far avoided both isolation and economic ruin .
If the COVID-19 pandemic tails off in a few weeks , months before the alarmists claim it will , they will probably pivot immediately and pat themselves on the back for the brilliant social-distancing controls that they imposed on the world . They will claim that their heroic recommendations averted total calamity . Unfortunately , they will be wrong ; and Sweden , which has done almost no mandated social distancing , will probably prove them wrong .
Lots of people are rushing to discredit Sweden ’ s approach , which relies more on calibrated precautions and isolating only the most vulnerable than on imposing a full lockdown . While gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited and high schools and colleges are closed , Sweden has kept its borders open as well as its preschools , grade schools , bars , restaurants , parks , and shops .
President Trump has no use for Sweden ’ s nuanced approach . Last Wednesday , he smeared it in a spectacular fashion by saying he ’ d heard that Sweden “ gave it a shot , and they saw things that were really frightening , and they went immediately to shutting down the country. ” He and the public-health experts who told him this were wrong on both counts and would do better to question their approach . Johan Giesecke , Sweden ’ s former chief epidemiologist and now adviser to the Swedish Health Agency , says that other nations “ have taken political , unconsidered actions ” that are not justified by the facts .
In the rush to lock down nations and , as a result , crater their economies , no one has addressed this simple yet critical question : How do we know social-isolation controls actually work ? And even if they do work for some infectious epidemics , do they work for COVID-19 ? And even if they work for this novel coronavirus , do they have to be implemented by a certain point in the epidemic ? Or are they locking down the barn door after the horses are long gone ?
In theory , less physical interaction might slow the rate of new infections . But without a good understanding of how long COVID-19 viral particles survive in air , in water , and on contact surfaces , even that is speculative . Without reliable information on what proportion of the population has already been exposed and successfully fought off the coronavirus , it ’ s worth questioning the value of social-isolation controls . It is possible that the fastest and safest way to “ flatten the curve ” is to allow young people to mix normally while requiring only the frail and sick to remain isolated .
This is , in fact , the first time we have quarantined healthy people rather than quarantining the sick and vulnerable . As Fredrik Erixon , the director of the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels , wrote in The Spectator ( U.K. ) last week : “ The theory of lockdown , after all , is pretty niche , deeply illiberal — and , until now , untested . It ’ s not Sweden that ’ s conducting a mass experiment . It ’ s everyone else . ”
We ’ ve posed these simple questions to many highly trained infectious-disease doctors , epidemiologists , mathematical disease-modelers , and other smart , educated professionals . It turns out that , while you need proof beyond a reasonable doubt to convict a person of theft and throw them in jail , you don ’ t need any actual evidence ( much less proof ) to put millions of people into a highly invasive and burdensome lockdown with no end in sight and nothing to prevent the lockdown from being reimposed at the whim of public-health officials . Is this rational ?
When we asked what evidence is available to support the utility of quarantine and social isolation , academics point to the Diamond Princess cruise ship , with 700 COVID-19 passenger cases and eight deaths . But the ship is an artificially engineered , densely packed container of humans that bears little resemblance to living conditions in most countries .
The other major evidence academics often cite is the course run by the 1918 swine flu , which swept the globe 102 years ago and was not a coronavirus . Philadelphia did not practice social distancing during the 1918 pandemic , but St. Louis did and had a death rate lower than Philadelphia ’ s . But how is that relevant to today ’ s crisis ? Apart from the post hoc , ergo propter hoc nature of the argument , a key difference was that the GIs returning from World War I Europe who were carrying the swine-flu virus couldn ’ t fly nonstop from Paris to St. Louis . They had to land at East Coast ports such as Philadelphia . It ’ s therefore not surprising that the sick GIs rested and convalesced while spreading the virus on the East Coast , and they got better before continuing to St. Louis and other interior cities .
Basing the entire architecture of social distancing on the evidence from the 1918 swine flu makes no sense , especially when that architecture causes significant destruction in the lives and livelihoods of most of the American population .
But the social-isolation advocates frantically grasp at straws to support shutting down the world .

Unlike other countries, it has so far avoided both isolation and economic ruin.

If the COVID-19 pandemic tails off in a few weeks, months before the alarmists claim it will, they will probably pivot immediately and pat themselves on the back for the brilliant social-distancing controls that they imposed on the world. They will claim that their heroic recommendations averted total calamity. Unfortunately, they will be wrong; and Sweden, which has done almost no mandated social distancing, will probably prove them wrong.

Lots of people are rushing to discredit Sweden’s approach, which relies more on calibrated precautions and isolating only the most vulnerable than on imposing a full lockdown. While gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited and high schools and colleges are closed, Sweden has kept its borders open as well as its preschools, grade schools, bars, restaurants, parks, and shops.

President Trump has no use for Sweden’s nuanced approach. Last Wednesday, he smeared it in a spectacular fashion by saying he’d heard that Sweden “gave it a shot, and they saw things that were really frightening, and they went immediately to shutting down the country.” He and the public-health experts who told him this were wrong on both counts and would do better to question their approach. Johan Giesecke, Sweden’s former chief epidemiologist and now adviser to the Swedish Health Agency, says that other nations “have taken political, unconsidered actions” that are not justified by the facts.

In the rush to lock down nations and, as a result, crater their economies, no one has addressed this simple yet critical question: How do we know social-isolation controls actually work? And even if they do work for some infectious epidemics, do they work for COVID-19? And even if they work for this novel coronavirus, do they have to be implemented by a certain point in the epidemic? Or are they locking down the barn door after the horses are long gone?

In theory, less physical interaction might slow the rate of new infections. But without a good understanding of how long COVID-19 viral particles survive in air, in water, and on contact surfaces, even that is speculative. Without reliable information on what proportion of the population has already been exposed and successfully fought off the coronavirus, it’s worth questioning the value of social-isolation controls. It is possible that the fastest and safest way to “flatten the curve” is to allow young people to mix normally while requiring only the frail and sick to remain isolated.

This is, in fact, the first time we have quarantined healthy people rather than quarantining the sick and vulnerable. As Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels, wrote in The Spectator (U.K.) last week: “The theory of lockdown, after all, is pretty niche, deeply illiberal — and, until now, untested. It’s not Sweden that’s conducting a mass experiment. It’s everyone else.”

We’ve posed these simple questions to many highly trained infectious-disease doctors, epidemiologists, mathematical disease-modelers, and other smart, educated professionals. It turns out that, while you need proof beyond a reasonable doubt to convict a person of theft and throw them in jail, you don’t need any actual evidence (much less proof) to put millions of people into a highly invasive and burdensome lockdown with no end in sight and nothing to prevent the lockdown from being reimposed at the whim of public-health officials. Is this rational?

When we asked what evidence is available to support the utility of quarantine and social isolation, academics point to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, with 700 COVID-19 passenger cases and eight deaths. But the ship is an artificially engineered, densely packed container of humans that bears little resemblance to living conditions in most countries.

The other major evidence academics often cite is the course run by the 1918 swine flu, which swept the globe 102 years ago and was not a coronavirus. Philadelphia did not practice social distancing during the 1918 pandemic, but St. Louis did and had a death rate lower than Philadelphia’s. But how is that relevant to today’s crisis? Apart from the post hoc, ergo propter hoc nature of the argument, a key difference was that the GIs returning from World War I Europe who were carrying the swine-flu virus couldn’t fly nonstop from Paris to St. Louis. They had to land at East Coast ports such as Philadelphia. It’s therefore not surprising that the sick GIs rested and convalesced while spreading the virus on the East Coast, and they got better before continuing to St. Louis and other interior cities.

Basing the entire architecture of social distancing on the evidence from the 1918 swine flu makes no sense, especially when that architecture causes significant destruction in the lives and livelihoods of most of the American population.

But the social-isolation advocates frantically grasp at straws to support shutting down the world. It bothers them that there is one country in the world that hasn’t shut down and that hasn’t socially isolated its population. It bothers them because when this coronavirus epidemic is over, they would probably love to conclude that social isolation worked.

Sweden has courageously decided not to endorse a harsh quarantine, and consequently it hasn’t forced its residents into lockdown. “The strategy in Sweden is to focus on social distancing among the known risk groups, like the elderly. We try to use evidence-based measurements,” Emma Frans, a doctor in epidemiology at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, told Euronews. “We try to adjust everyday life. The Swedish plan is to implement measurements that you can practice for a long time.”

The problem with lockdowns is that “you tire the system out,” Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, told the Guardian. “You can’t keep a lockdown going for months — it’s impossible.” He told Britain’s Daily Mail: “We can’t kill all our services. And unemployed people are a great threat to public health. It’s a factor you need to think about.”

If social isolation worked, wouldn’t Sweden, a Nordic country of 10.1 million people, be seeing the number of COVID-19 cases skyrocket into the tens of thousands, blowing past the numbers in Italy or New York City? As of today, there are 401 reported COVID-19 deaths in Sweden.

The really good news is that in Sweden’s ICU census, which is updated every 30 minutes nationwide, admissions to every ICU in the country are flat or declining, and they have been for a week. As of this writing (based on currently available data), most of Sweden’s ICU cases today are elderly, and 77 percent have underlying conditions such as heart disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, and diabetes. Moreover, there hasn’t been a single pediatric ICU case or death in Sweden — so much for the benefits of shutting down schools everywhere else. There are only 25 COVID-19 ICU admissions among all Swedes under the age of 30.

Sweden is developing herd immunity by refusing to panic. By not requiring social isolation, Sweden’s young people spread the virus, mostly asymptomatically, as is supposed to happen in a normal flu season. They will generate protective antibodies that make it harder and harder for the Wuhan virus to reach and infect the frail and elderly who have serious underlying conditions. For perspective, the current COVID-19 death rate in Sweden (40 deaths per million of population) is substantially lower than the Swedish death rate in a normal flu season (in 2018, for instance, about 80 per million of population).

Compare that with the situation to Switzerland, a similar small European country, which has 8.5 million people. Switzerland is practicing strict social isolation. Yet Switzerland reports 715 cumulative Wuhan-virus deaths as of today, for a death rate nearly double the number in Sweden. What about Norway, another Nordic country that shares a 1,000-mile open border with Sweden, with a language and culture very similar to Sweden’s?

Nature’s got this one, folks. We’ve been coping with new viruses for untold generations.

As time passes, it will become clearer that social-isolation measures like those in Switzerland and Norway accomplish very little in terms of reducing fatalities or disease, though they crater local and national economies — increasing misery, pain, death, and disease from other causes as people’s lives are upended and futures are destroyed.

In a press conference Wednesday , President Donald Trump softened the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak , saying that the virus is “ a little bit like the flu . ”
“ We ’ ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner , ” he said , referring to efforts to develop a vaccine for the disease . According to experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci , who directs the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases , it ’ s still likely to be at least a year before a vaccine is ready for human use .
Trump also noted that far more Americans die from the flu each year than have been infected by the coronavirus thus far .
But experts say comparing COVID-19 to the flu understates what ’ s at stake .
“ It ’ s a confusing tone that the president set , ” said Lawrence Gostin , a professor Georgetown University who also directs the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law . He said the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have underscored the seriousness of the virus , but Trump ’ s comments appear “ to fluff it off as if it ’ s a common cold . ”
Nancy Messonnier , director for the CDC ’ s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , has warned that transmission of the virus in the U.S. is inevitable , that it is “ not so much a question of if , but when . ”
So far , there are millions of cases of the flu worldwide , compared to about 84,000 novel coronavirus cases , as of Friday afternoon . But public health officials warn that there is still a lot they don ’ t know about the new virus , including the various ways it ’ s transmitted , how pathogenic it might be , and how it could alter genetically .
That uncertainty creates an added urgency to containing the virus and , if those efforts fail , preparing for it to infect large swaths of the global population .
Here ’ s what we know now about the way these two infections compare , in terms of transmission , deadliness and scope .
Both the flu and COVID-19 are spread from person-to-person , transmitted through respiratory droplets that are formed when these people cough , sneeze or talk , according to the CDC . COVID-19 may also be transmitted when people touch surfaces that are infected , but this has not yet been confirmed .
“ We know these viruses can potentially survive on surfaces depending on the number of hours or days , ” said Dr. Brian Garibaldi , the director of the biocontainment unit at Johns Hopkins Medicine . “ We don ’ t know yet if it ’ s more likely that you ’ re going to get [ COVID-19 ] by coming into contact with droplets in the air . ”
Neither the flu nor COVID-19 can be treated with antibiotics .
Garibaldi added that the one way it may be useful to compare COVID-19 with the flu is when talking about prevention .
“ The method you can use to try to protect yourself from the flu is also going to help prevent you from getting the coronavirus , ” he said . Practicing good hygiene , by throwing out tissues , covering your cough and washing your hands , will help prevent the spread of both diseases .
Of the 83,652 COVID-19 cases confirmed thus far , there have been 2,858 deaths , according to the World Health Organization . A total of 2,791 of those deaths were within China . So far , 15 COVID-19 cases have been reported in the U.S. , with zero resulting deaths thus far . Another 47 Americans contracted the disease abroad and have been brought back to the U.S. to be quarantined .
By contrast , the CDC estimates that at least 18,000 people in the U.S. have died from the flu since October , and at least 32 million have been infected .
Globally , the flu kills hundreds of thousands of people annually . A 2017 study published in the Lancet , a leading medical journal , estimated that between 291,000 and 646,000 people die from seasonal-related respiratory illnesses each year .
Nevertheless , just because the flu is a more severe threat to Americans than COVID-19 right now doesn ’ t mean that the virus couldn ’ t grow to become just as , or more , deadly in the future . “ It ’ s precisely because the flu kills so many people that we should worry about coronavirus . We don ’ t want a mass-circulating virus that kills that many people , ” Gostin said .
Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch estimates that between 40 percent and 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 . Gostin said that these sorts of predictions are “ exactly why we need to take it seriously . ”
A recent study estimated that the mortality rate from COVID-19 is 2.3 percent , more than 20 times the death rate from the flu .
It should be noted that the vast majority of COVID-19 cases confirmed by China — 81 percent , as of Feb. 11 — are mild , meaning they did not involve pneumonia . Symptoms could be so mild that they are confused with the common cold , which is in the same family of viruses as COVID-19 .
Health officials caution that the fatality rate is dynamic and will likely change , particularly if more mild cases are confirmed , and as public health officials collect more data about cases in a growing number of countries .
“ There have got to be a lot of infections out there that are not detected , just because they are mild . If you add another 100,000 people , then the rate drops , ” said Gary Kobinger , the director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University .
In a briefing on Tuesday , Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization warned against reading too much into high fatality rates as the virus spreads to other countries . When asked about Iran , which recently reported an 11-percent mortality rate , Ryan said , “ We need to be very careful in the first wave of infections and any newly affected country because we may only be detecting severe cases and the deaths will be over-represented in that . ”
As researchers work to bolster our understanding of COVID-19 , that disease currently appears to be more deadly to the smaller swath of the population it has infected . In contrast , with so many more known annual infections , the mortality rate from the flu is about 0.1 percent annually .
To put the current COVID-19 estimates in context , the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic — one of the deadliest of all time — infected about 500 million people , and killed more than 2.5 percent of all those infected .
The fact that there is not yet a vaccine available for COVID-19 also makes the threat level different from that of the flu , at least for now .
Should the U.S. see transmission pockets start to form before a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed , Garibaldi said Americans could experience fatality rates that are just as severe as China ’ s .
“ The Chinese health system is fantastic — they have all the technology that we do , ” he said . “ There ’ s no reason to suspect that we ’ re going to do better than China if the mortality rate is 1-2 percent . ”","As novel coronavirus spreads around the world, some U.S. officials seem to be downplaying the potential global scope and severity of the disease by comparing it to a common illness — influenza.

Number of deaths

Of the 83,652 COVID-19 cases confirmed thus far, there have been 2,858 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. A total of 2,791 of those deaths were within China. So far, 15 COVID-19 cases have been reported in the U.S., with zero resulting deaths thus far.

Mortality rate

A recent study estimated that the mortality rate from COVID-19 is 2.3 percent, more than 20 times the death rate from the flu.

It should be noted that the vast majority of COVID-19 cases confirmed by China — 81 percent, as of Feb. 11 — are mild, meaning they did not involve pneumonia. Symptoms could be so mild that they are confused with the common cold, which is in the same family of viruses as COVID-19.

To put the current COVID-19 estimates in context, the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic — one of the deadliest of all time — infected about 500 million people, and killed more than 2.5 percent of all those infected.

The fact that there is not yet a vaccine available for COVID-19 also makes the threat level different from that of the flu, at least for now.

Should the U.S. see transmission pockets start to form before a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, Garibaldi said Americans could experience fatality rates that are just as severe as China’s.

What’s happening

The idea has also received significant pushback from scientists who argue it’s impossible to gauge how much risk participants are being subjected to because so much is unknown about the virus and how it behaves. There is also skepticism that the results of a challenge trial made up of young, healthy subjects could be applied to the broader population.

Others worry about the logistics of carrying out such trials, especially if several vaccines are tested at the same time. Some of those vaccines will inevitably fail, meaning all subjects will be put at risk without any protection. Challenge trials also face unique hurdles — like determining the correct form and amount of the virus to expose subjects to — that some experts say could make them take even longer than traditional methods.

What’s next

No challenge trials in the U.S. can be started without the approval of the Food and Drug Administration. A group of 35 lawmakers recently sent a letter to the FDA asking for the agency to acknowledge the urgency of the pandemic and allow future trials to go forward. With only a few vaccines in the early stages of human testing, it will likely be several months before any of them are ready for large-scale trials of any kind.

Opinion contributors

The resurgence of the coronavirus has thrust the pandemic back to the fore of our national consciousness. Living vs. making a living? A false dichotomy. We don’t believe that these values to be mutually exclusive. Both are possible, both necessary. And we need each other to figure out how to make both happen.

Political heresy? No.

The pandemic represents what folklore holds as the Chinese character for crisis: a “dangerous opportunity.” As supply-side economist Paul Romer first observed, “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.” The surface tension between maintaining both physical and fiscal health points to a deeper underlying crisis. It offers a path out of both the surface and the deep crisis.

What deep crisis? Prof. Daniel Dellaposta observed recently in the American Sociological Review, “The structure of U.S. opinion has shifted in ways suggesting troubling implications for proponents of political and social pluralism.” Only a threat of the complexity and magnitude of the pandemic is powerful enough to bring hereditary enemies, like us, together. One of us is the cofounder of MoveOn.org, the other the co-founder of TheCapitalistLeague.com.

I, Ralph, the conservative Republican, recognize my adversary Joan’s authentic compassion in holding that without a coordinated response, including government action, to flatten the curve she would have reasonable grounds to fear waves of infections that could overwhelm our medical personnel and capacity, intensifying both loss of life and economic devastation. This is a counsel of practical compassion. Not tyranny.

I, Joan, the progressive Democrat, recognize my adversary Ralph’s heartfelt concern that an overbearing, “one-size-fits-all,” quarantine can produce an unacceptable level of economic agony, especially among members of the working class. Not everyone has sufficient resources, nor is the government capable of indefinitely funding an economy many times larger than the resources it can responsibly command. This is a counsel of practical compassion. Not callousness.

Let's see each other as allies

Our survival appears at stake. Thus, to paraphrase a wise insight of second wave feminism: the political becomes personal. The political class now politically weaponizes everything. Democrats vilify Republicans as taking reckless life-and-death risks by premature openings. Republicans demonize Democrats for inflicting unwarranted and possibly catastrophic damage to our ability to subsist economically.

So let’s experiment with seeing one another as allies facing a mutual enemy, the novel coronavirus. Our respectively hated and feared political leaders really are not the primary enemy. (Yes, assuredly we will slug that out Nov.)

The primary enemy is the virus. It confronted (and confronts) our leaders, left and right, with huge unknowns. Of course, people are entitled to their political opinions. That said, common humanity calls for us to tone down the contempt. “Kill the ump” style heckling is better suited to baseball than it is to a truly mortal threat.

Physical and fiscal health are not antithetical. To get both will require greater trust and trustworthiness in government, in media, in our communities and in what Ben Franklin, during the Constitutional Convention, called “the virtue and spirit of the common people.” And, yes, trust in the good faith in our political opponents.

That the left and right disagree is neither novel nor interesting. The interesting thing is that we represent proof-of-concept that both sides can show respect for one another and are willing to work together against a common foe.

Pandemic isn't about politics

So, are we going to keep politically weaponizing the pandemic (as we have weaponized practically everything else)? We will remain passionate foes on many issues. The pandemic is fundamentally different. It is a common enemy and a mortal one.

There are judgment calls about priorities and what measures to take. That said, neither of us knows anyone who does not believe in the importance of protecting both lives and livelihoods. We must, and can, work together. American independence was predicated on the self-evident truth that foremost among our unalienable rights are both life and liberty. Governments are instituted to protect these rights. We demand both values be fully honored. This is not paradoxical.

We’ve gotten out of the habit of working together even where we agree. That is the deeper existential crisis the pandemic brings to light. That said, the pandemic is so epic that it compels cooperation. Knowing that we are on the “same team,” we can pull America out of the wreckage of lives and livelihood the pandemic has wrought.

Rediscovering that there are areas in which we can fruitfully cooperate, perhaps our cooperation in the face of the pandemic could transform the future of politics.

Javits Convention Center in Manhattan , which will be partially converted into a hospital for patients affected by the coronavirus outbreak , March 23 , 2020 . ( Mike Segar/Reuters )
Previously marginalized state and local governments have taken the lead in fighting the present pandemic .
Alexis de Tocqueville ’ s America was supposed to be long gone . Seeing political centralization as the great woe of the French state — which had been periodically wracked by violent instability since 1789 , and would be again in 1848 — the young French aristocrat found a possible cure in the highly decentralized system of Jackson-era American government . Political life , he wrote , was overwhelmingly concentrated at the local level , where town meetings still decided most matters of significance . Counties were administrative divisions that mostly existed on paper , state governors were kept on an extremely tight leash , and the federal government was still in its infancy , its powers strictly confined to a few undeniably national concerns .
Until several weeks ago , it was hard not to think that contemporary America had turned Tocqueville ’ s analysis completely on its head . Following the Civil War , the vast expansion of federal power that was deemed necessary to guarantee the rights of freed slaves against the states that had enslaved them , and to enforce Reconstruction while it lasted , famously ( though more gradually than some have implied ) accompanied a grammatical change in the way we describe the United States , from plural to singular : “ The United States are ” became “ the United States is. ” Early 20th century Progressives led the growth of a federal bureaucracy , which expanded with the New Deal and the Second World War until , by the end of the 1940s , it was common to speak of a federal “ administrative state , ” attached to the executive , ruling the country , unaccountable to voters .
All of this led inevitably to the moment just before the current crisis hit , in which national politics , blaring on TV screens and dominating social-media feeds , seemed to crowd out state and local politics . The newspapers that had reminded Americans of the importance of these closer , smaller realms declined and disappeared . Ticket-splitting , which could be considered an indicator of the strength of the Tocquevillian tradition , hit a new low in 2018 .
Intermittently , Beltway writers issued calls for others to abandon the swamps of Washington and rejuvenate local institutions and state politics , which served mainly to illustrate the desperation of the situation . All the major political issues — drug legalization , gay marriage , abortion — were either removed from state purview by Supreme Court fiat or seemed destined sooner or later to receive such a treatment . It appeared increasingly clear that the federal constitution was a pretty relic of the Tocquevillian era , prized mainly by nostalgists , serving a legitimating role in an order that no longer had any space for it , like the Roman Senate under the Empire .
Then a pandemic struck . The initial federal response was faltering , with test kits malfunctioning and the president downplaying the risk . So states — and , in many cases , local governments — came to the fore . California ’ s Bay Area issued the first “ shelter in place ” order , followed quickly by a similar order for the rest of the state . Governor Gavin Newsom has proclaimed California a “ nation-state. ” New York , which was next in line for lockdown , has seen its governor , Andrew Cuomo , emerge as a leading protagonist in the struggle to combat the virus . Cuomo ’ s bullying style , a nuisance in tranquil times , now soothes the frayed nerves of New Yorkers , in the latest demonstration of Machiavelli ’ s tenet that men ’ s characters fit some times better than others . Crucial , life-and-death matters were suddenly in the hands not of the federal government but of state and local authorities .
The public-health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus has proven that you can ’ t fudge federalism . It isn ’ t enough to set up formal federal bodies and give them constitutional powers ; sub-national units must have traditions of independence and popular sanction to actually use the powers they ’ ve been given . The viral pandemic has given the lie to systems in countries around the world that are federal on paper but unitary in fact .
Spain ’ s autonomous communities were supposed to have very extensive powers , including over decisions relating to public health — until , on March 14 , Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez ’ s government declared a state of emergency and announced that the central government in Madrid would be assuming control .
In Italy , decrees isolating first a handful of northern towns , then the region , and finally the entire country came at every stage from the central government . Regional presidents such as Lombardy ’ s Attilio Fontana , unable to put in place firmer measures themselves , were reduced to begging the central government to do so .
In the United Kingdom , devolved governments in Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland —governments that some thought were moving toward an ad hoc form of federalism until the pandemic — have had no opportunity to exert influence on the response to the virus . They have been forced , as have local councils across England , simply to implement the decisions made in No . 10 : first , a laissez-faire policy intended to build “ herd immunity , ” then , following predictions of mass death resulting from the strategy , an escalating about-face ending in nationwide lockdown on March 23 .
In Germany , it ’ s true , the states ( Länder ) took the lead , with Bavaria locking down two days before the rest of the country — but reports circulated that Angela Merkel was nervous at the prospect of divergent policies across the country . She quickly directed the federal government to retake control of the fight against the virus by banning gatherings of more than two people .
Only in Brazil , where president Jair Bolsonaro has refused to institute a nationwide lockdown , taking to national television to proclaim the coronavirus a “ tiny little flu ” and attack the World Health Organization for its “ destruction of jobs , ” have federal units had a real chance to step up . State governors in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo have led the response , introducing lockdown measures within their jurisdictions , and making themselves targets of the president in the process .
Of course , it can ’ t be said that the present resurgence of federalism in Brazil and the United States has happened under the best of circumstances . And it ’ s too soon to determine how a decentralized administration helped , or didn ’ t help , the response to the virus . But for now , it ’ s enough to take stock of how robust and relevant previously marginalized political institutions suddenly seem . They are a piece of the old constitution still with us , having showed signs of life at a moment when , across the world , many of their counterparts did not .","New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks to the media as U.S. Army personnel look at the Jacob K.

Until several weeks ago, it was hard not to think that contemporary America had turned Tocqueville’s analysis completely on its head. Following the Civil War, the vast expansion of federal power that was deemed necessary to guarantee the rights of freed slaves against the states that had enslaved them, and to enforce Reconstruction while it lasted, famously (though more gradually than some have implied) accompanied a grammatical change in the way we describe the United States, from plural to singular: “The United States are” became “the United States is.” Early 20th century Progressives led the growth of a federal bureaucracy, which expanded with the New Deal and the Second World War until, by the end of the 1940s, it was common to speak of a federal “administrative state,” attached to the executive, ruling the country, unaccountable to voters.

All of this led inevitably to the moment just before the current crisis hit, in which national politics, blaring on TV screens and dominating social-media feeds, seemed to crowd out state and local politics. The newspapers that had reminded Americans of the importance of these closer, smaller realms declined and disappeared. Ticket-splitting, which could be considered an indicator of the strength of the Tocquevillian tradition, hit a new low in 2018.

Intermittently, Beltway writers issued calls for others to abandon the swamps of Washington and rejuvenate local institutions and state politics, which served mainly to illustrate the desperation of the situation. All the major political issues — drug legalization, gay marriage, abortion — were either removed from state purview by Supreme Court fiat or seemed destined sooner or later to receive such a treatment. It appeared increasingly clear that the federal constitution was a pretty relic of the Tocquevillian era, prized mainly by nostalgists, serving a legitimating role in an order that no longer had any space for it, like the Roman Senate under the Empire.

Then a pandemic struck. The initial federal response was faltering, with test kits malfunctioning and the president downplaying the risk. So states — and, in many cases, local governments — came to the fore. California’s Bay Area issued the first “shelter in place” order, followed quickly by a similar order for the rest of the state. Governor Gavin Newsom has proclaimed California a “nation-state.” New York, which was next in line for lockdown, has seen its governor, Andrew Cuomo, emerge as a leading protagonist in the struggle to combat the virus. Cuomo’s bullying style, a nuisance in tranquil times, now soothes the frayed nerves of New Yorkers, in the latest demonstration of Machiavelli’s tenet that men’s characters fit some times better than others. Crucial, life-and-death matters were suddenly in the hands not of the federal government but of state and local authorities.

The public-health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus has proven that you can’t fudge federalism. It isn’t enough to set up formal federal bodies and give them constitutional powers; sub-national units must have traditions of independence and popular sanction to actually use the powers they’ve been given. The viral pandemic has given the lie to systems in countries around the world that are federal on paper but unitary in fact.

Spain’s autonomous communities were supposed to have very extensive powers, including over decisions relating to public health — until, on March 14, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s government declared a state of emergency and announced that the central government in Madrid would be assuming control.

In Italy, decrees isolating first a handful of northern towns, then the region, and finally the entire country came at every stage from the central government. Regional presidents such as Lombardy’s Attilio Fontana, unable to put in place firmer measures themselves, were reduced to begging the central government to do so.

In the United Kingdom, devolved governments in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland —governments that some thought were moving toward an ad hoc form of federalism until the pandemic — have had no opportunity to exert influence on the response to the virus. They have been forced, as have local councils across England, simply to implement the decisions made in No. 10: first, a laissez-faire policy intended to build “herd immunity,” then, following predictions of mass death resulting from the strategy, an escalating about-face ending in nationwide lockdown on March 23.

In Germany, it’s true, the states (Länder) took the lead, with Bavaria locking down two days before the rest of the country — but reports circulated that Angela Merkel was nervous at the prospect of divergent policies across the country. She quickly directed the federal government to retake control of the fight against the virus by banning gatherings of more than two people.

Only in Brazil, where president Jair Bolsonaro has refused to institute a nationwide lockdown, taking to national television to proclaim the coronavirus a “tiny little flu” and attack the World Health Organization for its “destruction of jobs,” have federal units had a real chance to step up. State governors in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo have led the response, introducing lockdown measures within their jurisdictions, and making themselves targets of the president in the process.

Of course, it can’t be said that the present resurgence of federalism in Brazil and the United States has happened under the best of circumstances. And it’s too soon to determine how a decentralized administration helped, or didn’t help, the response to the virus. But for now, it’s enough to take stock of how robust and relevant previously marginalized political institutions suddenly seem. They are a piece of the old constitution still with us, having showed signs of life at a moment when, across the world, many of their counterparts did not.",www.nationalreview.com,right,e1SptsNood4Ltuqu

“It’s the modern conceit that we can control the time and the hour of death,” Mr. Reno says. “People are anguished by the reality of death, and my heart goes out to the health care workers who must face it. But we as moderns, we believe we have the technological ability to simply send it away, which of course is an impossible task.”

A growing number of countries around the world, if they have not done so already, are discussing the possibility of responding to the growing coronavirus pandemic by going into “lockdown,” borrowing a metaphor from the prison system. But the question of how to treat actual prisoners amid the epidemic has mostly slipped from public focus.

Prisons are a humanitarian crisis in the making, given the way inmates often live almost on top of each other, making them highly susceptible to the virus’s spread. Their vulnerability has been highlighted by the infection of certain notorious inmates, including the sex offender Harvey Weinstein in a New York maximum security prison. In Britain, one infected prisoner has already died.

Prisoners have no choice but to rely on their confiners’ mercy. In some places, that mercy has been forthcoming—in others, not.

In democratic countries, such as the United States and those in Western Europe, many governments have already responded by liberating nonviolent and elderly inmates and deferring incarceration for those recently sentenced.

Last week Deborah Birx , the White House ’ s coronavirus-response coordinator , called rapid antigen tests the “ breakthrough innovation ” that is needed to perform hundreds of millions of such assays a day . The remarks echoed her previous statements that antigen tests might be used to examine broad swaths of the public .
The technique often involves a technology—called a lateral flow assay—similar to that employed in home pregnancy tests . In the test , an antibody can bind to one of the spike proteins ( the antigens ) that cover the surface of the virus like the spines on a puffer fish . The tests are inexpensive to produce and simple to use , and they deliver results in minutes .
The goal is also to field a test that is just as accurate as the current standard , which uses polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) to process the virus ’ s genetic material and amplify it for detection . But major technical hurdles still remain . “ What you would want in terms of a breakthrough is that [ an antigen ] test is more sensitive , [ or less prone to false negatives ] , and easier to use than a PCR-based test . And that is not so easy to do , ” says Bettina Fries , chief of the infectious diseases division at Stony Brook Medicine . “ Normally , PCR-based tests are more sensitive . ”
The urgent need to conduct massive levels of testing means that any feasible technology is being considered . OraSure Technologies , a medical device company in Bethlehem , Pa. , received a $ 710,310 federal contract last month for an in-home assay that can potentially detect a coronavirus antigen in saliva in as little as 20 minutes . Stephen Tang , the company ’ s CEO , says such antigen tests are needed to screen millions of people per day . “ You can ’ t be dependent on the throughput of laboratories and the availability of medical and laboratory professionals , ” as PCR assays typically require , to conduct widespread testing , he says .
Because a PCR test makes thousands of copies of its target RNA , it is able to detect a virus at far lower concentrations , called the limit of detection , than antigen tests typically can . PCR ’ s limits of detection “ are on the order of a few hundred virus particles in a milliliter of transport liquid , ” says Geoffrey Baird , acting chair of laboratory medicine at the University of Washington ’ s School of Medicine .
In contrast , the sensitivities of rapid antigen tests have been mixed . A 2016 analysis of 116 such tests for the bacteria that cause strep throat , for example , found they had a sensitivity of 86 percent on average—turning in false negative results for 14 percent of people with strep . Antigen tests used to diagnose viral infections such as the flu are even less sensitive , often reporting a negative result when the virus is actually present . Their specificity , or ability to correctly avoid false positive results , is often much higher . They can exceed 95 percent , meaning less than 5 percent of people without infection would test positive .
Birx had said that antigen tests could be used as first-pass screening tools that would be confirmed with follow-up PCR assays . Otto Yang , an infectious disease researcher at the University of California , Los Angeles , is uncertain if that goal can be achieved . “ Generally , when you ’ re doing it that way , you aim for higher sensitivity and less specificity in your screening test , ” he says . “ It only makes sense if you ’ re trying to save money or reagents , and you don ’ t have the capacity [ to do PCR ] . The only potential benefit would be cost savings , but the loss of sensitivity is a big problem. ” The approach would make sense , Yang adds , only if the first-pass screening test was at least as sensitive as PCR in addition to being cheaper .
His view will by no means close the debate on the validity of antigen testing . Lee Gehrke , a microbiologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-founded E25Bio , another company developing a coronavirus antigen assay , balks at comparisons of such tests ’ accuracy with that of PCR . “ The use of the test needs to be tailored to the setting , ” he says . “ In back-to-work , back-to-school settings , repeated , regular testing is going to be needed . If the testing is repeated , I believe the rapid [ antigen ] test will pick [ the virus ] up . ”
Gehrke acknowledges that infected individuals can have viral proteins present at levels below the test ’ s limit of detection in the first few days of infection . He says those levels will increase as the infection progresses , however . “ It ’ s possible that at the very left end of that bell curve , there ’ s a time that PCR can detect [ the virus ] but the rapid antigen test doesn ’ t , ” Gehrke says . But if the goal of testing is to get people back to work , he adds , a test that has “ less than perfect ” sensitivity will be acceptable if it is also inexpensive .
Yang counters that antigen tests could find a place as a diagnostic tool , yet the results they provide may be unable to serve as a much needed early warning signal . “ If your goal is to detect somebody that has a virus that may be more contagious [ with a greater volume of the pathogen ] , then maybe that does make sense , ” he says . But if the objective of a periodic antigen test is to detect people early in infection , “ there will be less virus , and so sensitivity will be a big issue . ”
The acute need for this type of testing , however , will continue to provide momentum to this line of research . “ Rapid tests are going to miss people who are sick , but they are still very valuable , because they take just a few minutes to test somebody , ” says Gigi Gronvall , an immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security . “ If we ’ re able to scale up PCR , that will give you a more accurate , sensitive result . But there is some value at the point of care to having a screen like this . ”
Ultimately , these debates may be put to rest in a few years . “ Getting testing broadly is clearly something that we need to contain the epidemic . But all of this is a stopgap , ” says Karla Satchell , a microbiologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine . “ What we really need is a vaccine . ”","An inexpensive coronavirus test that millions of Americans could use at a pharmacy, in a workplace or even at home could prove to be a vital asset in allowing people to return to jobs and school.

coronavirus,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-massie-bill-coronavirus,Trump signs $2T coronavirus stimulus bill after House passes historic response,,Marisa Schultz,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox . Sign up here .
President Trump on Friday signed a more than $ 2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak ’ s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day .
`` I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first , '' Trump said during an afternoon Oval Office signing ceremony .
Trump marveled at the magnitude of the aid package as he penned his name on the legislation : `` I 've never signed anything with a 'T ' on it , '' Trump quipped of the trillions of dollars of new spending .
The legislation , approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker ’ s objections , amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history . It includes checks for most Americans , boosted unemployment aid , help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations – at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace , a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines .
“ This bill is not only a rescue package , it is a commitment ... that your government and the people whom you elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face , both now and in the foreseeable future , ” House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , said prior to the vote . `` To the American public : If you do your part , I promise we will do ours . ''
The approval , while widely anticipated , followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote .
Rep. Thomas Massie , R-Ky. , had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel . Massie , as part of his push , wanted to ensure there is a quorum , which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill .
So as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding , hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York , California and elsewhere . This , despite strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers not to congregate at the Capitol and to stay in their offices until needed to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers .
“ Massie has now become the most hated person on Capitol Hill , '' said Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y. , who left his home at 4:30 a.m. to drive to the Capitol to ensure the measure got passed Friday .
While Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote , he was not , in the end , able to force a roll-call .
The House , after several hours of debate , ultimately passed the measure by voice vote , and it was allowed to stand .

President Trump on Friday signed a more than $2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak’s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day.

""I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,"" Trump said during an afternoon Oval Office signing ceremony.

Trump marveled at the magnitude of the aid package as he penned his name on the legislation: ""I've never signed anything with a 'T' on it,"" Trump quipped of the trillions of dollars of new spending.

The legislation, approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker’s objections, amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history. It includes checks for most Americans, boosted unemployment aid, help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations – at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace, a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines.

CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW

“This bill is not only a rescue package, it is a commitment...that your government and the people whom you elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said prior to the vote. ""To the American public: If you do your part, I promise we will do ours.""

The approval, while widely anticipated, followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote.

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel. Massie, as part of his push, wanted to ensure there is a quorum, which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill.

So as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding, hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York, California and elsewhere. This, despite strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers not to congregate at the Capitol and to stay in their offices until needed to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers.

“Massie has now become the most hated person on Capitol Hill,"" said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who left his home at 4:30 a.m. to drive to the Capitol to ensure the measure got passed Friday.

While Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote, he was not, in the end, able to force a roll-call.

The House, after several hours of debate, ultimately passed the measure by voice vote, and it was allowed to stand.

There were loud cries for ‘ayes’ and few rumblings of ‘nos’ on the House floor.

“The ayes have it,” declared the presiding officer, Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md.

But Massie stood up and objected. “I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote,” Massie said.

Brown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote. But Massie pressed on.

“I object on the basis that a quorum is not present,” Massie said, instructing a count of lawmakers.

“A quorum is present and the motion is adopted,” Brown ruled, to applause.

Minutes before the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort.

Pelosi touted the aid forthcoming for Americans and small businesses, while acknowledging that more needs to be done for state and local governments and the frontline healthcare workers. She paid homage to a nurse manager, Kious Kelly, who died from coronavirus after serving at a New York City hospital that had to resort to using plastic garbage bags as gowns.

“We know that this cannot be our final bill,” Pelosi said.

In a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill, lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill's imperfections.

“We're going to help Americans through this,"" McCarthy said. ""We're going to do this together and in the end, we are going to be healthier, stronger and more united than ever before, because as Americans, that's who we are.”

Upon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote, though, Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations.

""It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY. Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,"" he tweeted.

After the voice vote, Massie accused Pelosi and McCarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications.

""There's a big cover up in there,"" Massie said as he exited the Capitol.

Emotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $2 trillion stimulus bill.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen’s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don’t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment.

She ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to the income inequality gap in order for families to get “crumbs.”

“What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!” Ocasio-Cortez said.

On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said he’s “distressed by the Hobson’s choice"" lawmakers face of having to accept unrelated spending sprees in order to send relief.

“No more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated. No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention,” Perry said.

In a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama, Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor, even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time.

Instead, Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands – clad with pink surgical gloves—in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut.

As the presiding officer was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens “out of order,” Stevens screamed, “do not be afraid!”

Republicans, who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep’s seat in November, immediately pounced on the outburst as a “meltdown.”

The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains.

The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child.

Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis.

There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.

Schweikert, however, argued Congress must “do the right thing” by passing the legislation.

However, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he opposed the legislation over cost and debt concerns.

""As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,"" Buck said.

Mnuchin disputed that characterization and said the terms of the lending programs had been negotiated with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.

The treasury secretary also said the government is willing to take some risks in financing the emergency loans.

""We are fully prepared to take losses in certain scenarios,"" Mnuchin said.

Powell reiterated his view that Congress may have to authorize additional relief spending to keep families, businesses and cash-strapped state and local governments afloat until the virus is under control.

""What Congress has done to date has been remarkably timely and forceful,"" the Fed chairman said. ""I do think we need to take a step back and ask, over time, is it enough? And we need to be prepared to act further.""

In addition to the Fed's lending programs, the government has made hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans to small businesses, which can be forgiven so long as most of the money is used for payroll. Mnuchin said he's eager to work with lawmakers to give borrowers in that program more flexibility.",www.npr.org,center,BgaQ1gKSgAinHIW6

RADDATZ : And — and as for the origins of COVID-19 , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a statement this week saying the virus did originate in China , but concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified , the statement going on to say that they will continue to examine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident in a laboratory in Wuhan . Later , the president was asked if he had seen anything that gave him high confidence that the Wuhan lab was the origin of the virus . Let ’ s listen .

Partial transcript as follows:

RADDATZ: I want to turn to China, with intelligence officials, as we mentioned, saying that the Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of COVID-19 from the international community in early January, while it stockpiled medical supplies.

In terms of international concealing, I assume you think they did that intentionally to keep as many masks for themselves as possible. Will there be some sort of retaliation?

POMPEO: Martha, you’ve got the facts just about right. We can confirm that the Chinese Communist Party did all that it could to make sure that the world didn’t learn in a timely fashion about what was taking place.

There’s lots of evidence of that. Some of it you can see in public, right?

We’ve seen announcements. We’ve seen the fact that they kicked the journalists out. We saw the fact that those who were trying to report on this, medical professionals inside of China, were silenced. They shut down reporting — all the kind of things that authoritarian regimes do, the way Communist parties operate. This is a classic Communist disinformation effort. That created enormous risk, and now you can see hundreds of thousands of people around the world, tens of thousands in the United States, have been harmed. President Trump has been very clear. We’re going to hold those responsible accountable, and we’ll do so on a timeline that is our own.

RADDATZ: And — and as for the origins of COVID-19, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a statement this week saying the virus did originate in China, but concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified, the statement going on to say that they will continue to examine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident in a laboratory in Wuhan. Later, the president was asked if he had seen anything that gave him high confidence that the Wuhan lab was the origin of the virus. Let’s listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

QUESTION: Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?

TRUMP: Yes, I have. Yes, I have.

QUESTION: What gives you a high degree of confidence that this originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

TRUMP: I can’t tell you that. I’m not allowed to tell you that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RADDATZ: And, Mr. Secretary, have you seen anything that gives you high confidence that it originated in that Wuhan lab?

POMPEO: Martha, there’s enormous evidence that that’s where this began. We’ve said from the beginning that this was a virus that originated in Wuhan, China. We took a lot of grief for that from the outset. But I think the whole world can see now.

Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

RADDATZ: Do you believe it was man-made or genetically modified?

POMPEO: Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point.

RADDATZ: Your — your Office of the DNI says the consensus, the scientific consensus was not man-made or genetically modified.

POMPEO: That’s right. I agree with that. Yeah. I’ve seen their analysis. I’ve seen the summary that you saw that was released publicly. I have no reason to doubt that that is accurate…

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: OK, so just to be clear, you do not think it was man-made or genetically modified?

POMPEO: I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they’ve got it wrong.

(CROSSTALK)

POMPEO: Martha, you have to put this in context. Here’s what — here’s what’s important, Martha. Here’s what’s important. The Chinese Communist Party had the opportunity to prevent all of the calamity that has befallen the world. And here we find ourselves today — you and I were talking about we haven’t seen each other physically for a long time. That’s true of people all across the world.

This — this is an enormous crisis, created by the fact that the Chinese Communist Party reverted to form, reverted to the kinds of disinformation, the kinds of concealment that authoritarian regimes. Had those scientists been operating in America, they would have put this out. There would have been an exchange of ideas. And we would have quickly identified the kinds of things that needed to be done in response.

Instead, China behaved like authoritarian regimes do, attempted to conceal and hide and confuse. It employed the World Health Organization as a tool to do the same. These are the kind of things that have now presented this enormous crisis, an enormous loss of life and tremendous economic cost, all across the globe. The Australians agree with that. You hear the Europeans beginning to say the same thing. I think the whole world is united in understanding that China brought this virus to the world.

RADDATZ: And — and, just very quickly, if we can, Mr. Secretary, running out of time. Do you think they intentionally released that virus or it was an accident in the lab?

POMPEO: You know, I don’t have anything to say about that. I think there’s a lot to know. But I can say this. We’ve done our best to try and answer all of those questions. We tried to get a team in there. The World Health Organization tried to get a team in there. And they have failed. No one’s been allowed to go to this lab or any of the other laboratories — there are many labs inside of China, Martha. This risk remains. This is an ongoing challenge. We still need to get in there. We still don’t have the virus samples we need. This is an ongoing threat, an ongoing pandemic. And the Chinese Communist Party continues to block access to the Western world, the world’s best scientists, to figure out exactly what happened. So I can’t answer your question about that.

A return to school will also ensure children are getting fed each day and will have a more routine schedule to their daily lives, which children thrive best on.

Contact school board members and administrators, voicing your concerns on your child's insufficient education for the past three months. Our children need you as their advocate in their education. Other countries around the world have sent children back to school successfully and we can too. To do otherwise, will be a black mark on our children's educational future, setting them years behind. We must not let that happen.

What Life Is Like for Millions of Americans Facing Financial Ruin Because of the Pandemic,,,"On the same day that Elon Musk , the famously eccentric CEO of the electric-car company Tesla , saw his net worth hit $ 36.6 billion , Maricela Betancourt , one of the many people who work in his factories , was agonizing over her family ’ s bills . Betancourt , 58 , had been a janitor at Tesla ’ s Fremont , Calif. , factory until April 7 , when the company told her and 129 fellow janitors to go home and not come back until social-distancing measures were lifted . She got her last paycheck on April 8 and has no idea when the next one ’ s coming . She owes $ 1,325 for an emergency–room visit in March , and is struggling to pay for rent , Internet and food . Her husband , a construction worker , also lost his job during the COVID-19 economic collapse . So did their son Daniel , 20 , who is the first in their family to go to college and was helping to pay his way with a job at an arcade . The family put their stimulus funds toward Daniel ’ s tuition and prays something will come through before June rent is due .
Betancourt ’ s boss , meanwhile , might as well live in another stratosphere . While she relied on a food bank to supplement family dinner and Daniel turned to gig work for extra -income , Musk publicly mused that he ’ s considering selling all of his possessions because they “ just weigh you down. ” Tesla ’ s stock price rose so steeply this year ( 28 % ) that on May 1 , Musk tweeted that it was too high , sending the share price tumbling 10 % . It ’ s still more than triple what it was a year ago .
Maricela Betancourt , 58 , Janitor , San Jose , Calif. After decades of cleaning houses , Betancourt wanted a job with benefits , so she started working at Tesla . But her health insurance hadn ’ t kicked in when severe abdominal pain brought her to the ER , and then Tesla sent the janitors home without pay . The hospital bill keeps rising as her family struggles to pay it and other bills . Mark Mahaney for TIME
“ It ’ s obviously a millionaire company that has enough resources to thrive , ” Betancourt told me from her home in San Jose , Calif. “ But as workers , we live paycheck to paycheck , and now we don ’ t even have that paycheck , so we don ’ t know what we ’ re going to do. ” ( Tesla did not reply to a request for comment . )
The growing gap between America ’ s rich and everyone else is hardly new . But the extra-ordinarily rapid economic collapse catalyzed by COVID-19 has made the chasm deeper and wider , with edges that keep crumbling under the feet of those crowded on the edge . Since mid-March , more than 30 million people have filed for -unemployment—more than three times as many as lost their jobs during the two-year-long Great Recession . Meanwhile , after a steep but brief dip in March , the stock market rallied . The richest and most well–connected are seeing their wealth reaccumulate , as if by magic , while middle- and working–class families drown in debt that deepens with every passing week .

For now , though , he ’ s home , trying to teach his 4-year-old son letters and numbers while his wife works as a patient-care associate at a hospital . “ Every day when I wake up , I ask God to shield her , ” he says .

The contrast isn ’ t just between low-wage workers and billionaire bosses . Bills are mounting for small restaurants and retailers as their applications for the federal Paycheck Protection Program go unanswered . But firms like Hallador Energy , an Indiana coal company that hired former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt as a lobbyist , raked in millions from the program . While the median home price rose 8 % in March , families across the country began -receiving eviction notices , even in states with eviction moratoriums . Small retailers closed to comply with social–distancing orders while e-commerce sales , especially from the biggest online platforms , have spiked . –Amazon reported a 26 % jump in revenue in the first quarter .
Assistance is most readily available to those with lawyers and lobbyists on the payroll . Companies like Carnival and Boeing borrowed billions thanks to intervention from the Federal Reserve . In mid-April , Carnival ’ s CEO told CNBC the company could survive the rest of 2020 without any revenue . Meanwhile , Cindy Kimbler , a -cashier in Columbus , Ohio , filed for bankruptcy after a collection agency began garnishing her wages over a payday loan she ’ d taken out to fix the car she needed to get to work .

This yawning inequality will darken the coming years . The U.S. is the world ’ s largest economy , and so long as the majority of Americans are stumbling through a tunnel with no end in sight , its trading partners will suffer too . It ’ s not an exaggeration to say that inequality has the potential to undermine democratic society and threaten global stability .
The rapid shutdown of consumer–facing businesses makes this downturn unique . When cheaper foreign labor lured manufacturing jobs overseas , the U.S. became a service economy . In March and early April , as the novel coronavirus began killing Americans , shops and businesses closed overnight . Millions of workers—-waitresses and nannies and hotel clerks and line cooks—were instantly out of work .

Kim Jaemim , 58 , Taxi Driver , Manhattan . As business has plummeted , so has the civility of the customers who enter Kim ’ s cab . “ We face a lot of crazy , racist people , ” says the South Korean driver ( bottom far right ) . “ The yellow-cab driver is an essential employee , but I don ’ t think the city respects us like doctors and nurses , the police , the subway workers .

I haven ’ t heard back so I started working again . '' Andre D.Wagner for TIME
College-educated employees who can work remotely have , so far , largely been spared , still drawing paychecks and watching their savings grow as they cancel vacations and dinners out and complain about how boring it is to stay at home . One analysis of unemployment–insurance claims in California found that nearly 37 % of workers with just a high school diploma have filed for benefits since March 15 , compared with less than 6 % of those with a bachelor ’ s degree .
That may change , of course . No group is safe in a recession of this magnitude . Yelp , Gap and Lyft each cut more than 1,000 corporate employees , and millions more have been furloughed or seen their pay reduced . But college-educated workers are more likely to have a cushion : they experienced wage gains since 2000 that passed those who make less . Only about 1 in 4 adults in lower-income households say they have enough money to cover expenses for three months in the case of an emergency , according to an April survey by Pew . For upper–income households , the number is 3 in 4 .
Tanisha Robinson , 41 , Nanny , Alpharetta , GA. After losing her job as a nanny in March , Robinson could no longer afford health insurance , so she ’ s been rationing her lupus and anxiety medications .

While the ups and downs of the American economy have long been most destructive to the poor and middle class , this downturn is even more targeted : it is singularly affecting those who can least afford it . During the Great Recession , while pain was widespread across industries , many service workers kept their jobs as consumers decided a dinner out or a haircut were small luxuries they could afford . This time , the majority of people laid off are working–class and disproportionately women and people of color , who had been living paycheck to paycheck , their expenses rising while their wages stagnated . One lost job or missed rent payment threatens to tip them into an economic abyss .
Much of the country teeters behind them . The number of new COVID-19 cases shows no sign of receding , and consumers and businesses remain nervous about returning to the way things were . In the world of finance and business , nothing is less welcome than uncertainty . As the crisis lengthens and consumers continue to delay purchases , more businesses will fail , creating more unemployment and further diminishing consumer demand .

The safety net—already a dubious -patchwork—grows more tattered . In normal times , not quite a third of workers who have lost jobs receive jobless benefits . In April and May , thousands waited weeks to get through to unemployment offices , sometimes only to be told they weren ’ t eligible . Then there is the added expense of health care . About 12.7 million Americans have likely lost employer–provided health insurance since the pandemic began , according to the Economic Policy Institute , adding to the 27.5 million who didn ’ t have it before this crisis .
Tanisha Robinson , 41 , could not afford health insurance after losing her job as a nanny in Alpharetta , Ga. , in mid-March . As her savings dwindled , Robinson turned to what has become the fallback for many : asking strangers on the Internet for help . A $ 25 donation from a new Twitter friend paid for groceries ; funds from another Twitter user , coupled with Robinson ’ s stimulus payment , covered April rent . As May approached , she was again out of money . “ I literally have to choose which medications are most important and which I can get by without taking , ” she told me recently . One of the drugs to treat her lupus , hydroxychloroquine , has gotten harder to find since President Donald Trump touted it as a potential treatment for COVID-19 .

The wealthy have never faced these impossible choices , but as more Americans do , the U.S. economy comes to resemble a game of chutes and ladders , where the richest are steadily climbing ever higher while workers without stable jobs , incomes or savings are sent plummeting downward . It will be more difficult than ever for them to catch up or to even stay in the game , given their disadvantages going in .
After dipping in early March , the stock market has nearly returned to where it was in December , allowing the wealthiest tenth of Americans , who own 84 % of all stocks , to breathe a sigh of relief . The 10 % also had reasons to cheer the CARES Act , which Congress passed on March 27 with a tweak to the tax code that primarily benefits hedge-fund investors and owners of real estate businesses . Banks handling the government ’ s $ 349 billion small–business loan program collected more than $ 10 billion in fees , according to NPR .
The Betancourts , meanwhile , worry that if their son can ’ t keep paying his college tuition , he ’ ll lose his chance at a degree and be bumped back into the same economic category as his parents . America is still known to immigrants as the land of opportunity . But among experts who study its economy , it has become the land of income inequality . Epochal changes that lifted billions out of poverty—-globalization , -technology—also served to concentrate wealth in the hands of a few . Meanwhile , the U.S. has decided over time to allow a greater share of money to stay in private hands , and to collect less for the common good .

When adjusted for inflation , the wages of workers in the bottom tenth of the U.S. economy have risen just 3 % since 2000 , while those in the top tenth have risen 15.7 % , according to the Pew Research Center . This stagnation , aggravated by the decline in labor unions , is driven by a rise in jobs without guaranteed hours , benefits or even pay . Retail and food-service workers get called in only if customers show up . The pandemic has reduced most of their hours to zero . Across the economy , a growing number of workers—from truck drivers to researchers at Google—are independent contractors without the stability and protections of full-time employees . The same is true in the gig economy . Drivers for apps like Instacart , Uber , Lyft and Amazon Flex don ’ t know if they ’ ll make minimum wage on any given day after expenses . And yet , economic desperation drives more people to gig work , diluting the opportunities for all .
There ’ s no reason to believe that the conditions that led us here will change on their own . Already , more companies are talking about replacing workers with machines . And recessions are not good for workers ’ leverage . With millions of people now desperate for any income at all , companies can offer less and demand more .
Christina Thomason 39 , and son Logan , Tecumseh , Okla. “ You can ’ t tell people to stay home and not care for them . I ’ m watching everything we worked for being flushed down the toilet . How are we going to come back from this ? ” she says . September Dawn Bottoms for TIME
Can things be different ? Fairer ? It may well be that the country emerges as a more generous place , buoyed by the communal spirit that brings New Yorkers to their windows every evening at 7 , to cheer and bang pots in praise of those risking their lives to save others . It ’ s no less possible that in the year or more it takes to create the vaccine that will allow a return to routine daily life , the virus will become one more corrosive element in public life , and we return to business as usual .
Democratic policymakers have floated ideas like expanding Medicaid , forgiving student loans or canceling rent , and making it easier to unionize . But it ’ s not yet possible to discern how much the world will be changed by COVID-19 .
Already there are signs it ’ s gotten scarier for workers to stick their necks out . In March , Amazon fired a worker who helped organize a warehouse strike . The company said the worker had violated social–distancing guidelines . In times of great economic insecurity , pundits often wonder why there aren ’ t widespread revolts . Where are the pitchforks , the ramparts ? But it ’ s not that people do not feel the rage of injustice . It ’ s that they ’ re too busy fighting to keep a roof over their heads .

There’s no reason to believe that the conditions that led us here will change on their own. Already, more companies are talking about replacing workers with machines. And recessions are not good for workers’ leverage. With millions of people now desperate for any income at all, companies can offer less and demand more.

Can things be different? Fairer? It may well be that the country emerges as a more generous place, buoyed by the communal spirit that brings New Yorkers to their windows every evening at 7, to cheer and bang pots in praise of those risking their lives to save others. It’s no less possible that in the year or more it takes to create the vaccine that will allow a return to routine daily life, the virus will become one more corrosive element in public life, and we return to business as usual.

Democratic policymakers have floated ideas like expanding Medicaid, forgiving student loans or canceling rent, and making it easier to unionize. But it’s not yet possible to discern how much the world will be changed by COVID-19.

Already there are signs it’s gotten scarier for workers to stick their necks out. In March, Amazon fired a worker who helped organize a warehouse strike. The company said the worker had violated social–distancing guidelines. In times of great economic insecurity, pundits often wonder why there aren’t widespread revolts. Where are the pitchforks, the ramparts? But it’s not that people do not feel the rage of injustice. It’s that they’re too busy fighting to keep a roof over their heads.

coronavirus,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51409801,Li Wenliang: Coronavirus death of Wuhan doctor sparks anger,,,"The death of a Chinese doctor who tried to warn about the coronavirus outbreak has sparked widespread public anger and grief in China .
Li Wenliang died after contracting the virus while treating patients in Wuhan .
Last December he sent a message to fellow medics warning of a virus he thought looked like Sars - another deadly coronavirus .
But he was told by police to `` stop making false comments '' and was investigated for `` spreading rumours '' .
`` I do n't think he was rumour-mongering . Has n't this turned into reality now ? '' his father , Li Shuying , told the BBC . `` My son was wonderful . ''
According to Chinese site Pear Video , Dr Li 's wife is due to give birth in June .
The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever , followed by a dry cough .
Most of those killed have been over the age of 60 or have suffered from other medical conditions , China 's health authorities say . Dr Li 's medical history is not known .
The country 's anti-corruption body said it would open an investigation into `` issues involving Dr Li '' .
China 's leadership had already faced accusations of downplaying the severity of the virus - and initially trying to keep it secret .
The government has admitted `` shortcomings and deficiencies '' in its response to the virus , which has now killed 636 people and infected 31,198 in mainland China .
Analysts say it is hard to recall an event in recent years that has triggered as much online grief , rage and mistrust against the Chinese government .
News of Dr Li 's death became the top trending topic on Chinese social media , garnering an estimated 1.5bn views .
His death has also brought demands for action , with `` Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang an apology '' and `` We want freedom of speech '' among the hashtags trending .
Both hashtags were quickly censored . When the BBC searched Weibo early on Friday , hundreds of thousands of comments had been wiped . Only a handful remain .
`` This is not the death of a whistleblower . This is the death of a hero , '' read one comment .
A photo circulating on Twitter reportedly sourced from messaging platform WeChat showed a message in Chinese saying `` Farewell Li Wenliang '' written in the snow on a riverbank .
Many have taken to posting under the hashtag `` Can you manage , do you understand ? '' - a reference to the letter Dr Li was told to sign when he was accused of disturbing `` social order '' .
BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell says Beijing 's efforts to manage the coronavirus outbreak have laid bare the worst aspects of China 's command and control system of governance under President Xi Jinping .
The Chinese people will take some convincing that the government knows how to manage such an emergency , he adds .
The number of new cases of the coronavirus has fallen for the past two days .
Official Chinese figures released on Wednesday reported nearly 3,900 newly confirmed cases . The latest figures show just over 3,100 .
But it is dangerous to read too much into two days ' worth of data .
It is impossible to say if cases are really levelling off , or if this is a sign of health authorities being unable to keep up with testing - or if cases will shoot up again in the next few days .
Realistically , it is going to take another week or so before we have a clear picture of whether the outbreak is peaking .
And there is still a massive mismatch between the figures released by China and what outbreak analysts think is really going on .
It is widely accepted that the laboratory-confirmed cases are just the tip of the iceberg .
Some mathematic models of the outbreak suggest the true size of the epidemic could be 10 times higher than the official figures .
Dr Li , an ophthalmologist , posted his story on Weibo from a hospital bed a month after sending out his initial warning .
He had noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like Sars - the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003 .
On 30 December he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection .
Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter .
In the letter he was accused of `` making false comments '' that had `` severely disturbed the social order '' . Local authorities later apologised to Dr Li .
In his Weibo post he describes how on 10 January he started coughing , the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital . He was diagnosed with the coronavirus on 30 January .
Some 61 people onboard a cruise ship off the coast of Japan have tested positive for coronavirus . There are 3,700 people on board the vessel , which began testing people after an 80-year-old who had previously been on the ship tested positive for the virus
Uganda 's health ministry has placed more than 100 people in quarantine as a preventative measure against the possible spread of coronavirus
A third person in the UK has tested positive for the virus , and is believed to have caught it in Singapore
Singapore has raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition ( Dorscon ) level from yellow to orange . This means that the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person but has not spread widely and is being contained
Equatorial Guinea 's president has said the oil-rich country will donate $ 2m ( £1.5m ) to aid its `` sister nation '' China . This is despite the fact that China boasts the world 's second-biggest economy
The head of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said officials were facing a `` chronic shortage of personal protective equipment '' such as masks and gowns . Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he would work to resolve `` bottlenecks '' in the supply chain
Chinese President Xi Jinping has told his US counterpart Donald Trump that China is `` fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic '' . The country has introduced more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak :
The capital Beijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays . Cities including Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day
Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside .

China's leadership had already faced accusations of downplaying the severity of the virus - and initially trying to keep it secret.

The government has admitted ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in its response to the virus, which has now killed 636 people and infected 31,198 in mainland China.

What has the public reaction been?

Analysts say it is hard to recall an event in recent years that has triggered as much online grief, rage and mistrust against the Chinese government.

News of Dr Li's death became the top trending topic on Chinese social media, garnering an estimated 1.5bn views.

His death has also brought demands for action, with ""Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech"" among the hashtags trending.

Both hashtags were quickly censored. When the BBC searched Weibo early on Friday, hundreds of thousands of comments had been wiped. Only a handful remain.

""This is not the death of a whistleblower. This is the death of a hero,"" read one comment.

A photo circulating on Twitter reportedly sourced from messaging platform WeChat showed a message in Chinese saying ""Farewell Li Wenliang"" written in the snow on a riverbank.

Many have taken to posting under the hashtag ""Can you manage, do you understand?"" - a reference to the letter Dr Li was told to sign when he was accused of disturbing ""social order"".

BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell says Beijing's efforts to manage the coronavirus outbreak have laid bare the worst aspects of China's command and control system of governance under President Xi Jinping.

The Chinese people will take some convincing that the government knows how to manage such an emergency, he adds.

The beginning of the end?

The number of new cases of the coronavirus has fallen for the past two days.

Official Chinese figures released on Wednesday reported nearly 3,900 newly confirmed cases. The latest figures show just over 3,100.

But it is dangerous to read too much into two days' worth of data.

It is impossible to say if cases are really levelling off, or if this is a sign of health authorities being unable to keep up with testing - or if cases will shoot up again in the next few days.

Realistically, it is going to take another week or so before we have a clear picture of whether the outbreak is peaking.

And there is still a massive mismatch between the figures released by China and what outbreak analysts think is really going on.

It is widely accepted that the laboratory-confirmed cases are just the tip of the iceberg.

Some mathematic models of the outbreak suggest the true size of the epidemic could be 10 times higher than the official figures.

What did Li Wenliang do?

Dr Li, an ophthalmologist, posted his story on Weibo from a hospital bed a month after sending out his initial warning.

He had noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like Sars - the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003.

On 30 December he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection.

Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter.

In the letter he was accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order"". Local authorities later apologised to Dr Li.

In his Weibo post he describes how on 10 January he started coughing, the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital. He was diagnosed with the coronavirus on 30 January.

What is the latest on the coronavirus?

Some 61 people onboard a cruise ship off the coast of Japan have tested positive for coronavirus. There are 3,700 people on board the vessel, which began testing people after an 80-year-old who had previously been on the ship tested positive for the virus

Uganda's health ministry has placed more than 100 people in quarantine as a preventative measure against the possible spread of coronavirus

A third person in the UK has tested positive for the virus, and is believed to have caught it in Singapore

Singapore has raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) level from yellow to orange. This means that the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person but has not spread widely and is being contained

Equatorial Guinea's president has said the oil-rich country will donate $2m (£1.5m) to aid its ""sister nation"" China. This is despite the fact that China boasts the world's second-biggest economy

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said officials were facing a ""chronic shortage of personal protective equipment"" such as masks and gowns. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he would work to resolve ""bottlenecks"" in the supply chain

Chinese President Xi Jinping has told his US counterpart Donald Trump that China is ""fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic"". The country has introduced more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak:

The capital Beijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays. Cities including Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day

Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside.

The virus has now spread to more than 25 countries, but only two of the deaths have been outside mainland China.

Administration officials have said they want a deal by the end of the month, to line up with the soon-to-expire federal increase in unemployment benefits. The Senate is scheduled to leave town on Aug. 7, giving negotiators more flexibility.

There are several divisions not just among Republicans and Democrats but GOP senators and the White House over key policy proposals lawmakers are debating including in the next coronavirus bill.

So what are the differences between coronavirus and the flu ? For starters , there is no vaccine for COVID-19 and it could take many months or years to get one to market , and , unlike the influenza viruses for which there are several vaccines , humans have not built up an immunity over multiple generations . What ’ s worse , doctors fear the virus will mutate .
The first known person was reported to have contracted the virus on Dec. 1 in China . Today , it ’ s spread to approximately 130 countries or territories . Experts advise changing your behavior to limit its spread . Public officials in New York have said people should avoid taking mass transit , if possible . Italy has effectively quarantined its entire population . Israel , among other countries , has closed its land borders .
Of course , there are similarities between influenza and COVID-19 . Both viruses are untreatable with antibiotics , and they have almost identical symptoms — fever , coughing , night sweats , aching bones , tiredness and , in more severe cases of both viruses , nausea and even diarrhea . They can be spread by touching your face , coughing and sneezing .
But doctors say their differences are just as varied . “ It ’ s a little simple to think the novel coronavirus is just like flu , ” Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security and a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America , told ███ .
“ We don ’ t want another flu , ” he said . “ This is additive , not in place of . Yes , the flu kills thousands of people every year , but we ’ re going to have more deaths . ”
Dispatches from the front lines of a pandemic : ‘ The lack of an all-island response has also rattled communities on both sides of the Irish border. ’ Pubs close due to coronavirus , government issues new strict rules for funerals
There are reported to be some 1 billion influenza infections worldwide each year , with up to 45 million cases in the U.S. per year , tens of thousands of U.S. deaths , and 291,000 to 646,000 deaths worldwide .
Seasonal flu has a fatality rate of less than 1 % . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on Capitol Hill , estimates that the fatality rate of flu is closer to 0.1 % . But even accounting for the mild , yet undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 , he said Wednesday , it would still make it “ roughly 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu . ”
Another reason not to compare the two viruses : Influenza has likely been around for more than 2,000 years . Scientists say the “ novel influenza A viruses ” in humans lead to a pandemic approximately once every 40 years . But , again , flu vaccines exist . “ The flu has been with us since the birth of modern medicine , ” said Adalja .
“ Flu has likely been around for 2,000 years . This coronavirus is three months old and , as yet , there is no vaccine . ”
Hippocrates of Kos , the Greek physician who was born around 460 BC , mentioned what we now know as the modern influenza virus in his writings , some historians say . He called it the “ Fever of Perinthus. ” Others wonder whether this was flu , another illness , or a combination of illnesses .
“ In 1173 and 1500 , two other influenza outbreaks were described , though in scant detail . The name ‘ influenza ’ originated in the 15th century in Italy , from an epidemic attributed to the ‘ influence of the stars , ’ ” which , according to historical documents , “ raged across Europe and perhaps in Asia and Africa , ” a 2016 paper in the Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene reported .
“ Scholars and historians debate whether influenza was already present in the New World or whether it was carried by contaminated pigs transported on ships , ” it added . “ Some Aztec texts speak of a ’ pestilential catarrh ’ outbreak in 1450-1456 in an area now corresponding to Mexico , but these manuscripts are difficult to interpret correctly and this hypothesis seems controversial . ”
What has all this got to do with COVID-19 ? There is an advantage to coming down with a virus that has been around for hundreds , if not a couple of thousand , years . Humans , ideally , will have built up more natural defenses to fight it .
Complicating matters : influenza and COVID-19 come from different virus families , and COVID-19 is brand new . “ There are four other strains of the coronavirus , but the attack rate of this virus is relatively high as there is no immunity to it , ” Adalja said .
Dispatches from the front lines of a pandemic : As coronavirus cases rise in Switzerland , residents keep wary eye on Italy ’ s worsening situation next door
To put that in perspective : In 2017–18 , the worst flu season on record in the U.S. outside of a pandemic , approximately 80,000 Americans died . The four other coronavirus strains that already exist are responsible for around 25 % of our common colds , Adalja added .
“ But it doesn ’ t seem like there is cross-immunity with this coronavirus as there are with the other coronaviruses , ” he added . In other words , the natural defense systems in our body that help us ward off flu are unlikely to apply here .
Luis Ostrosky , a member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America , said humans have a “ herd immunity ” to flu . “ When there are enough people in the community who are immune it protects people who are not immune. ” That is the case with flu , but not with COVID-19 . Ostrosky said this is especially critical when no vaccines or therapeutic treatments for a virus .
“ Both can be spread from person to person through droplets in the air from an infected person coughing , sneezing or talking , ” Lisa Maragakis , senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore , wrote . Based on the estimated distance viruses travel , scientists recommend “ social distancing ” of at least six feet in enclosed public spaces .
In the meantime , the virus continues to spread , likely helped by people who have mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic .
As of Tuesday afternoon , there were 190,140 confirmed cases globally and 7,519 deaths , according to data the latest rally from the database of Johns Hopkins University ’ s Center for Systems Science and Engineering ; the database also reported 80,648 recoveries . The U.S. has had at least 5,218 confirmed coronavirus cases and 94 deaths .
Neither the flu nor COVID-19 viruses is treatable with antibiotics , and the two illnesses have roughly identical symptoms . ███ photo illustration/iStockphoto
While estimates of coronavirus fatality rates vary , they remain far higher than those for the flu . COVID-19 has a fatality rate of 3.4 % , WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said earlier this month . That ’ s more than previous estimates of between 1.4 % and 2 % , although some observers say his analysis was a blunt interpretation of incomplete data , and were probably skewed by a higher death rate in China .
COVID-19 rates may fall closer to those of the flu , assuming many more people are infected . JAMA recently released this paper analyzing data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China last month , the largest such sample of this kind . The sample ’ s overall case-fatality rate was 2.3 % , in line with the earlier estimates .
“ ‘ As coronavirus spreads it threatens to put a much greater burden on health systems than flu does. ’ ” — Antigone Barton , ScienceSpeaks
Fatality rates also varied dramatically depending on the age of the individual . No deaths occurred in those 9 and younger , but cases in those aged 70 to 79 carried an 8 % fatality rate , and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14.8 % . The rate was 49 % among critical cases , and elevated among those with pre-existing conditions , to between 5.6 % and 10.3 % , depending on the condition .
Other differences between coronavirus and flu lie in what we don ’ t know . Adults with the flu , which has an average incubation period of two days , can infect others 24 hours before symptoms develop and 5 to 7 days after becoming sick . Novel coronavirus has a median incubation period of 5.1 days , longer than that other human coronaviruses ( 3 days ) that cause the common cold .
The agency said the number of cases outside China has increased tenfold and the number of countries affected has tripled . “ We expect to see the number of cases , the number of deaths and the number of affected countries climb even higher . WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock , ” Tedros told reporters . “ And we ’ re deeply concerned . Most by the alarming levels of spread and severity . And by the alarming levels of inaction . ”
Coronavirus appears to be transmitted with ease to around 2.3 people by each person infected in the community , said Antigone Barton , editor of ScienceSpeaks , a medical website . Drug companies and the medical community , she said , are scrambling to come up with a vaccine before more people die , and health services are overwhelmed with sick people showing up at their doors .
The potential demand for hospital beds , ventilators , masks and medications , and the pressure all of this would put on staff worries her . “ Because there ’ s no proven therapy or vaccine ; as coronavirus spreads , ” Barton said , “ it threatens to put a much greater burden on health systems than flu does , and greater than most or many are prepared for . ”","Coronavirus. It’s just like the flu, isn’t it?

In the meantime, the virus continues to spread, likely helped by people who have mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic.

As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 190,140 confirmed cases globally and 7,519 deaths, according to data the latest rally from the database of Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering; the database also reported 80,648 recoveries. The U.S. has had at least 5,218 confirmed coronavirus cases and 94 deaths.

While estimates of coronavirus fatality rates vary, they remain far higher than those for the flu. COVID-19 has a fatality rate of 3.4%, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said earlier this month. That’s more than previous estimates of between 1.4% and 2%, although some observers say his analysis was a blunt interpretation of incomplete data, and were probably skewed by a higher death rate in China.

COVID-19 rates may fall closer to those of the flu, assuming many more people are infected. JAMA recently released this paper analyzing data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China last month, the largest such sample of this kind. The sample’s overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, in line with the earlier estimates.

“ ‘As coronavirus spreads it threatens to put a much greater burden on health systems than flu does.’ ” — Antigone Barton, ScienceSpeaks

Fatality rates also varied dramatically depending on the age of the individual. No deaths occurred in those 9 and younger, but cases in those aged 70 to 79 carried an 8% fatality rate, and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14.8%. The rate was 49% among critical cases, and elevated among those with pre-existing conditions, to between 5.6% and 10.3%, depending on the condition.

Other differences between coronavirus and flu lie in what we don’t know. Adults with the flu, which has an average incubation period of two days, can infect others 24 hours before symptoms develop and 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Novel coronavirus has a median incubation period of 5.1 days, longer than that other human coronaviruses (3 days) that cause the common cold.

The agency said the number of cases outside China has increased tenfold and the number of countries affected has tripled. “We expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths and the number of affected countries climb even higher. WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock,” Tedros told reporters. “And we’re deeply concerned. Most by the alarming levels of spread and severity. And by the alarming levels of inaction.”

Coronavirus appears to be transmitted with ease to around 2.3 people by each person infected in the community, said Antigone Barton, editor of ScienceSpeaks, a medical website. Drug companies and the medical community, she said, are scrambling to come up with a vaccine before more people die, and health services are overwhelmed with sick people showing up at their doors.

The potential demand for hospital beds, ventilators, masks and medications, and the pressure all of this would put on staff worries her. “Because there’s no proven therapy or vaccine; as coronavirus spreads,” Barton said, “it threatens to put a much greater burden on health systems than flu does, and greater than most or many are prepared for.”

“What is the point of visiting mosques at a time when the virus is spreading so fast?” he said.

FIRST WAVE NOT OVERCOME

In Turkey, the top medical association said the easing of restrictions on June 1 had come too soon, although the daily death toll as fallen in recent weeks to about 20.

“There is talk of when the second wave will hit, but we have not yet been able to overcome the first wave,” Cavit Isik Yavuz, part of the coronavirus research team at the Turkish Medics Association said.

While new infections are slowing in most of Europe, health experts see a moderate to high risk that post-lockdown rises may warrant new restrictions.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) predicted a moderate acceleration across Europe in coming weeks, which could place healthcare systems under stress if not checked rapidly. Government control measures could check and reverse upward trends within two to three weeks, it said.

Andrea Ammon, director of the ECDC, stressed the importance of maintaining physical distancing, hand hygiene and what she called “respiratory etiquette”.

Officials have expressed concern the virus could spread among the tens of thousands who have crowded together in Europe’s big cities to demonstrate against racism after the death in U.S. police custody of George Floyd.

“Mass events could be a major route of transmission,” said Martin Seychell, a health official at the EU Commission.

SOLIDARITY CALL

World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said late on Thursday that the threat of a resurgence remained very real.

“We must also remember that, although the situation is improving here in Europe, globally it’s getting worse ... We will continue to need global solidarity to defeat this pandemic fully,” he said.

Of 5,347 new deaths recorded worldwide, 3,681 were in the Americas, the WHO said on Thursday.

In about half a dozen U.S. states including Texas and Arizona, the number of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds is rising, fanning concerns that the reopening of the U.S. economy may unleash a second wave of infections. Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon and Nebraska all had a record number of new cases on Thursday.

“I want the reopening to be successful,” Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top executive for the county that encompasses Houston, Texas, told reporters. “But I’m growing increasingly concerned that we may be approaching the precipice of a disaster.”

More hospitalisations inevitably mean more deaths ahead, said Spencer Fox, research associate at the University of Texas at Austin.

“We are starting to see very worrying signs about the course the pandemic is taking in cities and states in the U.S. and around the world,” he said. “When you start seeing those signs, you need to act fairly quickly.”

Wall Street’s main indexes opened sharply higher on Friday, a day after the biggest one-day dive in about three months on fears of a resurgence in infections. Global stocks .MIWD00000PUS were up 1.3% after four days of consecutive losses.

The United States has now recorded more than 113,000 coronavirus deaths, by far the most in the world. That figure could be over 200,000 by September, Ashish Jha, the head of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, told CNN.",www.reuters.com,center,bgJRbnN12bRX7ASk

President Donald Trump has been defending his handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States and has now introduced travel restrictions on European countries.

We've fact-checked some of the president's recent claims.

Claim 1

""The US has done a very good job on testing. When people need a test they can get a test.""

In early March, the White House conceded that the United States did not have enough testing kits. Some health centres have also reported difficulties using them. The government says more than one million have now been distributed, with more on the way.

But the US has carried out far fewer tests than other countries - 26 per million people between 3 January and 11 March compared with South Korea's 4,000. The UK has carried out 400 tests per million and Italy 1,000 as of 10 March. Health experts fear the virus may have spread undetected in US communities because few tests were carried out.

Claim 2

""We made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe.""

President Trump has often cited travel restrictions as the reason the number of coronavirus cases is relatively low in the US and says many lives have been saved. On 31 January, any foreign national who had been to China within the previous 14 days was barred from entering the US. Three major US airlines operating flights to China had already stopped flying.

Later in February, restrictions were placed on foreign nationals who had been in Iran - which was already under a travel ban - in the previous 14 days. Non-US citizens from 26 European countries were then banned from entering the US. Later, this was extended to include the UK and Ireland.

US citizens and their families are largely exempt from all these restrictions. Experts believe the US action bought the government time to prepare and reduced the number of cases, but we don't know whether it saved lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said travel restrictions can be harmful ""by hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains and harming economies"".

Claim 3

When asked about WHO data on the virus's death rate: ""I think the 3.4% is really a false number... Personally, I think the number is way under 1%.""

In a telephone interview on Fox News, President Trump said a WHO figure of 3.4% for the coronavirus death rate was ""false"". WHO reported this figure on 3 March and said it was based on all the confirmed coronavirus cases that had resulted in death.

Mr Trump said he thought the true death rate, based on ""my hunch"", was ""way under 1%"". He said the death rate appeared higher because many people who caught a mild form of the virus did not report it to the doctor and therefore did not end up as confirmed cases.

At the moment we don't know how likely you are to die from coronavirus, mainly because of the lack of data on infections. However, scientists' current best guess is about 1%.

Claim 4

On 9 March: ""Last year 37,000 Americans died from the common flu. Nothing is shut down, life and the economy go on... Think about that.""

This statement from the president requires context. We don't know exactly how many Americans' deaths there have been linked to flu. But estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) give a range between 26,339 and 52,664 flu deaths last winter (between October 2019 and February 2020), with a best estimate of 34,157. So a lot of people die from flu each year, as Mr Trump points out.

Claim 5

On 7 March: ""Very soon, we're going to come up [with a vaccine].""

Currently there is no vaccine for this new coronavirus, although scientists in many countries are working hard to develop one. Scientists say realistically, one won't be ready until at least the middle of next year. Testing of vaccines on animals has already started. There's also been a test on human volunteers of a vaccine against coronavirus, but it will take many months before we know if this works.

Claim 6

On 29 February: ""We've taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus. They are the most aggressive taken by any country.""

The US has now imposed sweeping restrictions and some quarantine measures. It's now closing the border with Canada to all non-essential travel. But other countries have also taken aggressive measures to counter the virus - in some instances, more than the US.

China and Italy, for example, introduced widespread quarantining, affecting millions of people. The EU has closed its external borders for at least 30 days, with some European states closing their borders to any non-nationals, as well as introducing severe restrictions on movement.

Opinion

First-generation college student Arica Kincheloe lost the jobs that she relied on to pay her tuition at the University of Chicago. While many schools have shifted to online classes, students remain burdened with the same tuition costs that many of them already struggled to pay.

At the end of March, Congress passed the CARES Act, providing for a $1,200 stimulus payment to most Americans. It is clear that this one-time stimulus is not enough to meet Americans’ needs. We must establish monthly payments and we must increase the amount of money received to help people like Magdalena and Arica make ends meet for the length of the COVID-19 crisis.

The economic impact of the crisis have been especially bad for people of color who are disproportionately risking their lives in jobs that cannot be done remotely. More than half of African Americans under 45 have lost their jobs or seen a reduction in work and wages since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Young people, early in their careers and often lacking seniority and the job protections of earlier generations, also are severely affected.

While the new unemployment benefits Congress passed in the first CARES Act are beginning to give millions of people a needed financial boost, we must do more to help Illinois families.

Even before the current pandemic, 40% of Americans were one missed paycheck away from disaster. No one should ever be one crisis away from poverty, but for a large percentage of American families, that is the reality. We are seeing the impact of this economic vulnerability play out over and over again as our nation struggles through these challenging times.

The fastest and most effective way to help the families in Illinois harmed by economic impacts of COVID-19 is with direct cash payments. Millions of people in Illinois have already received their one-time $1,200 CARES Act stimulus check. For many, this stimulus is a lifeline, allowing residents to pay bills that they’ve lost sleep over or to purchase groceries, replenishing cabinets that were looking increasingly bare. $1,200 is a good start, but it’s not nearly enough. The average rent for an apartment in Chicago is nearly $2,000 per month. The $1,200 stimulus wouldn’t even cover one month of rent for most families.

We need bigger, bolder policies to help people — recurring payments that last until the economy recovers and it is safe to return to work. My colleagues and I are pushing for legislation that would establish payments of $2,000 a month for adults and $1,000 for children. These payments would include college students and other adult dependents, and families with one or more members who file taxes using an Individual Tax Identification Number.

We know that the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for years to come. Many are predicting the crisis will last well into 2021, or beyond. Now is not the time for timid solutions. We must take the steps necessary to not only keep our small businesses afloat, but also to keep our families afloat.

Direct payments are an essential tool to help families solve their own problems and to provide resiliency and stability. In the next relief bill, we must step up and ensure that there are no more one-time, Band-Aid solutions for families. Let’s make sure that Illinois families receive monthly payments to give them the financial security they need to ride out this crisis.

Hospitals are threatening to fire health-care workers who publicize their working conditions during the coronavirus pandemic -- and have in some cases followed through .
Ming Lin , an emergency room physician in Washington state , said he was told Friday he was out of a job because he ’ d given an interview to a newspaper about a Facebook post detailing what he believed to be inadequate protective equipment and testing . In Chicago , a nurse was fired after emailing colleagues that she wanted to wear a more protective mask while on duty . In New York , the NYU Langone Health system has warned employees they could be terminated if they talk to the media without authorization .
“ Hospitals are muzzling nurses and other health-care workers in an attempt to preserve their image , ” said Ruth Schubert , a spokeswoman for the Washington State Nurses Association . “ It is outrageous . ”
Hospitals have traditionally had strict media guidelines to protect patient privacy , urging staff to talk with journalists only through official public relations offices . But the pandemic has ushered in a new era , Schubert said .
Health-care workers “ must have the ability to tell the public what is really going on inside the facilities where they are caring for Covid-19 patients , ” she said .
One reason is to prepare other nurses and doctors for the looming onslaught of cases and encourage donations of much-needed equipment , particularly the personal protective equipment or PPE that protects them from being infected and in turn infecting other patients as well as their families when they go home .
In China , one of the earliest alarms about the mysterious new illness was raised by a doctor in an online chatroom in late December . He was reprimanded and forced to sign a police statement that the post was illegal . He later contracted the disease from a patient and died .

“ It is good and appropriate for health-care workers to be able to express their own fears and concerns , especially when expressing that might get them better protection , ” said Glenn Cohen , faculty director of Harvard Law School ’ s bioethics center . It ’ s likely hospitals are trying to limit reputational damage because “ when health-care workers say they are not being protected , the public gets very upset at the hospital system . ”
Doctors are a famously independent profession , where individual medical judgment on what ’ s best for the patient is prized over administrative dictates . That ’ s reared its head during the Covid-19 outbreak , with many physicians , nurses and other health-care workers taking to social media to express deep concerns about the lack of protective gear or much-needed patient-care equipment like respirators . Some posts have gone viral and are being shared hundreds of thousands of times , often tagged with # GetMePPE . Privacy laws prohibit disclosing specific patient information , but they don ’ t bar discussing general working conditions .

NYU Langone Health employees received a notice Friday from Kathy Lewis , executive vice president of communications , saying that anyone who talked to the media without authorization would be “ subject to disciplinary action , including termination . ”
Jim Mandler , a spokesman for NYU Langone Health , said the policy was to protect patient and staff confidentiality . “ Because information is constantly evolving , it is in the best interest of our staff and the institution that only those with the most updated information are permitted to address these issues with the media . ”
New York ’ s Montefiore Health System requires staff get permission before speaking publicly , and sent a reminder in a March 17 newsletter that all media requests “ must be shared and vetted ” by the public relations department .
“ Associates are not authorized to interact with reporters or speak on behalf of the institution in any capacity , without pre-approval , ” according to the policy , which was seen by ███ News .
Lauri Mazurkiewicz , the Chicago nurse who was fired by Northwestern Memorial Hospital after urging colleagues to wear more protective equipment , has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit .
“ A lot of hospitals are lying to their workers and saying that simple masks are sufficient and nurses are getting sick and they are dying , ” she said .
Mazurkiewicz , 46 , has asthma and cares for her father , who suffers from a respiratory disease . At 75 , he ’ s in one of the most at-risk groups of dying from the virus . “ I didn ’ t want to get infected because I ’ m not wearing the proper mask and then spread it to my patients and my family , ” she said .
A Northwestern Memorial Hospital spokesperson declined to comment , citing the lawsuit . The hospital said in an emailed statement that it “ is committed to the safety of our employees . ”

“ Our oath is to do no harm , ” Lin said . “ I spoke out for patient safety and as a result I got terminated . ”
Not all hospitals are blocking staff from talking to the press . New York ’ s Mount Sinai has been scheduling media interviews for nurses , physicians and trainees to help the public understand the severity of the crisis , a spokesperson said in an emailed statement . The University of California San Francisco Medical Center has gotten hundreds of such calls and encouraged workers to talk to reporters .

“ I ’ m hearing widespread stories from physicians across the country and they are all saying : ‘ We have these stories that we think are important to get out , but we are being told by our hospital systems that we are not allowed to speak to the press , and if we do so there will be extreme consequences , ” she said .
Many say they get daily emails urging them not to talk to the media under any circumstances . “ The public needs to hear these stories and other physicians need to hear them to be warned against what ’ s coming , ” Mehta said . “ It ’ s so important that everyone understands how bad this is going to get . ”","LISTEN TO ARTICLE 6:19 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

In China, one of the earliest alarms about the mysterious new illness was raised by a doctor in an online chatroom in late December. He was reprimanded and forced to sign a police statement that the post was illegal. He later contracted the disease from a patient and died.

It’s hard to come to grips with the fact that #WhenCoronaVirusIsOver some of us in healthcare will not be standing. And to think that is partially due to a lack of #PPE is infuriating. #GetMePPE pic.twitter.com/id5rrHoQFH — Joseph Sakran (@JosephSakran) March 29, 2020

“It is good and appropriate for health-care workers to be able to express their own fears and concerns, especially when expressing that might get them better protection,” said Glenn Cohen, faculty director of Harvard Law School’s bioethics center. It’s likely hospitals are trying to limit reputational damage because “when health-care workers say they are not being protected, the public gets very upset at the hospital system.”

Doctors are a famously independent profession, where individual medical judgment on what’s best for the patient is prized over administrative dictates. That’s reared its head during the Covid-19 outbreak, with many physicians, nurses and other health-care workers taking to social media to express deep concerns about the lack of protective gear or much-needed patient-care equipment like respirators. Some posts have gone viral and are being shared hundreds of thousands of times, often tagged with #GetMePPE. Privacy laws prohibit disclosing specific patient information, but they don’t bar discussing general working conditions.

NYU Langone Health employees received a notice Friday from Kathy Lewis, executive vice president of communications, saying that anyone who talked to the media without authorization would be “subject to disciplinary action, including termination.”

Jim Mandler, a spokesman for NYU Langone Health, said the policy was to protect patient and staff confidentiality. “Because information is constantly evolving, it is in the best interest of our staff and the institution that only those with the most updated information are permitted to address these issues with the media.”

New York’s Montefiore Health System requires staff get permission before speaking publicly, and sent a reminder in a March 17 newsletter that all media requests “must be shared and vetted” by the public relations department.

“Associates are not authorized to interact with reporters or speak on behalf of the institution in any capacity, without pre-approval,” according to the policy, which was seen by Bloomberg News.

Lauri Mazurkiewicz, the Chicago nurse who was fired by Northwestern Memorial Hospital after urging colleagues to wear more protective equipment, has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit.

“A lot of hospitals are lying to their workers and saying that simple masks are sufficient and nurses are getting sick and they are dying,” she said.

Mazurkiewicz, 46, has asthma and cares for her father, who suffers from a respiratory disease. At 75, he’s in one of the most at-risk groups of dying from the virus. “I didn’t want to get infected because I’m not wearing the proper mask and then spread it to my patients and my family,” she said.

A Northwestern Memorial Hospital spokesperson declined to comment, citing the lawsuit. The hospital said in an emailed statement that it “is committed to the safety of our employees.”

Charles Prosper, chief executive of PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center’s Northwest network where Lin worked in Bellingham, said in an email that Lin was “publicly critical” of the hospital’s readiness to deal with patients. Lin’s contract is through TeamHealth, which said it’s seeking to find him new work.

“Our oath is to do no harm,” Lin said. “I spoke out for patient safety and as a result I got terminated.”

Not all hospitals are blocking staff from talking to the press. New York’s Mount Sinai has been scheduling media interviews for nurses, physicians and trainees to help the public understand the severity of the crisis, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The University of California San Francisco Medical Center has gotten hundreds of such calls and encouraged workers to talk to reporters.

Nisha Mehta is a 38-year radiologist from Charlotte, North Carolina, who runs two Facebook groups for physicians with around 70,000 members. She’s fielded numerous requests from health-care workers hoping to get their stories into the public arena.

“I’m hearing widespread stories from physicians across the country and they are all saying: ‘We have these stories that we think are important to get out, but we are being told by our hospital systems that we are not allowed to speak to the press, and if we do so there will be extreme consequences,” she said.

Many say they get daily emails urging them not to talk to the media under any circumstances. “The public needs to hear these stories and other physicians need to hear them to be warned against what’s coming,” Mehta said. “It’s so important that everyone understands how bad this is going to get.”

coronavirus,Time Magazine,0,https://time.com/5817435/covid-19-mental-health-coronavirus/,'We Carry That Burden.' Medical Workers Fighting COVID-19 Are Facing a Mental Health Crisis,,Tara Law,"As a critical care doctor in New York City , Monica is used to dealing with high-octane situations and treating severely ill patients . But she says the COVID-19 outbreak is unlike anything she ’ s seen before . Over the past few weeks , operating rooms have been transformed into ICUs , physicians of all backgrounds have been drafted into emergency room work , and two of her colleagues became ICU patients . While Monica is proud of her coworkers for rising to the challenge , she says it ’ s been hard for them to fight a prolonged battle against a deadly , highly contagious illness with no known cure .
To make matters worse , Monica recently tested positive for COVID-19 , and she believes she brought the virus home to her husband . Both have gotten sick and are improving , but he had a much harder time with the disease than she did . Monica says that , while she ’ s used the inherent risk of her job , she feels her hospital failed to protect her and her family — and she blames herself , in part , for her husband ’ s illness . “ There ’ s this sinking feeling that you have , ” says Monica , who requested anonymity because she feared professional repercussions for speaking candidly , “ not only , like , the hospital let you down , and that the system let us down as doctors and didn ’ t protect us , but then I didn ’ t protect my own family . ”
In hospitals around the world , doctors , nurses and other healthcare workers like Monica are fighting an enemy that has already killed more than 95,000 people , including over 16,000 in the United States . And as with any war , the fight against COVID-19 will result not just in direct casualties , but also take a terrible toll on the minds of many of those who survive .
It will be years before the mental health toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is fully understood , but some early data already paints a bleak picture . A study published March 23 in the medical journal JAMA found that , among 1,257 healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients in China , 50.4 % reported symptoms of depression , 44.6 % symptoms of anxiety , 34 % insomnia , and 71.5 % reported distress . Nurses and other frontline workers were among those with the most severe symptoms .
In interviews with TIME , several doctors and nurses said that fighting COVID-19 is making them feel more dedicated to their profession , and determined to push through and help their patients . However , many also admitted to harboring darker feelings . They ’ re afraid of spreading the disease to their families , frustrated about a lack of adequate protective gear and a sense they can ’ t do enough for their patients , exhausted as hours have stretched longer without a clear end in sight , and , most of all , deeply sad for their dying patients , many of whom are slipping away without their loved ones at their side .
It ’ s those lonely deaths that have hit the hardest for some . Natalie Jones , an ICU-registered nurse at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton in New Jersey , says it ’ s been agonizing to have to turn away people who want to visit their loved ones one last time . She ’ s trying to find ways to be compassionate where she can — last week , she passed on a message from a patient ’ s wife just before he died : “ That they love him , and it ’ s O.K . to go. ” But even simply carrying a message of such emotional weight can take a toll .
“ We carry that burden for the families , too , ” says Jones , who ’ s having difficultly sleeping without nightmares . “ And we understand it ’ s so difficult that they can ’ t be there . And that hurts us too . As nurses , we ’ re healers , and we ’ re compassionate . It hits very close to home for us as well . ”
“ We ’ re all affected , ” adds Jones , whose already hectic schedule has gotten even more intense amid the outbreak , costing her the sleep that might otherwise help her cope with what she ’ s experiencing . “ To say that we ’ re not would be a lie . ”
The coronavirus is taking a mental toll even on those medical experts who aren ’ t on the front lines . Since the start of the outbreak , Dr. Morgan Katz , an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University , has been advising nursing homes and long-term care centers on dealing with the coronavirus . But she ’ s struggling with the gap between what she believes to be the proper procedures and what ’ s actually possible in this crisis . Many of the facilities she ’ s advising are suffering from a lack of protective equipment , limited staffing and insufficient testing , and a sense of helplessness is taking hold .
“ We didn ’ t have the resources before this that we needed , and this has completely strapped them beyond anything feasible , ” says Katz . “ It ’ s so sad . I really feel for these nursing homes and the staff of these nursing homes , because I truly believe that they ’ re trying to do the right thing . But I really don ’ t feel like they ’ re being protected the way that we need to protect them . ”
Finding ways to support medical workers ’ mental health could be a key component in the fight against COVID-19 . Dr. Albert Wu , professor of health policy and management and medicine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , says that evidence from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggests that failing to support healthcare workers in a crisis , including by not providing enough protective gear , can erode their “ wellbeing and resilience , ” ultimately leading to chronic burnout . Some healthcare workers could leave the profession , be absent more often from work , or develop PTSD , and any preexisting mental health conditions could be exacerbated . Furthermore , healthcare workers are human like the rest of us , and under extreme stress , they could be prone to making mistakes — which could lead to worse outcomes for patients , and further erode doctors ’ and nurses ’ mental health . “ We can ’ t get away from our physiology , ” says Wu .
If healthcare workers can ’ t provide the care they typically believe is medically necessary for their patients , they may experience a phenomenon known as “ moral injury , ” says Dr. Wendy Dean , a psychiatrist and the co-founder of the nonprofit Fix Moral Injury . Dean says that American healthcare providers are used to doing anything and everything to help their patients , but inadequate protective gear and triage procedures will force them to make “ exquisitely painful ” decisions , such as choosing whether or not to risk infecting themselves , their family and other patients in order to help everyone in their care .
Still , Dean says the scope of the mental health crisis among healthcare workers won ’ t come into focus until the more immediate problem has ebbed .
“ When I think the real challenge is going to come is when the pandemic eases up and people start having time to process , ” she says . “ All that they ’ ve seen , all that they ’ ve done , all that they ’ ve felt and pushed away . ”
Several healthcare workers said that , amid all the uncertainty and horrors , they have found some relief in drawing upon support from their families , communities , and one another . Monica , for one , says her friends brought food to her and her husband after they got sick , and she deeply appreciated the support . She ’ s also proud of the way her colleagues have come together as a team to fight the virus . “ There has been a real feeling of , everybody ’ s in the trenches together , ” she says . “ What I ’ ve been most amazed about is people have really risen to that call . ”

“They’ve got access to most of the drug supply [of remdesivir], so there’s nothing for Europe,” Dr. Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at Liverpool University, told the UK’s Guardian.

“This is the first major approved drug, and where is the mechanism for access? Once again we’re at the back of the queue,” he said.

Hill added the UK could still get its hands on remdesivir through what is known as a compulsory license, which overrides the intellectual property rights of the company.

That would allow the UK to purchase from generic companies in Bangladesh or India, where Gilead’s patent is not recognized, the Guardian reported.",www.nypost.com,right,fuHSlZH4Pv0mMIRs

This week, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warned the world is facing ""a dangerous epidemic of misinformation"" about the coronavirus. And on Wednesday, the global advocacy group Avaaz released a study saying millions of users have been exposed to coronavirus-related misinformation on Facebook.

The study pointed to conspiracy theories that the virus was created by the World Health Organization and the Gates Foundation; touted false cures such as oregano oil and garlic; and gave the potentially lethal recommendation that drinking chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach, will ""destroy"" the virus.

None of those are true.

""Not only is Facebook an epicenter of misinformation, but more dangerously, people's lives are being put at risk, because they're not being informed that this content was false,"" said Fadi Quran, campaign director at Avaaz. He said the new alerts are ""a huge step forward.""

A Facebook spokesperson said: ""We share Avaaz's goal of reducing misinformation about COVID-19 and appreciate their partnership in developing the notifications we'll now be showing people who engaged with harmful misinformation about the virus we've since removed. However, their sample is not representative of the community on Facebook and their findings don't reflect the work we've done.""

In 43 cases, the posts were still available on Facebook without any warning label indicating that fact-checkers had debunked their claims. Avaaz said after it shared the list of posts with Facebook, the company removed 17 of them.

Avaaz found it could take up to three weeks for Facebook to post warning labels or remove content that fact-checkers rated as false. Facebook declined to say how long it typically takes to flag or remove posts that violate its policies.

Williamson, Nro Contributor","People take advantage of minimal traffic on East Capitol Street as the coronavirus outbreak continues in Washington , D.C. , April 6 , 2020 . ( Leah Millis/Reuters )
In this current crisis , the longest if not the first complete shutdown in U.S. history , the freedoms of American democracy are being tested in ways we scarcely ever imagined . Out of nowhere little Napoleonic governors arise to enact decrees prohibiting gardening or strolling on an empty beach — decrees that seem to have little purpose other than to reflect that they can do so . Snitches volunteer to out felonious social deviants who are seen cooking in the backyard with a neighbor . A little horned-devil virus seems to be trying to do what those Russkies never could .
Experts with all sorts of Ph.D.s , M.D.s , and J.D.s after their names lecture from authority about what we must right now do — or else ! — on the principle that they have a scientific or technocratic prerogative to impress critics of their modeling or their demand that we shut down a $ 22-trillion economy for “ 18 months , ” if need be .
A supposedly disinterested media — found by media watchdogs to be 93 percent negative in its presidential reportage before the virus crisis — envision their coverage of the Trump demon as an endless zero-sum game in which any morsel of good news for him is instantly bad for them .
In short , if American democracy were to fail to sustain itself under myriad pressures , then this would be the moment . For some , the Sixties can at last be made manifest — especially given that its aging children just impeached an American president on articles nowhere found in the Constitution , after weaponizing the FBI , CIA , and DOJ in an attempt to abort a presidential campaign and then presidency .
How fortunate , then , that in this current crisis , when one questions the logic of using a misleading denominator to ascertain viral lethality , and thus the logic of basing existential public policies on resulting case-to-fatality rates that admittedly can not be true , one can ( at least for now ) keep raising skepticism without being sent to a Chinese-like reeducation camp .
We are witnessing the fading moments of Baby Boomer–generation authority . As it vaporizes , it still can not fundamentally change America with sermons that we “ will never go back to normal , ” a synonym for “ we don ’ t like lots of things in that bothersome Constitution. ” America is currently engaged in a free-fall of angry , unfettered discussion about everything from the wearing of masks to the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine . Tempers rise ; false knowledge replicates . Smack-down arguments from authority grow shrill . And , thank God , it all remains legal . Out of the mess , the acrimony can lead to light rather than endless heat .
Warn an American that he poses a public threat by illegally and solitarily launching his tiny boat on a nearby empty pond to fish , and he ’ s likely to do just that — and thereby reveal the absurdity of the functionary who issued such a tyrannical order .
Tell a pastor he can ’ t preach from his car to other car-bound parishioner and , by God , he will do just that — and will be praised by most for his measured civil disobedience .
Let criminals out of jail , and what ’ s a paranoid American city-dweller to do ? Obviously head down to the gun store and get in a line for something that shoots something , now for the first time in his life bitching in extremis that gun laws he once found wonderful are far stricter than they should be .
Today in the midst of a national lockdown , one can read that the nation ’ s commander in chief , Donald Trump , is a narcissistic buffoon whose recklessness will doom us all . Or , with more effort , scouring the Internet for non-left-wing perspectives , one can read that he ’ s playing three-dimensional chess and that the media , Joe Biden , the Chinese , and the virus are no match for his cunning . Agree either way , and you may be pilloried online and smeared with a volume of cowardly emails and letters to your employer , but you won ’ t end up like a Chinese whistleblower .
Traipse down Main Street , with 20 in tow , and you may well be arrested for violating viral lockdowns , but you won ’ t be marooned in jail without bail — at least yet .
If an unhinged governor in Washington or Michigan or a Virginia functionary decides that you ’ re a big mouth and an insurrectionist , he can not invent a new law that says it is a felony to speak ill , or reduce the majesty , of lawmakers .
Donald Trump was trashed for musing that as chief executive he could order states to open up if he wished , and then hours later trashed even more when he suggested that the decision was really up to the governors . If he was not trolling the media , it may be that his advisers not only quoted the Constitution to him but that he saw fit to leave the politically lose/lose decision to lesser , would-be-king officials .
No matter , the courts will decide whether it is legal for a president to overrule a governor ’ s order , at least as it affects federal property and interstate commerce .

Thank God for the Bill of Rights.

In this current crisis, the longest if not the first complete shutdown in U.S. history, the freedoms of American democracy are being tested in ways we scarcely ever imagined. Out of nowhere little Napoleonic governors arise to enact decrees prohibiting gardening or strolling on an empty beach — decrees that seem to have little purpose other than to reflect that they can do so. Snitches volunteer to out felonious social deviants who are seen cooking in the backyard with a neighbor. A little horned-devil virus seems to be trying to do what those Russkies never could.

Experts with all sorts of Ph.D.s, M.D.s, and J.D.s after their names lecture from authority about what we must right now do — or else! — on the principle that they have a scientific or technocratic prerogative to impress critics of their modeling or their demand that we shut down a $22-trillion economy for “18 months,” if need be.

A supposedly disinterested media — found by media watchdogs to be 93 percent negative in its presidential reportage before the virus crisis — envision their coverage of the Trump demon as an endless zero-sum game in which any morsel of good news for him is instantly bad for them.

In short, if American democracy were to fail to sustain itself under myriad pressures, then this would be the moment. For some, the Sixties can at last be made manifest — especially given that its aging children just impeached an American president on articles nowhere found in the Constitution, after weaponizing the FBI, CIA, and DOJ in an attempt to abort a presidential campaign and then presidency.

How fortunate, then, that in this current crisis, when one questions the logic of using a misleading denominator to ascertain viral lethality, and thus the logic of basing existential public policies on resulting case-to-fatality rates that admittedly cannot be true, one can (at least for now) keep raising skepticism without being sent to a Chinese-like reeducation camp.

We are witnessing the fading moments of Baby Boomer–generation authority. As it vaporizes, it still cannot fundamentally change America with sermons that we “will never go back to normal,” a synonym for “we don’t like lots of things in that bothersome Constitution.” America is currently engaged in a free-fall of angry, unfettered discussion about everything from the wearing of masks to the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. Tempers rise; false knowledge replicates. Smack-down arguments from authority grow shrill. And, thank God, it all remains legal. Out of the mess, the acrimony can lead to light rather than endless heat.

Warn an American that he poses a public threat by illegally and solitarily launching his tiny boat on a nearby empty pond to fish, and he’s likely to do just that — and thereby reveal the absurdity of the functionary who issued such a tyrannical order.

Tell a pastor he can’t preach from his car to other car-bound parishioner and, by God, he will do just that — and will be praised by most for his measured civil disobedience.

Let criminals out of jail, and what’s a paranoid American city-dweller to do? Obviously head down to the gun store and get in a line for something that shoots something, now for the first time in his life bitching in extremis that gun laws he once found wonderful are far stricter than they should be.

Today in the midst of a national lockdown, one can read that the nation’s commander in chief, Donald Trump, is a narcissistic buffoon whose recklessness will doom us all. Or, with more effort, scouring the Internet for non-left-wing perspectives, one can read that he’s playing three-dimensional chess and that the media, Joe Biden, the Chinese, and the virus are no match for his cunning. Agree either way, and you may be pilloried online and smeared with a volume of cowardly emails and letters to your employer, but you won’t end up like a Chinese whistleblower.

Traipse down Main Street, with 20 in tow, and you may well be arrested for violating viral lockdowns, but you won’t be marooned in jail without bail — at least yet.

If an unhinged governor in Washington or Michigan or a Virginia functionary decides that you’re a big mouth and an insurrectionist, he cannot invent a new law that says it is a felony to speak ill, or reduce the majesty, of lawmakers.

Donald Trump was trashed for musing that as chief executive he could order states to open up if he wished, and then hours later trashed even more when he suggested that the decision was really up to the governors. If he was not trolling the media, it may be that his advisers not only quoted the Constitution to him but that he saw fit to leave the politically lose/lose decision to lesser, would-be-king officials.

No matter, the courts will decide whether it is legal for a president to overrule a governor’s order, at least as it affects federal property and interstate commerce. Can Trump open Yosemite National Park amid Governor Gavin Newsom’s lockdown, but not California’s Big Sur State Park? Who, after all, “owns” Wall Street? Is it a physical or a cyber space? Does the mayor of New York City or the governor of New York State control the building and what goes on inside, or does Bud Jones in Bakersfield, whose retirement years hinge on a 401(k), have a say?

No one quite knows the limits of Washington, D.C., or the parameters of federalism. The schizophrenic Left now tends to favor the neo-Confederate idea of federal nullification when it’s a matter of sanctuary cities or abortion laws or opposing anything Trump is for. But at least there is tension there, and that uncertainty itself can limit the power of both a president and a governor. And that’s not always a bad thing when the mentality of the mob takes over.

Previously","Despite what political leaders want them to say , COVID-19 models will become less predictive exactly when we need them most .
In the continuing drama of America ’ s coronavirus response , statistical models play the role of Hamlet ’ s father : foreboding , influencing the action on the stage but unable to speak for themselves .
Some health leaders have said that various COVID-19 models ’ worst projections — such as the Imperial College London model that predicted that 500,000 Britons would die — were overly dire . That skepticism about what the models truly say will play a growing role in the discussion about when and how to “ re-open ” the country . But the idea that the worst of the pandemic is behind us — and that the models prove it — is misleading at best and dangerous at worst , say experts .
Right now , the world is eager for news that the crisis is abating and that economic and social life can “ return to normal. ” Largely as a result of massive social distancing efforts , new infections in New York and other hotspots are going down . Some , like Andrew McCarthy at the National Review , feel like they ’ ve seen enough to toss the modelers out on their rears . “ There is no shortage of government spin , regurgitated by media commentators , assuring us that the drastic reductions in the projections over just a few days powerfully illustrate how well social distancing and the substantial shuttering of the economy is working . Nonsense , ” McCarthy writes .
What the models are , in fact , is poorly represented by the policy makers touting them . The vast majority of them aren ’ t built to project infection rates out beyond a few weeks , so they don ’ t tell us anything about the resurgences that may come . Some of the most influential models , such as the University of Pennsylvania ’ s COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics , or CHIME , were designed to help hospital managers stock up for worst-case scenarios . Yet , in the Washington , D.C. , mayor ’ s office , CHIME is the model of choice .
CHIME is an SIR model , which stands for susceptible , infected , recovered . They ’ re hardly perfect and they don ’ t pretend to be , as Michael Z . Levy , an associate professor in the Department of Biostatistics , Epidemiology & Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania , recently said in an online lecture . You can change the outcome drastically with small changes to various parameters . For it to be of the most use , you need to be seeking the answer to a specific question , like , “ How many beds will this hospital need in May ? ”
SIR models assume that “ everyone is bumping into everyone else like perfect spheres in a vacuum , ” Levy said . “ We didn ’ t act like that even before social distancing . ”
Such models are “ fine for short-term forecasts , but it becomes problematic when you start to ask different questions ” — like what will happen if social distancing is implemented in some places but not others ? What happens if infections go down but testing is still inadequate ? What changes if therapeutic drugs are available only in some places ?
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation , or IHME , model used by the White House is a more general public-health model . It predicted peak hospital resource use during the second week in April along with ICU and hospital overcapacity . But it showed those outcomes could be mitigated through social distancing measures . When most people talk about “ flattening the curve , ” they ’ re referring to this model .
But the model ’ s creators admit to a big limitation that doesn ’ t make it into the White House briefings . It was originally designed only to track infection rates and hospital use through June . And while its creators at the University of Washington are constantly using new data to improve it , these updates don ’ t provide high-confidence predictions about the fall or next year because the number of variables is growing as new measures are implemented in lots of different ways across varied locations .
Another example : a March 25 article in the New York Times was intended to show the effects of two months of social distancing to “ flatten the curve. ” But it doesn ’ t extend past October . Wesley Pegden , an associate professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University , recently took to Medium to point out that two months of lockdown won ’ t end the pandemic , and people who say otherwise are mistaken or lying . In fact , a two-month lock down that isn ’ t followed by a uniform strategy to manage new infections without overwhelming the health system leads to a fall resurgence that eclipses the spring “ peak . ”
“ Two months of mitigations have not improved the outcome of the epidemic in this model , it has just delayed its terrible effects , ” Pegden wrote . “ In fact , because of the role of weather in the model presented in the [ New York Times ] article , two months of mitigations actually results in 50 % more infections and deaths than two weeks of mitigations , since it pushes the peak of the epidemic to the winter instead of the summer , whose warmer months this model assumes causes lower transmission rates…No model whose purpose is to study the overall benefits of mitigations should end at a time-point before a steady-state is reached . ”
In a conversation with ███ , Pegden said that the messaging around these models has left the public ill-informed . “ People have not been given enough sense of the uncertainty . They have not been given a sense of how a lockdown will not fix the problem . ”
When he tells people this , he finds them “ surprised and disturbed that a two-month lockdown was not going to fix the problem , ” he said .
Pegden ’ s concerns are much more in line with a model produced by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London . It predicts resurgent infection spikes until a vaccine becomes widely available in a year or so .
Even the most dire projections remain a possibility despite the recent slump in new cases , Ferguson said .
1/4 - I think it would be helpful if I cleared up some confusion that has emerged in recent days . Some have interpreted my evidence to a UK parliamentary committee as indicating we have substantially revised our assessments of the potential mortality impact of COVID-19 . — neil_ferguson ( @ neil_ferguson ) March 26 , 2020
Pegden says that a lockdown from March to May could wind up making the situation much worse later precisely because policymakers overpromised on its effects . A lockdown only buys you time , time to get nationwide testing in order , ventilators to more places , and hospitals ready for a coming surge in patients . In the United States , that hasn ’ t happened to the extent it needs to .
“ It is not true , a priori , that every transmission you avoid today is saving lives , ” says Pegden . “ You can save lives by having more transmissions among more people in the short term . ”
He acknowledges that the idea of exposing more people to the virus is counterintuitive , but , he says , “ It ’ s not always the case that the most conservative thing you can do will save the most lives . If transmission levels revert to normal over the next year…then it would turn out that being locked down was a mistake . ”
It ’ s now up to policymakers to find a coherent way to reopen the country , guided by strategy and not models that will start to fall apart as more and more variables are introduced . A total lockdown until a vaccine arrives is neither politically nor economically viable . The question is how to ease the lockdown without overwhelming the healthcare system . Pegden put out a preprint paper looking at how to do just that . In essence , he says , you want to start lifting restrictions on people who are younger , a population that is less likely to need ICU care . But you don ’ t want to lift restrictions on all of them since some of them may live with someone in the more vulnerable 60-plus age group .
“ Age-targeting has the potential to greatly reduce total mortalities compared with optimum choices for homogeneous measures . At the same time , we see that the best strategies for age-targeting are sensitive to the fraction of the younger population which can be released . In general , if too few people are released initially , a second wave occurs when transmission levels return to normal , ” they write .

Policy-makers should also begin to prepare for the illness to start having a much worse effect on people with lower incomes . Reports show that they are more likely to have underlying health conditions and are less likely to be able to work remotely or to maintain social distance , said Levy . That diversity of health outcomes is already occurring to some extent , but it ’ s likely to get worse . A new visualization tool shows which areas are going to be more affected based on the demographics of the population .
Levy , in his lecture , pointed out that trying to tweak models to reflect the arrival of anti-COVID drugs won ’ t much improve them , since there are still too many variables to control for . “ To really affect transmission dynamics , ” he said , a potential drug “ would need to affect these other parameters . You would need an over-the-counter-cold-sniffy-nose-and-COVID drug . ”
One thing we probably should begin to model for now is mutation , since that ’ s going to affect the efficacy of drugs , vaccines , and other measures later on . That ’ s going to be more useful than trying to forecast infection and recovery among a population in an environment where that will become more difficult .
A recent paper by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University offers an interesting and useful take on precisely that very hard problem .
Predicting when a virus mutates into another virus is more challenging than mapping the spread of a contagion among a group . But looking at how information spreads and mutates online in social networks can provide some insight into how viruses spread and mutate in the real world .
“ There is some similarity from an evolution perspective via the mechanism of natural selection . A virus may go through a number of mutations ( mostly a random process ) . However , among a large number of these , the mutation that leads to highest infectiousness will be ‘ naturally selected ’ i.e. , it will be the one that we will see most commonly . For information it is also similar , ” Osman Yağan , an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon ’ s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , told ███ in an email . “ Several people can attempt to modify a piece of information to make it more attractive . It will be the audience who will then ‘ select ’ the most appealing one and that particular version of the information will be much more prevalent ( say in Twitter ) than others . ”
Yağan says that the research could help epidemiologists better prepare in case the virus goes through a rapid mutation process , as well as to understand the effects of protective measures in a new way . “ We believe that there is some similarity between ‘ a virus mutating and becoming less easy to infect individuals ’ and ‘ people being careful about social-distancing and thus becoming less easy to get infected. ’ The analogy here is strengthened by the fact that those who do not obey social-distancing are more likely to infect each other ( a la carrying a second-strain of the virus ) than those who are obeying the guidelines . ”
The work is partially funded by the U.S. Army . Edward Palazzolo , program manager for the Social and Cognitive Networks Program at the Army Research Office , told ███ that it ’ s his job to bring people together across different disciplines to find new approaches to problems , which is what they did here . “ We ’ re always supporting basic research ” he said , and it ’ s a long-term effort . They began funding Yağan ’ s work in 2017 .
Speaking in a personal capacity and not as a representative of the U.S. Army , Palazzolo said that he was heartened to see more people learning some of the elementary basics of data science . But he said that contract tracing — a key to other countries ’ successful approaches — will be especially difficult in the United States because of the privacy implications of contact-tracing apps .
Palazzolo warned that leaders should avoid treating models like crystal balls . They “ should never take a model and say , ‘ This is the truth ’ , ” he said .
More importantly , they need to work with scientists to understand statistical terms — for example , what a confidence interval is . ( It ’ s the specific range of numbers the modeler is confident that the value falls within . ) “ Having the right people on the team will make all the difference . ”
Of course , having the right people only matters if you listen to them — lest we rely on models that seem to predict a recovery on the basis of assumptions that are no-longer true , like a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .","Despite what political leaders want them to say, COVID-19 models will become less predictive exactly when we need them most.

Of course, having the right people only matters if you listen to them — lest we rely on models that seem to predict a recovery on the basis of assumptions that are no-longer true, like a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",www.defenseone.com,center,PvKl5hGBik9IodgE

The outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed . Following are developments on Friday related to the global economy , the work place and the spread of the virus .
COSTS MOUNT : The pandemic will cost the global economy as much as $ 4.1 trillion , or nearly 5 % of all economic activity , according to new estimates from the Asian Development Bank .
The head of the International Monetary Fund said the recession sparked by the coronavirus pandemic is “ way worse ” than the 2008 global recession . At a press briefing in Geneva on Friday , IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva described the situation as “ a crisis like no other . ”
AIRLINES : Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , United Airlines , Southwest and JetBlue said they applied Friday for their share of $ 25 billion in federal grants designed to cover airline payrolls for the next six months . None disclosed the amount they are seeking .
The grant money was part of $ 2.2 trillion relief bill approved last week .

The number of travelers screened Thursday at airports nationwide was 124,000 , a 95 % drop from the same day last year .
And the global airline industry passed a milestone Friday : Half of all passenger jets are now grounded as airlines cut flights sharply . Aviation-data firm Cirium said that with another 530 parked since Thursday , there are now 12,635 jets in service and 13,655 grounded . The number of commercial flights is down 75 % , according to tracking service
The Transportation Department , meanwhile , said it is getting more complaints from consumers who say airlines are giving travel vouchers instead of refunds after canceling flights . The department says vouchers aren ’ t easy to use because airlines are cutting so many flights due to the coronavirus outbreak .

coronavirus,Time Magazine,0,https://time.com/5843893/nursing-homes-workers-coronavirus/,'It's Getting Worse.' Nursing Home Workers Confront Risks in Facilities Devastated by Coronavirus,,Katie Reilly,"Days before she tested positive for COVID-19 in early April , Tanya Beckford was already worried about dying because of the conditions in the Connecticut nursing home where she has worked for 23 years . She wasn ’ t feeling well and says she and her co-workers , facing a shortage of masks , gloves and gowns , had started wearing plastic trash bags over their uniforms for protection as they cared for infected residents .
Beckford , a certified nursing assistant ( CNA ) in the Alzheimer ’ s unit at Newington Rapid Recovery Rehab Center in Newington , Connecticut , had been running a low-grade fever but says the facility was only sending workers home if their temperature reached 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit — per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines . In an effort to ensure there were enough staff to care for all the residents , Beckford says , employees had been told they were not allowed to take any more time off .
“ I went to the administrator , like , ‘ I am sick , and you guys are still keeping me in here , I don ’ t have the proper PPE ( personal protective equipment ) to work with now , and I just don ’ t want to die , ' ” says Beckford , 48 . Days later , she tested positive for COVID-19 .
The coronavirus pandemic has devastated nursing homes across the country . There have been more than 35,000 COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities , according to the Associated Press — a figure that accounts for about a third of the country ’ s coronavirus deaths . The industry has been sharply criticized by relatives of the dead , who ’ ve accused nursing homes of being slow to take action against the virus and of trying to dodge responsibility for their loved ones ’ deaths . But nursing home employees , who face serious occupational hazards even in non-pandemic times , say they ’ re caught in an impossible situation and being blamed for problems rooted in America ’ s failed elder-care system .
Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here .
They ’ re struggling to protect themselves and support their families on menial salaries while caring for a population that is among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 . Nursing home employees who contract COVID-19 have been forced to use up their limited sick time or vacation time , go without pay , or lose their jobs entirely . Through it all , they have dealt with grief and despair as elderly residents to whom they ’ ve become emotionally attached become sick with COVID-19 and die .
“ The worst thing that I get upset about is hearing the word hero , hero , hero being thrown around for us . And no one is treating us as such . We feel disrespected , ” says Beckford , who has been on sick leave since April 10 and is still recovering from pneumonia caused by the virus . “ I would love to see them give us the proper PPE that we need , give us some kind of compensation , and for goodness sake , I don ’ t have any more vacation or sick time now , and the year is just beginning . Give me back some kind of compensation and put back my time . ”
Newington Rapid Recovery Rehab Center denies Beckford ’ s allegations , including that employees were forced to use trash bags for protection . “ At no time has our staff been without appropriate PPE . The building has been properly staffed throughout the crisis , ” it said in a statement , adding : “ We have been strictly following the CDC protocol for health care workers. ” When she recovers , Beckford plans to return to work there .
But recent lawsuits — brought by relatives of nursing home workers who died of COVID-19 and by former nursing home employees — are drawing attention to the conditions within some facilities that workers say put them and patients at unreasonably high risk .
Carlenia Milanes , a licensed practical nurse , spent weeks unwittingly caring for COVID-19 patients at Alaris Health at Hamilton Park in Jersey City , N.J. , while the facility initially prohibited employees from wearing masks , according to a lawsuit filed April 22 . The suit claims the nursing home hid coronavirus cases from employees , “ refused to test patients and pressured staff to work even if they had symptoms of the highly contagious and deadly disease , all while patients and staff alike were dying of COVID-19 . ”
On April 3 , Milanes sent an email to Jersey City officials sounding an alarm and saying the nursing home ’ s strategy “ is to put blinders on even at the cost of human life. ” “ Something needs to be done or more people and staff get sick and possibly die , ” Milanes wrote , according to the lawsuit . “ I need your help . ”
Milanes , 28 , called in sick for the following day after developing symptoms of COVID-19 , but her suit alleges that she was told she would be fired if she didn ’ t present a doctor ’ s note . In her lawsuit , Milanes also alleges the facility allowed seemingly healthy residents to share rooms with residents who had symptoms of COVID-19 .
By May 27 , there were 110 COVID-19 cases among the facility ’ s residents , including 31 deaths , and 42 COVID-19 cases among staff , including two deaths , according to data reported to the state . Milanes was among the affected staff members ; the COVID-19 test she took on April 6 came positive .
“ I ’ m not afraid to work . I would take care of anyone , but if I ’ m sick , how am I going to be any good for a patient ? ” says Milanes , a single mother whose 7- and 10-year-old daughters have since shown symptoms of COVID-19 as well . “ I ’ m somebody ’ s mother . I ’ m somebody ’ s sister . I ’ m somebody ’ s daughter . And granted yes , this is what I signed up for , but protect me . ”
LaDawn Chapman , a CNA at the same facility , also filed a lawsuit against Alaris on April 22 that echoes many of Milanes ’ allegations , including that the facility lacked adequate protective gear for employees and did not notify employees about coronavirus cases . The lawsuit says Chapman was likely exposed to COVID-19 through a patient and multiple coworkers and had a doctor ’ s note advising her to self-isolate for two weeks . She was told that unless she had symptoms of the disease , she had to come to work , her lawsuit alleges .
Both women say they were fired , but Alaris Health denies this . Five days after the suits were filed , Alaris Health sent each woman a letter saying they were “ mistaken ” about being fired and setting dates that each was expected to return to work . In a statement , Alaris spokesperson Matt Stanton also denied the lawsuits ’ other allegations .
“ I can tell you that each and every allegation in this case is false , ” he said . “ No employees were terminated . At no time was information withheld from staff , our residents or their loves ones [ sic ] . Thankfully , adequate PPE has never been an issue at any of our facilities . In fact Alaris required N95 masks and PPE for all staff well before the ( New Jersey Department of Health ) and CDC mandates . Finally , no employees were ever pressured to work while sick . Staff showing COVID-19 symptoms were sent home and required to adhere to strict return to work protocols as published by the NJ DOH . ”
In Texas , Maurice Dotson , a CNA at West Oaks Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Austin , died on April 17 after contracting COVID-19 . His mother sued the nursing home on May 13 , accusing it of failing to provide staff with protective equipment and exposing workers and patients to “ unreasonable risks of serious harm. ” A spokesperson for West Oaks said Dotson “ touched countless lives and was a respected and comforting presence , ” but declined to comment on pending litigation .
Leaders in the long-term care industry have argued that nursing homes need more support and funding from state and federal governments . And the industry has sought immunity from potential lawsuits related to the pandemic , but the laws and executive orders granting them immunity from civil liability in some states , including New Jersey , might not protect them from all legal claims .
“ While I understand that you can ’ t judge a nursing home that ’ s in the midst of a pandemic by the same standards you would on a regular day , it doesn ’ t give these nursing homes the license or the right to behave recklessly or engage in willful misconduct , ” says Bill Matsikoudis , an attorney who is representing nursing home workers and residents in the lawsuits against Alaris Health at Hamilton Park .
Infection control has long been a challenge in long-term care facilities , where hands-on care is a necessity , and the pandemic has exacerbated that problem . The U.S. Government Accountability Office , in a report released May 20 , said that 82 % of nursing homes surveyed from 2013 to 2017 were cited for infection prevention and control deficiencies .
Meanwhile , the median pay for nursing assistants was $ 29,640 last year — just above the national poverty level for a family of four , which is $ 26,200 . By comparison , the median salary for a full-time worker last year was about $ 49,000 , according to weekly earnings data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics . In part because of that low pay , many nursing home employees work second jobs , which increases their risk of contracting the virus and unwittingly carrying it to residents .
“ If the aides were paid a living wage , they would not need to have multiple jobs , ” says Joanne Spetz , director of the Health Workforce Research Center for Long-Term Care at the University of California , San Francisco . “ That forces the workers to put themselves at more and more risk to support themselves , and that also puts their clients at risk and their residents at risk . ”
And while staff shortages have long been an issue at nursing homes , the problem becomes worse when workers stay home sick . As their colleagues take on the extra work , the care and time they ’ re able to give patients suffers .
The median pay for nursing assistants was $ 29,640 last year — just above the national poverty level for a family of four , which is $ 26,200 .
“ A lot of nursing homes are worried , ” says David Grabowski , a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical school who focuses on long-term care . “ Who steps in here ? Maybe it ’ s the National Guard , maybe it ’ s contract nurses . But it ’ s not like these places have a big roster of folks ready to plug into these positions. ” In New York City on May 20 , Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would provide staff to fill in for nursing home workers who contract COVID-19 and must stay home .
All of this suggests that the looming shortage of elder care workers in the U.S. is likely to worsen , now that the pandemic has laid bare many of the problems in the industry . “ It ’ s a two-way street . We need to pay them a rate commensurate with all we ’ re asking of them and support them , ” Grabowski says . “ Otherwise they ’ re not going to be there to do this . ”
The response to coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes has varied by state . In Maryland— where nursing home residents and staff account for more than half the state ’ s coronavirus deaths — Gov . Larry Hogan required in early April that all nursing home workers wear masks at all times and then ordered testing of all residents and workers , whether they showed symptoms or not . In New York , Gov . Andrew Cuomo recently mandated twice-weekly COVID-19 testing of nursing home workers . But he also faced criticism from the nursing home industry and residents for originally directing long-term care facilities to accept back coronavirus patients released from the hospital . He walked back that policy on May 10 amid concerns that it would cause the virus to further spread within nursing homes .
On May 5 , Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker introduced legislation that would require nursing homes to provide workers with training in how to avoid COVID-19 exposure , sufficient personal protective equipment , increased testing and at least two weeks of paid sick leave . Parts of the bill were incorporated into the new $ 3 trillion pandemic relief package that passed the House , but that legislation is unlikely to become law as it faces overwhelming Republican opposition in the Senate .
Following complaints about a lack of transparency within nursing homes , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is now requiring them to report coronavirus cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , as well as to residents and their families . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) — which has received at least 230 COVID-19 complaints related to nursing homes — released guidance on May 14 aimed at reducing workers ’ exposure to the virus . It recommends that facilities encourage workers to stay home if they ’ re sick , develop a process for decontamination and reuse of protective gear , and train workers on how to protect themselves .
Debbie Berkowitz , program director for the worker safety and health program at the National Employment Law Project , says there needs to be stronger oversight at state and federal levels and that nursing homes should ramp up training of employees on treating COVID-19 and increase testing of workers and patients within their facilities . She says any solution will also hinge on staffers having enough protective equipment — a consistent obstacle for frontline workers .
“ Mentally , physically , emotionally , you ’ re fighting a disease . And on top of that , we have to fight administrators to give us protective gear , ” says Nicole Jefferson , a part-time CNA at Apple Rehab in Rocky Hill , Conn. , who thinks of her 3-year-old and 14-year-old daughters each time she enters a COVID-19 room . “ I don ’ t want to die . I don ’ t want my kids to die . What more can we do ? ”
An Apple Rehab administrator reached by phone said “ we have plenty of protective gear , ” but directed further questions to a spokesperson , who did not respond to a request for comment .
In Illinois , thousands of nursing home employees who are members of the SEIU Healthcare union had voted to strike on May 8 , before reaching a last-minute deal on a new contract . It includes an increase in base pay to $ 15 an hour , an extension of $ 2 hazard pay and five additional paid sick days for coronavirus .
The new contract also guarantees that staffers won ’ t be required to work without adequate protective equipment . But Francine Rico , a CNA at the Villa at Windsor Park nursing home in Chicago who was on the bargaining committee , says workers still don ’ t have enough . Rico says she was given a raincoat to wear for protection and takes care of her N95 mask “ like it ’ s gold . ”
“ How do they expect for this virus , this pandemic , to even lift if we ’ re still wearing the same PPE gear in and out of the rooms ? ” says Rico , 52 . The nursing home has had 143 cases of coronavirus and 33 deaths as of May 23 , according to data reported by the state .
In a statement , Villa at Windsor Park called its workers “ heroic ” and said the facility is screening staff for symptoms at the start and end of their shifts . “ In as much as there has been a national shortage of PPE , Villa at Windsor Park has at all times had sufficient levels PPE , including those necessary for infection control and personal protection , to ensure that we meet the needs within the center , ” the statement said .
Rico ’ s sister , Eartha Sears , is a CNA in the same facility and says she recently returned to work after using up all her sick time and vacation time while recovering from COVID-19 . “ I wish they ’ d [ use ] better judgment about safety — not just our safety , the residents ’ safety as well , ” says Sears , 56 . “ Because it ’ s not getting better , it ’ s getting worse . ”
Meanwhile , employees are contending with the mental and emotional toll of continuing to work in places ravaged by illness , losing residents and coworkers they ’ ve known for years .
“ They teach you when you ’ re in school as a CNA not to take any of this personally , ” says Beckford . “ But if you ’ re a human being with a heart , you ’ re going to feel something for the people that you ’ re working with for such a long time . ”
Beckford graduated with a master ’ s degree in 2018 , planning to transition into social work , but she stayed at the nursing home to continue caring for her oldest residents . “ Unfortunately , once I return to work , the majority of my residents will not be there , ” she says .
Milanes says many of the residents she cared for have died in the past two months . She says she recently received a job offer from a different nursing home , and she plans to start when she tests negative for COVID-19 . But everything about the career she once loved has changed .
“ Maybe I ’ m afraid because I cared about them , and I know that they ’ re all dead , ” she says . “ I ’ ve cried , I just don ’ t think that I ’ ve had time to really grieve . ”

She wasn’t feeling well and says she and her co-workers, facing a shortage of masks, gloves and gowns, had started wearing plastic trash bags over their uniforms for protection as they cared for infected residents.

Beckford, a certified nursing assistant (CNA) in the Alzheimer’s unit at Newington Rapid Recovery Rehab Center in Newington, Connecticut, had been running a low-grade fever but says the facility was only sending workers home if their temperature reached 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit — per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. In an effort to ensure there were enough staff to care for all the residents, Beckford says, employees had been told they were not allowed to take any more time off.

“I went to the administrator, like, ‘I am sick, and you guys are still keeping me in here, I don’t have the proper PPE (personal protective equipment) to work with now, and I just don’t want to die,'” says Beckford, 48. Days later, she tested positive for COVID-19.

The coronavirus pandemic has devastated nursing homes across the country. There have been more than 35,000 COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities, according to the Associated Press — a figure that accounts for about a third of the country’s coronavirus deaths. The industry has been sharply criticized by relatives of the dead, who’ve accused nursing homes of being slow to take action against the virus and of trying to dodge responsibility for their loved ones’ deaths. But nursing home employees, who face serious occupational hazards even in non-pandemic times, say they’re caught in an impossible situation and being blamed for problems rooted in America’s failed elder-care system.

They’re struggling to protect themselves and support their families on menial salaries while caring for a population that is among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Nursing home employees who contract COVID-19 have been forced to use up their limited sick time or vacation time, go without pay, or lose their jobs entirely. Through it all, they have dealt with grief and despair as elderly residents to whom they’ve become emotionally attached become sick with COVID-19 and die.

“The worst thing that I get upset about is hearing the word hero, hero, hero being thrown around for us. And no one is treating us as such. We feel disrespected,” says Beckford, who has been on sick leave since April 10 and is still recovering from pneumonia caused by the virus. “I would love to see them give us the proper PPE that we need, give us some kind of compensation, and for goodness sake, I don’t have any more vacation or sick time now, and the year is just beginning. Give me back some kind of compensation and put back my time.”

Newington Rapid Recovery Rehab Center denies Beckford’s allegations, including that employees were forced to use trash bags for protection. “At no time has our staff been without appropriate PPE. The building has been properly staffed throughout the crisis,” it said in a statement, adding: “We have been strictly following the CDC protocol for health care workers.” When she recovers, Beckford plans to return to work there.

But recent lawsuits — brought by relatives of nursing home workers who died of COVID-19 and by former nursing home employees — are drawing attention to the conditions within some facilities that workers say put them and patients at unreasonably high risk.

Carlenia Milanes, a licensed practical nurse, spent weeks unwittingly caring for COVID-19 patients at Alaris Health at Hamilton Park in Jersey City, N.J., while the facility initially prohibited employees from wearing masks, according to a lawsuit filed April 22. The suit claims the nursing home hid coronavirus cases from employees, “refused to test patients and pressured staff to work even if they had symptoms of the highly contagious and deadly disease, all while patients and staff alike were dying of COVID-19.”

On April 3, Milanes sent an email to Jersey City officials sounding an alarm and saying the nursing home’s strategy “is to put blinders on even at the cost of human life.” “Something needs to be done or more people and staff get sick and possibly die,” Milanes wrote, according to the lawsuit. “I need your help.”

Milanes, 28, called in sick for the following day after developing symptoms of COVID-19, but her suit alleges that she was told she would be fired if she didn’t present a doctor’s note. In her lawsuit, Milanes also alleges the facility allowed seemingly healthy residents to share rooms with residents who had symptoms of COVID-19.

By May 27, there were 110 COVID-19 cases among the facility’s residents, including 31 deaths, and 42 COVID-19 cases among staff, including two deaths, according to data reported to the state. Milanes was among the affected staff members; the COVID-19 test she took on April 6 came positive.

“I’m not afraid to work. I would take care of anyone, but if I’m sick, how am I going to be any good for a patient?” says Milanes, a single mother whose 7- and 10-year-old daughters have since shown symptoms of COVID-19 as well. “I’m somebody’s mother. I’m somebody’s sister. I’m somebody’s daughter. And granted yes, this is what I signed up for, but protect me.”

LaDawn Chapman, a CNA at the same facility, also filed a lawsuit against Alaris on April 22 that echoes many of Milanes’ allegations, including that the facility lacked adequate protective gear for employees and did not notify employees about coronavirus cases. The lawsuit says Chapman was likely exposed to COVID-19 through a patient and multiple coworkers and had a doctor’s note advising her to self-isolate for two weeks. She was told that unless she had symptoms of the disease, she had to come to work, her lawsuit alleges.

Both women say they were fired, but Alaris Health denies this. Five days after the suits were filed, Alaris Health sent each woman a letter saying they were “mistaken” about being fired and setting dates that each was expected to return to work. In a statement, Alaris spokesperson Matt Stanton also denied the lawsuits’ other allegations.

“I can tell you that each and every allegation in this case is false,” he said. “No employees were terminated. At no time was information withheld from staff, our residents or their loves ones [sic]. Thankfully, adequate PPE has never been an issue at any of our facilities. In fact Alaris required N95 masks and PPE for all staff well before the (New Jersey Department of Health) and CDC mandates. Finally, no employees were ever pressured to work while sick. Staff showing COVID-19 symptoms were sent home and required to adhere to strict return to work protocols as published by the NJ DOH.”

In Texas, Maurice Dotson, a CNA at West Oaks Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Austin, died on April 17 after contracting COVID-19. His mother sued the nursing home on May 13, accusing it of failing to provide staff with protective equipment and exposing workers and patients to “unreasonable risks of serious harm.” A spokesperson for West Oaks said Dotson “touched countless lives and was a respected and comforting presence,” but declined to comment on pending litigation.

Leaders in the long-term care industry have argued that nursing homes need more support and funding from state and federal governments. And the industry has sought immunity from potential lawsuits related to the pandemic, but the laws and executive orders granting them immunity from civil liability in some states, including New Jersey, might not protect them from all legal claims.

“While I understand that you can’t judge a nursing home that’s in the midst of a pandemic by the same standards you would on a regular day, it doesn’t give these nursing homes the license or the right to behave recklessly or engage in willful misconduct,” says Bill Matsikoudis, an attorney who is representing nursing home workers and residents in the lawsuits against Alaris Health at Hamilton Park.

‘It’s not getting better, it’s getting worse’

Infection control has long been a challenge in long-term care facilities, where hands-on care is a necessity, and the pandemic has exacerbated that problem. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, in a report released May 20, said that 82% of nursing homes surveyed from 2013 to 2017 were cited for infection prevention and control deficiencies.

Meanwhile, the median pay for nursing assistants was $29,640 last year — just above the national poverty level for a family of four, which is $26,200. By comparison, the median salary for a full-time worker last year was about $49,000, according to weekly earnings data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In part because of that low pay, many nursing home employees work second jobs, which increases their risk of contracting the virus and unwittingly carrying it to residents.

“If the aides were paid a living wage, they would not need to have multiple jobs,” says Joanne Spetz, director of the Health Workforce Research Center for Long-Term Care at the University of California, San Francisco. “That forces the workers to put themselves at more and more risk to support themselves, and that also puts their clients at risk and their residents at risk.”

And while staff shortages have long been an issue at nursing homes, the problem becomes worse when workers stay home sick. As their colleagues take on the extra work, the care and time they’re able to give patients suffers.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Despite White House claims , the U.S. still lacks a comprehensive battle plan against the coronavirus in critical areas including masks , testing , treatments and vaccines , whistleblower Rick Bright warned Thursday in testimony before a House committee . “ Our window of opportunity is closing , ” he declared .
The nation could face “ the darkest winter in modern history ” if the virus rebounds , the government vaccine scientist told lawmakers . Bright ’ s appearance came after his ouster last month as head of a Health and Human Services biodefense agency , an action he alleges was retaliation by the Trump administration .
“ We need still a comprehensive plan , and everyone across the government and everyone in America needs to know what that plan is , and what role they play , ” he told the House Energy and Commerce Committee . “ There are critical steps that we need to do to prepare ... we do not still have enough personal protective equipment to manage our health care workers ... we still do not have the supply chains ramped up for the drugs and vaccines , and we still don ’ t have plans in place for how we distribute those drugs and vaccines . We still do not have a comprehensive testing strategy . ”
At the White House , President Donald Trump said Bright looked like an “ angry , disgruntled employee , ” and Bright ’ s boss , HHS Secretary Alex Azar , said , “ Everything he is complaining about was achieved . ”
“ So this is like somebody who was in a choir and is now trying to say he was a soloist back then , ” Azar added .
Trump , said later , at a Pennsylvania medical equipment distributor , that the U.S. is ramping up production of COVID-19-related items and that his goal “ is to produce everything America needs for ourselves and then export to the world , including medicines . ”
Bright spoke in measured tones and rarely raised his voice during five hours of questioning . He didn ’ t question the fact that there ’ s now an all-out effort , financed by billions in taxpayer dollars , to procure masks and other supplies , develop better tests and treatments and discover an effective vaccine . His point was that those efforts aren ’ t being fitted together in a coherent strategy that will get supplies and medicines to where they ’ re most needed to protect people and prevent shortages and price gouging .
Asked by Rep. Joe Kennedy , D-Mass. , if administration officials have prepared the country for the “ moment we are in ” and the months ahead , Bright responded , “ I think we have a lot of work to do to be prepared . ”
Rep. Frank Pallone , D-N.J. , asked if he should be concerned that Americans will have problems getting access to a vaccine when it ’ s available . Bright responded , “ Absolutely , sir . ”
Bright , a career official , alleges he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority after repeatedly warning higher-ups the virus outbreak was going to be worse than the public was being led to believe .
He said the breaking point came when he opposed a White House directive to allow widespread access to hydroxychloroquine , a malaria drug Trump was touting as an effective treatment .
The FDA recently warned against its use for COVID-19 , except in limited circumstances . But at the White House on Thursday , the president was still bullish . “ We ’ ve had tremendous response to the hydroxy , ” Trump said . “ So , a lot of people have sworn by it , and we ’ ll see . ”
Republican lawmakers for the most part were careful not to attack Bright directly . But Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma criticized him for continuing to collect his $ 285,000 salary while first on sick leave for a spike in blood pressure , and now on vacation as he tries to straighten out his work situation .
“ You ’ re too sick to go into work , but you ’ re well enough to come here while getting paid , ” said Mullin . “ I have a hard time understanding that . ”
Bright said one of the worst moments as he tried to raise alarms came when repeated efforts to jump-start U.S. production of respirator masks went nowhere .
He recalled getting emails in late January from Mike Bowen , an executive at a medical supply company called Prestige Ameritech , indicating that its N95 mask supply was “ completely decimated . ”
“ And he said : ‘ We ’ re in deep shit . The world is . And we need to act , ’ ” Bright said . “ And I pushed that forward to the highest levels I could in HHS and got no response . From that moment I knew that we were going to have a crisis for our health care workers because we were not taking action . ”
Following Bright to the witness table , Bowen told lawmakers he ’ s a Republican who voted for Trump . He paused then , and added that he admires Bright .
As part of his whistleblower complaint , Bright is seeking to be reinstated in his old job . A federal watchdog agency has found “ reasonable grounds ” that he was removed as a reprisal .
HHS , Bright ’ s employer , says it strongly disagrees with his allegations and says it reassigned him to a high-profile position helping to lead the development of new coronavirus tests at the National Institutes of Health .
Nearly 85,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. , representing more than one-fourth of global deaths and the world ’ s highest toll , according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University . Worldwide more than 4.4 million have been infected and about 300,000 have died .
Bright ’ s testimony followed this week ’ s warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci , the government ’ s top infectious disease expert , that a rushed lifting of store-closing and stay-at-home restrictions could “ turn back the clock , ” seeding more suffering and death and complicating efforts to get the economy rolling again .
Eager to restart the U.S. economy , Trump has been urging states to lift restrictions , and many governors are doing so gradually , though consumers remain leery of going back to restaurants , social events and sporting competitions .
Bright , who has a doctoral degree in immunology , said the nation ’ s path forward should be based on science . The steps include :
— Establishing a national testing strategy . The White House has urged states to take the lead on testing , even as the federal government pushes to make more tests and better ones widely available . Trump says the U.S. has “ prevailed ” on testing through this strategy , but in Congress Democrats are demanding a federal framework to encompass the whole nation .
— Doubling down on educating the public about basic safety measures such as frequent hand-washing and wearing masks in public places . “ Frankly , our leaders must lead by modeling the behavior , ” said Bright , in a not-too-subtle reference to a president who conspicuously goes maskless .
— Setting up a system to fairly distribute equipment and supplies that are scarce and highly sought . Eliminating state vs. state competition would increase efficiency and reduce costs .","Richard Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, arrives for a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health hearing to discuss protecting scientific integrity in response to the coronavirus outbreak, Thursday, May 14, 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington.

“We need still a comprehensive plan, and everyone across the government and everyone in America needs to know what that plan is, and what role they play,” he told the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “There are critical steps that we need to do to prepare ... we do not still have enough personal protective equipment to manage our health care workers ... we still do not have the supply chains ramped up for the drugs and vaccines, and we still don’t have plans in place for how we distribute those drugs and vaccines.

Asked by Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., if administration officials have prepared the country for the “moment we are in” and the months ahead, Bright responded, “I think we have a lot of work to do to be prepared.”

Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., asked if he should be concerned that Americans will have problems getting access to a vaccine when it’s available. Bright responded, “Absolutely, sir.”

Bright, a career official, alleges he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority after repeatedly warning higher-ups the virus outbreak was going to be worse than the public was being led to believe.

He said the breaking point came when he opposed a White House directive to allow widespread access to hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug Trump was touting as an effective treatment.

The FDA recently warned against its use for COVID-19, except in limited circumstances. But at the White House on Thursday, the president was still bullish. “We’ve had tremendous response to the hydroxy,” Trump said. “So, a lot of people have sworn by it, and we’ll see.”

Republican lawmakers for the most part were careful not to attack Bright directly. But Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma criticized him for continuing to collect his $285,000 salary while first on sick leave for a spike in blood pressure, and now on vacation as he tries to straighten out his work situation.

“You’re too sick to go into work, but you’re well enough to come here while getting paid,” said Mullin. “I have a hard time understanding that.”

Bright said one of the worst moments as he tried to raise alarms came when repeated efforts to jump-start U.S. production of respirator masks went nowhere.

He recalled getting emails in late January from Mike Bowen, an executive at a medical supply company called Prestige Ameritech, indicating that its N95 mask supply was “completely decimated.”

“And he said: ‘We’re in deep shit. The world is. And we need to act,’” Bright said. “And I pushed that forward to the highest levels I could in HHS and got no response. From that moment I knew that we were going to have a crisis for our health care workers because we were not taking action.”

Following Bright to the witness table, Bowen told lawmakers he’s a Republican who voted for Trump. He paused then, and added that he admires Bright.

As part of his whistleblower complaint, Bright is seeking to be reinstated in his old job. A federal watchdog agency has found “reasonable grounds” that he was removed as a reprisal.

HHS, Bright’s employer, says it strongly disagrees with his allegations and says it reassigned him to a high-profile position helping to lead the development of new coronavirus tests at the National Institutes of Health.

Nearly 85,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S., representing more than one-fourth of global deaths and the world’s highest toll, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide more than 4.4 million have been infected and about 300,000 have died.

Bright’s testimony followed this week’s warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci , the government’s top infectious disease expert, that a rushed lifting of store-closing and stay-at-home restrictions could “turn back the clock,” seeding more suffering and death and complicating efforts to get the economy rolling again.

Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak

Eager to restart the U.S. economy, Trump has been urging states to lift restrictions, and many governors are doing so gradually, though consumers remain leery of going back to restaurants, social events and sporting competitions.

Bright, who has a doctoral degree in immunology, said the nation’s path forward should be based on science. The steps include:

— Establishing a national testing strategy. The White House has urged states to take the lead on testing, even as the federal government pushes to make more tests and better ones widely available. Trump says the U.S. has “prevailed” on testing through this strategy, but in Congress Democrats are demanding a federal framework to encompass the whole nation.

— Doubling down on educating the public about basic safety measures such as frequent hand-washing and wearing masks in public places . “Frankly, our leaders must lead by modeling the behavior,” said Bright, in a not-too-subtle reference to a president who conspicuously goes maskless .

— Setting up a system to fairly distribute equipment and supplies that are scarce and highly sought. Eliminating state vs. state competition would increase efficiency and reduce costs.",www.apnews.com,center,CycQM0XP1YqYhL9u

coronavirus,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/23/coronavirus-congress-tries-break-stalemate-emergency-package/2897083001/,"Trump signals he may lift federal coronavirus guidelines, Congress at odds on rescue package",2020-03-23,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday said his administration is looking at ways to ease economic restrictions it stressed just days earlier even as the U.S. braces for a jump in coronavirus cases and states tighten restrictions on people and businesses .
`` I 'm not looking at months , '' Trump said of the duration of social distancing guidelines that have led to school and business closures . `` We will be back in business as a country pretty soon . ''
Trump ’ s suggestion comes as others are taking their most strict measures yet . On Monday , four U.S. states announced more rigid orders for residents and businesses , an International Olympic Committee member revealed this year 's games would be postponed and U.S. deaths approached 600 , according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard .
The federal government , Trump said , will use data `` to recommend new protocols ” to allow local economies to “ cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time . ''
He did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S .
The remarks were a major departure from Trump 's prediction just days ago that the guidelines could potentially be in place through the summer . Trump appeared to signal that parts of the country that are less hard hit could be placed under less strict guidelines than states like New York and California .
At the same time , Trump admitted the outbreak will only get worse in the U.S. Trump said he agreed with his surgeon general ’ s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump .
“ This is going to be bad , ” Trump said . “ We ’ re trying to make it so it ’ s much , much less bad . ”
President Donald Trump said Monday that first lady Melania Trump tested negative for coronavirus .
`` She 's great , she 's fine , '' said Trump , hesitating slightly before answering a question about his wife 's test : `` Negative . ''
Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence initially declined to be tested , noting that they did not have symptoms . But pressure grew for both officials amid reports that they had contact with others who tested positive . Pence 's office said last week that one of his aides tested positive for the virus .
Trump said he got the test only after facing questions from reporters .
President Donald Trump offered rare words of praise for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday .
Trump , a frequent critic of the central bank and especially its chairman , said Powell has done a good job in trying to boost the economy during the coronavirus pandemic . Trump said he even called Powell on Monday .
“ I called up Jerome Powell and said , Jerome , you ’ ve done a really good job , ” Trump told reporters . “ I was proud of him . ”
Just a little more than a week ago , Trump complained that the central bank needed to be “ more proactive ” and argued it had not done enough to juice the economy . But his criticism has softened since the Fed cut short-term interest rates to zero on March 15 .
“ That took courage , ” Trump said , adding that Powell did “ the right thing . ”
“ He has really stepped up over the last week , ” Trump said .
Asked if he has any regrets about how he has responded to the coronavirus pandemic , Trump said he had none . “ I think we ’ ve handled it really well , ” he said , adding that he looks forward , not backward .
Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation ’ s highly respected infectious disease expert , did not attend Monday ’ s briefing on coronavirus at the White House – an absence that reporters noticed immediately .
It was particularly noteworthy because Fauci gave a remarkably candid interview to Science magazine , posted Sunday evening , in which he admitted being at odds with Trump over several issues .
Trump said he had just been with Fauci and did not express any irritation with the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
“ He ’ s a good man . I like Dr. Fauci , ” Trump said . “ He ’ s not here because we weren ’ t discussing ” issues that he is best at addressing , the president said .
Asked if Fauci agrees with him on the need to reopen the economy soon , Trump said `` he does n't not agree . ''
Birx : If Paul followed guidelines , he would not have put other senators at risk
Dr. Deborah Birx , leader of the White House coronavirus task force , seemed to suggest Sen. Rand Paul , who has tested positive for COVID-19 , had not been adhering to the government ’ s social distancing guidelines .
“ Each person has to be responsible in the way that they decrease their interaction with others , ” she said . Everyone needs to keep six feet apart and assume that “ everyone you ’ re interacting with could be positive , '' she added .
Her remarks came in response to a question about contradictory messages : Birx and others have said that Americans should not get tested if they don ’ t have symptoms or exposure to the virus .
But Paul got tested even though he had no symptoms . In between taking the test and getting the results , Paul had lunch with other lawmakers and even went swimming in the Senate gym .
“ If he had been following these guidelines , he would n't have been infecting others because of the social distancing , washing your hands , doing everything that we talked about , ” Birx .
Dr. Deborah Birx , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said the U.S. is learning from China and South Korea .
`` The two areas that have moved through their curve is China and South Korea . So those are the two countries that we ’ re learning from . Those were 8-10 week curves . Each state and each hot spot in the United States is going to be its own curve because the seed came in at different times . ”
Trump declines to say whether he will ease social distancing measures
President Donald Trump declined to say directly that he would ease social distancing measures in order to restart the economy next week , but suggested guidelines could be different based on how hard a state or location has been hit .
“ You ’ ll see what happens , ” Trump said . `` It ’ s not going to be three or four months ” before life returns to normal , Trump said . “ Parts of our country are very lightly affected . ”
“ At a certain point we have to get open , ” Trump said . “ We have to get moving . We don ’ t want to lose these companies…We ’ ll be doing something relatively quickly . ”
President Donald Trump said he agreed with the surgeon general ’ s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump .
Trump said he agreed with the surgeon general ’ s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump .
“ This is going to be bad , ” Trump said . “ We ’ re trying to make it so it ’ s much , much less bad . ”
Trump said he agreed with public health officials that the death rate from the virus would be `` bad , '' but he also returned to comparing coronavirus to the seasonal flu .
`` It ’ s going to be bad , '' Trump said . `` We have a lot of people dying from the flu . Certainly this is going to be bad . And we ’ re trying to make it so that it ’ s much , much less bad . ''
Vice President Mike Pence said “ self-collected swabs ” for the coronavirus would soon be available , so Americans can test themselves for infection .
“ This will expedite the testing process , ” Pence said , and also “ reduce the risk to health care providers . ”
He said the tests would be available at clinics and drive-through testing sites , but did not say where or how soon .
Pence said the test is “ less invasive , '' collected at the end of the nasal passage . Trump and others have described the test as unpleasant because the swab goes so far up the nose .
Pence said 313,000 coronavirus tests have been completed in the U.S. A little more than 41,000 Americans have contracted the virus , he added .
Vice President Mike Pence said Facebook donated its reserve of over 700,000 masks , which they had because of wildfires in California .
`` Health workers urgently need more protective gear , '' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Sunday . `` To help , Facebook donated our emergency reserve of 720,000 masks that we had bought in case the wildfires continued . We 're also working on sourcing millions of more to donate . I hope you 're all staying healthy and safe ! ''
President Donald Trump abandoned the term `` Chinese virus '' in his opening remarks at a press conference about the coronavirus Monday , the first time he has done so in days .
Trump , who has drawn criticism for echoing the term , generally uses it in his opening remarks . Instead , Trump echoed an earlier tweet suggesting that Asian Americans should be `` protected '' and not blamed for a virus that researchers believe began in China .
`` The spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form , '' Trump said .
Trump had frequently referred to coronavirus as the “ Chinese virus ” despite mounting criticism among Asian-American advocates , health experts and Democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location-specific name stigmatizes ethnic groups .
Dr. Deborah Birx , a member of the White House coronavirus task force , said one child age 14 died of the virus in China , but no child under 15 has died of the virus in Europe .
“ That should be reassuring to the moms and dads out there , ” she said .
Birx also said the New York metro area of New Jersey , New York City and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to one in 1,000 , which fives times what other areas are seeing .
President Donald Trump said he signed an executive order to prohibit the hoarding medical equipment and supplies , including hand sanitizers and face masks .
The order designates certain medical supplies as `` scarce , '' he said , which makes it a crime to stockpile these items .
`` We will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit , '' Trump said .
U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department plans to identify cases in which hoarding may be interfering with efforts to address large medical supply shortages at hospitals across the country . Barr said the administration convened their first task force meeting to address issues of price gouging .
He added the Justice Department was not seeking out consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations , but people hoarding on an industrial scale .
“ If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house this is not something you have to worry about , '' he said . But if you 're hoarding masks in a warehouse , `` then you 're going to get a knock on the door . ''
Trump : new protocols being considered to allow local economies to 'cautiously resume '
President Donald Trump said Monday the federal government will use data `` to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time . ''
He did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S .
`` America will again , and soon , be open for business – a lot sooner than three or four months , which somebody was suggesting , '' he said .
Coronavirus : Should Congress move immediately to remote voting ? Sen. Rand Paul ’ s coronavirus diagnosis adds to debate
He said once the medical community “ gives the OK , ” certain places will be free to end the social distancing practices and other restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the virus .
Trump also encouraged Congress to pass a stimulus now being negotiated in the Senate .
`` Now Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written , and avoid playing any more partisan games , '' he said .
Trump said coronavirus started out as a medical problem , and the U.S. will not allow it to become a financial problem .
Trump announced the postponement for the deadline for compliance with real ID requirements .
Trump said the U.S. brought home 103 American citizens stranded in Brazil . Most of them were senior citizens .
Trump said 148 countries are now affected by coronavirus . But , `` we will be back in business as a country pretty soon . ''
President Donald Trump called for protecting the Asian American community on Monday amid criticism that by using the term “ Chinese virus ” to describe the coronavirus pandemic he has stigmatized Chinese Americans .
“ It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States , and all around the world , ” Trump tweeted Monday minutes before a White House briefing on coronavirus . “ They are amazing people , and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way , shape , or form . They are working closely with us to get rid of it . WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER ! ”
Coronavirus : Trump weighs easing of tough coronavirus guidelines amid growing alarm about economy
Trump reiterated his call to protect the Asian American community at a Monday evening press conference .
Trump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the “ Chinese virus ” despite mounting criticism among Asian-American advocates , health experts and Democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location-specific name stigmatizes certain ethnic groups .
The World Health Organization has urged people to be careful with language used to describe COVID-19 , insisting that it not be referred to as the `` Chinese '' or `` Wuhan '' virus . Any mention of location could lead to discrimination or stigmatization , the group warns . Researchers say coronavirus originated in China and Trump has defended his use of the term as “ accurate . ”
`` It 's not racist at all , no , '' Trump told reporters last week when pressed on the term . `` It comes from China . I want to be accurate . ''
Poll : More Americans approve of governors ' response to coronavirus than Trump 's
More Americans say the country 's governors are handling the unfolding coronavirus crisis better than President Donald Trump , according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday .
The poll found 72 % of Americans said they approved of their state governor 's response to COVID-19 compared to 50 % who said Trump was doing a good job . Just 18 % disapproved of their state 's governor while 45 % said Trump was doing a bad job dealing with the outbreak .
The poll also fell along partisan lines , with 89 % of Republicans , 48 % of Independents and 19 % of Democrats approving of Trump 's handling of the virus . The governors ' praise appeared to be more bipartisan with 73 % of Republicans , 76 % of Democrats and 67 % of Independents who said their governor was doing a good job .
The poll was conducted between March 18th and 22nd with a margin of error of 3.4 % .
House Democrats are proposing a financial rescue plan to help the nation recover from the coronavirus pandemic that , at $ 2.5 trillion , would dwarf the roughly $ 2 trillion package Republicans and the Trump administration have been touting .
The package , released Monday afternoon by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , would provide $ 1,500 to every individual , up to $ 7,500 for a family of five . The benefit “ would be available to anyone with an individual taxpayer identification number , as well as to our nation ’ s retirees and unemployed individuals , ” according to an outline obtained by ███ .
Eliminate medical costs for all Americans , even those uninsured , for treatments and vaccines ( When one is developed ) relating to COVID-19 .
Provide $ 150 billion to hospitals for costs related to fighting the disease .
Give up to $ 600 to workers affected by COVID-19 and eligible for unemployment compensation benefits .
Create a $ 500 billion pool of grants and interest-free loans for small businesses .
Supply nearly $ 60 billion for schools and universities to help them keep running .
Ensure states can carry out 2020 elections with $ 4 billion in grant funding for states ,
Imposes a national requirement that states provide both 15 days of early voting and “ no-excuse ” absentee vote-by-mail .
Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers , the top Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee , called the proposal “ left-wing nonsense . ”
“ While Americans are trying to figure out how to keep their loved ones safe and pay this month ’ s rent , Speaker Pelosi is trying to use this outbreak to her political advantage , ” he said . “ The House Democrats ’ bill is just a wish list of everything they haven ’ t been able to accomplish . ”
WASHINGTON – An effort in the Senate to move forward with a nearly $ 2 trillion economic stimulus package to combat the coronavirus crisis has stalled for the second day in a row over continued disagreements between Republicans and Democrats .
The largely party-line vote ( with Republican for and Democrats against ) was 49-46 to end debate and move forward . Sixty votes were needed to advance the measure for a final floor vote .
The measure is designed to provide direct payments to most Americans , throw a lifeline to small businesses shuttered across the country , and rescue large industries , such as the airlines , battered by the coronavirus crisis . But Democrats want more protections for workers from layoffs and loss of heath coverage , more money for states to deal with the crisis , and more aid for students facing student debt repayment .
After the vote , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell angrily dismissed the Democratic opposition as “ procedural obstruction ” that could delay a vote on the measure until the end of the week .
`` Democrats take responsibility for our workers who require that any corporation that takes taxpayer dollars must protect their workers wages and benefits , not CEO pay , stock buybacks or layoffs , '' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after the Senate vote . `` The Senate Republican bill put corporations first , but because of the insistence of leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats , progress has been made . ''
The State Department is tracking at least 13,500 Americans who are stranded abroad and need U.S. help getting back to the United States , a senior official told reporters on Monday .
The State Department has already brought about 5,000 Americans home from 17 countries , and officials are hoping to bring another 1,600 U.S. citizens back this week from countries across the globe .
“ We ’ re looking at 16 or so flights in the next five days and about 1,600 passengers identified for those flights with room for more , ” said this official , who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity .
“ It has been a lot of hard work and it is going to be a lot of hard work going forward , ” this person said . “ We are devoting all of our resources to this . ”
The State Department has set up a call center to help marooned Americans , but officials say the best way to get on the agency ’ s radar is to register online with the agency ’ s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program , called STEP .
“ The only way to find someone is if they are registering with STEP . That ’ s how we build the manifests for these flights , '' the person said .
The call center phone number is 202-501-4444 for those overseas and 888-407-4747 for those calling within the U.S. on behalf of stranded family or friends .
The Pentagon plans to deploy field hospitals to New York and Seattle later this week to help those cities deal with the coronavirus pandemic , Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday .
The Army ’ s largest field hospitals can accommodate 248 beds , he said . More of the mobile facilities will be offered in coming weeks . Meanwhile , the U.S. Navy ’ s hospital ship , the Mercy , is set to sail to Los Angeles as soon as today . The USS Comfort , the Navy ’ s other hospital ship , is being repaired . It is scheduled to sail to New York in April .
The disease has forced the military to cancel some training exercises , and Esper acknowledged that the virus could affect the Pentagon ’ s readiness to conduct combat missions if it worsens . He said 133 troops were being treated for the illness .
At the Pentagon , about 60 % of the workforce has been telecommuting , Esper said . Security has tightened , he said , and screening of visitors for fever may begin soon .
A day after announcing he became the first senator to contract coronavirus , Sen. Rand Paul urged his colleagues on Capitol Hill to get tested for COVID-19 as well .
“ I believe we need more testing immediately , even among those without symptoms , ” the Kentucky Republican said in a statement shared with reporters . “ I had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person . I had , however , traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate . That , together with the fact that I have a compromised lung , led me to seek testing . Despite my positive test result , I remain asymptomatic for COVID-19 . ”
Federal guidelines discourage testing for those who are not showing symptoms even if they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive or is believed to have been exposed .
What Congress is considering : Congress ' $ 2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package , visualized
“ For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine , realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee , I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol , ” Paul said . “ The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined . It was my extra precaution , out of concern for my damaged lung , that led me to get tested . ”
Paul is one three members of Congress , including Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart , R-Fla. , and Ben McAdams , D-Utah who have announced they ’ ve tested positive .
Tensions rose on the Senate floor Monday as lawmakers struggled to reach an agreement on a historic bailout package while the health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus continued to escalate .
“ Take a deep breath , ” Minority Whip Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , said as senators bickered over whose fault it is that there ’ s no deal yet . “ Everyone is emotional at this moment on both sides of the aisle . But we have a job to do . ”
Durbin ’ s comments came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , went after his Democratic counterparts – particularly House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif .
McConnell blamed Pelosi for undermining negotiations , saying things were going fine until she got involved .
“ Get with the program , ” McConnell said . “ It ’ s time to pass historic relief . The country doesn ’ t have time for these political games . ”
Durbin said he knows Pelosi “ really unnerves a lot of people on that side of the aisle . '' But , he said Pelosi wanting to be part of negotiations `` is not an outrageous idea . ”
At one point , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , blocked a routine request to speak from Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine .
Schumer said he objected to get clarity on the schedule as he continues to negotiate changes Democrats want to make to GOP package .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled on Monday a counter-offer to the GOP stimulus proposal that includes priorities congressional Democrats have been pushing for in round-the-clock negotiations with GOP leaders and the Trump administration .
Requiring President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to order private companies to manufacture respirators , masks and other needed equipment .
Using nearly $ 40 billion to help states stabilize school funding and help colleges continue operating during the crisis .
Giving states billions in grant funding to help hold elections , including expanding early , absentee and mail voting .
Speaking on a conference call with reporters , Pelosi said the bill Democrats would introduce this afternoon would be `` worker-oriented , not giving away the store '' to corporations .
Speaking on the Senate floor Monday , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , blamed Pelosi for undermining negotiations on a nearly $ 2 trillion package designed to provide direct payments to most Americans , throw a lifeline to small businesses , and rescue large industries , such as the airlines , battered by the coronavirus crisis .
“ We were this close and then the speaker of the House flew back from San Francisco ( Sunday ) and turned this into this left-wing episode of Supermarket Sweep , ” he said , referring to the TV game show where contestants race through a grocery store grabbing items before time runs out . “ Unrelated issues left and right . ''
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer remained optimistic a deal would be reached Monday .
“ We ’ re very close to reaching a deal . Very close . Our goal is to reach a deal today . And we ’ re hopeful , even confident , that we will meet that goal , ” said Schumer , D-N.Y . But , he added , “ We have the obligation to get the details right . ”
Republican governors in Maryland and Massachusetts on Monday ordered the closure of non-essential businesses , stopping short of shelter-in-place orders but taking the most drastic actions to date in both states .
The Maryland order goes into effect 5 p.m. EDT , while the Massachusetts order begins Tuesday at noon and extends to April 7 .
Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan said he felt the measure was necessary because too many people were ignoring his order to avoid crowds of 10 or more , `` literally endangering the lives '' of others .
The executive orders in both states do not include industries deemed essential in guidelines issued last week by the federal government such as health care , food , agriculture , energy , first responders , transportation and public works . Liquor stores will also be exempt and restaurants can continue to serve to-go food .
“ By taking this action now , we can significantly improve our position in this fight to slow down the spread of this virus , ” Massachusetts Gov . Charlie Baker said .
Baker issued a stay-at-home advisory , which urges everyone to stay home and limit `` unnecessary activities , '' but he made clear he does n't believe ordering people to their homes is the right call .

He added : “ There ’ s been a lot of talk about a government mandating people shelter in their homes . I do not believe I can or should order U.S. citizens to be confined to their homes days on end . It doesn ’ t make sense from a public health point of view and it ’ s not realistic . ”
In Massachusetts , there have been 646 confirmed cases of the coronaries virus and five deaths . Maryland has 288 confirmed cases .
In Indiana , Gov . Eric Holcomb ordered his state 's residents to remain in their homes except for certain permitted activities , such as caring for others and ordering supplies .
Dozens of House lawmakers are calling on House leaders to adopt a temporary rule that allows remote voting by members during national emergencies , such as the current coronavirus crisis .
“ My constituents need a voice in Congress right now , ” Rep. Eric Swalwell , D-Calif. , said after he and 66 other members asked the Rules Committee to make the change . “ It is critical that no matter how this crisis develops , I can continue to advocate for working families in my district—no matter where I am physically . And every Member of Congress should be able to do the same . ”
The request to the Rules Committee , which is examining the issue , comes a day after Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul ’ s announcement that he tested positive for COVID-19 rattled the Senate . Nearly three dozen congressional lawmakers have announced steps to self-quarantine , or otherwise isolate themselves as a precaution .
North Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer backed the change as well , tweeting that “ extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures . ”
Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin implored his colleagues to move to remote voting during a speech on the Senate floor Monday , calling it “ naïve for us to believe that that is the end of the challenge to our membership . ”
“ We should not be physically present on this floor at this moment , ” said Durbin , the No . 2 Senate Democrat . “ Too many of our colleagues and their families are falling prey to this disease . ”
Not long after he spoke , Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri could be seen wiping down the desk of the presiding officer after taking over floor duties as debate continued .
Pressure was building on Congress to break its logjam on a coronavirus rescue package .
Stocks slid again Monday despite the Federal Reserve ’ s decision to launch an expansion of lending programs to help the economy .
A week after the U.S. markets posted their worst week since the financial crisis , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down as much as 500 points in the opening minutes of trading .
The Fed said it plans to purchase an unlimited amount of Treasurys and mortgage securities in a bid to support financial markets . It also said that it would purchase commercial mortgage-backed securities as part of an expansion in its asset purchases , known in the market as quantitative easing .

“ We ’ ve got a lot of promise from the Fed , but they ’ re still going to need help from Congress , ” says Scott Colyer , chief executive at Advisors Asset Management . “ Does the Fed ’ s latest move solve our virus problem ? No . Does it solve our unemployment problem ? No . But it does allow markets to function . At the end of last week , we were sorely in need of that . ”
On anniversary of signing , Obama says ACA needed more than ever
Former President Barack Obama recognized the 10-year-anniversary of his signing of the Affordable Care Act Monday in a tweet about the significance of the landmark law to the current health care crisis .
“ It ’ s still under attack right when we need care the most , ” Obama tweeted . “ We have to protect it , build on it , until we cover everyone . ”
The law expanding health insurance coverage and protections is once again in the courts , under a challenge brought by Republican attorneys general that is supported by the Trump administration .
Former Vice President Joe Biden , who famously described the law as a “ big ( expletive ) deal ” in a private comment that was picked up by a microphone at the bill signing ceremony , sent a letter to Trump and the lead GOP attorneys general Monday urging them to drop the lawsuit . Biden is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump in the fall .
Trump was asked Sunday at the daily White House briefing on the coronavirus whether he would reconsider his position because of the pandemic .
“ What we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care , ” Trump said .
The administration has not put forward an alternative to ACA after Republicans in Congress were unable to pass their bill .
The U.S. Supreme Court , which has already upheld the law twice , will take up the latest suit in their next term . It ’ s likely to be scheduled for oral argument in the fall and a decision in 2021 .
The husband of Sen. Amy Klobuchar has been hospitalized with COVID-19 and pneumonia , the Minnesota Democrat and former presidential candidate announced Monday .
Klobuchar said she is not getting tested for the virus , on the advice of her doctor , because she and her husband have not been together for the past two weeks and she is outside the 14-day period for getting sick .
“ As everyone is aware , there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don ’ t qualify to get one under any standard , ” Klobuchar said in a statement .
She said her husband , John Bessler , professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law , immediately quarantined himself when he started to feel sick even though he thought it was just a cold .
But his high temperature and bad cough persisted . When he started coughing up blood , he got tested and was checked into a Virginia hospital because his blood showed low oxygen levels , among other concerns . Bessler is now receiving oxygen but is not on a ventilator , according to Klobuchar ’ s statement .
“ I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease , ” Klobuchar said . She and their daughter , Abigail , have been “ constantly calling and texting and emailing . ”
Bessler is the first congressional spouse who is known to have COVID-19 .
Three members of Congress – Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , and Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart , R-Fla. , and Ben McAdams , D-Utah – have announced they ’ ve tested positive .
The Pentagon reported Monday that cases of coronavirus had nearly doubled to 243 troops , their family members and civilian employees .
That ’ s an increase of 119 patients since Friday when the number of cases totaled 124 .
On Sunday , the Navy announced that three special warfare sailors training in Washington state had tested positive for the disease . They join a Navy commando who was diagnosed with COVID-19 last month .
Of the 243 COVID-19 cases , 133 are troops , seven of whom are hospitalized . Over the weekend , the Pentagon also reported its first death , that of a contract employee . So far , four troops and one civilian employee have recovered .
President Donald Trump signaled in a tweet overnight that he is considering lifting social distancing guidelines that may be slowing the spread of the coronavirus but are hurting the economy .
“ WE CAN NOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF , ” Trump posted on Twitter just before midnight in Washington . “ AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD , WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO ! ”
Missed opportunity : The US had a chance to learn from anthrax , SARS , H1N1 and Ebola . So why is the federal coronavirus response so messy ?
Public health officials , including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , have recommended Americans work from home when they can and not congregate at restaurants or other businesses . The administration rolled out a 15-day plan on March 16 to “ bend the curve ” of new coronavirus cases .
Many of those officials , including Surgeon General Jerome Adams , have said that two weeks is “ likely not enough time ” to halt the spread of the virus in the country .
“ If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now , we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus , ” Trump said at the time . “ And we 're going to have a big celebration all together . ”
Trump retweeted two users Monday morning who used similar language to urge that , at the end of 15 days , only “ high risk groups ” be isolated and that the rest of Americans go “ back to work . ”
Yet the restrictions are having a major impact on the economy . The Labor Department reported a 30 % increase in unemployment claims last week . James Bullard , president of the St. Louis branch of the Federal Reserve Bank , predicted the unemployment rate could hit 30 % in the U.S .
Several states , including New York , California and Illinois , have imposed stricter social distancing requirements . Even if Trump eased the federal guidelines next week it would not affect orders signed by governors in those and other states .
Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , has become the face of the White House 's scientific and medical response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak , frequently appearing alongside President Donald Trump during task force news conferences .
But he and the president have not always agreed on the facts surrounding the outbreak .
Remote voting : Tradition-bound Congress considers voting remotely as coronavirus illnesses hit home
For example , after Trump played up a drug used to treat malaria as a potential `` game-changer '' in the fight against coronavirus , Fauci said the only evidence that the drug could be helpful was `` anecdotal . '' Fauci has also contradicted Trump on the timetable for a vaccine and the severity of the outbreak .
In an interview with Science magazine , Fauci said that he and Trump do n't disagree on substantive issues .
`` Even though we disagree on some things , he listens . He goes his own way . He has his own style , '' Fauci said . `` But on substantive issues , he does listen to what I say . ''
But he said during news conferences , the president says things `` in a way that I would not express it , because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject . ''
When asked about Trump 's claim that China could have told the world about the coronavirus three or four months earlier , Fauci grew defensive .
`` What do you want me to do ? I mean , seriously Jon , let ’ s get real , what do you want me to do ? '' he asked Science staff writer Jon Cohen .
As Congress negotiates over the stimulus package , here are the main sticking points :
Both sides want to give businesses a lifeline amid shutdowns that threaten to plunge the economy into a deep recession . Democrats want tough provisions to prevent corporations that receive federal bailouts from later engaging in stock buybacks that enrich their executives . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said his bill already includes Democrats ' demands for conditions on loans and other aide to major businesses .
Democrats have called for provisions that would temporarily block evictions and foreclosures as families struggle with lost income . They also want additional funding for food stamps and an expansion of unemployment benefits .
Democrats and Republicans are also wrangling over how much money should go to hospitals and health providers to help them deal with the crisis .
The Senate will try again Monday to break its logjam over an emergency stimulus package intended to stem the damage from the coronavirus pandemic . Democrats , who are pushing for more restrictions on corporate bailouts , negotiated late into the night with the Trump administration on the details of the legislation .
The impasse in Congress weighed heavily on the battered stock market , which had its worst week since the financial crisis last week .
On Sunday evening , futures for the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 900 points while Standard & Poor ’ s 500 futures fell 5 % , triggering an automatic shock absorber .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , blasted Democrats Sunday for opposing the GOP-crafted coronavirus rescue package and said he hoped they would have a “ change of heart ” after the U.S. financial markets opened Monday morning . McConnell noted there were already signs of another bad day on Wall Street as Congress remained gridlocked over how to help laid-off workers and shuttered businesses .","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday said his administration is looking at ways to ease economic restrictions it stressed just days earlier even as the U.S. braces for a jump in coronavirus cases and states tighten restrictions on people and businesses.

""I'm not looking at months,"" Trump said of the duration of social distancing guidelines that have led to school and business closures. ""We will be back in business as a country pretty soon.""

Trump’s suggestion comes as others are taking their most strict measures yet. On Monday, four U.S. states announced more rigid orders for residents and businesses, an International Olympic Committee member revealed this year's games would be postponed and U.S. deaths approached 600, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.

The federal government, Trump said, will use data ""to recommend new protocols” to allow local economies to “cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time.""

Coronavirus:Trump signals growing impatience with coronavirus-related economic shutdowns

He did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.

The remarks were a major departure from Trump's prediction just days ago that the guidelines could potentially be in place through the summer. Trump appeared to signal that parts of the country that are less hard hit could be placed under less strict guidelines than states like New York and California.

At the same time, Trump admitted the outbreak will only get worse in the U.S. Trump said he agreed with his surgeon general’s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump.

“This is going to be bad,” Trump said. “We’re trying to make it so it’s much, much less bad.”

Trump: first lady Melania Trump tests negative for coronavirus

President Donald Trump said Monday that first lady Melania Trump tested negative for coronavirus.

""She's great, she's fine,"" said Trump, hesitating slightly before answering a question about his wife's test: ""Negative.""

Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence initially declined to be tested, noting that they did not have symptoms. But pressure grew for both officials amid reports that they had contact with others who tested positive. Pence's office said last week that one of his aides tested positive for the virus.

Trump said he got the test only after facing questions from reporters.

Trump offers rare praise for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell

President Donald Trump offered rare words of praise for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday.

Trump, a frequent critic of the central bank and especially its chairman, said Powell has done a good job in trying to boost the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said he even called Powell on Monday.

“I called up Jerome Powell and said, Jerome, you’ve done a really good job,” Trump told reporters. “I was proud of him.”

Just a little more than a week ago, Trump complained that the central bank needed to be “more proactive” and argued it had not done enough to juice the economy. But his criticism has softened since the Fed cut short-term interest rates to zero on March 15.

“That took courage,” Trump said, adding that Powell did “the right thing.”

“He has really stepped up over the last week,” Trump said.

Asked if he has any regrets about how he has responded to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump said he had none. “I think we’ve handled it really well,” he said, adding that he looks forward, not backward.

Where is Fauci?

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s highly respected infectious disease expert, did not attend Monday’s briefing on coronavirus at the White House – an absence that reporters noticed immediately.

It was particularly noteworthy because Fauci gave a remarkably candid interview to Science magazine, posted Sunday evening, in which he admitted being at odds with Trump over several issues.

Trump said he had just been with Fauci and did not express any irritation with the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

“He’s a good man. I like Dr. Fauci,” Trump said. “He’s not here because we weren’t discussing” issues that he is best at addressing, the president said.

Asked if Fauci agrees with him on the need to reopen the economy soon, Trump said ""he doesn't not agree.""

Birx: If Paul followed guidelines, he would not have put other senators at risk

Dr. Deborah Birx, leader of the White House coronavirus task force, seemed to suggest Sen. Rand Paul, who has tested positive for COVID-19, had not been adhering to the government’s social distancing guidelines.

“Each person has to be responsible in the way that they decrease their interaction with others,” she said. Everyone needs to keep six feet apart and assume that “everyone you’re interacting with could be positive,"" she added.

Her remarks came in response to a question about contradictory messages: Birx and others have said that Americans should not get tested if they don’t have symptoms or exposure to the virus.

But Paul got tested even though he had no symptoms. In between taking the test and getting the results, Paul had lunch with other lawmakers and even went swimming in the Senate gym.

“If he had been following these guidelines, he wouldn't have been infecting others because of the social distancing, washing your hands, doing everything that we talked about,” Birx.

Birx: US learning from China South Korea

Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said the U.S. is learning from China and South Korea.

""The two areas that have moved through their curve is China and South Korea. So those are the two countries that we’re learning from. Those were 8-10 week curves. Each state and each hot spot in the United States is going to be its own curve because the seed came in at different times.”

Trump declines to say whether he will ease social distancing measures

President Donald Trump declined to say directly that he would ease social distancing measures in order to restart the economy next week, but suggested guidelines could be different based on how hard a state or location has been hit.

“You’ll see what happens,” Trump said. ""It’s not going to be three or four months” before life returns to normal, Trump said. “Parts of our country are very lightly affected.”

“At a certain point we have to get open,” Trump said. “We have to get moving. We don’t want to lose these companies…We’ll be doing something relatively quickly.”

Trump agrees coronavirus cases will jump

President Donald Trump said he agreed with the surgeon general’s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump.

Trump said he agreed with the surgeon general’s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump.

“This is going to be bad,” Trump said. “We’re trying to make it so it’s much, much less bad.”

Trump said he agreed with public health officials that the death rate from the virus would be ""bad,"" but he also returned to comparing coronavirus to the seasonal flu.

""It’s going to be bad,"" Trump said. ""We have a lot of people dying from the flu. Certainly this is going to be bad. And we’re trying to make it so that it’s much, much less bad.""

Pence: 'self-collected swabs' for tests will soon be available

Vice President Mike Pence said “self-collected swabs” for the coronavirus would soon be available, so Americans can test themselves for infection.

“This will expedite the testing process,” Pence said, and also “reduce the risk to health care providers.”

He said the tests would be available at clinics and drive-through testing sites, but did not say where or how soon.

Pence said the test is “less invasive,"" collected at the end of the nasal passage. Trump and others have described the test as unpleasant because the swab goes so far up the nose.

Pence said 313,000 coronavirus tests have been completed in the U.S. A little more than 41,000 Americans have contracted the virus, he added.

Pence: Facebook donated more than 700,000 masks

Vice President Mike Pence said Facebook donated its reserve of over 700,000 masks, which they had because of wildfires in California.

""Health workers urgently need more protective gear,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Sunday. ""To help, Facebook donated our emergency reserve of 720,000 masks that we had bought in case the wildfires continued. We're also working on sourcing millions of more to donate. I hope you're all staying healthy and safe!""

Trump abandons 'Chinese virus' in opening remarks

President Donald Trump abandoned the term ""Chinese virus"" in his opening remarks at a press conference about the coronavirus Monday, the first time he has done so in days.

Trump, who has drawn criticism for echoing the term, generally uses it in his opening remarks. Instead, Trump echoed an earlier tweet suggesting that Asian Americans should be ""protected"" and not blamed for a virus that researchers believe began in China.

""The spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form,"" Trump said.

Trump had frequently referred to coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” despite mounting criticism among Asian-American advocates, health experts and Democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location-specific name stigmatizes ethnic groups.

Birx: no child under 15 has died in Europe

Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said one child age 14 died of the virus in China, but no child under 15 has died of the virus in Europe.

“That should be reassuring to the moms and dads out there,” she said.

Birx also said the New York metro area of New Jersey, New York City and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to one in 1,000, which fives times what other areas are seeing.

Trump signs order prohibiting hoarding

President Donald Trump said he signed an executive order to prohibit the hoarding medical equipment and supplies, including hand sanitizers and face masks.

The order designates certain medical supplies as ""scarce,"" he said, which makes it a crime to stockpile these items.

""We will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit,"" Trump said.

Barr: Hoarders, expect 'a knock on the door'

U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department plans to identify cases in which hoarding may be interfering with efforts to address large medical supply shortages at hospitals across the country. Barr said the administration convened their first task force meeting to address issues of price gouging.

He added the Justice Department was not seeking out consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations, but people hoarding on an industrial scale.

“If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house this is not something you have to worry about,"" he said. But if you're hoarding masks in a warehouse, ""then you're going to get a knock on the door.""

Trump: new protocols being considered to allow local economies to 'cautiously resume'

President Donald Trump said Monday the federal government will use data ""to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time.""

He did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.

""America will again, and soon, be open for business – a lot sooner than three or four months, which somebody was suggesting,"" he said.

Coronavirus:Should Congress move immediately to remote voting? Sen. Rand Paul’s coronavirus diagnosis adds to debate

He said once the medical community “gives the OK,” certain places will be free to end the social distancing practices and other restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the virus.

Trump also encouraged Congress to pass a stimulus now being negotiated in the Senate.

""Now Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written, and avoid playing any more partisan games,"" he said.

What else was said at the news conference:

Trump said coronavirus started out as a medical problem, and the U.S. will not allow it to become a financial problem.

Trump announced the postponement for the deadline for compliance with real ID requirements.

Trump said the U.S. brought home 103 American citizens stranded in Brazil. Most of them were senior citizens.

Trump said 148 countries are now affected by coronavirus. But, ""we will be back in business as a country pretty soon.""

Trump: 'We totally protect our Asian American community'

President Donald Trump called for protecting the Asian American community on Monday amid criticism that by using the term “Chinese virus” to describe the coronavirus pandemic he has stigmatized Chinese Americans.

“It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,” Trump tweeted Monday minutes before a White House briefing on coronavirus. “They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!”

Coronavirus:Trump weighs easing of tough coronavirus guidelines amid growing alarm about economy

Trump reiterated his call to protect the Asian American community at a Monday evening press conference.

Trump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” despite mounting criticism among Asian-American advocates, health experts and Democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location-specific name stigmatizes certain ethnic groups.

The World Health Organization has urged people to be careful with language used to describe COVID-19, insisting that it not be referred to as the ""Chinese"" or ""Wuhan"" virus. Any mention of location could lead to discrimination or stigmatization, the group warns. Researchers say coronavirus originated in China and Trump has defended his use of the term as “accurate.”

""It's not racist at all, no,"" Trump told reporters last week when pressed on the term. ""It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""

Poll: More Americans approve of governors' response to coronavirus than Trump's

More Americans say the country's governors are handling the unfolding coronavirus crisis better than President Donald Trump, according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday.

The poll found 72% of Americans said they approved of their state governor's response to COVID-19 compared to 50% who said Trump was doing a good job. Just 18% disapproved of their state's governor while 45% said Trump was doing a bad job dealing with the outbreak.

The poll also fell along partisan lines, with 89% of Republicans, 48% of Independents and 19% of Democrats approving of Trump's handling of the virus. The governors' praise appeared to be more bipartisan with 73% of Republicans, 76% of Democrats and 67% of Independents who said their governor was doing a good job.

The poll was conducted between March 18th and 22nd with a margin of error of 3.4%.

What's in the Democrats' stimulus counter-offer?

House Democrats are proposing a financial rescue plan to help the nation recover from the coronavirus pandemic that, at $2.5 trillion, would dwarf the roughly $2 trillion package Republicans and the Trump administration have been touting.

The package, released Monday afternoon by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would provide $1,500 to every individual, up to $7,500 for a family of five. The benefit “would be available to anyone with an individual taxpayer identification number, as well as to our nation’s retirees and unemployed individuals,” according to an outline obtained by USA TODAY.

The plan also would:

Eliminate medical costs for all Americans, even those uninsured, for treatments and vaccines (When one is developed) relating to COVID-19.

Provide $150 billion to hospitals for costs related to fighting the disease.

Give up to $600 to workers affected by COVID-19 and eligible for unemployment compensation benefits.

Create a $500 billion pool of grants and interest-free loans for small businesses.

Supply nearly $60 billion for schools and universities to help them keep running.

Ensure states can carry out 2020 elections with $4 billion in grant funding for states,

Imposes a national requirement that states provide both 15 days of early voting and “no-excuse” absentee vote-by-mail.

Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, the top Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee, called the proposal “left-wing nonsense.”

“While Americans are trying to figure out how to keep their loved ones safe and pay this month’s rent, Speaker Pelosi is trying to use this outbreak to her political advantage,” he said. “The House Democrats’ bill is just a wish list of everything they haven’t been able to accomplish.”

Stimulus package stalls again in Senate

WASHINGTON – An effort in the Senate to move forward with a nearly $2 trillion economic stimulus package to combat the coronavirus crisis has stalled for the second day in a row over continued disagreements between Republicans and Democrats.

The largely party-line vote (with Republican for and Democrats against) was 49-46 to end debate and move forward. Sixty votes were needed to advance the measure for a final floor vote.

The measure is designed to provide direct payments to most Americans, throw a lifeline to small businesses shuttered across the country, and rescue large industries, such as the airlines, battered by the coronavirus crisis. But Democrats want more protections for workers from layoffs and loss of heath coverage, more money for states to deal with the crisis, and more aid for students facing student debt repayment.

After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell angrily dismissed the Democratic opposition as “procedural obstruction” that could delay a vote on the measure until the end of the week.

""Democrats take responsibility for our workers who require that any corporation that takes taxpayer dollars must protect their workers wages and benefits, not CEO pay, stock buybacks or layoffs,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after the Senate vote. ""The Senate Republican bill put corporations first, but because of the insistence of leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, progress has been made.""

State Department tracking 13,000 Americans stranded abroad

The State Department is tracking at least 13,500 Americans who are stranded abroad and need U.S. help getting back to the United States, a senior official told reporters on Monday.

The State Department has already brought about 5,000 Americans home from 17 countries, and officials are hoping to bring another 1,600 U.S. citizens back this week from countries across the globe.

“We’re looking at 16 or so flights in the next five days and about 1,600 passengers identified for those flights with room for more,” said this official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.

“It has been a lot of hard work and it is going to be a lot of hard work going forward,” this person said. “We are devoting all of our resources to this.”

The State Department has set up a call center to help marooned Americans, but officials say the best way to get on the agency’s radar is to register online with the agency’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, called STEP.

“The only way to find someone is if they are registering with STEP. That’s how we build the manifests for these flights,"" the person said.

The call center phone number is 202-501-4444 for those overseas and 888-407-4747 for those calling within the U.S. on behalf of stranded family or friends.

Pentagon to deploy field hospitals to New York, Seattle

The Pentagon plans to deploy field hospitals to New York and Seattle later this week to help those cities deal with the coronavirus pandemic, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday.

The Army’s largest field hospitals can accommodate 248 beds, he said. More of the mobile facilities will be offered in coming weeks. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy’s hospital ship, the Mercy, is set to sail to Los Angeles as soon as today. The USS Comfort, the Navy’s other hospital ship, is being repaired. It is scheduled to sail to New York in April.

The disease has forced the military to cancel some training exercises, and Esper acknowledged that the virus could affect the Pentagon’s readiness to conduct combat missions if it worsens. He said 133 troops were being treated for the illness.

At the Pentagon, about 60% of the workforce has been telecommuting, Esper said. Security has tightened, he said, and screening of visitors for fever may begin soon.

Rand Paul: people without symptoms need testing

A day after announcing he became the first senator to contract coronavirus, Sen. Rand Paul urged his colleagues on Capitol Hill to get tested for COVID-19 as well.

“I believe we need more testing immediately, even among those without symptoms,” the Kentucky Republican said in a statement shared with reporters. “I had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person. I had, however, traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate. That, together with the fact that I have a compromised lung, led me to seek testing. Despite my positive test result, I remain asymptomatic for COVID-19.”

Federal guidelines discourage testing for those who are not showing symptoms even if they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive or is believed to have been exposed.

What Congress is considering:Congress' $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, visualized

“For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol,” Paul said. “The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined. It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested.”

Paul is one three members of Congress, including Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah who have announced they’ve tested positive.

'This is unbelievable': Senators get testy over stimulus delay

Tensions rose on the Senate floor Monday as lawmakers struggled to reach an agreement on a historic bailout package while the health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus continued to escalate.

“Take a deep breath,” Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said as senators bickered over whose fault it is that there’s no deal yet. “Everyone is emotional at this moment on both sides of the aisle. But we have a job to do.”

Durbin’s comments came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., went after his Democratic counterparts – particularly House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

McConnell blamed Pelosi for undermining negotiations, saying things were going fine until she got involved.

“Get with the program,” McConnell said. “It’s time to pass historic relief. The country doesn’t have time for these political games.”

Durbin said he knows Pelosi “really unnerves a lot of people on that side of the aisle."" But, he said Pelosi wanting to be part of negotiations ""is not an outrageous idea.”

At one point, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blocked a routine request to speak from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.

“Oh, come on,” Collins said. “This is unbelievable.”

Schumer said he objected to get clarity on the schedule as he continues to negotiate changes Democrats want to make to GOP package.

Pelosi unveils counter-offer to GOP stimulus bill

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled on Monday a counter-offer to the GOP stimulus proposal that includes priorities congressional Democrats have been pushing for in round-the-clock negotiations with GOP leaders and the Trump administration.

It includes:

Requiring President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to order private companies to manufacture respirators, masks and other needed equipment.

Providing more workers guaranteed paid family and medical leave.

Using nearly $40 billion to help states stabilize school funding and help colleges continue operating during the crisis.

Giving states billions in grant funding to help hold elections, including expanding early, absentee and mail voting.

Speaking on a conference call with reporters, Pelosi said the bill Democrats would introduce this afternoon would be ""worker-oriented, not giving away the store"" to corporations.

Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blamed Pelosi for undermining negotiations on a nearly $2 trillion package designed to provide direct payments to most Americans, throw a lifeline to small businesses, and rescue large industries, such as the airlines, battered by the coronavirus crisis.

“We were this close and then the speaker of the House flew back from San Francisco (Sunday) and turned this into this left-wing episode of Supermarket Sweep,” he said, referring to the TV game show where contestants race through a grocery store grabbing items before time runs out. “Unrelated issues left and right.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer remained optimistic a deal would be reached Monday.

“We’re very close to reaching a deal. Very close. Our goal is to reach a deal today. And we’re hopeful, even confident, that we will meet that goal,” said Schumer, D-N.Y. But, he added, “We have the obligation to get the details right.”

Maryland, Massachusetts, Indiana tighten coronavirus measures

Republican governors in Maryland and Massachusetts on Monday ordered the closure of non-essential businesses, stopping short of shelter-in-place orders but taking the most drastic actions to date in both states.

The Maryland order goes into effect 5 p.m. EDT, while the Massachusetts order begins Tuesday at noon and extends to April 7.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he felt the measure was necessary because too many people were ignoring his order to avoid crowds of 10 or more, ""literally endangering the lives"" of others.

The executive orders in both states do not include industries deemed essential in guidelines issued last week by the federal government such as health care, food, agriculture, energy, first responders, transportation and public works. Liquor stores will also be exempt and restaurants can continue to serve to-go food.

“By taking this action now, we can significantly improve our position in this fight to slow down the spread of this virus,” Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said.

Baker issued a stay-at-home advisory, which urges everyone to stay home and limit ""unnecessary activities,"" but he made clear he doesn't believe ordering people to their homes is the right call.

He added: “There’s been a lot of talk about a government mandating people shelter in their homes. I do not believe I can or should order U.S. citizens to be confined to their homes days on end. It doesn’t make sense from a public health point of view and it’s not realistic.”

In Massachusetts, there have been 646 confirmed cases of the coronaries virus and five deaths. Maryland has 288 confirmed cases.

In Indiana, Gov. Eric Holcomb ordered his state's residents to remain in their homes except for certain permitted activities, such as caring for others and ordering supplies.

67 House members call for remote voting

Dozens of House lawmakers are calling on House leaders to adopt a temporary rule that allows remote voting by members during national emergencies, such as the current coronavirus crisis.

“My constituents need a voice in Congress right now,” Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said after he and 66 other members asked the Rules Committee to make the change. “It is critical that no matter how this crisis develops, I can continue to advocate for working families in my district—no matter where I am physically. And every Member of Congress should be able to do the same.”

The request to the Rules Committee, which is examining the issue, comes a day after Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul’s announcement that he tested positive for COVID-19 rattled the Senate. Nearly three dozen congressional lawmakers have announced steps to self-quarantine, or otherwise isolate themselves as a precaution.

North Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer backed the change as well, tweeting that “extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.”

Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin implored his colleagues to move to remote voting during a speech on the Senate floor Monday, calling it “naïve for us to believe that that is the end of the challenge to our membership.”

“We should not be physically present on this floor at this moment,” said Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. “Too many of our colleagues and their families are falling prey to this disease.”

Not long after he spoke, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri could be seen wiping down the desk of the presiding officer after taking over floor duties as debate continued.

Fed says it will purchase securities to support markets

Pressure was building on Congress to break its logjam on a coronavirus rescue package.

Stocks slid again Monday despite the Federal Reserve’s decision to launch an expansion of lending programs to help the economy.

A week after the U.S. markets posted their worst week since the financial crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down as much as 500 points in the opening minutes of trading.

The Fed said it plans to purchase an unlimited amount of Treasurys and mortgage securities in a bid to support financial markets. It also said that it would purchase commercial mortgage-backed securities as part of an expansion in its asset purchases, known in the market as quantitative easing.

Remote voting:Tradition-bound Congress considers voting remotely as coronavirus illnesses hit home

“We’ve got a lot of promise from the Fed, but they’re still going to need help from Congress,” says Scott Colyer, chief executive at Advisors Asset Management. “Does the Fed’s latest move solve our virus problem? No. Does it solve our unemployment problem? No. But it does allow markets to function. At the end of last week, we were sorely in need of that.”

On anniversary of signing, Obama says ACA needed more than ever

Former President Barack Obama recognized the 10-year-anniversary of his signing of the Affordable Care Act Monday in a tweet about the significance of the landmark law to the current health care crisis.

“It’s still under attack right when we need care the most,” Obama tweeted. “We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone.”

The law expanding health insurance coverage and protections is once again in the courts, under a challenge brought by Republican attorneys general that is supported by the Trump administration.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who famously described the law as a “big (expletive) deal” in a private comment that was picked up by a microphone at the bill signing ceremony, sent a letter to Trump and the lead GOP attorneys general Monday urging them to drop the lawsuit. Biden is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump in the fall.

Trump was asked Sunday at the daily White House briefing on the coronavirus whether he would reconsider his position because of the pandemic.

“What we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care,” Trump said.

The administration has not put forward an alternative to ACA after Republicans in Congress were unable to pass their bill.

The U.S. Supreme Court, which has already upheld the law twice, will take up the latest suit in their next term. It’s likely to be scheduled for oral argument in the fall and a decision in 2021.

Klobuchar’s husband hospitalized with COVID-19

The husband of Sen. Amy Klobuchar has been hospitalized with COVID-19 and pneumonia, the Minnesota Democrat and former presidential candidate announced Monday.

Klobuchar said she is not getting tested for the virus, on the advice of her doctor, because she and her husband have not been together for the past two weeks and she is outside the 14-day period for getting sick.

“As everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don’t qualify to get one under any standard,” Klobuchar said in a statement.

She said her husband, John Bessler, professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, immediately quarantined himself when he started to feel sick even though he thought it was just a cold.

But his high temperature and bad cough persisted. When he started coughing up blood, he got tested and was checked into a Virginia hospital because his blood showed low oxygen levels, among other concerns. Bessler is now receiving oxygen but is not on a ventilator, according to Klobuchar’s statement.

“I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease,” Klobuchar said. She and their daughter, Abigail, have been “constantly calling and texting and emailing.”

Bessler is the first congressional spouse who is known to have COVID-19.

Three members of Congress – Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah – have announced they’ve tested positive.

Pentagon: COVID-19 cases nearly double over weekend

The Pentagon reported Monday that cases of coronavirus had nearly doubled to 243 troops, their family members and civilian employees.

That’s an increase of 119 patients since Friday when the number of cases totaled 124.

On Sunday, the Navy announced that three special warfare sailors training in Washington state had tested positive for the disease. They join a Navy commando who was diagnosed with COVID-19 last month.

Of the 243 COVID-19 cases, 133 are troops, seven of whom are hospitalized. Over the weekend, the Pentagon also reported its first death, that of a contract employee. So far, four troops and one civilian employee have recovered.

Trump signals he may lift federal coronavirus guidelines

President Donald Trump signaled in a tweet overnight that he is considering lifting social distancing guidelines that may be slowing the spread of the coronavirus but are hurting the economy.

“WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” Trump posted on Twitter just before midnight in Washington. “AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!”

Missed opportunity:The US had a chance to learn from anthrax, SARS, H1N1 and Ebola. So why is the federal coronavirus response so messy?

Public health officials, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have recommended Americans work from home when they can and not congregate at restaurants or other businesses. The administration rolled out a 15-day plan on March 16 to “bend the curve” of new coronavirus cases.

Many of those officials, including Surgeon General Jerome Adams, have said that two weeks is “likely not enough time” to halt the spread of the virus in the country.

“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus,” Trump said at the time. “And we're going to have a big celebration all together.”

Trump retweeted two users Monday morning who used similar language to urge that, at the end of 15 days, only “high risk groups” be isolated and that the rest of Americans go “back to work.”

Yet the restrictions are having a major impact on the economy. The Labor Department reported a 30% increase in unemployment claims last week. James Bullard, president of the St. Louis branch of the Federal Reserve Bank, predicted the unemployment rate could hit 30% in the U.S.

Several states, including New York, California and Illinois, have imposed stricter social distancing requirements. Even if Trump eased the federal guidelines next week it would not affect orders signed by governors in those and other states.

Fauci addresses Trump's coronavirus claims

Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become the face of the White House's scientific and medical response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, frequently appearing alongside President Donald Trump during task force news conferences.

But he and the president have not always agreed on the facts surrounding the outbreak.

Remote voting:Tradition-bound Congress considers voting remotely as coronavirus illnesses hit home

For example, after Trump played up a drug used to treat malaria as a potential ""game-changer"" in the fight against coronavirus, Fauci said the only evidence that the drug could be helpful was ""anecdotal."" Fauci has also contradicted Trump on the timetable for a vaccine and the severity of the outbreak.

In an interview with Science magazine, Fauci said that he and Trump don't disagree on substantive issues.

""Even though we disagree on some things, he listens. He goes his own way. He has his own style,"" Fauci said. ""But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.""

But he said during news conferences, the president says things ""in a way that I would not express it, because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject.""

When asked about Trump's claim that China could have told the world about the coronavirus three or four months earlier, Fauci grew defensive.

""What do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let’s get real, what do you want me to do?"" he asked Science staff writer Jon Cohen.

Why can't Congress agree?

As Congress negotiates over the stimulus package, here are the main sticking points:

Both sides want to give businesses a lifeline amid shutdowns that threaten to plunge the economy into a deep recession. Democrats want tough provisions to prevent corporations that receive federal bailouts from later engaging in stock buybacks that enrich their executives. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said his bill already includes Democrats' demands for conditions on loans and other aide to major businesses.

Democrats have called for provisions that would temporarily block evictions and foreclosures as families struggle with lost income. They also want additional funding for food stamps and an expansion of unemployment benefits.

Democrats and Republicans are also wrangling over how much money should go to hospitals and health providers to help them deal with the crisis.

Senate to convene at noon EDT

The Senate will try again Monday to break its logjam over an emergency stimulus package intended to stem the damage from the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats, who are pushing for more restrictions on corporate bailouts, negotiated late into the night with the Trump administration on the details of the legislation.

Senators are planning to reconvene at noon.

The impasse in Congress weighed heavily on the battered stock market, which had its worst week since the financial crisis last week.

On Sunday evening, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 900 points while Standard & Poor’s 500 futures fell 5%, triggering an automatic shock absorber.

The Senate is expected to convene at noon EDT.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blasted Democrats Sunday for opposing the GOP-crafted coronavirus rescue package and said he hoped they would have a “change of heart” after the U.S. financial markets opened Monday morning. McConnell noted there were already signs of another bad day on Wall Street as Congress remained gridlocked over how to help laid-off workers and shuttered businesses.

So , there 's two ways to do that . Either natural exposure out in the environment or a vaccination campaign , and what we 're really looking to do to be able to restart society , if we do n't have a widely available vaccine . It 's going to start little by little with people who 've been exposed naturally . Once we have a vaccine that works and we can roll it out on a larger scale , then we 're looking at trying to reach something like 80 % , 85 % of the population either receiving a vaccine or being able to demonstrate that they have antibodies against the coronavirus . That will give us enough protection that if a new case is imported from somewhere else , from some other hot spot , that there will be enough who are not able to get infected , that the virus does n't spread through the community at that exponential rate that we 're seeing right now .
LG : Megan , I think we 're going to take a quick break shortly and then come back to you for the second half of the show . But I did want to ask you quickly about antibodies because we 're hearing a lot about this at the same time that we 're hearing about vaccine development . And I imagine that there 's some confusion for people who just are generally thinking about this as a cure for coronavirus . And of course , we know there is no cure currently , but what are the basics that people need to understand about the difference between blood plasma donations and how antibodies might help us counter the effects of coronavirus and what a vaccine would do ?
MM : Yeah , that 's a really good question and an important distinction to make . So , the antibodies that people would be receiving through a plasma donation would be antibodies that they would be getting from someone who has already been exposed to the virus . Those antibodies can prime that person 's immune system and help them fight off that virus . So , we should be thinking about it as a treatment . Those antibodies are n't going to last forever , they 're going to eventually get broken down by that person 's body . In order to have longer lasting immunity , that person needs to have what are called B cells or memory cells that are actually producing their own antibodies . And that 's a different process . That would basically involve either having a vaccine or being exposed to the virus directly to jumpstart that pathway . So , when we 're talking about antibodies received through a plasma donation , think of it like a treatment that 's on the short order of I believe we 're talking about days to weeks , but what you would need to boost the immune system while you 're in the thick of an infection .
MC : All right , let 's take a quick break and then when we come back , we 're going to talk about testing .
MC : Welcome back . While developing a vaccine for the coronavirus may be a drawn out , complicated effort , developing a test for the virus is much easier , or at least it should be . But there 's been a shortage of tests here in the United States and issues with the reliability of tests on top of that . Megan , can you tell us why are we having such a difficult time with testing ?
MM : Man , I wish I had an easy answer , but every week it 's really something new . So , at first the bottleneck in testing was that the FDA had only approved a single testing protocol in the US , so this was a test developed by the CDC in Atlanta . And what happened was that that test relies on a technology called RTPCR , which has to happen in a lab . You have to have a PCR machine , you have to have people who know how to use it . And at first the CDC was the only lab that was doing that testing . After the FDA approved the CDC protocol under this emergency use authorization , then the test from the CDC went out to all the public health labs in the US . Then there turned out to be a problem with those test kits , one of the reagents had an issue . It was not coming up with the right results , so that slowed things down a bit as well . Once the CDC issued new test kits , those went back out to the public health labs around the states and they started trying to ramp up their production .","MM: Yeah, so there's two ways of achieving herd immunity, which herd immunity being enough people have immunity to the virus that they're able to form a protective wall around people who remain vulnerable. So, there's two ways to do that. Either natural exposure out in the environment or a vaccination campaign, and what we're really looking to do to be able to restart society, if we don't have a widely available vaccine. It's going to start little by little with people who've been exposed naturally. Once we have a vaccine that works and we can roll it out on a larger scale, then we're looking at trying to reach something like 80%, 85% of the population either receiving a vaccine or being able to demonstrate that they have antibodies against the coronavirus. That will give us enough protection that if a new case is imported from somewhere else, from some other hot spot, that there will be enough who are not able to get infected, that the virus doesn't spread through the community at that exponential rate that we're seeing right now.

LG: Megan, I think we're going to take a quick break shortly and then come back to you for the second half of the show. But I did want to ask you quickly about antibodies because we're hearing a lot about this at the same time that we're hearing about vaccine development. And I imagine that there's some confusion for people who just are generally thinking about this as a cure for coronavirus. And of course, we know there is no cure currently, but what are the basics that people need to understand about the difference between blood plasma donations and how antibodies might help us counter the effects of coronavirus and what a vaccine would do?

MM: Yeah, that's a really good question and an important distinction to make. So, the antibodies that people would be receiving through a plasma donation would be antibodies that they would be getting from someone who has already been exposed to the virus. Those antibodies can prime that person's immune system and help them fight off that virus. So, we should be thinking about it as a treatment.

LG: Got it. Thank you for explaining that.

MC: All right, let's take a quick break and then when we come back, we're going to talk about testing.

What’s happening

One of the most intensely debated topics in the U.S. since the start of the coronavirus pandemic has been testing, specifically whether the country is doing enough testing to accurately track the outbreak. Health experts agree that testing capacity is critical, but they also point to another element in an effective virus response that hasn’t gotten nearly as much attention: contact tracing.

Contact tracing is the process of tracking down anyone who has come into contact with an infected person, letting them know they may be at risk and telling them to isolate themselves so they don’t pass it on to more people. Effective tracing can break the chain of transmission and limit isolated outbreaks before they spread into the broader community.

Experts agree that a robust tracing system will be a key part of containing the virus in the U.S. as lockdown restrictions are gradually lifted. The Trump administration’s coronavirus plan calls for national contract tracing, but the programs are being carried out by individual states.

Estimates suggest the U.S. will need anywhere between 100,000 to 300,000 contact tracers to successfully contain the virus. In addition to human tracers, some tech companies have developed apps to aid contact tracing using phone data.

Why there’s debate

A major reason why epidemiologists believe contact tracing will help fight the coronavirus is because it’s worked in the past. In the 1940s, the U.S. government enlisted an elite cadre of highly trained health experts to track a pervasive outbreak of venereal disease. Since then, contact tracing has been a key element of efforts to combat a variety of pathogens, including smallpox, AIDS and Ebola. More recently, contact tracing has been a major part of the response of the most successful coronavirus response plans, like those in South Korea and Germany.

With proper investment, the U.S. has the opportunity to mobilize a nationwide corps of contract tracers, public health experts say. Though tracing can be complex, it requires no special skill or experience, meaning the country has a vast potential workforce of recently unemployed workers who could be hired.

Despite its potential, some experts express doubt that the U.S. can carry out an effective contact tracing program. Without a nationwide plan, tracing programs have been left up to the states, leading to a patchwork of systems across the country. There’s also concern that the country is too late in getting tracing systems up and running. According to research by NPR, there were 11,000 tracers working in the U.S., and most states’ plans for future hiring fell well short of estimates of how many tracers would be needed. Others say the U.S. still doesn’t have the testing capacity to identify asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, a step that’s necessary before tracing can begin.

Even a properly staffed system could be overwhelmed by the size of the outbreak in the U.S., especially if lifting lockdown restrictions leads to a surge in new infections, some experts fear. The effort may also be hampered because years of persistent robocalls have made people reluctant to answer calls from unknown numbers. Those who do answer may consider questions about personal health as a violation of privacy and refuse to answer.

What’s next

Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion stimulus bill that includes money to fund states’ contract tracing programs. The Republican-led Senate is expected to consider its own legislation to boost the economy when it returns from recess at the beginning of June. It’s unclear whether additional funding for contact tracing will be included in that bill.

Over 1 million Americans have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection , with 52,525 deaths as reported by the COVID Tracking Project through 28 April 2020 .
Those are big numbers , yet there are increasing signs the spread of COVID-19 is decelerating , though some states are still seeing growing numbers of cases . Here 's what the daily progression of cumulative coronavirus testing , confirmations , hospitalizations , and deaths look like when tracked at the national level in a tower chart over the seven weeks from 10 March 2020 through 21 April 2020 .
Starting from 22 April 2020 , the volume of testing in the U.S. has kicked up into a higher gear , with anywhere from 190,000 to 314,000 tests results now being recorded per day . In the last week , the overall 'test positivity ' rate of daily testing has dropped below 15 % for the nation , confirming the expansion of testing beyond those suspected of having been infected by the coronavirus that originated in China .
The following chart shows the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 reported within the U.S. each day during the seven weeks since 10 March 2020 when time series data became available .
A sudden transition from exponential to relatively steady growth appears to have taken place on 4 April 2020 , with the number of new cases showing noisy day-to-day volatility in the weeks since , with since of further slowing in the past week . The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 each day has lagged behind the overall case count , with a peak having been reached on 21 April 2020 .
The changes affecting the national pattern are actually taking place at the state and local level , where a more mixed picture continues to be present in the pandemic 's seventh week in the U.S. Those changes may be seen in the following skyline tower charts , where you can start to see some of the improvements that have begun to take place . Each of these charts span the same period of time and the width of each corresponds to 2.0 % of each state or territory 's population , making it very easy to see which states and territories have been most impacted and which have been the least impacted through the first seven weeks of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S. , especially since we 've ranked them from the highest percentage of infection within the state 's population to the least as you read from left-to-right , top-to-bottom .
This is the first weekly update for which we have n't needed to adjust the horizontal scale of the charts .
If you look at the top row of the chart , you can see the growth in cases in the state of New York continues to slow , though they are still at a level that puts New York at the top of the list for states and territories most impacted by the coronavirus . The other state we highlighted last week , Louisiana , is considerably further along in showing a trend of improvement , which is allowing it to drop down to fifth place in our skyline chart rankings . Both states are now reporting much higher numbers of recovered coronavirus cases among their populations .
The highly ranked states of New Jersey , Massachusetts , Rhode Island and Connecticut however continue to show a widening base of coronavirus cases , though not at the level that the state of New York experienced . We 've been updating New York 's situation separately on a daily basis , where you can catch up with the latest analysis here . There has been some very disturbing news about Governor Andrew Cuomo and his administration 's management of New York 's coronavirus epidemic in the news during the past week , which goes a long way to understanding why the state 's death count has been so much higher than what other states and many countries have experienced .
Here 's our series of articles featuring the data visualization we developed to cover the story :
Meanwhile , if you prefer your data in the form of tables presenting numbers and percentages , we also have you covered !","The seventh week of the global coronavirus epidemic in the U.S. has come to an end. Over 1 million Americans have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, with 52,525 deaths as reported by the COVID Tracking Project through 28 April 2020.

Those are big numbers, yet there are increasing signs the spread of COVID-19 is decelerating, though some states are still seeing growing numbers of cases. Here's what the daily progression of cumulative coronavirus testing, confirmations, hospitalizations, and deaths look like when tracked at the national level in a tower chart over the seven weeks from 10 March 2020 through 21 April 2020.

To see the daily progression chart, click here.

Starting from 22 April 2020, the volume of testing in the U.S. has kicked up into a higher gear, with anywhere from 190,000 to 314,000 tests results now being recorded per day. In the last week, the overall 'test positivity' rate of daily testing has dropped below 15% for the nation, confirming the expansion of testing beyond those suspected of having been infected by the coronavirus that originated in China.

The following chart shows the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 reported within the U.S. each day during the seven weeks since 10 March 2020 when time series data became available.

To see that chart, click here.

A sudden transition from exponential to relatively steady growth appears to have taken place on 4 April 2020, with the number of new cases showing noisy day-to-day volatility in the weeks since, with since of further slowing in the past week. The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 each day has lagged behind the overall case count, with a peak having been reached on 21 April 2020.

The changes affecting the national pattern are actually taking place at the state and local level, where a more mixed picture continues to be present in the pandemic's seventh week in the U.S. Those changes may be seen in the following skyline tower charts, where you can start to see some of the improvements that have begun to take place. Each of these charts span the same period of time and the width of each corresponds to 2.0% of each state or territory's population, making it very easy to see which states and territories have been most impacted and which have been the least impacted through the first seven weeks of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S., especially since we've ranked them from the highest percentage of infection within the state's population to the least as you read from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

To see the state-by-state chart, click here.

This is the first weekly update for which we haven't needed to adjust the horizontal scale of the charts.

If you look at the top row of the chart, you can see the growth in cases in the state of New York continues to slow, though they are still at a level that puts New York at the top of the list for states and territories most impacted by the coronavirus. The other state we highlighted last week, Louisiana, is considerably further along in showing a trend of improvement, which is allowing it to drop down to fifth place in our skyline chart rankings. Both states are now reporting much higher numbers of recovered coronavirus cases among their populations.

The highly ranked states of New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut however continue to show a widening base of coronavirus cases, though not at the level that the state of New York experienced. We've been updating New York's situation separately on a daily basis, where you can catch up with the latest analysis here. There has been some very disturbing news about Governor Andrew Cuomo and his administration's management of New York's coronavirus epidemic in the news during the past week, which goes a long way to understanding why the state's death count has been so much higher than what other states and many countries have experienced.

Whether that immune response is enough to protect someone from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 remains unclear , according to several experts who reviewed the results .
Moderna 's chief medical officer Tal Zaks said although the protective effect of the vaccine ca n't technically be known yet , all indications are that mRNA-1273 will be safe and effective .
Zaks said the levels of protective antibodies produced by the trial participants were similar to those found in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 , suggesting that the candidate vaccine provides the same protection as an infection . Animal studies show mRNA-1273 can protect mice against infection , he said , and trials in primates and Syrian hamsters are underway .
The mRNA-1273 candidate did not generate a kind of immune cell that in other diseases made vaccinated people worse off , Zaks said .
The clinical trial was led by Anthony Fauci ’ s Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health . The experimental vaccine is being created quickly . On March 16 , two months after Chinese scientists revealed the virus ’ s genetic sequence , a volunteer in Seattle was injected . That set a record for getting a candidate vaccine into human trials .
In the trial , 45 participants were divided in three groups – one that received a high dose , one a medium dose and one a low dose . Each person got two shots , a month apart .
All the reactions in the two lower dose groups were mild : More than half suffered minor fatigue , chills , headache or muscle pain , as is typical with vaccines . Three of those who received the highest dose had a severe reaction after the second shot , according to the study , including one participant whose fever spiked to 103 .
The highest dose , 250 micrograms , was dropped from later stage trials , and only the 100-microgram dose will be proposed for use in people .
All the participants showed evidence of an immune reaction , which is the goal of immunization . COVID-19 is so new it 's not clear how much of an immune reaction will be needed to protect against infection .
`` It looks like their vaccine was able to induce a virus neutralizing antibody , which is positive , '' said Dr. Peter Hotez , dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston . `` But it 's hard to know if the level of virus neutralizing antibody will be sufficient to induce protective immunity , or if it compares favorably with other ( vaccine ) candidates . ''
`` These are good results , '' said Dr. Nadine Rouphael , who helped lead the trial at Emory University School of Medicine .
She agreed with Hotez that it 's too early to know whether the vaccine will be protective . Neutralizing antibodies are key for fighting other infections , she said , but there are a lot of questions about COVID-19 .
`` How long will they stay , what 's the right level of protection remains to be determined , '' she said Tuesday .
Learning whether the vaccine is protective will require a much larger study . A so-called Phase 3 trial with 30,000 participants is slated to begin July 27 , Zak confirmed .
One challenge , Rouphael said , will be to find trial participants who naturally catch COVID-19 . In trials for a Zika vaccine , the disease was brought under control , and it was very difficult to determine whether the vaccine was protective , because no one was catching it , she said .
Thousands of people volunteered for the small Phase 1 trial , Rouphael said , and she hopes people will continue to sign up for the research .
The novel coronavirus works by invading human cells , then forcing them to reproduce the virus in high volumes . One way to stop the disease could be to get the body to produce antibodies in advance that would prevent the virus from penetrating cells . Though the results show people injected produce antibodies , it ’ s not known whether that protects them from getting sick .
Moderna relies on a technology the company compared to digitizing vaccines . Rather than injecting someone with a weakened or dead virus , Moderna uses genetic material to trick the body into producing the critical antibodies before a person gets infected . Moderna was founded in 2011 , but it has not successfully produced a vaccine .
The company , which went public in 2018 , will join the NASDAQ-100 , which includes the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market , based on market capitalization , the company announced Tuesday .
Paul Offit , a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at the University of Pennsylvania , said it is n't easy to understand what 's going on in the immune system after vaccinations . Offit helped develop a vaccine against rotavirus , testing it in 35,000 infants and getting blood samples from all of them .
The vaccine worked in most babies , he said , but even with so many blood samples , researchers never figured out what was different about the immune systems of the babies who did n't get protection . `` You 'd think we 'd be able to say here 's why they were n't protected , '' he said , but `` we could n't find an immune correlate . ''
The goal is to have a vaccine ready in limited batches by January , or at the latest next summer . There is no way to tell whether either of those timetables are feasible . Historically , vaccines take many years to develop .

All the participants showed evidence of an immune reaction, which is the goal of immunization. COVID-19 is so new it's not clear how much of an immune reaction will be needed to protect against infection.

""It looks like their vaccine was able to induce a virus neutralizing antibody, which is positive,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""But it's hard to know if the level of virus neutralizing antibody will be sufficient to induce protective immunity, or if it compares favorably with other (vaccine) candidates.""

""These are good results,"" said Dr. Nadine Rouphael, who helped lead the trial at Emory University School of Medicine.

She agreed with Hotez that it's too early to know whether the vaccine will be protective. Neutralizing antibodies are key for fighting other infections, she said, but there are a lot of questions about COVID-19.

""How long will they stay, what's the right level of protection remains to be determined,"" she said Tuesday.

Learning whether the vaccine is protective will require a much larger study. A so-called Phase 3 trial with 30,000 participants is slated to begin July 27, Zak confirmed.

One challenge, Rouphael said, will be to find trial participants who naturally catch COVID-19. In trials for a Zika vaccine, the disease was brought under control, and it was very difficult to determine whether the vaccine was protective, because no one was catching it, she said.

Thousands of people volunteered for the small Phase 1 trial, Rouphael said, and she hopes people will continue to sign up for the research.

The novel coronavirus works by invading human cells, then forcing them to reproduce the virus in high volumes. One way to stop the disease could be to get the body to produce antibodies in advance that would prevent the virus from penetrating cells. Though the results show people injected produce antibodies, it’s not known whether that protects them from getting sick.

Moderna relies on a technology the company compared to digitizing vaccines. Rather than injecting someone with a weakened or dead virus, Moderna uses genetic material to trick the body into producing the critical antibodies before a person gets infected. Moderna was founded in 2011, but it has not successfully produced a vaccine.

The company, which went public in 2018, will join the NASDAQ-100, which includes the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization, the company announced Tuesday.

Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, said it isn't easy to understand what's going on in the immune system after vaccinations. Offit helped develop a vaccine against rotavirus, testing it in 35,000 infants and getting blood samples from all of them.

The vaccine worked in most babies, he said, but even with so many blood samples, researchers never figured out what was different about the immune systems of the babies who didn't get protection. ""You'd think we'd be able to say here's why they weren't protected,"" he said, but ""we couldn't find an immune correlate.""

The goal is to have a vaccine ready in limited batches by January, or at the latest next summer. There is no way to tell whether either of those timetables are feasible. Historically, vaccines take many years to develop.

Trump ’ s defenders , however , assert he is simply fulfilling the traditional role of a president in trying to bolster morale during a crisis .

Second , there is his history of downplaying the threat from the coronavirus and then revising history to make it appear as if he had not done so .
For example , on Feb. 26 , Trump said the 15 cases then known in the United States “ within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero. ” By March 17 , he would claim at a news conference , “ This is a pandemic . I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic . ”

“ This should have been stopped in China , ” he said during Sunday ’ s Fox News event , held at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington . “ It should have been stopped .

Is Rice telling the truth?

Specifically, Rice alleged the Trump administration ignored pandemic preparedness, while, of course, claiming the Obama administration prioritized such readiness as ""a top national security priority.""

However, research indicates this is not completely accurate.

In fact, the Obama administration significantly depleted the national stockpile of medical equipment containing N95 respirator masks and other personal protection equipment that has now become vital in the face of COVID-19.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , and other Democratic lawmakers are accusing the Trump administration of unfairly targeting Planned Parenthood amid reports that some affiliated health care centers are being pressured by the government to return federally-funded , potentially forgivable small business loans granted through the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) during the coronavirus pandemic .
In a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Small Business Administration ( SBA ) Administrator Jovita Carranza , Democrats argue that by seeking to reclaim the PPP funds , the SBA is taking an `` ideologically-driven action '' in order to `` score political points for this administration by attacking nonprofit health care providers . ''
The lawmakers add that `` the administration 's longstanding campaign against reproductive health generally , and Planned Parenthood specifically , strongly suggests that Planned Parenthood is being arbitrarily singled out amongst over 4.3 million loans that have been issued under this program . ''
Forty Democratic senators and one independent senator endorsed the letter .
The SBA has notified at least three Planned Parenthood affiliates that they should return their PPP loans . It 's unclear if other clinics have been contacted .

`` Like many other local nonprofits and health care providers , some independent Planned Parenthood 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations applied for and were awarded loans under the eligibility rules established by the CARES Act and the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) , which they met , '' Jacqueline Ayers , Planned Parenthood Federation of America 's vice president of government relations and public policy , said in a statement .
Those eligibility rules , outlined by the SBA , allow for most businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 500 workers to qualify for PPP . But Republicans have argued that since Planned Parenthood Federation of America has organizational control over its affiliates , and it should be considered as one large enterprise with too many employees to qualify for the lending program .
In their own letter last week , Senate Republicans urged the Department of Justice to open an investigation into reports that Planned Parenthood affiliates received roughly $ 80 million from the program .
However Planned Parenthood says that because the individual affiliates that received PPP loans have their own governing boards , they must be considered as smaller , standalone entities that lawfully qualify for the program .

Here’s how I’m dealing with coronavirus fears.,2020-03-10,"Lux Alptraum, Sean Illing, Li Zhou, Alex Ward, Dylan Scott, Cameron Peters, Zeeshan Aleem","Over the past few weeks , as the Covid-19 coronavirus has made its way around the world , I ’ ve found myself preoccupied with worry . Am I washing my hands enough ? Am I touching my face ? What am I touching on the subway ? What if I get infected and don ’ t realize it , and unknowingly pass on the virus to older or immunocompromised loved ones ? Maybe I should start wearing a surgical mask when I visit my parents . Maybe I should stop visiting my parents . Maybe I should stop leaving the house .
As someone who lives with OCD , I ’ m used to having my anxious thoughts take over — and , thanks to the work I ’ ve done in therapy , I ’ m usually pretty good at flagging thoughts as anxiety and OCD rather than a legitimate concern . But as the coronavirus outbreak has put the world on high alert , many of the thoughts I ’ d ordinarily dismiss as a product of my anxiety have started to seem like rational worry , and I find it harder to push back .
Although many people associate OCD with obsessive cleanliness — a habit that might seem helpful in the midst of an outbreak — the reality is much more complicated . For many people , OCD involves extreme hypochondria or intrusive thoughts about harm coming to oneself or loved ones . The stress of an outbreak can exacerbate those fears , leading to a resulting increase in compulsive behavior , like time-consuming rituals that disrupt one ’ s life , or extreme self-isolation .
It ’ s not just people who live with OCD . For anyone with generalized anxiety or other mental disorders that make one prone to excessive worrying and irrational behavior , outbreaks can be a particularly dangerous time . As we work to protect ourselves from pathogens , it ’ s easy to get caught up in panic — and that panic can threaten the tenuous control we maintain over our mental health .
So how can you avoid infection without spiraling out of control ?
For starters , avoid the temptation to learn everything you possibly can about Covid-19 . While more information might seem like the best defense against illness , it ’ s far more likely to ramp up your panic — especially if you ’ re getting that information from a place like Twitter , where the takes are fast , furious , and frequently unverified . On social media , “ the information is coming so fast and so thick and so unverified that it ’ s very easy to get overwhelmed , ” says bioethicist Kelly Hills . “ If you don ’ t need to stay on top of this for your job or your academic work , don ’ t . ”
Hills recommends limiting your Covid-19 news consumption to once a day , and only getting that news from a trusted , verified source . While staying informed is important , sensationalistic coverage is far more likely to inflame panic and cause more harm . “ We have to regulate and make choices about what we are exposing ourselves to , ” says therapist Jenn Brandel , noting that managing anxiety around outbreaks requires us to focus on facts rather than emotions . If it ’ s friends and family , rather than the news , who are inundating you with Covid-19 updates , it ’ s okay to mute them on social media , or ask them not to message you with anything related to the crisis .
Second , set a basic safety regimen — and avoid the temptation to add to it . As you ’ ve likely heard , regular hand-washing is one of the most essential components of coronavirus prevention , but washing your hands repeatedly , for far more than 20 seconds at a time , is moving out of disease prevention territory and into compulsion territory . Too much hand-washing can actually work against that effort .
The CDC and the WHO recommend several basic measures to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases such as Covid-19 : Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds .
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue , then throw the tissue in the trash .
touch your face . DON ’ T travel if you have a fever and cough .
travel if you have a fever and cough . DON ’ T wear a face mask if you are well . Face masks should be used by people who show symptoms . Information on the coronavirus outbreak , including its severity , may change as it spreads . Stay informed , and stay safe , with ███ ’ s guide to Covid-19 .
“ If you are washing your hands so much that they are raw or chafed , you are washing your hands too much , ” says Hills . Washing your hands , she points out , isn ’ t about preventing an infection from seeping in through your skin ; it ’ s about removing pathogens before you pass them on to points of entry like your eyes , nose , and mouth . If your hand-washing leads your skin to crack and bleed , you ’ ve created a new entry point for the virus — meaning you could be more , not less , likely to get infected . ( If you or a loved one are at elevated risk due to a comorbidity , Hills notes you can also wipe down light switches , phones , countertops , and other frequently touched surfaces with a Clorox wipe once a day — but once a day should be sufficient , and the entire process should only take a few minutes . )
If you ’ re worried that a self-quarantine might amp up your anxiety or depression , staying on top of your general fitness and wellness regimen is even more important during a stressful time like this one . Make sure you ’ re sleeping enough , eating a balanced diet , and getting some exercise . Even if you ’ re unable to leave the house , there are plenty of at-home workouts ( everything from aerobics to Zumba ) that you can use to get your heart racing from activity rather than anxiety .
And if you ’ re feeling really overwhelmed , remember that you don ’ t have to go through this alone . Therapy , Brandel says , can be an important part of managing your mental health during a crisis . If therapy isn ’ t an option for you , a trusted source — a doctor , a family , or a friend — who can help you analyze what is a rational concern or safety measure , and what is a panicked , anxious overreaction , is another excellent option .
And as social distancing becomes more widespread , with more of us finding ourselves having to work from home or stay in to care for children who can ’ t go to school , it ’ s good to plan some strategies to stay in touch with your support system remotely . Group chats and video chat can be a great way to feel connected to friends and family , but it ’ s also a good idea to check if your therapist is available to do sessions remotely over video chat or phone .
In my case , it ’ s been helpful to talk things through with friends and family , making a safety plan I can stick to that doesn ’ t go overboard . When I feel the urge to wash my hands , I stop and think about whether there ’ s actually a chance I ’ ve picked up new pathogens since I last scrubbed them , applying the same mindfulness techniques I ’ ve always applied to help manage my intrusive thoughts and compulsions .
Ultimately , the best way to get through these trying times is to just “ keep doing your work , ” says Brandel . “ It ’ s easier to do our work around managing intrusive thoughts or managing compulsive impulses when we ’ re in the best of conditions . These aren ’ t the best conditions for someone with OCD [ or other mental illnesses ] — these are going to be hard conditions . But the work is still the same . ”
Whether you ’ re struggling with OCD , generalized anxiety , or another mental illness that ’ s feeling more intensified in these trying times , you ’ ll be able to get through this outbreak the same way you get through everything : taking it day by day .

For anyone with generalized anxiety or other mental disorders that make one prone to excessive worrying and irrational behavior, outbreaks can be a particularly dangerous time. As we work to protect ourselves from pathogens, it’s easy to get caught up in panic — and that panic can threaten the tenuous control we maintain over our mental health.

So how can you avoid infection without spiraling out of control?

For starters, avoid the temptation to learn everything you possibly can about Covid-19. While more information might seem like the best defense against illness, it’s far more likely to ramp up your panic — especially if you’re getting that information from a place like Twitter, where the takes are fast, furious, and frequently unverified. On social media, “the information is coming so fast and so thick and so unverified that it’s very easy to get overwhelmed,” says bioethicist Kelly Hills. “If you don’t need to stay on top of this for your job or your academic work, don’t.”

Hills recommends limiting your Covid-19 news consumption to once a day, and only getting that news from a trusted, verified source. While staying informed is important, sensationalistic coverage is far more likely to inflame panic and cause more harm. “We have to regulate and make choices about what we are exposing ourselves to,” says therapist Jenn Brandel, noting that managing anxiety around outbreaks requires us to focus on facts rather than emotions. If it’s friends and family, rather than the news, who are inundating you with Covid-19 updates, it’s okay to mute them on social media, or ask them not to message you with anything related to the crisis.

Second, set a basic safety regimen — and avoid the temptation to add to it. As you’ve likely heard, regular hand-washing is one of the most essential components of coronavirus prevention, but washing your hands repeatedly, for far more than 20 seconds at a time, is moving out of disease prevention territory and into compulsion territory. Too much hand-washing can actually work against that effort.

The CDC and the WHO recommend several basic measures to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases such as Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home when you are sick.

DON’T touch your face.

touch your face. DON’T travel if you have a fever and cough.

travel if you have a fever and cough. DON’T wear a face mask if you are well. Face masks should be used by people who show symptoms. Information on the coronavirus outbreak, including its severity, may change as it spreads. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s guide to Covid-19.

“If you are washing your hands so much that they are raw or chafed, you are washing your hands too much,” says Hills. Washing your hands, she points out, isn’t about preventing an infection from seeping in through your skin; it’s about removing pathogens before you pass them on to points of entry like your eyes, nose, and mouth. If your hand-washing leads your skin to crack and bleed, you’ve created a new entry point for the virus — meaning you could be more, not less, likely to get infected. (If you or a loved one are at elevated risk due to a comorbidity, Hills notes you can also wipe down light switches, phones, countertops, and other frequently touched surfaces with a Clorox wipe once a day — but once a day should be sufficient, and the entire process should only take a few minutes.)

If you’re worried that a self-quarantine might amp up your anxiety or depression, staying on top of your general fitness and wellness regimen is even more important during a stressful time like this one. Make sure you’re sleeping enough, eating a balanced diet, and getting some exercise. Even if you’re unable to leave the house, there are plenty of at-home workouts (everything from aerobics to Zumba) that you can use to get your heart racing from activity rather than anxiety.

And if you’re feeling really overwhelmed, remember that you don’t have to go through this alone. Therapy, Brandel says, can be an important part of managing your mental health during a crisis. If therapy isn’t an option for you, a trusted source — a doctor, a family, or a friend — who can help you analyze what is a rational concern or safety measure, and what is a panicked, anxious overreaction, is another excellent option.

And as social distancing becomes more widespread, with more of us finding ourselves having to work from home or stay in to care for children who can’t go to school, it’s good to plan some strategies to stay in touch with your support system remotely. Group chats and video chat can be a great way to feel connected to friends and family, but it’s also a good idea to check if your therapist is available to do sessions remotely over video chat or phone.

In my case, it’s been helpful to talk things through with friends and family, making a safety plan I can stick to that doesn’t go overboard. When I feel the urge to wash my hands, I stop and think about whether there’s actually a chance I’ve picked up new pathogens since I last scrubbed them, applying the same mindfulness techniques I’ve always applied to help manage my intrusive thoughts and compulsions.

Ultimately, the best way to get through these trying times is to just “keep doing your work,” says Brandel. “It’s easier to do our work around managing intrusive thoughts or managing compulsive impulses when we’re in the best of conditions. These aren’t the best conditions for someone with OCD [or other mental illnesses] — these are going to be hard conditions. But the work is still the same.”

Whether you’re struggling with OCD, generalized anxiety, or another mental illness that’s feeling more intensified in these trying times, you’ll be able to get through this outbreak the same way you get through everything: taking it day by day.

coronavirus,Washington Post,0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/12/fauci-testimony-senate-coronavirus/,Fauci warns Senate that reopening U.S. too quickly could lead to ‘really serious’ consequences,2020-05-12,"John Wagner, Mike Debonis, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Laurie Mcginley, Reporter Covering Health","Anthony S. Fauci , the nation ’ s top infectious-diseases expert , predicted Americans would experience “ suffering and death that could be avoided , ” as well as additional economic damage , if states ignore federal guidelines , including delaying reopening of most businesses until they see dramatic declines in cases . He also said the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus is probably higher than the 80,000 reported to date .
Fauci ’ s comments came during a contentious Senate hearing as lawmakers of both parties pressed him and other federal health officials on whether the country is ready to reopen . The panel ’ s chairman and all four witnesses appeared remotely because they all recently came into contact with people with confirmed infections — a testament to how the virus has transformed life even within the corridors of power .
Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , which held the hearing , is self-isolating at home after a staff member tested positive for the virus . Fauci ; Stephen Hahn , head of the Food and Drug Administration ; Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ; and Brett Giroir , an assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services , all testified remotely after coming into contact with a White House aide who tested positive last week .
In his first congressional testimony since President Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency on March 13 , Fauci bluntly laid out the dangers of ignoring federal reopening guidelines .
“ If some areas , cities , states or what-have-you , jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently , my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks , ” said Fauci , director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . “ I have been very clear in my message — to try , to the best extent possible , to go by the guidelines , which have been very well thought-out and very well-delineated . ”
Giroir , who oversees the U.S. testing strategy , told senators the U.S. could be performing up to 50 million tests a month by September — but that would still amount to fewer than the 2 million to 3 million tests a day that experts have said is needed to ensure that people returning to work are infection-free .
The health officials also warned that a surge of cases in the fall could be especially challenging , when a coronavirus outbreak could coincide with flu season — in contrast to the president ’ s statements that the fall would not be worse . Redfield said the U.S. would need a five-to-10-fold increase in its capability to conduct contact tracing by the fall to identify all the known contacts of someone who tested positive for the virus in order to prevent an outbreak . He warned that individuals needed to remain vigilant in practicing social distancing measures for the next several months .
Fauci at one point contradicted statements made last week by Trump , when the president proclaimed the virus would disappear in coming months even without a vaccine .
“ This is going to go away without a vaccine , ” Trump said Friday , adding there could be “ flare-ups , ” including in the fall , but that covid-19 would go away regardless .
“ That is just not going to happen , ” Fauci said of the notion the virus would disappear on its own . “ It ’ s a highly transmissible virus . It is likely there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will likely get back to us . ”
The hearing often became combative , with Democrats criticizing Trump ’ s response to the pandemic and even Sen. Mitt Romney ( R-Utah ) scolding Giroir at one point for politicizing testing numbers . Romney said Giroir “ celebrated ” the fact that the U.S. is conducting more tests per capita than South Korea in a Rose Garden news conference on Monday , but ignored that South Korea had far greater testing capacity than the U.S. at the beginning of its outbreak and has only had 300 deaths .
“ I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever , ” Romney said .
Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , who recovered after becoming infected with covid-19 earlier this year , questioned aspects of the scientific consensus during his questioning time , and in a combative exchange , told Fauci he was not the “ end-all ” for coronavirus decisions . Paul asserted that schools could reopen widely in the fall because the virus appears to be less dangerous in children .
“ It ’ s not to say this isn ’ t deadly , but really , outside of New England , we ’ ve had a relatively benign course for this virus nationwide , ” Paul said . “ And I think the one-size-fits-all , that we ’ re going to have a national strategy and nobody is going to go to school , is kind of ridiculous . We really ought to be doing it school district by school district , and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions . ”
After asking to respond , Fauci told Paul , “ I ’ ve never made myself out to be the end-all. ” He warned that while the numbers indicate the pathogen is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly , “ we don ’ t know everything about this virus. ” He noted a spate of new cases of coronavirus-infected children presenting with a “ very strange inflammatory syndrome . ”
“ I am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don ’ t know everything about this disease , and that ’ s why I ’ m very reserved in making broad predictions , ” Fauci said .
In response to repeated questions about when better therapeutics and a vaccine would be available , Fauci dismissed the notion they might be in use by the time schools reopen in the fall .
“ The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far , ” he said . “ The drug that has shown some degree of efficacy was modest and in hospitalized patients ” only , he added , referring to remdesivir , the Gilead antiviral drug that has shown to reduce recovery time for people with covid-19 . But Fauci said that remdesivir alone was not sufficient as a therapeutic .
Asked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) whether the virus is contained in the U.S. , Fauci chose his words carefully . “ I think we are going in the right direction , ” he said . “ But the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak . ”
Fauci says he doesn ’ t have a confrontational relationship with Trump Sen. Kelly Loeffler ( R-Ga. ) , the last senator in line to ask questions , sought assurances from all four witnesses that they don ’ t have a confrontational relationship with Trump — a notion that she said has been advanced by the news media and some of her colleagues . “ There is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the president , ” Fauci said . “ I give advice , opinion based on evidence-based scientific information . He hears that . He respects it . He gets opinions from a variety of other people , but in no way , in my experience over the last several months , has there been any confrontational relationship between us. ” Redfield , Hahn and Giroir all gave similar answers . “ We have a very productive working relationship with each other , ” Giroir said . Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , the committee ’ s chairman , adjourned the hearing shortly before 1:30 p.m. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic .

Romney says U.S. testing record ‘ nothing to celebrate whatsoever ’ Sen. Mitt Romney ( R-Utah ) criticized the Trump administration ’ s news conference Monday heralding its increased testing capacity . “ I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever , ” Romney told the health officials assembled at the hearing . Trump and other administration officials Monday regularly pointed to the fact that the United States was conducting more testing per capita than South Korea , which has been widely praised for its early and aggressive testing efforts that helped stem its outbreak . Romney said U.S. officials were ignoring the fact that South Korea had far higher testing capacity than the United States early in its outbreak , while the United States was “ treading water in February. ” South Korea has had fewer than 300 covid-19 deaths . Romney also asked why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’ s data-collection system was so outdated and the agency ’ s director what Congress needed to do to help modernize the system . He also asked coronavirus task force member Anthony S. Fauci whether it was a “ long shot ” to hope for a vaccine that would be ready within a year or two . “ It ’ s definitely not a long shot , ” Fauci replied . “ It ’ s clearly much more likely than not that somewhere in that time frame , we will get a vaccine for the virus. ” By Yasmeen Abutaleb AD AD
FDA commissioner pledges remdesivir distribution will be based on need Trump administration officials pledged to be guided in their distribution of the coronavirus treatment drug remdesivir by evidence of outbreaks and patient need , responding at the Senate hearing Tuesday to an uproar over the uneven distribution of the treatment . Doctors last week complained of a haphazard and opaque process for distributing the limited supplies of the experimental Gilead Sciences drug in the week after the Food and Drug Administration permitted its distribution under an emergency use authorization . Over the weekend , the Department of Health and Human Services disclosed that seven states had received the drug in a first wave , and it added five more states to the list . Maine was not on either list , which drew concern at the Senate hearing Tuesday from Sen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) . “ I ’ m concerned that hospitalized patients in Maine will have little or no ability to be treated with this promising therapeutic for the foreseeable future , ” Collins said . “ As this and more therapeutics and ultimately a vaccine come onto the marketplace , how can these allocations and distribution issues be resolved so that patient care is not delayed and so it doesn ’ t depend on which state you live in , whether you are going to get access to these treatments , and ultimately a vaccine ? '' she asked Trump officials . Hahn appeared to acknowledge problems in the early distribution of remdesivir and said HHS officials had established a system of sending the drug to areas with the most hospitalized patients who are eligible to receive the drug . “ I think we can all agree upon the fact that we have learned a lot of lessons on the remdesivir situation , ” Hahn said . Moving forward , the drug will be sent to areas based the size of outbreaks and numbers of hospitalized patients , he said . HHS said in a weekend news release that an initial allocation was sent to Indiana , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New York , Rhode Island , Tennessee and Virginia . It said it added Connecticut , Illinois , Iowa , Maryland and Michigan beginning May 7 . It said Gilead has pledged to provide enough donated drug to treat 78,000 patients in the United States over the next six weeks . By Christopher Rowland AD AD
‘ The time for magical thinking is over , ’ Sen. Warren says Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) , like most Democrats , used her questioning time Tuesday to attack the Trump administration without directly criticizing the nonpolitical officials appearing before the committee . She began her round by asking Anthony S. Fauci a simple question : “ Do we have the coronavirus contained ? ” He gave a nuanced answer : In some places , like New York and New Orleans , rates of infection and hospitalization have started to diminish , he said , but in other places they have spiked — contributing to an overall flattening of the national infection curve . “ I think we ’ re going in the right direction , but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak , ” Fauci said . Warren went on to question Fauci about the risks of a possible fall resurgence of the virus and whether the federal government would be prepared to handle it . Fauci said his previous warnings continue to hold but that current administration projections are that there will be sufficient testing and health system capacity to handle it . “ If we do not respond in an adequate way when the fall comes … then we run the risk of having a resurgence , ” he said . “ I would hope by that point in time in the fall that we have more than enough to respond adequate . But if we don ’ t , there will be problems. ” “ I appreciate your hope , ” Warren said . “ The president needs to stop pretending that if he just ignores bad news , it will go away , ” she continued . “ It won ’ t . The time for magical thinking is over , here . President Trump must acknowledge that the federal response has been insufficient and that more people are dying as a result. ” She did not ask Fauci to respond . By Mike DeBonis AD AD
Murphy presses health officials for more detailed guidance on reopening Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) pressed health officials over whether the Trump administration would release more detailed guidance to aid states beginning to reopen , adding that the guidance so far provided is “ criminally vague. ” Redfield declined to commit to a specific timetable on when the CDC might issue more detailed guidance . Several media outlets reported last week that the White House rejected CDC guidance because it was overly prescriptive . “ You work for a president who is frankly undermining our efforts to comply with the guidance you gave us , ” Murphy told the health officials . “ The guidance you gave us is criminally vague . The plan to reopen America was to be followed by more nuanced , detailed guidance. ” Murphy also asked the health officials whether they were continuing to draw a salary while they self-isolated at home due to exposure to a confirmed coronavirus case . Fauci said he was at the White House on Monday and could return to his NIH office on Tuesday , despite his recent exposure to Vice President Pence ’ s press secretary , who tested positive for the virus last week .

Sen. Paul spars with Fauci over immunity , school openings Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , who recovered after becoming infected with the novel coronavirus earlier this year , questioned aspects of the scientific consensus surrounding the pandemic during his questioning time — asserting for instance that there is compelling evidence that recovered covid-19 patients are at least temporarily immune from reinfection and that schools could reopen widely in the fall . Paul said U.S. policymakers should consider following the example of Sweden . Schools did not widely close there as they did in the United States , yet Sweden ’ s mortality rates remained below other European countries where schools did close . “ I don ’ t think there ’ s anybody arguing that what happened in Sweden is an unacceptable result , ” he said , adding that “ we never really reached any sort of pandemic levels ” in Kentucky and other rural states . “ It ’ s not to say this isn ’ t deadly , but really , outside of New England , we ’ ve had a relatively benign course for this virus nationwide , ” Paul said . “ And I think the one-size-fits-all , that we ’ re going to have a national strategy and nobody is going to go to school , is kind of ridiculous . We really ought to be doing it school district by school district , and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions. ” Fauci asked to respond , and then warned that while the numbers indicate that the virus is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly , “ we don ’ t know everything about this virus. ” He noted that there are now cases of coronavirus-infected children presenting with a “ very strange inflammatory syndrome. ” “ I am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don ’ t know everything about this disease , and that ’ s why I ’ m very reserved in making broad predictions , ” Fauci said . Regarding immunity , Fauci told Paul that he agreed that it was “ very likely ” that there is a degree of protection for those who have recovered from covid-19 . But the level of antibodies necessary for protection and the duration of that protection remain unknown , he said . “ You can make a reasonable assumption that it would be protective , but natural history studies over a period of months to years will then tell you definitively if that ’ s the case , ” he said . By Mike DeBonis AD AD
Fauci says U.S. death toll is probably higher than the 80,000 reported Fauci said the U.S. death toll is probably higher than the 80,000 deaths officially reported , and added that the virus will not disappear in the fall or winter , contradicting President Trump ’ s claims last week that the virus would go away even without a vaccine . “ I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests : This is going to go away without a vaccine , ” Trump said Friday , adding that there could be “ flare-ups , ” including in the fall , but that covid-19 would go away regardless . “ That is just not going to happen , ” Fauci said of the idea that the virus would disappear on its own . “ It ’ s a highly transmissible virus . It is likely there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will likely get back to us. ” Fauci also agreed with Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , who said many experts have said that the death toll is higher than what ’ s been reported . Fauci pointed to New York City , where he said the health-care system faced an extraordinary challenge during the peak of the outbreak , and people could have died at home of coronavirus without being officially counted . Several administration officials , including Trump , have questioned whether the death toll is inflated . Sanders also pressed officials on whether a vaccine would be available to everyone regardless of income if and when it becomes available . “ I will certainly advocate that anyone be able to access the vaccine , ” Giroir said in response to Sanders ’ s question .

Premature openings could be dangerous , Fauci says Pressed by Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) , Fauci warned that states that fail to obey federal reopening guidelines and move too quickly to restart their economies would put themselves at risk of new outbreaks that could be hard to control . “ If some areas , cities , states or what-have-you jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently , my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks , ” said Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . “ I have been very clear in my message — to try to the best extent possible to go by the guidelines , which have been very well thought out and very well delineated. ” Any loosening of restrictions , Fauci added , would lead to new cases , but those new cases could be manageable so long as states have the proper infrastructure in place . “ It ’ s the ability and the capability of responding to those cases with good identification , isolation and contact tracing [ that ] will determine whether you can continue to go forward as you try to reopen America , ” he said . Murray also pressed Brett Giroir , the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts , on a strategic testing plan required to be submitted later this month to Congress under the terms of recent legislation . Giroir said that the administration had numerical targets in place for testing in each state but cautioned that they stand to be revised based on the course of the virus ’ s spread . “ Yes , there will be targets , ” he said . “ The targets will need to change based on the evidence that we see . … So we really just need to be very humble about this . We need to look at the data. ” By Mike DeBonis AD AD
Hahn : Evolving clinical picture of virus affects FDA ’ s search for treatments Hahn said new information about the virus and how it manifests itself in the body affects the “ endpoints ” the FDA is looking for in new drugs to treat covid-19 . For example , the agency is looking at evolving symptoms , such as blood clots — which weren ’ t immediately obvious at the beginning of the pandemic . He also said the agency is working with other agencies to ensure that there will be enough supplies , including syringes and needles to distribute vaccines , once they are available . By Laurie McGinley
FDA head Hahn : Agency is working to ‘ bridge the gap ’ to a vaccine through treatments Hahn , head of the Food and Drug Administration , said the agency is working to “ bridge the gap ” between now and when a vaccine might be available through therapeutics . The focus , he said , is speeding development and review of antiviral and antibody drugs as well as convalescent plasma products . Hahn said the agency has created an emergency program to conduct such reviews and is using “ every available authority and flexibility that ’ s appropriate. ” On testing , he said that the agency has worked with more than 500 developers who have submitted or said they would submit applications for FDA authorization for covid-19 tests — including some involving technologies never used before . The agency also is cracking down on fraudulent tests and trying to provide more clarity to the public on which tests have been authorized by the FDA and which ones haven ’ t , he said . By Laurie McGinley
Fauci : ‘ A bridge too far ’ to expect treatments , vaccine in time for fall school semester Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , the panel ’ s chairman , began the questioning by asking Fauci whether college and school administrators could feel safe welcoming students back to campus in the fall , and the likelihood of a treatment or vaccine becoming available by then . “ The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far , ” Fauci said . “ The drug that has shown some degree of efficacy was modest and was in hospitalized patients. ” Fauci said whether students will feel safe returning to school will also largely depend on testing capabilities . Giroir said he expects the country to have the capacity to conduct 25 million to 30 million tests a month by the fall , which could allow schools to have a surveillance strategy in place to quickly identify and isolate confirmed covid-19 cases .

Giroir : 40 million to 50 million tests per month by September Giroir , the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts , said the nation will be able to conduct more tests for the novel coronavirus in the coming months , a critical step to reopening the country . “ By September … we project that our nation will be capable of performing 40 to 50 million tests per month , ” Giroir told the committee . The Trump administration has faced criticism that it is not testing enough Americans , with health experts arguing that far more testing is necessary . Trump has been dismissive about the need for testing , calling it “ somewhat overrated ” last week . On Monday , the president claimed that his administration is besting the world in testing and that it will help states expand such efforts , which are a key element of lifting the safety restrictions that have shuttered much of the economy since March . Trump ’ s claims about U.S. testing benchmarks do not account for what health experts have criticized as the slow pace of testing capability in the United States this spring , a delay that some say contributed to the rapid spread of the virus , the mounting death toll and uncertainty about the way forward . By Donna Cassata
CDC director : ‘ We ’ re not out of the woods yet ’ CDC Director Robert Redfield told the Senate committee that social distancing remains “ imperative ” for Americans as public health authorities continue battling the pandemic . “ It ’ s important to emphasize that we ’ re not out of the woods yet , ” Redfield said in his opening statement , adding that the battle could continue for months . “ We need to stay vigilant with social distancing . It remains an imperative. ” Redfield deemed the pandemic “ the most serious public health crisis in more than a century ” and detailed the CDC ’ s efforts to combat it , including expert assistance to state health authorities , disease surveillance and testing and contact tracing strategy . But he also sounded an alarm that the nation ’ s public health resources have been insufficient to meet the challenge that covid-19 has posed . “ We need to rebuild our nation ’ s public health infrastructure : data and data analytics , public health laboratory resilience and our nation ’ s public health workforce , ” he said . “ Now is the time to put it in place for the generations to come , not only for the public health system that our nation needs , but for the public health system our nation deserves. ” By Mike DeBonis
Fauci gives overview of covid-19 vaccine , therapeutic progress in opening statements In his much-anticipated opening remarks , Fauci gave senators an update on potential drugs and vaccines that could treat covid-19 . While several senators will look to Fauci for an honest assessment of the administration ’ s response to the crisis and whether the country is ready to reopen , Fauci kept his opening remarks focused on the search for medical treatments for coronavirus patients . He said remdesivir , the drug that showed some efficacy in treating covid-19 and has been distributed to several states , had only a “ modest result ” and that researchers hope to find a more effective treatment , either through a combination of drugs or through another medication altogether . Fauci also told senators that there were eight covid vaccines in clinical development , and that the NIH has been collaborating with numerous pharmaceutical companies in various stages of development . He said the agency hoped to know how successful a vaccine candidate may be in late fall . Fauci again stressed that a vaccine was at least a year away , at best , and that certain vaccines could have negative consequences . By Yasmeen Abutaleb
Remote appearances , social distancing as committee questions top federal health officials Senators wore masks and sat six feet apart Tuesday morning in a cavernous Capitol Hill hearing room as they questioned top federal health officials about the coronavirus pandemic . Some senators , most notably Chairman Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) and top Democrat Patty Murray ( Wash. ) participated remotely from home . Murray , whose state had some of the first cases of the disease , criticized the Trump administration ’ s response . “ One thing that ’ s abundantly clear , we need dramatically more testing . It ’ s unacceptable that we still don ’ t have a national strategic plan to make sure testing is free , fast and everywhere , ” she said . More than a half-dozen senators participated in the hearing in person . By Donna Cassata
Sen. Alexander : ‘ Almost all of us ... underestimated this virus ’ In his opening statement , committee Chairman Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) struck two notes : first , that coronavirus testing needs to be greatly expanded over the coming months to reopen the American economy , and second , warning against political gamesmanship as Democratic criticism of the Trump administration mounts . “ Before we spend too much time finger pointing , I would like to suggest that almost all of us … underestimated this virus , ” he said , according to prepared remarks . “ Underestimated how contagious it would be . How it can travel silently without causing symptoms . How it can be especially deadly among certain segments of the population. ” Alexander noted that the federal government prepared over the past 20 years for a pandemic and other public health threats . But he said Washington had “ become preoccupied with other important things . '' “ Our collective memory is short , ” he said . “ Just three months ago the country was consumed with impeaching a president . Now that seems like ancient Roman history. ” Now , Alexander said , Congress should start thinking about preparing for the next pandemic — even amid the scourge of covid-19 : “ If there is to be finger pointing , I hope fingers will point in that direction. ” Addressing the theme of the hearing — “ Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School ” — Alexander declared that indefinite stay-at-home orders would be unworkable . “ There is not enough money available to help all those hurt by a closed economy , ” he said . “ All roads back to work and back to school lead through testing , tracking , isolation , treatment and vaccines. ” Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic .

Key senators , witnesses are appearing remotely The Senate hearing will be far different from most on Capitol Hill , with many senators and the four witnesses appearing remotely . Neither the panel ’ s chairman , Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , nor its top Democrat , Sen. Patty Murray ( Wash. ) , plan to be in the hearing room , according to aides . Alexander ’ s office disclosed that he will self-quarantine in Tennessee for two weeks after an aide tested positive for the novel coronavirus . The four health officials are appearing via video conference after Katie Miller , Vice President Pence ’ s press secretary who participated regularly in the administration ’ s task force briefings , tested positive for the coronavirus . Even some senators who are in Washington will appear from their offices rather than the hearing room , aides said . Those who arrived early , including Sens . Tim Kaine ( D-Va. ) and Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) , were wearing masks . By Seung Min Kim and John Wagner
Schumer encourages Fauci to be a ‘ truth-teller ’ Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) expressed hope Tuesday that senators would hear from a Fauci who was not “ muzzled ” by the president during the hearing . “ Dr . Fauci is a truth-teller , '' Schumer said during an appearance on CNN . `` That ’ s his reputation . It seems he has sort of muted the truth some in the presence of the president . … He has to tell the whole truth here . The president does not like the truth . He likes a story that helps his own ego on the day he tells it . And that has had severe consequences for this country. ” During remarks Monday on the Senate floor , Schumer encouraged Fauci to “ let it rip ” during the Senate hearing . “ This will be one of the first opportunities for Dr. Fauci to tell the American people the unvarnished truth without the president looking over his shoulder , ” Schumer said .

Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-diseases expert, predicted Americans would experience “suffering and death that could be avoided,” as well as additional economic damage, if states ignore federal guidelines, including delaying reopening of most businesses until they see dramatic declines in cases. He also said the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus is probably higher than the 80,000 reported to date.

Fauci’s comments came during a contentious Senate hearing as lawmakers of both parties pressed him and other federal health officials on whether the country is ready to reopen. The panel’s chairman and all four witnesses appeared remotely because they all recently came into contact with people with confirmed infections — a testament to how the virus has transformed life even within the corridors of power.

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which held the hearing, is self-isolating at home after a staff member tested positive for the virus. Fauci; Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration; Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, all testified remotely after coming into contact with a White House aide who tested positive last week.

In his first congressional testimony since President Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency on March 13, Fauci bluntly laid out the dangers of ignoring federal reopening guidelines.

“If some areas, cities, states or what-have-you, jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks,” said Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “I have been very clear in my message — to try, to the best extent possible, to go by the guidelines, which have been very well thought-out and very well-delineated.”

Giroir, who oversees the U.S. testing strategy, told senators the U.S. could be performing up to 50 million tests a month by September — but that would still amount to fewer than the 2 million to 3 million tests a day that experts have said is needed to ensure that people returning to work are infection-free.

The health officials also warned that a surge of cases in the fall could be especially challenging, when a coronavirus outbreak could coincide with flu season — in contrast to the president’s statements that the fall would not be worse. Redfield said the U.S. would need a five-to-10-fold increase in its capability to conduct contact tracing by the fall to identify all the known contacts of someone who tested positive for the virus in order to prevent an outbreak. He warned that individuals needed to remain vigilant in practicing social distancing measures for the next several months.

Fauci at one point contradicted statements made last week by Trump, when the president proclaimed the virus would disappear in coming months even without a vaccine.

“This is going to go away without a vaccine,” Trump said Friday, adding there could be “flare-ups,” including in the fall, but that covid-19 would go away regardless.

“That is just not going to happen,” Fauci said of the notion the virus would disappear on its own. “It’s a highly transmissible virus. It is likely there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will likely get back to us.”

The hearing often became combative, with Democrats criticizing Trump’s response to the pandemic and even Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) scolding Giroir at one point for politicizing testing numbers. Romney said Giroir “celebrated” the fact that the U.S. is conducting more tests per capita than South Korea in a Rose Garden news conference on Monday, but ignored that South Korea had far greater testing capacity than the U.S. at the beginning of its outbreak and has only had 300 deaths.

“I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever,” Romney said.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who recovered after becoming infected with covid-19 earlier this year, questioned aspects of the scientific consensus during his questioning time, and in a combative exchange, told Fauci he was not the “end-all” for coronavirus decisions. Paul asserted that schools could reopen widely in the fall because the virus appears to be less dangerous in children.

“It’s not to say this isn’t deadly, but really, outside of New England, we’ve had a relatively benign course for this virus nationwide,” Paul said. “And I think the one-size-fits-all, that we’re going to have a national strategy and nobody is going to go to school, is kind of ridiculous. We really ought to be doing it school district by school district, and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions.”

After asking to respond, Fauci told Paul, “I’ve never made myself out to be the end-all.” He warned that while the numbers indicate the pathogen is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly, “we don’t know everything about this virus.” He noted a spate of new cases of coronavirus-infected children presenting with a “very strange inflammatory syndrome.”

“I am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don’t know everything about this disease, and that’s why I’m very reserved in making broad predictions,” Fauci said.

In response to repeated questions about when better therapeutics and a vaccine would be available, Fauci dismissed the notion they might be in use by the time schools reopen in the fall.

“The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far,” he said. “The drug that has shown some degree of efficacy was modest and in hospitalized patients” only, he added, referring to remdesivir, the Gilead antiviral drug that has shown to reduce recovery time for people with covid-19. But Fauci said that remdesivir alone was not sufficient as a therapeutic.

Asked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) whether the virus is contained in the U.S., Fauci chose his words carefully. “I think we are going in the right direction,” he said. “But the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak.”

Fauci says he doesn’t have a confrontational relationship with Trump Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), the last senator in line to ask questions, sought assurances from all four witnesses that they don’t have a confrontational relationship with Trump — a notion that she said has been advanced by the news media and some of her colleagues. “There is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the president,” Fauci said. “I give advice, opinion based on evidence-based scientific information. He hears that. He respects it. He gets opinions from a variety of other people, but in no way, in my experience over the last several months, has there been any confrontational relationship between us.” Redfield, Hahn and Giroir all gave similar answers. “We have a very productive working relationship with each other,” Giroir said. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the committee’s chairman, adjourned the hearing shortly before 1:30 p.m. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

Romney says U.S. testing record ‘nothing to celebrate whatsoever’ Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) criticized the Trump administration’s news conference Monday heralding its increased testing capacity. “I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever,” Romney told the health officials assembled at the hearing. Trump and other administration officials Monday regularly pointed to the fact that the United States was conducting more testing per capita than South Korea, which has been widely praised for its early and aggressive testing efforts that helped stem its outbreak. Romney said U.S. officials were ignoring the fact that South Korea had far higher testing capacity than the United States early in its outbreak, while the United States was “treading water in February.” South Korea has had fewer than 300 covid-19 deaths. Romney also asked why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s data-collection system was so outdated and the agency’s director what Congress needed to do to help modernize the system. He also asked coronavirus task force member Anthony S. Fauci whether it was a “long shot” to hope for a vaccine that would be ready within a year or two. “It’s definitely not a long shot,” Fauci replied. “It’s clearly much more likely than not that somewhere in that time frame, we will get a vaccine for the virus.” By Yasmeen Abutaleb AD AD

FDA commissioner pledges remdesivir distribution will be based on need Trump administration officials pledged to be guided in their distribution of the coronavirus treatment drug remdesivir by evidence of outbreaks and patient need, responding at the Senate hearing Tuesday to an uproar over the uneven distribution of the treatment. Doctors last week complained of a haphazard and opaque process for distributing the limited supplies of the experimental Gilead Sciences drug in the week after the Food and Drug Administration permitted its distribution under an emergency use authorization. Over the weekend, the Department of Health and Human Services disclosed that seven states had received the drug in a first wave, and it added five more states to the list. Maine was not on either list, which drew concern at the Senate hearing Tuesday from Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). “I’m concerned that hospitalized patients in Maine will have little or no ability to be treated with this promising therapeutic for the foreseeable future,” Collins said. “As this and more therapeutics and ultimately a vaccine come onto the marketplace, how can these allocations and distribution issues be resolved so that patient care is not delayed and so it doesn’t depend on which state you live in, whether you are going to get access to these treatments, and ultimately a vaccine?'' she asked Trump officials. Hahn appeared to acknowledge problems in the early distribution of remdesivir and said HHS officials had established a system of sending the drug to areas with the most hospitalized patients who are eligible to receive the drug. “I think we can all agree upon the fact that we have learned a lot of lessons on the remdesivir situation,” Hahn said. Moving forward, the drug will be sent to areas based the size of outbreaks and numbers of hospitalized patients, he said. HHS said in a weekend news release that an initial allocation was sent to Indiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia. It said it added Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland and Michigan beginning May 7. It said Gilead has pledged to provide enough donated drug to treat 78,000 patients in the United States over the next six weeks. By Christopher Rowland AD AD

‘The time for magical thinking is over,’ Sen. Warren says Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), like most Democrats, used her questioning time Tuesday to attack the Trump administration without directly criticizing the nonpolitical officials appearing before the committee. She began her round by asking Anthony S. Fauci a simple question: “Do we have the coronavirus contained?” He gave a nuanced answer: In some places, like New York and New Orleans, rates of infection and hospitalization have started to diminish, he said, but in other places they have spiked — contributing to an overall flattening of the national infection curve. “I think we’re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak,” Fauci said. Warren went on to question Fauci about the risks of a possible fall resurgence of the virus and whether the federal government would be prepared to handle it. Fauci said his previous warnings continue to hold but that current administration projections are that there will be sufficient testing and health system capacity to handle it. “If we do not respond in an adequate way when the fall comes … then we run the risk of having a resurgence,” he said. “I would hope by that point in time in the fall that we have more than enough to respond adequate. But if we don’t, there will be problems.” “I appreciate your hope,” Warren said. “The president needs to stop pretending that if he just ignores bad news, it will go away,” she continued. “It won’t. The time for magical thinking is over, here. President Trump must acknowledge that the federal response has been insufficient and that more people are dying as a result.” She did not ask Fauci to respond. By Mike DeBonis AD AD

Murphy presses health officials for more detailed guidance on reopening Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) pressed health officials over whether the Trump administration would release more detailed guidance to aid states beginning to reopen, adding that the guidance so far provided is “criminally vague.” Redfield declined to commit to a specific timetable on when the CDC might issue more detailed guidance. Several media outlets reported last week that the White House rejected CDC guidance because it was overly prescriptive. “You work for a president who is frankly undermining our efforts to comply with the guidance you gave us,” Murphy told the health officials. “The guidance you gave us is criminally vague. The plan to reopen America was to be followed by more nuanced, detailed guidance.” Murphy also asked the health officials whether they were continuing to draw a salary while they self-isolated at home due to exposure to a confirmed coronavirus case. Fauci said he was at the White House on Monday and could return to his NIH office on Tuesday, despite his recent exposure to Vice President Pence’s press secretary, who tested positive for the virus last week.

Sen. Paul spars with Fauci over immunity, school openings Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who recovered after becoming infected with the novel coronavirus earlier this year, questioned aspects of the scientific consensus surrounding the pandemic during his questioning time — asserting for instance that there is compelling evidence that recovered covid-19 patients are at least temporarily immune from reinfection and that schools could reopen widely in the fall. Paul said U.S. policymakers should consider following the example of Sweden. Schools did not widely close there as they did in the United States, yet Sweden’s mortality rates remained below other European countries where schools did close. “I don’t think there’s anybody arguing that what happened in Sweden is an unacceptable result,” he said, adding that “we never really reached any sort of pandemic levels” in Kentucky and other rural states. “It’s not to say this isn’t deadly, but really, outside of New England, we’ve had a relatively benign course for this virus nationwide,” Paul said. “And I think the one-size-fits-all, that we’re going to have a national strategy and nobody is going to go to school, is kind of ridiculous. We really ought to be doing it school district by school district, and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions.” Fauci asked to respond, and then warned that while the numbers indicate that the virus is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly, “we don’t know everything about this virus.” He noted that there are now cases of coronavirus-infected children presenting with a “very strange inflammatory syndrome.” “I am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don’t know everything about this disease, and that’s why I’m very reserved in making broad predictions,” Fauci said. Regarding immunity, Fauci told Paul that he agreed that it was “very likely” that there is a degree of protection for those who have recovered from covid-19. But the level of antibodies necessary for protection and the duration of that protection remain unknown, he said. “You can make a reasonable assumption that it would be protective, but natural history studies over a period of months to years will then tell you definitively if that’s the case,” he said.

Fauci says U.S. death toll is probably higher than the 80,000 reported Fauci said the U.S. death toll is probably higher than the 80,000 deaths officially reported, and added that the virus will not disappear in the fall or winter, contradicting President Trump’s claims last week that the virus would go away even without a vaccine. “I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests: This is going to go away without a vaccine,” Trump said Friday, adding that there could be “flare-ups,” including in the fall, but that covid-19 would go away regardless. “That is just not going to happen,” Fauci said of the idea that the virus would disappear on its own. “It’s a highly transmissible virus. It is likely there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will likely get back to us.” Fauci also agreed with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who said many experts have said that the death toll is higher than what’s been reported. Fauci pointed to New York City, where he said the health-care system faced an extraordinary challenge during the peak of the outbreak, and people could have died at home of coronavirus without being officially counted. Several administration officials, including Trump, have questioned whether the death toll is inflated. Sanders also pressed officials on whether a vaccine would be available to everyone regardless of income if and when it becomes available. “I will certainly advocate that anyone be able to access the vaccine,” Giroir said in response to Sanders’s question.

Premature openings could be dangerous, Fauci says Pressed by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Fauci warned that states that fail to obey federal reopening guidelines and move too quickly to restart their economies would put themselves at risk of new outbreaks that could be hard to control. “If some areas, cities, states or what-have-you jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “I have been very clear in my message — to try to the best extent possible to go by the guidelines, which have been very well thought out and very well delineated.” Any loosening of restrictions, Fauci added, would lead to new cases, but those new cases could be manageable so long as states have the proper infrastructure in place. “It’s the ability and the capability of responding to those cases with good identification, isolation and contact tracing [that] will determine whether you can continue to go forward as you try to reopen America,” he said. Murray also pressed Brett Giroir, the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts, on a strategic testing plan required to be submitted later this month to Congress under the terms of recent legislation. Giroir said that the administration had numerical targets in place for testing in each state but cautioned that they stand to be revised based on the course of the virus’s spread. “Yes, there will be targets,” he said. “The targets will need to change based on the evidence that we see. … So we really just need to be very humble about this. We need to look at the data.” By Mike DeBonis AD AD

Hahn: Evolving clinical picture of virus affects FDA’s search for treatments Hahn said new information about the virus and how it manifests itself in the body affects the “endpoints” the FDA is looking for in new drugs to treat covid-19. For example, the agency is looking at evolving symptoms, such as blood clots — which weren’t immediately obvious at the beginning of the pandemic. He also said the agency is working with other agencies to ensure that there will be enough supplies, including syringes and needles to distribute vaccines, once they are available. By Laurie McGinley

FDA head Hahn: Agency is working to ‘bridge the gap’ to a vaccine through treatments Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency is working to “bridge the gap” between now and when a vaccine might be available through therapeutics. The focus, he said, is speeding development and review of antiviral and antibody drugs as well as convalescent plasma products. Hahn said the agency has created an emergency program to conduct such reviews and is using “every available authority and flexibility that’s appropriate.” On testing, he said that the agency has worked with more than 500 developers who have submitted or said they would submit applications for FDA authorization for covid-19 tests — including some involving technologies never used before. The agency also is cracking down on fraudulent tests and trying to provide more clarity to the public on which tests have been authorized by the FDA and which ones haven’t, he said. By Laurie McGinley

Fauci: ‘A bridge too far’ to expect treatments, vaccine in time for fall school semester Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the panel’s chairman, began the questioning by asking Fauci whether college and school administrators could feel safe welcoming students back to campus in the fall, and the likelihood of a treatment or vaccine becoming available by then. “The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far,” Fauci said. “The drug that has shown some degree of efficacy was modest and was in hospitalized patients.” Fauci said whether students will feel safe returning to school will also largely depend on testing capabilities. Giroir said he expects the country to have the capacity to conduct 25 million to 30 million tests a month by the fall, which could allow schools to have a surveillance strategy in place to quickly identify and isolate confirmed covid-19 cases.

Giroir: 40 million to 50 million tests per month by September Giroir, the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts, said the nation will be able to conduct more tests for the novel coronavirus in the coming months, a critical step to reopening the country. “By September … we project that our nation will be capable of performing 40 to 50 million tests per month,” Giroir told the committee. The Trump administration has faced criticism that it is not testing enough Americans, with health experts arguing that far more testing is necessary. Trump has been dismissive about the need for testing, calling it “somewhat overrated” last week. On Monday, the president claimed that his administration is besting the world in testing and that it will help states expand such efforts, which are a key element of lifting the safety restrictions that have shuttered much of the economy since March. Trump’s claims about U.S. testing benchmarks do not account for what health experts have criticized as the slow pace of testing capability in the United States this spring, a delay that some say contributed to the rapid spread of the virus, the mounting death toll and uncertainty about the way forward. By Donna Cassata

CDC director: ‘We’re not out of the woods yet’ CDC Director Robert Redfield told the Senate committee that social distancing remains “imperative” for Americans as public health authorities continue battling the pandemic. “It’s important to emphasize that we’re not out of the woods yet,” Redfield said in his opening statement, adding that the battle could continue for months. “We need to stay vigilant with social distancing. It remains an imperative.” Redfield deemed the pandemic “the most serious public health crisis in more than a century” and detailed the CDC’s efforts to combat it, including expert assistance to state health authorities, disease surveillance and testing and contact tracing strategy. But he also sounded an alarm that the nation’s public health resources have been insufficient to meet the challenge that covid-19 has posed. “We need to rebuild our nation’s public health infrastructure: data and data analytics, public health laboratory resilience and our nation’s public health workforce,” he said. “Now is the time to put it in place for the generations to come, not only for the public health system that our nation needs, but for the public health system our nation deserves.” By Mike DeBonis

Fauci gives overview of covid-19 vaccine, therapeutic progress in opening statements In his much-anticipated opening remarks, Fauci gave senators an update on potential drugs and vaccines that could treat covid-19. While several senators will look to Fauci for an honest assessment of the administration’s response to the crisis and whether the country is ready to reopen, Fauci kept his opening remarks focused on the search for medical treatments for coronavirus patients. He said remdesivir, the drug that showed some efficacy in treating covid-19 and has been distributed to several states, had only a “modest result” and that researchers hope to find a more effective treatment, either through a combination of drugs or through another medication altogether. Fauci also told senators that there were eight covid vaccines in clinical development, and that the NIH has been collaborating with numerous pharmaceutical companies in various stages of development. He said the agency hoped to know how successful a vaccine candidate may be in late fall. Fauci again stressed that a vaccine was at least a year away, at best, and that certain vaccines could have negative consequences. By Yasmeen Abutaleb

Remote appearances, social distancing as committee questions top federal health officials Senators wore masks and sat six feet apart Tuesday morning in a cavernous Capitol Hill hearing room as they questioned top federal health officials about the coronavirus pandemic. Some senators, most notably Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and top Democrat Patty Murray (Wash.) participated remotely from home. Murray, whose state had some of the first cases of the disease, criticized the Trump administration’s response. “One thing that’s abundantly clear, we need dramatically more testing. It’s unacceptable that we still don’t have a national strategic plan to make sure testing is free, fast and everywhere,” she said. More than a half-dozen senators participated in the hearing in person. By Donna Cassata

Sen. Alexander: ‘Almost all of us ... underestimated this virus’ In his opening statement, committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) struck two notes: first, that coronavirus testing needs to be greatly expanded over the coming months to reopen the American economy, and second, warning against political gamesmanship as Democratic criticism of the Trump administration mounts. “Before we spend too much time finger pointing, I would like to suggest that almost all of us … underestimated this virus,” he said, according to prepared remarks. “Underestimated how contagious it would be. How it can travel silently without causing symptoms. How it can be especially deadly among certain segments of the population.” Alexander noted that the federal government prepared over the past 20 years for a pandemic and other public health threats. But he said Washington had “become preoccupied with other important things."" “Our collective memory is short,” he said. “Just three months ago the country was consumed with impeaching a president. Now that seems like ancient Roman history.” Now, Alexander said, Congress should start thinking about preparing for the next pandemic — even amid the scourge of covid-19: “If there is to be finger pointing, I hope fingers will point in that direction.” Addressing the theme of the hearing — “Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School” — Alexander declared that indefinite stay-at-home orders would be unworkable. “There is not enough money available to help all those hurt by a closed economy,” he said. “All roads back to work and back to school lead through testing, tracking, isolation, treatment and vaccines.” Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

Key senators, witnesses are appearing remotely The Senate hearing will be far different from most on Capitol Hill, with many senators and the four witnesses appearing remotely. Neither the panel’s chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), nor its top Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), plan to be in the hearing room, according to aides. Alexander’s office disclosed that he will self-quarantine in Tennessee for two weeks after an aide tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The four health officials are appearing via video conference after Katie Miller, Vice President Pence’s press secretary who participated regularly in the administration’s task force briefings, tested positive for the coronavirus. Even some senators who are in Washington will appear from their offices rather than the hearing room, aides said. Those who arrived early, including Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), were wearing masks. By Seung Min Kim and John Wagner

Schumer encourages Fauci to be a ‘truth-teller’ Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope Tuesday that senators would hear from a Fauci who was not “muzzled” by the president during the hearing. “Dr. Fauci is a truth-teller,"" Schumer said during an appearance on CNN. ""That’s his reputation. It seems he has sort of muted the truth some in the presence of the president. … He has to tell the whole truth here. The president does not like the truth. He likes a story that helps his own ego on the day he tells it. And that has had severe consequences for this country.” During remarks Monday on the Senate floor, Schumer encouraged Fauci to “let it rip” during the Senate hearing. “This will be one of the first opportunities for Dr. Fauci to tell the American people the unvarnished truth without the president looking over his shoulder,” Schumer said. By John Wagner

Democrats prepared to grill the witnesses Democratic senators on the committee are preparing to grill top federal health officials, with much of the questioning centered on whether the nation is ready to reopen parts of the country that had been shuttered to contain the pandemic. Among the topics that senators plan to raise at Tuesday’s hearing are problems in the supply chain for tests, how the federal government makes decisions about testing machines and testing capacity, and workplace safety standards for businesses that choose to reopen. Democrats also want to question the health officials on what the administration’s metrics and goals are for testing, and why it did not take certain key steps earlier, according to interviews Monday with senators and aides. “I’m interested in more of a prospective interrogation,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “I think there’s going to be a commission and a very painful, under-the-hood look at what went horribly wrong. Right now, my state’s in crisis and we need answers as to whether we’re going to safely reopen.” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the committee’s ranking Democrat, plans to focus on reports that the White House interfered with guidance from public health experts and how the federal government will properly distribute a vaccine once it is eventually developed. “The fact of the matter is, President Trump has been more focused on fighting against the truth, than fighting this virus — and Americans have sadly paid the price,” Murray will say in her opening remarks. “Still, President Trump is trying to ignore the facts, and ignore the experts who have been clear we are nowhere close to where we need to be to reopen safely.” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), another member of the Senate health committee, said in an interview that he wants to compare the U.S. government response to the coronavirus pandemic to that of South Korea, which has been lauded for aggressive testing and tracing measures to contain the outbreak. “I just think it didn’t have to be this way,” Kaine said.

As coronavirus cases spike across Florida , dozens of hospitals in the state have announced that their intensive-care units are at capacity and many more warn that they are dangerously low on beds to handle the influx of new virus patients .
At least 56 Florida ICUs have run out of beds for coronavirus patients , and 35 more have said their bed availability has dropped to 10 percent or lower . The news comes as Florida recorded more than 7,300 new coronavirus cases , 380 new coronavirus hospitalizations , and 63 more deaths from the infection .
Despite the rising number of cases , Florida governor Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that the death rate in his state has begun to taper off , noting that most of the new cases are younger patients .
“ We are prepared for this , ” DeSantis said . “ In places like Miami , you ’ re seeing increased traffic in the hospitals , but it ’ s interesting , I was down there today , and they said that they ’ re actually seeing fewer hospitalizations from people in nursing homes , which is obviously a good sign because that ’ s where the No.1 risk of mortality is . ”
Several other states have seen their coronavirus cases surge in recent weeks after they reopened large swaths of their economies . Georgia passed 100,000 positive coronavirus cases on Tuesday , making it the ninth state to reach that number . The same day , California recorded a record daily increase of more than 10,200 new coronavirus cases , as well as a record 6,000 hospitalized patients . Some Texas counties have also warned that their hospital ICUs will run out of beds over the next two weeks .
Dr. Anthony Fauci , chief medical adviser for the Trump administration ’ s coronavirus task force , noted on Tuesday that the death rate from the virus has decreased , but warned against “ false complacency ” as the pathogen continues to spread .
“ It ’ s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death , ” Fauci said . “ There ’ s so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus , don ’ t get yourself into false complacency . ”
“ The death rate is lower , I admit that . Because people in general , who are young or healthier . But that doesn ’ t mean that you could not get seriously ill , ” he added .

At least 56 Florida ICUs have run out of beds for coronavirus patients, and 35 more have said their bed availability has dropped to 10 percent or lower. The news comes as Florida recorded more than 7,300 new coronavirus cases, 380 new coronavirus hospitalizations, and 63 more deaths from the infection.

Despite the rising number of cases, Florida governor Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that the death rate in his state has begun to taper off, noting that most of the new cases are younger patients.

“We are prepared for this,” DeSantis said. “In places like Miami, you’re seeing increased traffic in the hospitals, but it’s interesting, I was down there today, and they said that they’re actually seeing fewer hospitalizations from people in nursing homes, which is obviously a good sign because that’s where the No.1 risk of mortality is.”

Several other states have seen their coronavirus cases surge in recent weeks after they reopened large swaths of their economies. Georgia passed 100,000 positive coronavirus cases on Tuesday, making it the ninth state to reach that number. The same day, California recorded a record daily increase of more than 10,200 new coronavirus cases, as well as a record 6,000 hospitalized patients. Some Texas counties have also warned that their hospital ICUs will run out of beds over the next two weeks.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser for the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, noted on Tuesday that the death rate from the virus has decreased, but warned against “false complacency” as the pathogen continues to spread.

“It’s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,” Fauci said. “There’s so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don’t get yourself into false complacency.”

“The death rate is lower, I admit that. Because people in general, who are young or healthier. But that doesn’t mean that you could not get seriously ill,” he added.

The U.S. has recorded more than three million positive cases of coronavirus, and 131,200 people in the country have died after being infected.

Skepticism about China’s numbers has swirled throughout the crisis, fueled by official efforts to quash bad news in the early days and a general distrust of the government. Long lines of people waiting to collect the ashes of loved ones at funeral homes last week revived the debate.

There is no smoking gun pointing to a cover-up by China’s ruling Communist Party. But intentional or not, there is reason to believe that more people died of COVID-19 than the official tally, which stood at 3,312 at the end of Tuesday.

In a classified report released to the White House, three U.S. intelligence officers concluded that China has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country, underreporting both total cases and fatalities from the disease.

Bloomberg, which first wrote about the report, cited the officers who they said they alerted the White House last week to Beijing's misleading numbers. Two of the three sources called the numbers flat-out fake.

coronavirus,New York Times - News,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-guidelines.html,Trump Extends Social Distancing Guidelines Through End of April,2020-03-29,Michael D. Shear,"From The New York Times , I ’ m Michael Barbaro . This is “ The Daily. ” Today : As the pandemic quickly spreads across the U.S. , hundreds of hospitals are now confronting their first serious cases of the coronavirus . Susan Dominus on the lessons from the first confirmed case in New Jersey . It ’ s Monday , March 30 . Sue , tell me how you first heard about James Cai .
Well , a few weeks ago I heard about this young guy , a 32-year-old physician assistant , who was the very first patient in all of New Jersey to test positive for Covid-19 . And so I reached out to him while he was still at the hospital . And I was sort of wondering , would it possibly be OK , could you maybe find some time to talk ? And he said , sure , call me now . I ’ m in isolation , in other words , and I have time .
james cai Hello ? [ COUGHING ] susan dominus Are you there ? james cai Yes . [ COUGHING ] susan dominus OK .
james cai So my name is James Cai , and I ’ m a physician assistant .
And his mother and grandfather live in New Jersey , and so he spends quite a bit of time there as well .
james cai And I work as a primary care , urgent care and nursing home P.A .
He came to this country when he was about 16 from Shanghai . And he ’ s married and has a 20-month-old daughter , whom he adores .
susan dominus Why did you go into medicine in the first place ? Why were you drawn to medicine ? james cai Oh , because of my grandparents . They are doctors . My grandfather is an anesthesiologist in Shanghai . And when I was young , I always sick , so I always went to his hospital . So I had a good impression .
And as someone working in the medical field , was James expecting to interact with this epidemic , the coronavirus ? Was he maybe even thinking he would end up treating coronavirus patients ?
Well , he doesn ’ t work in a hospital . And because he works in private practice , I think he probably imagined he might be working remotely — with telemedicine .
james cai I actually heard about coronavirus many months ago when China had outbreak . But I always followed the disease .
But because of the family background and because he does work in medicine , when news of the coronavirus did start coming out of Wuhan , he definitely understood how quickly the virus could spread . And he definitely understood that the only way to guarantee that you could survive this was by not getting it in the first place .
james cai Around end of February , I started to pile up all the food , like canned foods , frozen vegetables , dumplings .
So soon after the coronavirus landed on the west coast , he and his family went to Costco and stocked up —
james cai Our family plan is to stay home for two months .
Right . So they were going to avoid any meaningful exposure to the virus ?
Yeah , if there was communal spread and it had become widespread , their plan was to shelter in place .
susan dominus So you weren ’ t sure at what point you would start doing that , but you felt you ’ d know when it was time ? james cai Yes .
But , you know , he ’ s stocking up at the end of February . You know , people in the U.S. were still flying all over the country . Kids were going to school . Bloomberg was in the race for president . People were planning vacations and weddings and all sorts of conferences and events . And the same was true of James . So like everybody else , he ’ s going about his life . And around this time , without really too much concern about his health , he went to a medical conference in Times Square .
james cai So I changed diaper for my daughter and gave her morning milk . And I kissed my wife and to go to conference .
On the fourth day of the conference , Monday , March 2 , he comes down with a cough . And he starts to realize he ’ s actually getting sick .
james cai I start to cough and a fever and tired .
So he leaves and texts his wife that he ’ s going to go to New Jersey , where his mom has a house . His mom ’ s away . And he doesn ’ t want to come home and get his wife and the baby sick .
james cai Because of my daughter , when I went home , she always hugged me and kissed me . And she will catch it .
And what ’ s running through his head at this moment ? Is he thinking , I have a bad cough ? I might have the flu ? Is coronavirus even on his mind ?
Not really . I mean , there had not been a single case in all of New Jersey . He thought he probably had the flu . By then , he was mostly feeling this bad cough . He had an elevated heart rate . His eyes were really runny . He had diarrhea . He was not feeling well at all . But he also was not alarmed . You know , he decided to go to one of those drop-in centers to get a flu test , because he wanted to be told he didn ’ t have the flu so he could go home . So the doctor gives him a strep test and a flu test . They discuss whether he should get a coronavirus test , in fact , but the doctor didn ’ t have one . So they moved on . And the results came back that although the strep and the flu tests were negative , his symptoms were consistent with something called a pulmonary embolism , which is a clot in your lung that can be fatal .
So this could potentially be even more serious than just a seasonal flu or —
james cai So after , I went direct to the Hackensack emergency room .
So the doctor sends him to the E.R . at the Hackensack University Medical Center , which is not far from that doctor ’ s office .
james cai And in the emergency room , they asked me questions . Asked me if I cough . I said , I do , I do have cough . I do have shortness of breath .
So as called for , the doctors do a CT scan . And after they do , they realize that , no , he does not have a pulmonary embolism . But that in fact , because of the symptoms he ’ s having and the way his lungs look in the scan —
james cai They see a ground glass nodules . So this can be coronavirus .
And how do the doctors at this hospital react to that ?
Well , at this point , they haven ’ t seen any coronavirus patients . So they don ’ t seem to him terribly alarmed . That said , they do put him in a tiny isolation room , a windowless room on the floor of the emergency room . That ’ s where he spends the night , texting his friends and his wife and getting increasingly unnerved and feeling quite ill .
james cai I was nervous . And at the same time , since I ’ m in the hospital , I ’ m going to check everything . Make sure I ’ m OK and then I go home .
So then on Tuesday , March 3 , which is the second day in the hospital —
james cai They decide to do a test on me . So the test takes about 24 hours or 48 hours .
— they do a Covid-19 test . And they tell him he ’ s going to have to wait a few days for the result , but he shouldn ’ t worry , he ’ s young and healthy . At the same time , he ’ s wildly Googling symptoms for Covid-19 and realizing that he has almost every one of them .
james cai I had maybe lied to myself , was like , trying to calm myself down . I don ’ t have the Covid-19 , I shouldn ’ t have it .
And so , it ’ s day three for James in the hospital . It ’ s Wednesday , March 4 . He ’ s still waiting for the results in his tiny little room with a TV . And —
archived recording ( newscaster 1 ) We we begin tonight with breaking news regarding the coronavirus . archived recording ( newscaster 2 ) Yeah , that virus arriving in the Garden State tonight . Governor Phil Murphy announcing the first presumptive positive case of the virus right here in New Jersey .
archived recording ( newscaster 2 ) A man in his thirties is hospitalized in Bergen County .
There ’ s a guy in his thirties in Bergen County , which is where he is , who ’ s tested positive for coronavirus . It ’ s the first case in New Jersey .
There ’ s even a tweet from the governor of New Jersey confirming it .
archived recording ( newscaster 2 ) — “ We take this situation very seriously and have been preparing for this for weeks . I urge residents to remain calm ” —
And it occurs to James , they really might be talking about him .
james cai And then I asked the doctor , saying , is this me ? And the doctor ’ s saying , no , your test is not back yet .
And of course , he hasn ’ t heard anything about the results of his test yet ?
susan dominus Wow . So you found out from the news from the governor of New Jersey ? james cai Yes . On TV . And I asked the doctor . The doctor say , the result is not back yet .
And then the next day , his doctors come to him and say , yes , you have tested positive . And he is the first person in New Jersey to have tested positive for Covid-19 .
Right . And perhaps the first person in the history of the universe to find out he has a disease , not from his doctor , but from TV news .
So he ’ s really scared . But the hospital is telling him that he really has nothing to worry about . He ’ s a 32-year-old guy . He ’ s got no preexisting conditions .
james cai Even Dr. [ INAUDIBLE ] was telling me , oh you ’ re so young . It ’ s like a flu .
james cai If it ’ s not because everybody is talking about corona , you can go home already .
You know , if it weren ’ t for all this attention about the coronavirus , you ’ d be home right now , just getting better in the comfort of your own bedroom .
In other words , it would probably just self-resolve in somebody of his health ?
james cai I mean , that day , I was so depressed .
I think he felt that as a medical professional , he actually — he knew that he was quite vulnerable , that nobody was invulnerable . And there was this disconnect between his own concerns and their own insistence that he was overly anxious .
It also dawns on him that he is the first person in this hospital to be treated for coronavirus .
james cai I feel like , I ’ m in real trouble . Why I come to this hospital ? Because I feel they don ’ t know how to treat this disease , and they don ’ t have deep understanding about this disease .
Nobody there has any experience . Nobody there can make good predictions . Nobody there has institutional knowledge about what happens when this goes wrong or something unexpected happens . He ’ s the first person , and that ’ s a very frightening position to be in .
We ’ ll be right back . So Sue , James is newly diagnosed . He ’ s in isolation at this hospital in Hackensack , New Jersey . He ’ s been there for about four days . Physically , how is he doing at this point ?
susan dominus When you first got the results of the positive test , on a scale of 1 to 10 , how bad did you feel physically ? 10 being the worst ? james cai I would say 10. susan dominus Wow .
james cai Getting worse . So my heart is compensating , beating very fast .
He definitely has that cough . And he also is having real trouble breathing .
james cai It ’ s like I ’ m in the water . susan dominus Tell me more about that . james cai It ’ s like , normally , we can just take very deep breaths in and out .
He describes it as that feeling when you ’ re underwater and you have to come up to gasp for breath , but you can ’ t quite get that oxygen that you want . And it ’ s very panicking feeling . It ’ s a very scary feeling .
james cai So my lung is not allowing me to take deep breaths .
And how is the hospital treating him now that he ’ s officially tested positive ?
They move him to a room with certain protections in place . And they ’ re keeping an eye on his numbers . And they ’ re giving him oxygen when he needs it . And he ’ s also keeping an eye on his numbers . And he ’ s worried , because he is not breathing well . And on Friday , March 6 , his fifth day in the hospital , he worries that he is desaturating to a dangerous level .
It means that when you desaturate below a certain level , your blood is not getting enough oxygen from your lungs for you to function in a normal , healthy way . And this is really concerning to him .
james cai You have pneumonia , it ’ s normal . Just use oxygen .
But he still has the sense that the hospital is telling him he ’ s overreacting , that he ’ s being too anxious . He ’ s going to recover just fine .
james cai I was confused . And also , I was worried , because I think I ’ m not getting enough care . And my oxygen level dropped , and they — they can not even see it .
And why do you think people in hospital are saying that ? And maybe more importantly , why are they thinking that ? Why are they insisting on being so calm about what it would mean to have an infection like this ?
I would have to guess that it ’ s because the widespread impression that people had was that young people were not going to be terribly affected by this virus , and that it was going to feel like a very , very bad flu . And that he was going to recover just fine , just like the statistics supposedly said he was going to .
susan dominus And did you actually feel yourself having difficulty breathing at that point ? james cai I just feel tightness . susan dominus Tightness in your chest ? james cai I feel like , a very scary — very scared . And I don ’ t know what to do next .
And James is all too aware that no one in that hospital has ever treated anyone with coronavirus . And he ’ s really worried about his symptoms , because he knows he ’ s feeling worse and worse every day .
james cai So I told my cousin , I told everybody , and they just start searching . .
So he starts reaching out to friends of his who are plugged into the Chinese medical community , including his best friend , who ’ s a physician — and whom he calls his cousin — and his boss . And they start making phone calls and trying to get information from experienced people who can maybe share what they ’ ve learned .
You know , there ’ s advice that he should get high doses of vitamin C , there ’ s some discussion of whether he should get a steroid treatment if things get worse .
They say that maybe he wants to look into antiviral medication . They tell him he shouldn ’ t wait too long before getting a second CT scan . But his doctors were really reluctant to do that .
They felt like they were giving him good care and that probably the results of the CT scan would not change that .
So James is more or less beginning to advise his own doctors on how to treat him , based on his research , based on his relationship with other medical professionals , which is pretty unusual .
Yes . Very unusual . And then the evening of the 7th , he starts desaturating to a level that really scares him . He ’ s concerned that if he desaturates to a certain degree , there could be no turning back . He ’ d have to be intubated , which definitely increases , you know , all of the risks of the illness . It would mean that a machine was going be doing all the breathing for him . It could lead to organ failure and in some cases , of course , death .
james cai And I mean , if I intubated at night , I probably would just die by myself alone , without seeing the loved ones .
And his friends — also , some of them see this real urgency to save his life . And you know , one of his friends said to me that he personally felt responsible for making sure that the doctors took James ’ s case as seriously as possible . Here he is . He ’ s the first health care worker in New Jersey also to come down with Covid-19 . If he didn ’ t make it , it was going to feel like the battle was over before it had even begun .
james cai You always live in fear that you ’ re never going to wake up . And also , in isolation . And nobody can see you . So it ’ s very miserable . If people die , think about it , people die and they can not see their loved ones . What — I mean , like , I feel like it ’ s very tough , right ? For somebody to die alone . susan dominus You were scared . I mean , you were probably too weak to really speak forcefully , but you were letting them know that you felt that your life was on the line at this point . james cai Yeah .
And we don ’ t exactly know why , but on the 8th , he did get that second CT scan .
It ’ s bad . He has pneumonia in both lungs . 30 to 40 percent of his lungs seem to be affected . That ’ s astonishing , that it would go from a small spot just a few days earlier to where it is now . And if he had gotten that bad in three days or four days since the last CT scan , how much worse was he going to be in another four days ? And now , James starts to worry that he really might not survive this .
james cai I was praying to everybody , to God , to Buddha , to everybody , saying , don ’ t let me die . When I know my oxygen levels keep desaturating , one of my requests is can I see my mother and my wife or my daughter for the last time ? It was that time , when my chest X-rays show so bad , and my oxygen level every day is dropping , and I would tell them that I have to be strong , but I don ’ t know how many days I can live . And the good thing is , after the CT , they listened . When she saw second CT , she was like , OK , we have to treat you .
I spoke to a doctor at the hospital who was part of the team overseeing his care . And he said they ’ d been looking at the whole clinical picture , had recognized that he was declining even before the CT scan . But from James ’ s point of view , everything changed after the scan . He feels like , now they ’ re taking this very seriously and they ’ re listening to him . They ’ re coming around to seeing just how serious it is . And also recognizing that , yes , even a young person can get very , very sick with coronavirus . And they ’ re willing to try something .
And at this stage , what is he asking them to do ?
james cai So then a doctor in China recommend a high-flow machine .
James wants a few different types of treatment . He ’ s been advised that the doctors should try providing him a more intensive form of oxygen therapy . And he wants to go on three experimental antiviral medications — Kaletra , chloroquine and remdesivir . And at this point , he and the doctors at Hackensack and all the other doctors he ’ s working with are pretty much all on the same page . He finally gets the main things he ’ s been asking for .
james cai And I think the next day , Dr. [ INAUDIBLE ] came in . He said , the medication ’ s here . We ’ re going to give it to you .
And finally , after more than a week in the hospital , James starts to turn around . He does start to feel better .
james cai So after the first day , my fever finally dropped . And my oxygen stopped dropping . I ’ m getting better and better every day . So that ’ s the whole thing .
And does he have a sense , do you have a sense , do his doctors have a sense of which of these treatments was responsible for that ?
Not really . I mean , it might have been any one of the drugs , or all of the drugs , or the oxygen , or some combination of that . Or he might have just gotten better on his own . We really don ’ t know .
susan dominus And so I asked you how you felt on a scale of 1 to 10 , 10 being the worst , when you first got the results of the test , and you said that you were a 10 . On a scale of 1 to 10 , how do you feel now ? james cai I would say now , maybe 3. susan dominus That ’ s pretty good . james cai Yeah , because I feel like all the symptoms have gone . I mean , I will be maybe no worry if tests come back negative . Then I know the virus is dead . Now , I don ’ t know if it is dead or not . susan dominus It ’ s now 10:37 , and I need you to get a good night ’ s sleep . So I ’ m going to call you in the morning and see how your oxygen level were . Is that OK ? james cai Yes . OK . Thank you . susan dominus All right . Thanks , James . Bye . Bye . james cai Good night . Bye-bye .
Sue , it feels — correct me if I ’ m wrong — like a big reason why James survived was because he was such an aggressive advocate for himself . And he had this network of expertise that he could tap into . He himself was a medical professional . And that that put him in a very strong position . But I wonder why the people around him in this hospital were not better prepared , given the stage of this pandemic when he arrived in Hackensack .
We don ’ t really know what saved his life , because these drugs are still in clinical trials . What we do know is that the entire story of coronavirus in this country is a story of lack of preparation . People did not believe that it simply was never going to be as bad here as it was in Wuhan or Milan . That is a universal story . It was hardly just these doctors at this hospital . I mean , part of it is that they are busy people . They are moving things really quickly . They are saving lives every day . In fact , we all know that they ’ re saving lives and putting their own lives on the line right now . But also , it is just hard to put yourself back in that moment — March 1 , March 2 or the end of February — and remember how unlikely we all still hoped and believed , against all evidence , that this wasn ’ t going to be devastating here the way it was elsewhere .
That said , to their credit , the doctors at this hospital were open-minded and they were flexible and they were nimble . And they were willing to try whatever they could that was safe when they realized that whatever they had been doing definitely was not working . And I know James feels really appreciative , ultimately . He sent out a tweet that expressed his gratitude for the hospital saving , as he sees it , his life .
Sue , what do you think the lesson of this story is , of James , his very unique situation in these early days of the pandemic in the United States , and of what happened to him at this hospital ?
One of the things that I ’ m hearing from doctors is that until you are in this moment and experiencing the onslaught of patients , it is very hard to imagine it . You can ’ t really know until you ’ re actually living it . And you know , every hospital in this country is likely to have its James . It ’ s going to have that first patient who comes in , who is really ill. They ’ re not exactly sure how to treat it . We still really don ’ t know how best to treat this virus . That is the hard , cold truth of it . There are some protocols that we hope will help , that are thought might help . But it ’ s unclear . It ’ s so new . And it ’ s going to be really hard for all those hospitals . And they ’ re going to have to make difficult choices . They ’ re going to have to make complicated ethical choices . They ’ re going to have to make decisions on the fly and build up their clinical experience . And it ’ s not going to be easy for any of them .
Sue , how is James doing at this point ? I don ’ t know when the last time it was that you spoke with him , but what did he tell you ?
He ’ s home . He is still in quarantine . So he still has not been able to see his wife or daughter . And his lungs are still recovering . It ’ s unclear just how fully they will recover . You know , it ’ s definitely a long road ahead of him . And at the same time , you know , he ’ s reading the news and he is feeling so lucky .
james cai Hello ? susan dominus Hi , James , it ’ s Sue . How are you doing ? james cai I ’ m good . susan dominus Are you actually in your own home ? james cai Yes . susan dominus How does it feel ? james cai It feels great . I ’ m going to sleep on my own bed . susan dominus Fantastic . james cai Once I ’ m out of the hospital , I feel like I ’ m alive . I feel like everything is so new to me . The grass , trees , cars , new people face , the sky . And then when I drive on the road , I appreciate every building , every people I see . I feel like it ’ s a second chance to live again , to be alive . susan dominus What is the first thing you ’ re going to say to your daughter and wife when you finally get to see them in person ? I know you ’ re quarantining for almost two more weeks now . james cai Yes . So when I see my daughter and my wife , I definitely will give them big hugs . Try to don ’ t let them go .

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: As the pandemic quickly spreads across the U.S., hundreds of hospitals are now confronting their first serious cases of the coronavirus. Susan Dominus on the lessons from the first confirmed case in New Jersey. It’s Monday, March 30. Sue, tell me how you first heard about James Cai.

susan dominus

Well, a few weeks ago I heard about this young guy, a 32-year-old physician assistant, who was the very first patient in all of New Jersey to test positive for Covid-19. And so I reached out to him while he was still at the hospital. And I was sort of wondering, would it possibly be OK, could you maybe find some time to talk? And he said, sure, call me now. I’m in isolation, in other words, and I have time.

james cai Hello? [COUGHING] susan dominus Are you there? james cai Yes. [COUGHING] susan dominus OK.

michael barbaro

And what was the story that he told you?

susan dominus

So James lives and works in New York City.

james cai So my name is James Cai, and I’m a physician assistant.

susan dominus

And his mother and grandfather live in New Jersey, and so he spends quite a bit of time there as well.

james cai And I work as a primary care, urgent care and nursing home P.A.

susan dominus

He came to this country when he was about 16 from Shanghai. And he’s married and has a 20-month-old daughter, whom he adores.

susan dominus Why did you go into medicine in the first place? Why were you drawn to medicine? james cai Oh, because of my grandparents. They are doctors. My grandfather is an anesthesiologist in Shanghai. And when I was young, I always sick, so I always went to his hospital. So I had a good impression.

michael barbaro

And as someone working in the medical field, was James expecting to interact with this epidemic, the coronavirus? Was he maybe even thinking he would end up treating coronavirus patients?

susan dominus

Well, he doesn’t work in a hospital. And because he works in private practice, I think he probably imagined he might be working remotely — with telemedicine.

james cai I actually heard about coronavirus many months ago when China had outbreak. But I always followed the disease.

susan dominus

But because of the family background and because he does work in medicine, when news of the coronavirus did start coming out of Wuhan, he definitely understood how quickly the virus could spread. And he definitely understood that the only way to guarantee that you could survive this was by not getting it in the first place.

james cai Around end of February, I started to pile up all the food, like canned foods, frozen vegetables, dumplings.

susan dominus

So soon after the coronavirus landed on the west coast, he and his family went to Costco and stocked up —

james cai Our family plan is to stay home for two months.

susan dominus

— for like, two months’ worth of supplies.

michael barbaro

Right. So they were going to avoid any meaningful exposure to the virus?

susan dominus

Yeah, if there was communal spread and it had become widespread, their plan was to shelter in place.

michael barbaro

And well ahead of the rest of us.

susan dominus

Yeah, I think that’s right.

susan dominus So you weren’t sure at what point you would start doing that, but you felt you’d know when it was time? james cai Yes.

susan dominus

But, you know, he’s stocking up at the end of February. You know, people in the U.S. were still flying all over the country. Kids were going to school. Bloomberg was in the race for president. People were planning vacations and weddings and all sorts of conferences and events. And the same was true of James. So like everybody else, he’s going about his life. And around this time, without really too much concern about his health, he went to a medical conference in Times Square.

james cai So I changed diaper for my daughter and gave her morning milk. And I kissed my wife and to go to conference.

susan dominus

On the fourth day of the conference, Monday, March 2, he comes down with a cough. And he starts to realize he’s actually getting sick.

james cai I start to cough and a fever and tired.

susan dominus

So he leaves and texts his wife that he’s going to go to New Jersey, where his mom has a house. His mom’s away. And he doesn’t want to come home and get his wife and the baby sick.

james cai Because of my daughter, when I went home, she always hugged me and kissed me. And she will catch it.

michael barbaro

And what’s running through his head at this moment? Is he thinking, I have a bad cough? I might have the flu? Is coronavirus even on his mind?

susan dominus

Not really. I mean, there had not been a single case in all of New Jersey. He thought he probably had the flu. By then, he was mostly feeling this bad cough. He had an elevated heart rate. His eyes were really runny. He had diarrhea. He was not feeling well at all. But he also was not alarmed. You know, he decided to go to one of those drop-in centers to get a flu test, because he wanted to be told he didn’t have the flu so he could go home. So the doctor gives him a strep test and a flu test. They discuss whether he should get a coronavirus test, in fact, but the doctor didn’t have one. So they moved on. And the results came back that although the strep and the flu tests were negative, his symptoms were consistent with something called a pulmonary embolism, which is a clot in your lung that can be fatal.

michael barbaro

So this could potentially be even more serious than just a seasonal flu or —

susan dominus

Yes. Certainly more serious than the flu.

james cai So after, I went direct to the Hackensack emergency room.

susan dominus

So the doctor sends him to the E.R. at the Hackensack University Medical Center, which is not far from that doctor’s office.

james cai And in the emergency room, they asked me questions. Asked me if I cough. I said, I do, I do have cough. I do have shortness of breath.

susan dominus

So as called for, the doctors do a CT scan. And after they do, they realize that, no, he does not have a pulmonary embolism. But that in fact, because of the symptoms he’s having and the way his lungs look in the scan —

james cai They see a ground glass nodules. So this can be coronavirus.

susan dominus

— he might actually have coronavirus.

michael barbaro

And how do the doctors at this hospital react to that?

susan dominus

Well, at this point, they haven’t seen any coronavirus patients. So they don’t seem to him terribly alarmed. That said, they do put him in a tiny isolation room, a windowless room on the floor of the emergency room. That’s where he spends the night, texting his friends and his wife and getting increasingly unnerved and feeling quite ill.

james cai I was nervous. And at the same time, since I’m in the hospital, I’m going to check everything. Make sure I’m OK and then I go home.

susan dominus

So then on Tuesday, March 3, which is the second day in the hospital —

james cai They decide to do a test on me. So the test takes about 24 hours or 48 hours.

susan dominus

— they do a Covid-19 test. And they tell him he’s going to have to wait a few days for the result, but he shouldn’t worry, he’s young and healthy. At the same time, he’s wildly Googling symptoms for Covid-19 and realizing that he has almost every one of them.

james cai I had maybe lied to myself, was like, trying to calm myself down. I don’t have the Covid-19, I shouldn’t have it.

susan dominus

And so, it’s day three for James in the hospital. It’s Wednesday, March 4. He’s still waiting for the results in his tiny little room with a TV. And —

archived recording [SOUND OF LOCAL NEWS THEME]

susan dominus

— a local news report comes on.

archived recording (newscaster 1) We we begin tonight with breaking news regarding the coronavirus. archived recording (newscaster 2) Yeah, that virus arriving in the Garden State tonight. Governor Phil Murphy announcing the first presumptive positive case of the virus right here in New Jersey.

susan dominus

And the news report says —

archived recording (newscaster 2) A man in his thirties is hospitalized in Bergen County.

susan dominus

There’s a guy in his thirties in Bergen County, which is where he is, who’s tested positive for coronavirus. It’s the first case in New Jersey.

archived recording (newscaster 2) Governor Murphy saying —

susan dominus

There’s even a tweet from the governor of New Jersey confirming it.

archived recording (newscaster 2) — “We take this situation very seriously and have been preparing for this for weeks. I urge residents to remain calm” —

susan dominus

And it occurs to James, they really might be talking about him.

james cai And then I asked the doctor, saying, is this me? And the doctor’s saying, no, your test is not back yet.

michael barbaro

And of course, he hasn’t heard anything about the results of his test yet?

susan dominus

No, he has not heard anything.

susan dominus Wow. So you found out from the news from the governor of New Jersey? james cai Yes. On TV. And I asked the doctor. The doctor say, the result is not back yet.

susan dominus

And then the next day, his doctors come to him and say, yes, you have tested positive. And he is the first person in New Jersey to have tested positive for Covid-19.

michael barbaro

Right. And perhaps the first person in the history of the universe to find out he has a disease, not from his doctor, but from TV news.

susan dominus

Let’s hope so.

michael barbaro

And how does the hospital react in this moment?

susan dominus

So he’s really scared. But the hospital is telling him that he really has nothing to worry about. He’s a 32-year-old guy. He’s got no preexisting conditions.

james cai Even Dr. [INAUDIBLE] was telling me, oh you’re so young. It’s like a flu.

susan dominus

In fact, one doctor even told him —

james cai If it’s not because everybody is talking about corona, you can go home already.

susan dominus

You know, if it weren’t for all this attention about the coronavirus, you’d be home right now, just getting better in the comfort of your own bedroom.

michael barbaro

In other words, it would probably just self-resolve in somebody of his health?

susan dominus

That was definitely the expectation.

james cai I mean, that day, I was so depressed.

susan dominus

I think he felt that as a medical professional, he actually — he knew that he was quite vulnerable, that nobody was invulnerable. And there was this disconnect between his own concerns and their own insistence that he was overly anxious.

james cai America is not ready.

susan dominus

It also dawns on him that he is the first person in this hospital to be treated for coronavirus.

james cai I feel like, I’m in real trouble. Why I come to this hospital? Because I feel they don’t know how to treat this disease, and they don’t have deep understanding about this disease.

susan dominus

Nobody there has any experience. Nobody there can make good predictions. Nobody there has institutional knowledge about what happens when this goes wrong or something unexpected happens. He’s the first person, and that’s a very frightening position to be in.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Sue, James is newly diagnosed. He’s in isolation at this hospital in Hackensack, New Jersey. He’s been there for about four days. Physically, how is he doing at this point?

susan dominus When you first got the results of the positive test, on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad did you feel physically? 10 being the worst? james cai I would say 10. susan dominus Wow.

susan dominus

He is feeling worse by the day.

james cai Getting worse. So my heart is compensating, beating very fast.

susan dominus

He definitely has that cough. And he also is having real trouble breathing.

james cai It’s like I’m in the water. susan dominus Tell me more about that. james cai It’s like, normally, we can just take very deep breaths in and out.

susan dominus

He describes it as that feeling when you’re underwater and you have to come up to gasp for breath, but you can’t quite get that oxygen that you want. And it’s very panicking feeling. It’s a very scary feeling.

james cai So my lung is not allowing me to take deep breaths.

michael barbaro

And how is the hospital treating him now that he’s officially tested positive?

susan dominus

They move him to a room with certain protections in place. And they’re keeping an eye on his numbers. And they’re giving him oxygen when he needs it. And he’s also keeping an eye on his numbers. And he’s worried, because he is not breathing well. And on Friday, March 6, his fifth day in the hospital, he worries that he is desaturating to a dangerous level.

james cai And I desats.

susan dominus

He desats.

susan dominus You desaturated.

michael barbaro

And what does that mean, to desaturate?

susan dominus

It means that when you desaturate below a certain level, your blood is not getting enough oxygen from your lungs for you to function in a normal, healthy way. And this is really concerning to him.

james cai You have pneumonia, it’s normal. Just use oxygen.

susan dominus

But he still has the sense that the hospital is telling him he’s overreacting, that he’s being too anxious. He’s going to recover just fine.

james cai I was confused. And also, I was worried, because I think I’m not getting enough care. And my oxygen level dropped, and they — they cannot even see it.

michael barbaro

And why do you think people in hospital are saying that? And maybe more importantly, why are they thinking that? Why are they insisting on being so calm about what it would mean to have an infection like this?

susan dominus

I would have to guess that it’s because the widespread impression that people had was that young people were not going to be terribly affected by this virus, and that it was going to feel like a very, very bad flu. And that he was going to recover just fine, just like the statistics supposedly said he was going to.

susan dominus And did you actually feel yourself having difficulty breathing at that point? james cai I just feel tightness. susan dominus Tightness in your chest? james cai I feel like, a very scary — very scared. And I don’t know what to do next.

susan dominus

And James is all too aware that no one in that hospital has ever treated anyone with coronavirus. And he’s really worried about his symptoms, because he knows he’s feeling worse and worse every day.

james cai So I told my cousin, I told everybody, and they just start searching. .

susan dominus

So he starts reaching out to friends of his who are plugged into the Chinese medical community, including his best friend, who’s a physician — and whom he calls his cousin — and his boss. And they start making phone calls and trying to get information from experienced people who can maybe share what they’ve learned.

michael barbaro

Which is what?

susan dominus

You know, there’s advice that he should get high doses of vitamin C, there’s some discussion of whether he should get a steroid treatment if things get worse.

james cai He translate the seventh edition.

susan dominus

They say that maybe he wants to look into antiviral medication. They tell him he shouldn’t wait too long before getting a second CT scan. But his doctors were really reluctant to do that.

michael barbaro

Why was that?

susan dominus

They felt like they were giving him good care and that probably the results of the CT scan would not change that.

michael barbaro

So James is more or less beginning to advise his own doctors on how to treat him, based on his research, based on his relationship with other medical professionals, which is pretty unusual.

susan dominus

Yes. Very unusual. And then the evening of the 7th, he starts desaturating to a level that really scares him. He’s concerned that if he desaturates to a certain degree, there could be no turning back. He’d have to be intubated, which definitely increases, you know, all of the risks of the illness. It would mean that a machine was going be doing all the breathing for him. It could lead to organ failure and in some cases, of course, death.

james cai And I mean, if I intubated at night, I probably would just die by myself alone, without seeing the loved ones.

susan dominus

And his friends — also, some of them see this real urgency to save his life. And you know, one of his friends said to me that he personally felt responsible for making sure that the doctors took James’s case as seriously as possible. Here he is. He’s the first health care worker in New Jersey also to come down with Covid-19. If he didn’t make it, it was going to feel like the battle was over before it had even begun.

james cai You always live in fear that you’re never going to wake up. And also, in isolation. And nobody can see you. So it’s very miserable. If people die, think about it, people die and they cannot see their loved ones. What — I mean, like, I feel like it’s very tough, right? For somebody to die alone. susan dominus You were scared. I mean, you were probably too weak to really speak forcefully, but you were letting them know that you felt that your life was on the line at this point. james cai Yeah.

susan dominus

And we don’t exactly know why, but on the 8th, he did get that second CT scan.

james cai And it come back very bad.

susan dominus

It’s bad. He has pneumonia in both lungs. 30 to 40 percent of his lungs seem to be affected. That’s astonishing, that it would go from a small spot just a few days earlier to where it is now. And if he had gotten that bad in three days or four days since the last CT scan, how much worse was he going to be in another four days? And now, James starts to worry that he really might not survive this.

james cai I was praying to everybody, to God, to Buddha, to everybody, saying, don’t let me die. When I know my oxygen levels keep desaturating, one of my requests is can I see my mother and my wife or my daughter for the last time? It was that time, when my chest X-rays show so bad, and my oxygen level every day is dropping, and I would tell them that I have to be strong, but I don’t know how many days I can live. And the good thing is, after the CT, they listened. When she saw second CT, she was like, OK, we have to treat you.

susan dominus

I spoke to a doctor at the hospital who was part of the team overseeing his care. And he said they’d been looking at the whole clinical picture, had recognized that he was declining even before the CT scan. But from James’s point of view, everything changed after the scan. He feels like, now they’re taking this very seriously and they’re listening to him. They’re coming around to seeing just how serious it is. And also recognizing that, yes, even a young person can get very, very sick with coronavirus. And they’re willing to try something.

michael barbaro

And at this stage, what is he asking them to do?

james cai So then a doctor in China recommend a high-flow machine.

susan dominus

James wants a few different types of treatment. He’s been advised that the doctors should try providing him a more intensive form of oxygen therapy. And he wants to go on three experimental antiviral medications — Kaletra, chloroquine and remdesivir. And at this point, he and the doctors at Hackensack and all the other doctors he’s working with are pretty much all on the same page. He finally gets the main things he’s been asking for.

james cai And I think the next day, Dr. [INAUDIBLE] came in. He said, the medication’s here. We’re going to give it to you.

susan dominus

And finally, after more than a week in the hospital, James starts to turn around. He does start to feel better.

james cai So after the first day, my fever finally dropped. And my oxygen stopped dropping. I’m getting better and better every day. So that’s the whole thing.

michael barbaro

And does he have a sense, do you have a sense, do his doctors have a sense of which of these treatments was responsible for that?

susan dominus

Not really. I mean, it might have been any one of the drugs, or all of the drugs, or the oxygen, or some combination of that. Or he might have just gotten better on his own. We really don’t know.

susan dominus And so I asked you how you felt on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, when you first got the results of the test, and you said that you were a 10. On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you feel now? james cai I would say now, maybe 3. susan dominus That’s pretty good. james cai Yeah, because I feel like all the symptoms have gone. I mean, I will be maybe no worry if tests come back negative. Then I know the virus is dead. Now, I don’t know if it is dead or not. susan dominus It’s now 10:37, and I need you to get a good night’s sleep. So I’m going to call you in the morning and see how your oxygen level were. Is that OK? james cai Yes. OK. Thank you. susan dominus All right. Thanks, James. Bye. Bye. james cai Good night. Bye-bye.

michael barbaro

Sue, it feels — correct me if I’m wrong — like a big reason why James survived was because he was such an aggressive advocate for himself. And he had this network of expertise that he could tap into. He himself was a medical professional. And that that put him in a very strong position. But I wonder why the people around him in this hospital were not better prepared, given the stage of this pandemic when he arrived in Hackensack.

susan dominus

We don’t really know what saved his life, because these drugs are still in clinical trials. What we do know is that the entire story of coronavirus in this country is a story of lack of preparation. People did not believe that it simply was never going to be as bad here as it was in Wuhan or Milan. That is a universal story. It was hardly just these doctors at this hospital. I mean, part of it is that they are busy people. They are moving things really quickly. They are saving lives every day. In fact, we all know that they’re saving lives and putting their own lives on the line right now. But also, it is just hard to put yourself back in that moment — March 1, March 2 or the end of February — and remember how unlikely we all still hoped and believed, against all evidence, that this wasn’t going to be devastating here the way it was elsewhere.

michael barbaro

Right.

susan dominus

That said, to their credit, the doctors at this hospital were open-minded and they were flexible and they were nimble. And they were willing to try whatever they could that was safe when they realized that whatever they had been doing definitely was not working. And I know James feels really appreciative, ultimately. He sent out a tweet that expressed his gratitude for the hospital saving, as he sees it, his life.

michael barbaro

Sue, what do you think the lesson of this story is, of James, his very unique situation in these early days of the pandemic in the United States, and of what happened to him at this hospital?

susan dominus

One of the things that I’m hearing from doctors is that until you are in this moment and experiencing the onslaught of patients, it is very hard to imagine it. You can’t really know until you’re actually living it. And you know, every hospital in this country is likely to have its James. It’s going to have that first patient who comes in, who is really ill. They’re not exactly sure how to treat it. We still really don’t know how best to treat this virus. That is the hard, cold truth of it. There are some protocols that we hope will help, that are thought might help. But it’s unclear. It’s so new. And it’s going to be really hard for all those hospitals. And they’re going to have to make difficult choices. They’re going to have to make complicated ethical choices. They’re going to have to make decisions on the fly and build up their clinical experience. And it’s not going to be easy for any of them.

michael barbaro

Sue, how is James doing at this point? I don’t know when the last time it was that you spoke with him, but what did he tell you?

susan dominus

He’s home. He is still in quarantine. So he still has not been able to see his wife or daughter. And his lungs are still recovering. It’s unclear just how fully they will recover. You know, it’s definitely a long road ahead of him. And at the same time, you know, he’s reading the news and he is feeling so lucky.

michael barbaro

Lucky to be alive?

susan dominus

To be alive.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Sue.

susan dominus

Thank you, Michael.

james cai Hello? susan dominus Hi, James, it’s Sue. How are you doing? james cai I’m good. susan dominus Are you actually in your own home? james cai Yes. susan dominus How does it feel? james cai It feels great. I’m going to sleep on my own bed. susan dominus Fantastic. james cai Once I’m out of the hospital, I feel like I’m alive. I feel like everything is so new to me. The grass, trees, cars, new people face, the sky. And then when I drive on the road, I appreciate every building, every people I see. I feel like it’s a second chance to live again, to be alive. susan dominus What is the first thing you’re going to say to your daughter and wife when you finally get to see them in person? I know you’re quarantining for almost two more weeks now. james cai Yes. So when I see my daughter and my wife, I definitely will give them big hugs. Try to don’t let them go. I maybe will, like, have my daughter in my arms all the time. I will come home and spend every minute with my family. Appreciate every day, living. susan dominus All right. Good night. Have a great night’s sleep. Thanks, James. james cai Thank you. Thank you for checking in on me. susan dominus My pleasure. Bye. Goodbye. james cai Bye-bye.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. In interviews on Sunday, members of the president’s coronavirus task force delivered dire warnings about the pandemic’s projected path in the United States.

archived recording (dr. deborah birx) No state, no metro area will be spared. And the sooner we react, and the sooner the states and the metro areas react and ensure that they put in full mitigation, at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need, then we’ll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans.

michael barbaro

Speaking to NBC News, Dr. Deborah Birx said that the White House was asking every state to prepare for the kind of outbreak now occurring in New York, where there are about 60,000 infections.

archived recording (jake tapper) Well, Dr. Birx said yesterday, as you know, that she doesn’t think any city will be spared from this virus. How many cases do you think the U.S. will reach? archived recording (dr. anthony fauci) I mean, looking at what we’re seeing now, you know, I would say between 100 and 200,000 cases — excuse me, deaths. But I just don’t think that we really need to make a projection when it’s such a moving target.

michael barbaro

On CNN, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that millions of Americans could eventually be infected, and that between 100,000 and 200,000 could die.

archived recording (dr. anthony fauci) What we do know, Jake, is that we’ve got a serious problem in New York. We have a serious problem in New Orleans. And we’re going to be developing serious problems in other areas.

Only a month ago , China reported several thousand new cases a day , outnumbering infections in other countries about 120 to 1 .","The novel coronavirus has infected nearly 100,000 people worldwide — spreading to around 90 countries and even slipping past the walls of the Vatican.

The tiny city-state within Rome confirmed its first case Friday, but wouldn’t say who was infected.

The Vatican has insisted that Pope Francis — who canceled audiences last week over a “slight indisposition” — has only a cold. He has tested negative for the coronavirus.

Vatican officials said they are working with Italian authorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Italy as a whole remained the European epicenter of the illness, particularly in its northern regions. A total of 148 fatalities have been reported there.

Meanwhile, in Iran, 3,500 cases and at least 107 deaths have been reported — including senior politician Hossein Sheikholeslam, a diplomat and the country’s former ambassador to Syria, Business Insider reported.

Eight percent of the country’s parliament has tested positive for the deadly infection, CNN reported earlier this week.

In the UK, a woman in her 70s with underlying health conditions became the first person in the country to die of COVID-19, the BBC reported.

The woman, who had been “in and out of hospital for non-coronavirus reasons,” was admitted and tested positive for the infection Wednesday.

The total number of people infected in the country surged to 116 Friday — rising by more than 30 in 24 hours — but the prime minister’s official spokesman said it was “highly likely the virus is going to spread in a significant way,” according to the report.

The Netherlands and Cameroon each reported their first cases on Friday.

South Korea, the second-hardest-hit country, saw 505 additional cases reported Friday, a notable decline from a high of 851 Tuesday.

While the country has touted its “remarkable diagnostic and treatment abilities,” vice health minister Kim Gang-lip said, “It’s not easy to make predictions about how the situation … would play out.”

China, where the virus originated in December, reported 143 new cases Friday, the same as a day earlier — but a marked decline from earlier in the outbreak.

Only a month ago, China reported several thousand new cases a day, outnumbering infections in other countries about 120 to 1.

New @ FREOPP : Updated report on # COVID19 nursing home fatalities with the latest data as of Friday . https : //t.co/ylZ5EqAzWY Nursing homes & assisted living facilities now represent 42 % of all deaths from the coronavirus—up from 40 % earlier this month—and 52 % outside of NY state . pic.twitter.com/78N6vD5Afp — Avik Roy ( @ Avik ) May 26 , 2020
Remember that only 1.8 % of U.S. residents live in nursing homes or assisted living facilities , and yet these facilities have tallied 42 % of all # COVID19 deaths . — Avik Roy ( @ Avik ) May 26 , 2020
Roy later clarified that the actual percentage of Americans living in these facilities is 0.6 percent . New York leads the nation in the total number of statewide COVID deaths generally , as well as at nursing homes -- but its overall percentage may still look somewhat favorable due to its government 's decision to alter the manner in which such deaths are counted . As the media flocked to cover this bogus story out of Florida ( because of course they did ) , New York 's apparent statistical sleight of hand has garnered relatively little attention . As we 've covered , Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and his team did an extraordinary job of recognizing and addressing COVID 's unique threat to nursing homes , achieving impressive and life-saving results thus far . Florida 's population is older and larger than New York 's , yet its death toll is roughly one-tenth of the Empire State 's . Thousands more people perished from the virus in New York nursing homes alone than in the entire state of Florida . Health policy expert Avik Roy , who published the tweets embedded above , adds additional insight based on the data :
States like New York , New Jersey , and Michigan actually ordered nursing homes to accept patients with active COVID-19 infections who were being discharged from hospitals . The most charitable interpretation of these orders is that they were designed to ensure that states would not overcrowd their ICUs . But well after hospitalizations peaked , governors like New York ’ s Andrew Cuomo were doubling down on their mandates . As recently as April 23 , Cuomo declared that nursing homes “ don ’ t have a right to object ” to accepting elderly patients with active COVID infections . “ That is the rule and that is the regulation and they have to comply with that. ” Only on May 10—after the deaths of nearly 3,000 New York residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities—did Cuomo stand down and partially rescind his order ... Contrast the decisions by governors like Cuomo with those of Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis . In Florida , all nursing home workers were required to be screened for COVID-19 symptoms before entering a facility . On March 15 , before most states had locked down , DeSantis signed an executive order that banned nursing home visitations from friends and family , and also banned hospitals from discharging SARS-CoV-2-infected patients into long-term care facilities ... While it is too late for thousands of nursing home residents who have already died , there is still time to protect the millions who remain , by learning from Florida ’ s example .
Learning from one 's mistakes should not include craven blame shift and purging the public record . This looks very suspicious , in light of the deserved criticism New York 's disastrous policies are facing :

Remember that only 1.8% of U.S. residents live in nursing homes or assisted living facilities, and yet these facilities have tallied 42% of all #COVID19 deaths. — Avik Roy (@Avik) May 26, 2020



Roy later clarified that the actual percentage of Americans living in these facilities is 0.6 percent. New York leads the nation in the total number of statewide COVID deaths generally, as well as at nursing homes -- but its overall percentage may still look somewhat favorable due to its government's decision to alter the manner in which such deaths are counted. As the media flocked to cover this bogus story out of Florida (because of course they did), New York's apparent statistical sleight of hand has garnered relatively little attention. As we've covered, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and his team did an extraordinary job of recognizing and addressing COVID's unique threat to nursing homes, achieving impressive and life-saving results thus far. Florida's population is older and larger than New York's, yet its death toll is roughly one-tenth of the Empire State's. Thousands more people perished from the virus in New York nursing homes alone than in the entire state of Florida. Health policy expert Avik Roy, who published the tweets embedded above, adds additional insight based on the data:

States like New York, New Jersey, and Michigan actually ordered nursing homes to accept patients with active COVID-19 infections who were being discharged from hospitals. The most charitable interpretation of these orders is that they were designed to ensure that states would not overcrowd their ICUs. But well after hospitalizations peaked, governors like New York’s Andrew Cuomo were doubling down on their mandates. As recently as April 23, Cuomo declared that nursing homes “don’t have a right to object” to accepting elderly patients with active COVID infections. “That is the rule and that is the regulation and they have to comply with that.” Only on May 10—after the deaths of nearly 3,000 New York residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities—did Cuomo stand down and partially rescind his order...Contrast the decisions by governors like Cuomo with those of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In Florida, all nursing home workers were required to be screened for COVID-19 symptoms before entering a facility. On March 15, before most states had locked down, DeSantis signed an executive order that banned nursing home visitations from friends and family, and also banned hospitals from discharging SARS-CoV-2-infected patients into long-term care facilities...While it is too late for thousands of nursing home residents who have already died, there is still time to protect the millions who remain, by learning from Florida’s example.

Learning from one's mistakes should not include craven blame shift and purging the public record. This looks very suspicious, in light of the deserved criticism New York's disastrous policies are facing:

I'll leave you with the mixed results of the reopening process thus far. Many of the critics' worst fears and most frightening predictions have failed to materialize -- but we need to keep a careful eye on rising hospitalizations:

Or just grabbing a burger at Poopy ’ s Pub and Grub in Savanna , Illinois .
Each of these activities became the subject of a federal lawsuit , as residents , businesses and even lawmakers challenged state shutdown orders designed to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus .
The cases test where the lines are safely drawn , as governors balance protecting public health against individual liberties . Governors say strict rules save lives , but critics who are forced to stay home or shutter their businesses called the steps “ draconian ” or compared them to “ house arrest. ” The lawsuits come as President Donald Trump has become increasingly vocal in criticism of state restrictions , encouraged protests at state capitols and urged churches to reopen despite restrictions .
More than 1,300 state and federal lawsuits have been filed over COVID-19 , including 240 dealing with civil rights , as of Friday , according to Hunton Andrews Kurth , a law firm tracking the cases . ███ reviewed more than 80 lawsuits that often dealt with conditions at prisons and nursing homes , voting rights , and university tuition . ███ focused on legal challenges to restrictions such as stay-at-home orders and business closures , and also whether abortion or church services can be limited during the pandemic , to gauge which orders were being challenged and how states were responding .
The eventual rulings could redefine the balance between state police powers and constitutional rights that advocates contend are too important to sacrifice even temporarily . Abortions are time sensitive . Buyers want guns during times of crisis . And parishioners seek solace at church . Other lawsuits test whether rules go beyond legislative authorities by requiring people to isolate themselves , stay apart in public and wear masks .
“ I tend to think there will be some new law made only because there are new scenarios that courts haven ’ t encountered before , '' said Polly Price , a law professor at Emory University . “ What they ’ re balancing is the scientific basis for a particular measure and the state ’ s need for it , in the face of uncertainty , to protect the public health . ''
But Ilya Somin , a law professor at George Mason University , expected only minor changes in the scope of police powers because even if gun shops and churches win their lawsuits , their activities cover a small fraction of the overall shutdown .
“ The scope of this kind of shutdown is unprecedented in American history and maybe even unprecedented in the history of liberal democracies generally , '' Somin said . `` The overall impact of these cases on the police power , even if the plaintiffs ultimately succeed , is pretty small . ''
Edward Richards , a law professor at Louisiana State University who has a master ’ s degree in public health for disease control , said health restrictions have been held paramount since the threat of yellow fever hung over the Constitutional Convention . But he said businesses have always been skeptical and political leaders now openly question the legitimacy of health science .
“ The legal picture doesn ’ t give us a real portrayal of the long-term ambivalent support toward public health , '' Richards said . `` We ’ ve never had the governmental authorities starting with the president actively undermining the public ’ s trust in public health , actively questioning whether the diseases are actually serious . ”
Access to abortion amid the pandemic became a legal issue when some governors banned non-essential medical procedures , to preserve hospital space for COVID-19 patients . In Texas , a panel of the 5th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Gov . Greg Abbott 's March 22 order banning elective procedures covered abortion .
But two other appeals courts – panels of the 10th Circuit and the 6th Circuit – allowed abortions to continue despite state orders against elective procedures from Oklahoma Gov . Kevin Stitt and Tennessee Gov . Bill Lee .
“ We do not uphold an injunction against state action lightly , much less during a public health crisis like the one our nation is experiencing now , ” Judge Karen Nelson Moore wrote for the 6th Circuit , favoring flexibility for governors and legislatures to balance rights . “ Affording flexibility , however , is not the same as abdicating responsibility , especially when well-established constitutional rights are at stake , as the right to abortion most assuredly is . ”
Another side-effect of shutdown orders halted gun sales , either because governors deemed stores non-essential or because government services were suspended .
The Connecticut Citizens Defense League filed a federal lawsuit against Gov . Ned Lamont because fingerprinting for a personal background check that is required for gun permits was suspended .
State Attorney General William Tong said the lawsuit has no merit and he would defend Lamont ’ s order . A hearing is scheduled for June 1 .
In Massachusetts , gun stores sued Gov . Charles Baker for ordering the shops closed as non-essential . U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock temporarily blocked Baker ’ s order May 9 so long as workers and customers wear face coverings and schedule appointments for sales , with no more than four per hour .
“ The need for personal self-defense is most acute during times of uncertainty and crisis – when law enforcement services may not be available or may not be reliably available , and when ( as now ) criminal offenders may be released from custody or may be less likely to be taken into custody in the first place , '' said the lawsuit from businesses Troy City Tactical , Shooting Supply and others .
Places of worship are one place people can gather during a pandemic that forced people apart . But the risks linger , like when 180 parishioners were exposed during a Mothers Day service in California . Many Georgia churches stayed closed as restrictions eased .
Kentucky has been a battleground . Two federal judges upheld Gov . Andy Beshear ’ s order against gatherings including church of more than 10 people . Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron , a Republican , opposed Democrat Beshear 's order for church services in a court filing .
On May 2 , a panel of the 6th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily allowed drive-in services by loudspeaker at Maryville Baptist Church . A week later , the appeals court also allowed in-person services .
“ There are some things you can ’ t do online that you can do in person , ” said Mathew Staver , a lawyer representing the church , who said two state troopers walked car to car during the drive-in service handing out quarantine notices .
Other cases are pending . In Minnesota , churches joined non-essential businesses in suing to block Gov . Tim Walz 's orders . Walz created `` a draconian shutdown that picks winners and losers , with devastating effects , '' the lawsuit said .
“ Worshippers across Minnesota have been prohibited from assembling to celebrate Easter and the Passover , while liquor stores have remained open , ” said the lawsuit from Northland Baptist Church , Living Word Christian Center , Glow in One Mini Golf and Myron ’ s Cards and Gifts . “ Target , Walmart , Walgreens and CVS are open , while local Hallmark stores are closed . Golf courses and bait shops are open , but indoor amusement facilities are shut . ”

Walz spokesman Teddy Tschann said the governor ’ s actions were grounded in the need to protect the health and safety of Minnesotans .
U.S. District Judge Wilhelmina Wright scheduled a hearing in the case for Tuesday .
In Virginia , Pastor Kevin Wilson at Lighthouse Fellowship Church of Chincoteague received a citation after 16 people attended a Palm Sunday service and parishioners were threatened with citations if they returned for Easter . Gov . Ralph Northam barred gatherings of more than 10 people through June 10 .
U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen 's rejected a request from the church to block Northam 's order because it does `` not refer to a religious practice to single it out for discriminatory treatment . ''
Staver , a lawyer who is appealing the decision and representing the pastor in criminal court , said the church doesn ’ t have an internet option and caters to vulnerable parishioners with histories of prostitution or drug addiction .
“ The church is their family , so they don ’ t have any other option , ” Staver said .
Churches gained a powerful allies . Trump announced Friday that his administration would consider churches and synagogues essential and he told governors to reopen them for the Memorial Day weekend . The Justice Department had already warned states in letters not to discriminate against places of worship .
“ The commonwealth of Virginia has offered no good reason for refusing to trust congregants who promise to use care in worship in the same way it trusts accountants , lawyers and others to do the same , ” said Eric Dreiband , chief of the department ’ s civil rights division .
Dreiband has also warned California Gov . Gavin Newsom against discriminating against places of worship by resuming operations at schools , restaurants and offices first .
`` Whichever level of restrictions you adopt , these civil rights protections mandate equal treatment of persons and activities of a secular and religious nature , '' Dreiband 's letter said .
Dr. Irwin Redlener , co-director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University , said the country needs leadership to explain why lifting shutdown orders would be dangerous before developing tools to ensure public health .
“ Opening stores before we have ability to do on-site daily testing is just playing Russian roulette with our families , ” said Redlener , a clinical professor of health management . “ We don ’ t want to take a step or many steps backwards where economic or political interests can override the public ’ s health . ”
Restrictions repeatedly pitted Democratic governors against Republican lawmakers , as officials grappled with how strict to make shutdown orders and how soon to relax them . In Wisconsin , the state Supreme Court overturned Gov . Tony Evers ’ stay-at-home order under a lawsuit from the state legislature . Even after the order was lifted , many continued to stay home .
Under a 1905 U.S. Supreme Court decision , courts tend to side with public health restrictions so long as they are based on science and tailored to deal with the emergency . State courts have supported restrictions set by Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer and Northam , whose restrictions sparked high-profile protests in Lansing and Raleigh .
In Maryland , U.S. District Judge Catherine Blake refused May 20 to overturn Gov . Larry Hogan 's orders for residents to stay home and close non-essential businesses , and for passengers on public transportation to wear masks . Hogan `` made reasonable choices '' informed by date and science , Blake wrote , while critics including state lawmakers , ministers and tourist destinations , minimized the risks of the pandemic with `` no contrary scientific authority . ''
The U.S. Supreme Court refused May 6 to hear a Pennsylvania case challenging Gov . Tom Wolf ’ s orders closing non-essential businesses . Price , the Emory professor , said the high court likely would n't intervene in a business case because rules vary across the 50 states , but a ruling would apply nationwide .
`` If they did that , it would be very hard to apply that in the other 49 states , '' Price said .
Other cases are still pending . Illinois Rep. Darren Bailey , a Republican , argued in a state lawsuit that Democratic Gov . J.B. Pritzker ’ s shutdown orders violated his rights by quarantining him at home , and by preventing him from traveling and attending worship services . The lawsuit contends Pritzker ’ s orders are unauthorized because the state legislature set a 30-day limit for governors to exercise such emergency police powers .
But Pritzker moved the case Thursday to U.S. District Court because of the constitutional issues at stake . Bailey opposed the move . The U.S. Justice Department filed an argument Friday in the federal case urging the federal court to return the case to state court .
“ However well-intentioned they may be , the executive orders appear to reach far beyond the scope of the 30-day emergency authority granted to the governor under Illinois law , ” said Steven Weinhoeft , the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois . “ Even during times of crisis , executive actions undertaken in the name of public safety must be lawful . ”
In Michigan , U.S. GOP Rep. Paul Mitchell challenged the governor 's orders for individuals to stay home and close businesses as unconstitutional – and not needed .
“ Given that the projected surge has not occurred , there is no basis , either legally or factually , to continue any further mandatory lockdown orders under criminal penalty , ” Mitchell ’ s lawsuit said . “ In short , Mitchell brings this lawsuit to define the limits of a State ’ s police power . ”
In Washington , four state lawmakers – Drew MacEwen , Andrew Barkis , Chris Corry and Brandon Vick – seek to block Gov . Jay Inslee ’ s restrictive orders .
“ We can declare victory , ” the lawsuit said of success in curbing the spread of virus . “ While the governor says otherwise , the facts don ’ t lie , and the Constitution does not authorize him to maintain infringements on Constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties on his mere say-so , with no avenue of review or redress . ”
John Farmer Jr. , director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University , said courts deferred to governors early in the pandemic under the threat that hospitals would become overwhelmed . But as the crisis wears on , even if courts overturn some restrictions as excessive , Farmer said governors and legislatures will debate the rules going forward .
“ No court in the country would want to wind up micromanaging in response to a pandemic , '' said Farmer , a former New Jersey attorney general and dean of Rutgers Law School . `` They might strike something down as excessive , but all that will do is return it to the political process for governors and legislatures to figure out . ''
State officials are filing their own lawsuits and taking other enforcement actions . Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller sued an Orange City man in April for alleged price gouging for charging $ 86 for a 12-pack of Angel Soft toilet paper and $ 50 for a six-pack of Bounty paper towels .
North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein won a temporary restraining order in May against Charlote ’ s A1 Towing Solutions and its owner , David Satterfield , to stop charging up to $ 4,400 after towing or booting vehicles .
New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said his office has received more than 4,000 complaints about price gouging on necessities such as food , bottled water and masks , and has issued 975 cease-and-desist letters . He is also charging business owners and individuals criminally for violating shutdown orders .
As officials grapple with restrictions , individuals and their businesses have challenged rules they contend are unfair or unworkable . Christopher Atchison , a professor emeritus at the University of Iowa 's Department of Health Management and Policy , said the 50 state `` laboratories of democracy '' respond differently as they gauge how infectious a virus is and how to combat it .
“ You wind up with a cauldron of different ingredients that result in the tensions that you get about what Wisconsin might be doing or Iowa might be doing , ” Atchison said .
Maine 's state nickname is Vacationland , but tourism businesses have argued they 've lost significant reservations because of Gov . Janet Mills . She initially ordered lodgings closed as non-essential and continues to require people visiting or returning from other states to spend 14 days in quarantine before venturing out .
Her reopening plan allowed Mainers to enjoy campgrounds starting Memorial Day weekend , but anticipates the quarantine rule remaining until August . Several businesses filed at least two federal lawsuits challenging the quarantine rule .
“ Who ’ s going to want to come up here to sit in their camper and not being allowed to leave ? ” asked Keith Richard , a lawyer for Bayley ’ s Camping Resort and Little Ossippee Campground . “ It ’ s really confusing for our campgrounds . ”
U.S. District Judge Lance Walker set a May 28 deadline for written arguments about whether to block Mills ' order temporarily .
In Illinois , Poopy ’ s bills itself as the biggest destination for bikers in the state and markets a 1-pound burger called the “ big poop. ” But the owners , Kevin and Peggy Promenschenkel , said they could go out of business if a federal court does n't block Gov . Pritzker ’ s closure order .
The local health department didn ’ t force Poopy ’ s to close , according to the lawsuit . But the Illinois Liquor Control Commission threatened to yank its license , along with unspecified criminal and civil penalties , if it remained open .
“ Pritzker has no constitutional authority to forcible close Poopy ’ s business , ” the lawsuit said .
Pritzker told reporters May 12 that more people would be hospitalized and would die if people don ’ t follow science in reopening gradually . In response to a question about whether Poopy ’ s and others could reopen , Pritzker said the “ vast majority ” of businesses and counties were reopening without “ relying on science in any way whatsoever . ”
“ I would just suggest to all of them that they are putting the patrons of their businesses and the people who live in their counties or in their cities in danger when they simply break the rules – break the law in fact – and decide they want to go it alone , ” Pritzker said . “ I just want to remind everybody , this virus is still out there and still killing people . ”","Camping in Scarborough, Maine.

Christopher Atchison, a professor emeritus at the University of Iowa's Department of Health Management and Policy, said the 50 state ""laboratories of democracy"" respond differently as they gauge how infectious a virus is and how to combat it.

“You wind up with a cauldron of different ingredients that result in the tensions that you get about what Wisconsin might be doing or Iowa might be doing,” Atchison said.

Maine's state nickname is Vacationland, but tourism businesses have argued they've lost significant reservations because of Gov. Janet Mills. She initially ordered lodgings closed as non-essential and continues to require people visiting or returning from other states to spend 14 days in quarantine before venturing out.

Her reopening plan allowed Mainers to enjoy campgrounds starting Memorial Day weekend, but anticipates the quarantine rule remaining until August. Several businesses filed at least two federal lawsuits challenging the quarantine rule.

“Who’s going to want to come up here to sit in their camper and not being allowed to leave?” asked Keith Richard, a lawyer for Bayley’s Camping Resort and Little Ossippee Campground. “It’s really confusing for our campgrounds.”

U.S. District Judge Lance Walker set a May 28 deadline for written arguments about whether to block Mills' order temporarily.

In Illinois, Poopy’s bills itself as the biggest destination for bikers in the state and markets a 1-pound burger called the “big poop.” But the owners, Kevin and Peggy Promenschenkel, said they could go out of business if a federal court doesn't block Gov. Pritzker’s closure order.

The local health department didn’t force Poopy’s to close, according to the lawsuit. But the Illinois Liquor Control Commission threatened to yank its license, along with unspecified criminal and civil penalties, if it remained open.

“Pritzker has no constitutional authority to forcible close Poopy’s business,” the lawsuit said.

Pritzker told reporters May 12 that more people would be hospitalized and would die if people don’t follow science in reopening gradually. In response to a question about whether Poopy’s and others could reopen, Pritzker said the “vast majority” of businesses and counties were reopening without “relying on science in any way whatsoever.”

“I would just suggest to all of them that they are putting the patrons of their businesses and the people who live in their counties or in their cities in danger when they simply break the rules – break the law in fact – and decide they want to go it alone,” Pritzker said. “I just want to remind everybody, this virus is still out there and still killing people.”",www.usatoday.com,center,qf003hNbODNrg9CH

Global financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund are warning that Covid-19 could trigger a global economic slowdown comparable only to the Great Depression .
One of the groups likely to suffer the most is millennials , many of whom have yet to fully recover from the Great Recession .
“ One thing we know is that younger workers who were more fragile are already being more hard hit . Older folks will suffer greater wealth losses , but at least they had that wealth cushion , ” the Atlantic ’ s Annie Lowrey told ███ ’ s Sean Illing recently .
Millennials , often categorized as people born between 1980 and 1997 , are economically vulnerable in part because they are an incredibly diverse generation , with about 55 percent being people of color . This diversity suggests that their economic situation is more broadly affected by financial inequalities than older generations .
In general , recent polls reveal that millennials — of all backgrounds — are experiencing high anxiety around how the coronavirus will affect their economic realities . For instance , a poll from the Pew Research Center conducted from April 7 to 12 ( among 4,917 adults , with a 2.1 percentage point margin of error ) found American millennials to be the most pessimistic of any age group about the future of the economy .
When asked whether the economy would be better or worse in one year , Americans over age 65 were the most optimistic , with 69 percent saying things would improve . But millennials were more likely to believe that things would be the same ( and they are not good now , as ███ ’ s Emily Stewart has explained ) or even worse . The majority of those between ages 18 and 29 said things would be the same or worse — 57 percent — as did 48 percent of those between ages 30 and 49 .
Adding to millennials ’ economic anxiety seems to be concerns about basic needs , including covering the costs of food and shelter . In early April , 60 percent of millennial-registered voters told pollsters at Quinnipiac University that the pandemic has them concerned about being unable to afford food , rent or mortgage , or medical expenses .
Millennials have every reason to be concerned , about their present and their future . Here are 14 charts that show why :
More young people have been laid off — and many of those still with jobs have had to take pay cuts
To get a sense of what things are like now , and how millennials are affected by cuts to their work hours , it ’ s helpful to look at this chart , from the Pew Research Center :
This chart , based on data from a poll of 4,917 adults ( taken from April 7 to 12 , with a 2.1 percentage point margin of error ) shows those between ages 18 and 29 have been the most affected by layoffs , with 35 percent saying they or someone in their household has lost their job . That cohort has been most affected by pay cuts as well , with 45 percent reporting reduced wages in their household .
Older millennials , who are entering their peak earning years , make up the second most affected group — 30 percent said they or someone in their household have lost their job and 39 percent said wages in the household have been cut .
Overall , a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist College poll found , with a 3.8 percentage point margin of error , that 55 percent of Americans under the age of 45 had either had hours cut , been laid off , or been furloughed as of April 26 .
Millennials of color have been particularly affected by layoffs . The unemployment rate for people of color was higher than it was for white Americans before the pandemic hit the US , and from February to March , it rose more sharply . According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics , black Americans saw a 0.9 percentage point increase , Latinx Americans a 1.6 percentage point increase , Asian Americans a 1.6 percentage point increase , and white Americans , a 0.9 percentage point increase .
Essentially , those making the least — including black and Latinx millennials — were more likely to be laid off than those making more .
It isn ’ t by chance that millennials are the group most affected by layoffs , furloughs , and wage reductions — and it appears that the jobs many worked were especially vulnerable to the restrictions needed to counter the pandemic .
Every industry has been affected by layoffs , but looking at the data from March , it is clear that the leisure and hospitality industry ( which includes hotels and restaurants ) alone lost 459,000 jobs .
In March , the sectors with the greatest job losses were in leisure and hospitality ; health care and social services ; professional services ( like consulting , administrative , and IT roles ) ; and retail sectors . And all four of those rely heavily on millennial labor .
As the above chart shows , industries that fall under the leisure and hospitality sector are majority millennial — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , in 2019 , 58.5 percent of “ accommodation and food services ” workers were between the ages of 20 and 44 ( with another 15.9 percent being under age 20 ) . And 52.9 percent of those employed in the “ arts , entertainment , and recreation ” industries ( which include professional sports , museums , and concert venues ) were between 20 and 44 .
Some industries with older workers — like farming — are clearly suffering more now than in March . But as ███ ’ s Matt Yglesias has noted , even as stay-at-home measures are relaxed , the millennial-heavy industries will likely be slowest to return to their former levels of profitability . People still need houses and apartments — a sector dominated by older Americans — amid the pandemic . But it isn ’ t clear there will be much appetite for dining or attending large sporting events anytime soon , meaning millennials working in the most affected sectors may face financial difficulties in the immediate future .
Millennials were in bad shape before the pandemic due to student debt
Layoffs , furloughs , and wage cuts due to the pandemic have stressed many households — particularly considering that Americans , in general , were dealing with nearly $ 15 trillion in debt :
Where older and younger Americans differ is that older Americans are more likely to have debt due to assets like homes that could , theoretically , be liquidated if times get tough . Most younger Americans , however , have much of their debt tied up in an asset that has no immediate value : their college education . ( And older millennials have debt due to both . )
What neither of these charts tells us is the scale of millennials ’ student loan debt burden . Looking just at federal student loans — which make up 92 percent of all student loans — the Department of Education found that Americans 24 or younger had $ 116 billion in debt at the end of 2019 ; those 25 to 34 had $ 498 billion ; and those 35 to 49 had $ 581 billion . People above the age of 50 , on the other hand , owed about $ 323 billion in student loans .
On average , millennials owed somewhere between $ 5,000 and $ 60,000 in student debt , and studies have found that debt comes with a cost . University of Wisconsin researchers Fenaba R. Addo and Yiling Zhang noted just how burdensome that debt can be in an essay in the 2019 series “ The Emerging Millennial Wealth Gap ” from the New America think tank : “ It is not surprising that the median wealth of all Millennials with any debt at age 30 is lower than those with no debt who attended college ; however , their median wealth levels are also lower than young adults who never attended college . ”
Many millennials took on college debt with the assumption that borrowing heavily while young would lead to higher wages as one aged . But given the high — and growing — cost of college education , younger millennials found themselves needing to wait longer than older millennials to see those benefits . And now , the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic raises the question of whether those benefits will ever materialize . This is true for millennials broadly , but even more true for millennials of color .
Wage gaps and heavier student loan burdens could make the pandemic more difficult for millennials of color
As is the case with health outcomes , the pandemic has revealed longstanding economic disparities .
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in the first quarter of 2020 , the median pay for a black male worker between the ages of 25 and 54 was $ 891 per week ; for a Latino man of the same age , it was $ 796 a week . Meanwhile , a white man of the same age averaged $ 1,128 per week . Women of all three racial groups made less than the average white man , with white women making $ 906 , black women making $ 767 , and Latina women making $ 701 .
People of color — particularly women of color — are more likely to hold jobs deemed essential , meaning they are more likely to be risking their lives than white men , all while being underpaid .
And for those millennials of color who are unemployed or furloughed , unemployment benefits ( not counting the temporary $ 600 per unemployment check provided by the CARES Act ) are calculated based on one ’ s former weekly earnings . This means these preexisting wage gaps will only exacerbate inequality at a particularly trying time , as Americans of color can expect to receive smaller unemployment benefits on average than white Americans .
This also means that millennials of color who attended college face a compound problem — first , they make less , making their degrees less valuable . Second , they , particularly black students , borrowed heavily to earn those degrees , and therefore have more to pay off . Data collected by New America ’ s Wesley Whistle found that in 2016 , 84 percent of black college-goers had taken out student loans , compared to 67 percent of white students .
And even before the coronavirus began affecting wages , these two factors caused black — and Latinx — college students to have more trouble than their white peers with staying current on their loan payments . In 2018 , the Federal Reserve found that 28 percent of black Americans ages 18 to 29 with student loans had fallen behind in their payments , as had 15 percent of Latinx college students in the same age range . By comparison , 7 percent of white 18- to 29-year-olds with debt were behind . And this was when the economy was doing “ well . ”
People of color are more affected in general — and that means more financial stress for millennials
Not all states have broken down their confirmed coronavirus case data by ethnicity , but a number of particularly hard-hit cities and states have , including Illinois , Michigan , and New York . And their numbers show black and Latinx Americans being disproportionately affected by Covid-19 — particularly those between the ages of 18 and 49 , as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows :
The latest CDC # COVIDView report with new hospitalization data on race/ethnicity by age is now available https : //t.co/zP4VYlo0Pb pic.twitter.com/HgstCJ7tO9 — CDC ( @ CDCgov ) April 24 , 2020
Some states have broken down this data further . Illinois , for instance , tracks confirmed cases based on age and ethnicity and found ( where race and ethnicity information is available ) that black and Latinx millennials are at particular risk for the disease .
Looking at available data , Latinx Illinoisans appear at particular risk compared to people of other ethnic backgrounds , with Latinx millennials ages 20 to 29 having more than 2,459 confirmed cases as of May 4 .
All of this adds to the economic stress millennials — particularly millennials of color — were already facing . Coronavirus testing is free , but any hospitalizations or emergency room visits related to coronavirus care are not . The average Covid-19-related hospital stay for an insured person is believed to be about $ 30,000 , according to the trade group America ’ s Health Insurance Plans . An analysis from FAIR Health , a nonprofit focused on the cost of care , found those without insurance — as about 16 percent of millennials are — can expect to pay between $ 42,486 and $ 74,310 .
And coronavirus costs don ’ t just fall on those who have the virus . They also disproportionately affect non-infected millennials of color who find themselves with unexpected hospital — and even funeral and interment — expenses for older family members . Death data is still incomplete , but what we have shows that black Americans make up one-third of all US coronavirus deaths , according to the Associated Press . Notably , the US is about 13 percent black ; the areas covered by the incomplete data are 14 percent black .
A 2019 Federal Reserve study found that 39 percent of Americans would not be able to weather a $ 400 emergency , and an SSRS/Bankrate poll conducted in January ( with a 3.39 percent margin of error ) found that 59 percent of Americans would be unable to cover a $ 1,000 emergency . Coronavirus-related health and end-of-life costs are far higher — they would be ruinous for many Americans in the best of times . That they would seem to disproportionately fall on those more likely to be furloughed or laid off , and to have heavier than average student loan burdens , makes them more onerous .
Millennials delayed home buying , which means they don ’ t have stable equity
With fewer resources , millennials have delayed buying homes — again , assets that for older Americans provide some measure of economic security amid sudden downturns like those created by the pandemic .
An analysis from Deutsche Bank shows that the median age of Americans buying homes increased sharply following the Great Recession . In 2009 , the median home-buying age was about 39 . In 2019 , when millennials were between the ages of 22 and 39 , the median age of homebuyers was 47 .
Homeownership has been particularly difficult for black millennials . A 2019 report by the National Association of Real Estate Brokers found that 16 percent of black millennials owned homes in 2017 , compared to 46 percent of white millennials , 34 percent of Asian American millennials , and 29 percent of Latinx millennials . The report ’ s authors found that even prior to the pandemic , fewer than 40 percent of black millennials were expected to own a home by the time they were 50 .
All this means that few millennials will exit the pandemic with an asset they can liquidate or leverage for loans , making their recovery all the more difficult — and making them all the more vulnerable to the next recession .
Millennials never really recovered from the Great Recession — and this time is looking worse
The Great Recession hit millennials really hard . They faced a sharp increase in unemployment , as this chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics illustrates :
That chart only includes people born in 1980 and ’ 81 , but it is reflective of the trends among all millennials — by the time the recession eased in 2010 , the Pew Research Center ’ s Drew DeSilver notes , unemployment was at 15.5 percent for Americans ages 20 to 24 .
In the decade after , millennials struggled to recover . A 2018 study by the St. Louis Federal Reserve found that while older Americans recovered in the years following the recession , millennials continued to sustain economic losses , so much so that by 2016 , the median wealth of a household headed by a millennial was 34 percent lower than historical models suggested it should have been .
Part of this is due to a decline in millennial income — the St. Louis Fed found that the median income for millennials was 10 percent lower in 2016 than it was pre-recession in 2007 . Also contributing to a decline in net worth , the study ’ s authors note , is that millennials were in a poor position to capitalize on some of the opportunities that allowed older Americans to rebound more quickly , such as low stock and property prices .
They also entered a job market during a period of high unemployment and low demand for workers , and found their wages depressed ; a 2017 study by the advocacy group Young Invincibles found millennials to have median wages 20 percent lower than Americans of the boomer generation did at their age .
Research shows that income levels began to recover for some millennials by 2016 . The average millennial college graduate was making about 7 percent more than expected by then , according to the 2019 New America report . Millennials who didn ’ t go to college , however , made about 9 percent less than expected . And as one might expect from the wage gap discussed before , there was a disparity in the recovery by ethnicity , leading to a larger racial wealth gap than existed previously .
In the New America report , Reid Cramer notes , “ The racial wealth gap in 2016 is larger than it was in the early 2000s , when the average non-Hispanic White household had ‘ only ’ six to seven times the wealth of the average African American household . ”
The Federal Reserve studied the racial wealth gap in 2016 and found the median net worth of a white American family was $ 171,000 . The median net worth of black and Latinx families , however , was $ 17,600 and 20,700 , respectively . Or , to compare as Reid did , the average white family had about 10 times the wealth of the average black family , and about 8.5 times as much as the average Latinx family . Reid also notes that far more black and Latinx families have zero or negative net worths than white families — nearly 20 percent of black families , and 15 percent of Latinx families .
This wealth gap — and millennials ’ difficulties in building wealth in general — is likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic . As ███ ’ s Emily Stewart has written , the US is already in a recession , and one analysts expect to become worse . Morgan Stanley has said investors should expect US GDP to fall by 37.9 percent in the second quarter of the year . Whether the economy will improve after that is a matter of debate . But even if it does , lasting damage will have been done , with millennials , again , among the most affected .

Global financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund are warning that Covid-19 could trigger a global economic slowdown comparable only to the Great Depression.

One of the groups likely to suffer the most is millennials, many of whom have yet to fully recover from the Great Recession.

“One thing we know is that younger workers who were more fragile are already being more hard hit. Older folks will suffer greater wealth losses, but at least they had that wealth cushion,” the Atlantic’s Annie Lowrey told Vox’s Sean Illing recently.

Millennials, often categorized as people born between 1980 and 1997, are economically vulnerable in part because they are an incredibly diverse generation, with about 55 percent being people of color. This diversity suggests that their economic situation is more broadly affected by financial inequalities than older generations.

In general, recent polls reveal that millennials — of all backgrounds — are experiencing high anxiety around how the coronavirus will affect their economic realities. For instance, a poll from the Pew Research Center conducted from April 7 to 12 (among 4,917 adults, with a 2.1 percentage point margin of error) found American millennials to be the most pessimistic of any age group about the future of the economy.

When asked whether the economy would be better or worse in one year, Americans over age 65 were the most optimistic, with 69 percent saying things would improve. But millennials were more likely to believe that things would be the same (and they are not good now, as Vox’s Emily Stewart has explained) or even worse. The majority of those between ages 18 and 29 said things would be the same or worse — 57 percent — as did 48 percent of those between ages 30 and 49.

Adding to millennials’ economic anxiety seems to be concerns about basic needs, including covering the costs of food and shelter. In early April, 60 percent of millennial-registered voters told pollsters at Quinnipiac University that the pandemic has them concerned about being unable to afford food, rent or mortgage, or medical expenses.

Millennials have every reason to be concerned, about their present and their future. Here are 14 charts that show why:

More young people have been laid off — and many of those still with jobs have had to take pay cuts

To get a sense of what things are like now, and how millennials are affected by cuts to their work hours, it’s helpful to look at this chart, from the Pew Research Center:

This chart, based on data from a poll of 4,917 adults (taken from April 7 to 12, with a 2.1 percentage point margin of error) shows those between ages 18 and 29 have been the most affected by layoffs, with 35 percent saying they or someone in their household has lost their job. That cohort has been most affected by pay cuts as well, with 45 percent reporting reduced wages in their household.

Older millennials, who are entering their peak earning years, make up the second most affected group — 30 percent said they or someone in their household have lost their job and 39 percent said wages in the household have been cut.

Overall, a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist College poll found, with a 3.8 percentage point margin of error, that 55 percent of Americans under the age of 45 had either had hours cut, been laid off, or been furloughed as of April 26.

Millennials of color have been particularly affected by layoffs. The unemployment rate for people of color was higher than it was for white Americans before the pandemic hit the US, and from February to March, it rose more sharply. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, black Americans saw a 0.9 percentage point increase, Latinx Americans a 1.6 percentage point increase, Asian Americans a 1.6 percentage point increase, and white Americans, a 0.9 percentage point increase.

Essentially, those making the least — including black and Latinx millennials — were more likely to be laid off than those making more.

It isn’t by chance that millennials are the group most affected by layoffs, furloughs, and wage reductions — and it appears that the jobs many worked were especially vulnerable to the restrictions needed to counter the pandemic.

Millennials disproportionately work in the industries hit hardest

Every industry has been affected by layoffs, but looking at the data from March, it is clear that the leisure and hospitality industry (which includes hotels and restaurants) alone lost 459,000 jobs.

In March, the sectors with the greatest job losses were in leisure and hospitality; health care and social services; professional services (like consulting, administrative, and IT roles); and retail sectors. And all four of those rely heavily on millennial labor.

As the above chart shows, industries that fall under the leisure and hospitality sector are majority millennial — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2019, 58.5 percent of “accommodation and food services” workers were between the ages of 20 and 44 (with another 15.9 percent being under age 20). And 52.9 percent of those employed in the “arts, entertainment, and recreation” industries (which include professional sports, museums, and concert venues) were between 20 and 44.

Some industries with older workers — like farming — are clearly suffering more now than in March. But as Vox’s Matt Yglesias has noted, even as stay-at-home measures are relaxed, the millennial-heavy industries will likely be slowest to return to their former levels of profitability. People still need houses and apartments — a sector dominated by older Americans — amid the pandemic. But it isn’t clear there will be much appetite for dining or attending large sporting events anytime soon, meaning millennials working in the most affected sectors may face financial difficulties in the immediate future.

Millennials were in bad shape before the pandemic due to student debt

Layoffs, furloughs, and wage cuts due to the pandemic have stressed many households — particularly considering that Americans, in general, were dealing with nearly $15 trillion in debt:

Where older and younger Americans differ is that older Americans are more likely to have debt due to assets like homes that could, theoretically, be liquidated if times get tough. Most younger Americans, however, have much of their debt tied up in an asset that has no immediate value: their college education. (And older millennials have debt due to both.)

What neither of these charts tells us is the scale of millennials’ student loan debt burden. Looking just at federal student loans — which make up 92 percent of all student loans — the Department of Education found that Americans 24 or younger had $116 billion in debt at the end of 2019; those 25 to 34 had $498 billion; and those 35 to 49 had $581 billion. People above the age of 50, on the other hand, owed about $323 billion in student loans.

On average, millennials owed somewhere between $5,000 and $60,000 in student debt, and studies have found that debt comes with a cost. University of Wisconsin researchers Fenaba R. Addo and Yiling Zhang noted just how burdensome that debt can be in an essay in the 2019 series “The Emerging Millennial Wealth Gap” from the New America think tank: “It is not surprising that the median wealth of all Millennials with any debt at age 30 is lower than those with no debt who attended college; however, their median wealth levels are also lower than young adults who never attended college.”

To help keep this news free , become a member and sign up for our newsletter , Outbreak Today .
Public health officials are on high alert for a mysterious new illness likely linked to the coronavirus that is hospitalizing hundreds of kids across the US .
On May 14 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave the illness a name : the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children , or MIS-C. At least 339 suspected or confirmed cases have been reported in 26 states , according to a ███ review of data from local health departments . At least 170 of these cases — about half the total cases in the country — are under investigation in New York , ground zero for the nation ’ s worst coronavirus outbreak . Three kids have died .
“ For the first several months of this horrible pandemic , we really thought kids were not being affected , ” according to Michael Anderson , president of the University of California San Francisco ’ s Benioff Children 's Hospitals .
Then in mid- to late April doctors in the United Kingdom and Italy began reporting kids of varying ages , from toddlers to teenagers , coming to the hospital with fevers , rashes , and other symptoms similar to an inflammatory illness called Kawasaki disease . In the last several weeks , cases have begun to be reported in cities like New York and Detroit as well .
“ Nobody read about this before . Nobody saw this coming . This is completely new , ” said Jane Burns , director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center , a collaboration between UC San Diego and Rady Children ’ s Hospital , “ and it is absolutely incontrovertibly connected to the appearance in our communities of this coronavirus . You just ca n't walk away from that observation . ”
As with COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus , there ’ s a lot experts do not know about this new syndrome , including what exactly is triggering it , who is most vulnerable , and how exactly it overlaps with Kawasaki disease . Further complicating matters , kids suspected of having it are exhibiting a wide range of symptoms , with some far more severe than others . Consequently , medical experts aren ’ t sure whether this is in fact a single syndrome or multiple ones .
The good news , multiple pediatricians told ███ , is the new syndrome is rare and most cases are treatable , and there ’ s so far been unprecedented coordination among academics , hospitals , and governments on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to learn more .
“ This has really been a whole of government and whole of society response , ” said Anderson , who has served as a consultant on the US government to learn more about the emerging syndrome . The United States Department of Health & Human Services , the Food and Drug Administration , National Institutes of Health , and CDC are “ all working on overdrive to help the children 's hospital and the pediatricians figure this out . ”
Here ’ s what we know so far about the new illness plaguing kids :
The new illness is most similar to Kawasaki disease — with some crucial differences .

Public health officials are on high alert for a mysterious new illness likely linked to the coronavirus that is hospitalizing hundreds of kids across the US.



On May 14, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave the illness a name: the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C. At least 339 suspected or confirmed cases have been reported in 26 states, according to a BuzzFeed News review of data from local health departments. At least 170 of these cases — about half the total cases in the country — are under investigation in New York, ground zero for the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreak. Three kids have died.

“For the first several months of this horrible pandemic, we really thought kids were not being affected,” according to Michael Anderson, president of the University of California San Francisco’s Benioff Children's Hospitals.

Then in mid- to late April doctors in the United Kingdom and Italy began reporting kids of varying ages, from toddlers to teenagers, coming to the hospital with fevers, rashes, and other symptoms similar to an inflammatory illness called Kawasaki disease. In the last several weeks, cases have begun to be reported in cities like New York and Detroit as well.

“Nobody read about this before. Nobody saw this coming. This is completely new,” said Jane Burns, director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center, a collaboration between UC San Diego and Rady Children’s Hospital, “and it is absolutely incontrovertibly connected to the appearance in our communities of this coronavirus. You just can't walk away from that observation.”

As with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, there’s a lot experts do not know about this new syndrome, including what exactly is triggering it, who is most vulnerable, and how exactly it overlaps with Kawasaki disease. Further complicating matters, kids suspected of having it are exhibiting a wide range of symptoms, with some far more severe than others. Consequently, medical experts aren’t sure whether this is in fact a single syndrome or multiple ones.



The good news, multiple pediatricians told BuzzFeed News, is the new syndrome is rare and most cases are treatable, and there’s so far been unprecedented coordination among academics, hospitals, and governments on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to learn more.

“This has really been a whole of government and whole of society response,” said Anderson, who has served as a consultant on the US government to learn more about the emerging syndrome. The United States Department of Health & Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and CDC are “all working on overdrive to help the children's hospital and the pediatricians figure this out.”

Here’s what we know so far about the new illness plaguing kids:

The new illness is most similar to Kawasaki disease — with some crucial differences.

Although no one knows exactly what triggers Kawasaki disease, it’s usually found in children who have viral infections. “We believe that the immune system has some massive reaction,” said Anderson.

Commonly found in kids under 5 years old, the classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a high fever that lasts several days, a rash, bloodshot eyes, swollen hands and feet, and swollen lymph glands in the neck. One of the most extreme complications is the ballooning and weakening of a child’s heart, called “coronary artery aneurysms.” According to the CDC, 5,440 kids under the age of 18 were hospitalized in the US for Kawasaki disease in 2016.

While children with the new MIS-C are being hospitalized with some of the same symptoms as Kawasaki disease, such as bloodshot eyes and rashes, they vary widely in age and more often experience heart complications and shock.

“They have cardiovascular collapse,” said Burns of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center, “so their heart muscle is just not working.”

There are also kids coming into hospitals with less severe symptoms, like prolonged fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. “Their laboratory studies are very different from what we typically see with Kawasaki disease,” said Burns, who views all these kids as experiencing “flavors of the same process with gradations of severity.”

Most cases respond well to treatment.

An overwhelming majority of the impacted kids are responding well to the same treatment used on patients with traditional Kawasaki disease. Specifically, the children have largely been treated with aspirin, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or IVIg.

“All of the children we’ve treated are getting better with steroids and IVIg. Of the 40-something we’ve had, we haven’t had anybody super sick. I know some places have,” said Steven Kernie, a pediatrician at New York’s Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital.

Fox News has obtained a video of McAuliffe 's Norfolk comments , which came after Biden has made a series of gaffes in his already-limited public appearances as he social distanced from home -- including by declaring that African-Americans who support President Trump `` ain ’ t black . ''
`` People say all the time , 'Oh , we got to get the vice president out of the basement , ' '' McAuliffe told the `` monthly breakfast '' of the Norfolk City Democratic Committee . `` He 's fine in the basement . Two people see him a day : his two body people . That 's it . Let Trump keep doing what Trump 's doing . ''
McAuliffe served as campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton 's 2016 presidential run . At the Zoom videoconference , he was introduced by a senior Norfolk Democrat , Charlie Stanton , who compared soldiers who participated in the D-Day landing to modern-day Antifa members .
`` It 's hard for the vice president to break through , '' McAuliffe told the group . `` You 've got the COVID crisis . He 's not a governor , does n't have the National Guard . He 's not the president , does n't have the briefing room . He needs to come out strategically . And when he says something like he did on race relations two days ago , it needs to have a big impact -- thoughtful , and that 's what we 're preferring that he actually do at the time . ''
`` He 's doing a lot of local , '' McAuliffe added . `` He 's talking to two , three governors a day . He 's doing roundtables , Zoom calls . A lot of it 's being done in those six battleground states that we have going forward . ''
Trump has hammered Biden repeatedly for remaining in his basement and has openly questioned whether Biden remains mentally competent . “ I ’ d love to see him get out of the basement so he can speak , ” Trump said in a telephone interview with Fox News last month .
Nevertheless , recent polls have shown Biden leading Trump , who is set to resume his trademark campaign rallies in the coming days . Biden himself has begun to travel again , including meeting privately in Texas on Monday with the family of George Floyd , whose death two weeks ago while in police custody has sparked nationwide protests .
In his comments , McAuliffe also assured the Democrats the 2020 election would be different than 2016 's , when nominee Hillary Clinton was hampered over the FBI 's investigation of her emails : `` We 're not gon na have crazy Jim Comey coming out 12 days before the election with that ridiculous thing he did . ''
But , McAuliffe conceded , `` We 're building the digital today , which Trump has a huge lead on , he 's got like 88 million Twitter followers , so that 's a big emphasis for us . '' McAuliffe also said during the video it 's `` likely '' he 'll run again for governor of Virginia in 2021 .
Although Biden has been in his basement , his campaign has found ways to broadcast his message nationally . With an eye towards attracting younger votes , Biden 's team has been putting portions of the presumptive Democratic nominee ’ s speech last week on the death of Floyd and the bigger issue of racial injustice into a new digital ad that it will run in key general election battleground states .
“ The history of this nation teaches us that in some of our darkest moments of despair , we ’ ve made some of our greatest progress , ” the former vice president says in the spot . “ The 13th , 14th , and 15th amendments followed the Civil War , the greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression , the Civil Rights Act of 1954 and the Voting Rights Act of ’ 65 came in the track of Bull Conner ’ s vicious dogs . ”
Biden , however , has found himself in something of an awkward position , as left-wing activists push proposals -- including defunding all police -- that are nationally unpopular . The Fairfax , Virginia Democratic Party claimed last week that a `` volunteer '' was responsible for posting a message to the party 's official Twitter account praising riots as an `` integral part of this country 's march towards progress , '' even as Biden and other top Democrats have sought to present more palatable solutions .
The tweet , which the Democrats deleted on Monday morning amid intense scrutiny , came after a night of chaos across America that injured dozens of federal officers and saw civilians beaten , churches torched , and stores looted .
The post read : `` RT @ bharatkrishnan9 : When President Obama included the Stonewall Riots in his 2nd inaugural , he did n't make that decision lightly . Riots are an integral part of this country 's march towards progress . '' ( The letters `` RT '' are short for `` retweet '' ; the Democrats were indicating that they were manually reposting a tweet from Bharat Krishnan , who self-identifies as an `` author of political fantasy , '' rather than using Twitter 's built-in reposting functionality . )
In a statement to Fox News , the Fairfax Democrats ' party chairman , Bryan Graham , walked back the post .
`` We support the right of peaceful protest and condemn violence , '' Graham said. `` A volunteer retweeted a message on May 30 without the review of our organization ’ s leadership . When it was brought to our attention , the message was removed to reinforce that it is not a position of our Committee . We are revising our social media policies . Black lives matter . ''

NPR 's Tim Mak points out how the number of testing sites remains small compared to the actual number of stores each retail pharmacy has .
Trump addresses Azar 's early handling of the virus : President Trump indirectly acknowledged that Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar 's initial downplaying of the coronavirus in late January was a mistake . `` You have many people in the other party that have said the same thing and with even more confidence , '' the president said — `` so a lot of people did n't get that right .

The Washington Post also reported on Monday that warnings about COVID-19 were regularly included in Trump 's top secret security briefings .
There 's a rise in Americans consuming disinfectant . Trump : `` I ca n't imagine why '' : After suggesting last week that injecting disinfectant products could help treat COVID-19 and then walking the comments back as `` sarcasm , '' a day later Trump rejected reports that Americans were taking his words seriously . Since Trump 's statements , there have been reports of increased calls regarding wrongful ingestion of such products . When asked if he would take any responsibility for the events , the president said , `` I ca n't imagine that . ''
Economic tailspin : Trump acknowledged estimates on Monday that the U.S. gross domestic product could take a hit in the second quarter unlike any seen since the Great Depression . But the president sought to emphasize what he has called the pent-up demand to revive the economy later this year . Just under 30 million Americans are out of work , and the virus mitigation countermeasures , including social distancing , have pummeled restaurants , brick-and-mortar retailers , travel , energy and much of the rest of the economy .
Grading their own tests : Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said Friday that antibody tests unauthorized by the FDA can be distributed if the manufacturer self-validates them . `` They have to tell us that they validated their tests , '' Hahn said , adding that the tests are labeled as unauthorized in the packaging . As of Friday , the FDA has authorized four tests — but Hahn 's remarks followed reports that problematic tests currently unapproved by the FDA are already being sold .","Testing Could Unlock A Return To Normal Life, But Obstacles Persist

Representatives from Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, Walmart and Kroger also spoke of expanding testing locations to more states, as well as the number of tests at their stores across the country. NPR's Tim Mak points out how the number of testing sites remains small compared to the actual number of stores each retail pharmacy has.

Trump addresses Azar's early handling of the virus: President Trump indirectly acknowledged that Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar's initial downplaying of the coronavirus in late January was a mistake. ""You have many people in the other party that have said the same thing and with even more confidence,"" the president said — ""so a lot of people didn't get that right."" The exchange follows reports about how Azar's initial response to the coronavirus was problematic, including his choice to delay informing Trump about its severity early on. The Washington Post also reported on Monday that warnings about COVID-19 were regularly included in Trump's top secret security briefings.

There's a rise in Americans consuming disinfectant. Trump: ""I can't imagine why"": After suggesting last week that injecting disinfectant products could help treat COVID-19 and then walking the comments back as ""sarcasm,"" a day later Trump rejected reports that Americans were taking his words seriously. Since Trump's statements, there have been reports of increased calls regarding wrongful ingestion of such products. When asked if he would take any responsibility for the events, the president said, ""I can't imagine that.""

Economic tailspin: Trump acknowledged estimates on Monday that the U.S. gross domestic product could take a hit in the second quarter unlike any seen since the Great Depression. But the president sought to emphasize what he has called the pent-up demand to revive the economy later this year. Just under 30 million Americans are out of work, and the virus mitigation countermeasures, including social distancing, have pummeled restaurants, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel, energy and much of the rest of the economy.

Grading their own tests: Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said Friday that antibody tests unauthorized by the FDA can be distributed if the manufacturer self-validates them. ""They have to tell us that they validated their tests,"" Hahn said, adding that the tests are labeled as unauthorized in the packaging. As of Friday, the FDA has authorized four tests — but Hahn's remarks followed reports that problematic tests currently unapproved by the FDA are already being sold.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Americans ’ support for mail-in voting has jumped amid concerns about the safety of polling places during the coronavirus pandemic , but a wide partisan divide suggests President Donald Trump ’ s public campaign against vote by mail may be resonating with his Republican backers .
A new poll from The ███-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds Democrats are now much more likely than Republicans to support their state conducting elections exclusively by mail , 47 % to 29 % .
In 2018 , about half as many Democrats were in favor , and there was little difference in the views of Democrats and Republicans on the question .
The survey also found a partisan divide on support for no-excuse absentee voting , the system in place in most states , including almost all the top presidential battlegrounds , even as a majority of Americans say they favor that practice .
The increased partisanship in the debate over how America votes comes just as that question has been thrust into the forefront of American politics . As health officials warn about the risk of spreading the coronavirus at polling places , some in the Republican Party have tried to limit the expansion of mail voting , with Trump and others openly fretting that it may enable too many people to cast their ballots for the GOP to win in November .
All states conduct elections differently , and only five states automatically mail ballots to every voter . But in response to the virus , some states — including Ohio on Tuesday — have shifted their primaries to virtually all-mail elections . On Monday , New York Democrats canceled their presidential primary , which had already been delayed until June 23 .
The Republican National Committee has been fighting some of those moves . Republicans successfully petitioned a New Mexico court to block the state from holding its June primary exclusively by mail , forcing the state to open some polling places and only send applications for absentee ballots to voters .
The Republican Attorney General in Texas argued unsuccessfully in a legal case that the coronavirus should not be an automatically accepted excuse for people seeking absentee ballots in that state .
Most prominently , the Republican-controlled Wisconsin legislature rebuffed a last-minute request to hold that state ’ s April 7 primary and state court election by mail . Democrats won a contested Supreme Court race , but not before shuttered polling locations left voters in long lines at polling places in Green Bay and Milwaukee , where only five of 183 stations were open .
But the debates over the primaries may only be a preview of the partisan battles ahead if the virus is still forcing stay-at-home orders and social distancing in November .
The poll finds that 39 % of Americans favor conducting all-mail elections , up from 19 % in 2018 . Another 40 % are opposed . But even more , 48 % , favor a move to voting only by mail if the coronavirus outbreak is ongoing in November .
The poll also shows 60 % of Americans support allowing people to vote via absentee ballot without requiring them to give a reason if the outbreak is still happening . That includes 73 % percent of Democrats and 46 % of Republicans . Some 40 % of Republicans are opposed .
The partisan differences could have a strong impact across the presidential battleground states . Five of the top seven swing states — Michigan , New Hampshire , North Carolina , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — have divided government , and skirmishes over voting have already broken out in several . In some , there are signs that Democratic areas are moving faster than GOP ones to embrace mail voting .
In Wisconsin , Democrats have already started to bolster their mail voting operations for November . Reliably Democratic Milwaukee , the state ’ s largest city , will send every one of its 300,000 voters a request for an absentee ballot . Republicans , who have resisted a similar step statewide , acknowledge that Milwaukee ’ s move would put them at a disadvantage . “ It makes winning Wisconsin harder , ” said Andrew Hitt , chair of the state Republican Party , calling for intervention to “ level the playing field . ”
In Pennsylvania , Democratically-led areas are eager to expand absentee voting , but Republicans seem less so . The second-most populous county in the state , the Democratic bastion of Allegheny , which includes Pittsburgh , is sending absentee ballot requests to all its voters in its June primary .
The poll found roughly two-thirds of Republicans worried that voter fraud would be a major problem with all-mail voting . Two months ago , about as many described voter fraud as a major problem in U.S. elections in general . Widespread voter fraud in mail-in voting is uncommon .
Brynn Alexander , 36 , who just moved with her husband to military housing in Alabama , is one of those who worries about security .
“ How do you even identify that the mail got to the right person ? ” Alexander asked . She added that she favored exceptions for some , like her 70-year-old mother , but preferred votes at the polls .
“ It ’ s going to be better to make everybody feel confident with the results , ” she said of in-person voting in the presidential election . “ You don ’ t want one party or the other saying the other side cheated . ”
Meanwhile , only 29 % of Democrats were worried about fraud being a major problem in an all-mail election , though another 41 % described it as a minor problem . Rick Reinesch , a 59-year-old IT technician in Austin , Texas , said Republicans needlessly pump up worries about voter fraud . “ It ’ s trying to kill a gnat with a sledgehammer , ” he said .
Paul Miller , 81 , of Carlisle , Pennsylvania , is wary of voting by mail . He ’ s accustomed to going to the polls on Election Day . “ I ’ m just not sold on mail-in voting , ” the Republican and retired factory worker said .
But Miller may bow to the reality that he shouldn ’ t be face-to-face with poll workers anytime soon and cast his vote by absentee .
“ I ’ m not dead set against mail , ” Miller said . “ I could be persuaded . ”
The AP-NORC poll of 1,057 adults was conducted April 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC ’ s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel , which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population . The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4 percentage points .","FILE - In this March 17, 2020, file photo a poll worker at the Su Nueva Lavanderia polling place uses rubber gloves as she enters a ballot in the ballot box in Chicago.

Republicans successfully petitioned a New Mexico court to block the state from holding its June primary exclusively by mail, forcing the state to open some polling places and only send applications for absentee ballots to voters.

The Republican Attorney General in Texas argued unsuccessfully in a legal case that the coronavirus should not be an automatically accepted excuse for people seeking absentee ballots in that state.

Most prominently, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin legislature rebuffed a last-minute request to hold that state’s April 7 primary and state court election by mail. Democrats won a contested Supreme Court race , but not before shuttered polling locations left voters in long lines at polling places in Green Bay and Milwaukee, where only five of 183 stations were open.

But the debates over the primaries may only be a preview of the partisan battles ahead if the virus is still forcing stay-at-home orders and social distancing in November.

Full Coverage: Election 2020

The poll finds that 39% of Americans favor conducting all-mail elections, up from 19% in 2018. Another 40% are opposed. But even more, 48%, favor a move to voting only by mail if the coronavirus outbreak is ongoing in November.

The poll also shows 60% of Americans support allowing people to vote via absentee ballot without requiring them to give a reason if the outbreak is still happening. That includes 73% percent of Democrats and 46% of Republicans. Some 40% of Republicans are opposed.

The partisan differences could have a strong impact across the presidential battleground states. Five of the top seven swing states — Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — have divided government, and skirmishes over voting have already broken out in several. In some, there are signs that Democratic areas are moving faster than GOP ones to embrace mail voting .

In Wisconsin, Democrats have already started to bolster their mail voting operations for November. Reliably Democratic Milwaukee, the state’s largest city, will send every one of its 300,000 voters a request for an absentee ballot. Republicans, who have resisted a similar step statewide, acknowledge that Milwaukee’s move would put them at a disadvantage. “It makes winning Wisconsin harder,” said Andrew Hitt, chair of the state Republican Party, calling for intervention to “level the playing field.”

In Pennsylvania, Democratically-led areas are eager to expand absentee voting, but Republicans seem less so. The second-most populous county in the state, the Democratic bastion of Allegheny, which includes Pittsburgh, is sending absentee ballot requests to all its voters in its June primary.

The poll found roughly two-thirds of Republicans worried that voter fraud would be a major problem with all-mail voting. Two months ago, about as many described voter fraud as a major problem in U.S. elections in general. Widespread voter fraud in mail-in voting is uncommon.

Brynn Alexander, 36, who just moved with her husband to military housing in Alabama, is one of those who worries about security.

“How do you even identify that the mail got to the right person?” Alexander asked. She added that she favored exceptions for some, like her 70-year-old mother, but preferred votes at the polls.

“It’s going to be better to make everybody feel confident with the results,” she said of in-person voting in the presidential election. “You don’t want one party or the other saying the other side cheated.”

Meanwhile, only 29% of Democrats were worried about fraud being a major problem in an all-mail election, though another 41% described it as a minor problem. Rick Reinesch, a 59-year-old IT technician in Austin, Texas, said Republicans needlessly pump up worries about voter fraud. “It’s trying to kill a gnat with a sledgehammer,” he said.

Paul Miller, 81, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, is wary of voting by mail. He’s accustomed to going to the polls on Election Day. “I’m just not sold on mail-in voting,” the Republican and retired factory worker said.

But Miller may bow to the reality that he shouldn’t be face-to-face with poll workers anytime soon and cast his vote by absentee.

“I’m not dead set against mail,” Miller said. “I could be persuaded.”

coronavirus,Scientific American,1,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heres-what-we-know-about-the-most-touted-drugs-tested-for-covid-191/,Here’s What We Know about the Most Touted Drugs Tested for COVID-19,,"Tanya Lewis, Nick Higgins","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to claim lives around the world , there are no specific treatments for the disease beyond supportive care . Several drugs already prescribed for other illnesses have shown promise against the novel coronavirus in preclinical studies . And they are now being tested in clinical trials or given to patients on a compassionate-use basis . But experts warn that these medications have yet to prove effective in treating COVID-19 patients .
As of this writing , the virus has infected more than two million people worldwide and caused more than 130,000 deaths . A vaccine and new treatments could take years to fully develop , but the World Health Organization recently launched a large international trial called Solidarity to test four existing therapies . They are the closely related malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ; the antiviral medication remdesivir ( originally developed to treat Ebola ) ; the antiviral combination of lopinavir and ritonavir ( used for HIV ) ; and those two HIV drugs plus the anti-inflammatory small protein interferon beta . A number of separate clinical trials of these medications and others are underway in several countries , including the U.S .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved remdesivir for treating COVID-19 patients under the compassionate-use protocol ( a designation that gives patients with life-threatening illnesses access to an experimental drug ) . And the agency has granted an emergency use authorization—which allows for otherwise unapproved drugs or uses during an emergency—for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine .
“ None of these therapies are proven , ” says Stanley Perlman , a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa . Only the results of randomized clinical trials can show whether they work , he adds .
Here is what scientists know so far about some of the most prominent drugs currently being tested as treatments for the potentially deadly infection .
President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted the malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19—despite a lack of clinical evidence that they work for the disease . The president ’ s comments set off a scramble among doctors and patients to obtain the drugs—which are frequently used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus—and there is now a shortage of them in the U.S. Also , these substances can be dangerous in healthy people : a man in Arizona died after ingesting a fish-tank cleaner containing a type of chloroquine that is not approved for human use . On March 28 the FDA issued an emergency authorization for administering chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients—but many experts say the widespread usage of these drugs is premature .
“ The clinical support is very , very minimal , ” says Maryam Keshtkar-Jahromi , an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , who co-authored an article in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene calling for more randomized controlled trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine . The drugs do “ not show strong evidence at this point , ” she adds .
A few preclinical studies have suggested these compounds could be effective at blocking infection with the novel coronavirus ( officially called SARS-CoV-2 ) , but there has been very little good evidence from clinical trials in patients with the illness it causes , COVID-19 . A controversial small , nonrandomized trial of hydroxychloroquine combined with the antibiotic azithromycin in France suggested that COVID-19 patients given the treatment had less virus , compared with those who refused the drugs or those at another hospital who did not receive them . But experts have questioned the study ’ s validity , and the society that publishes the journal in which it appeared has issued a statement of concern about the results , according to Retraction Watch . ( ███ reached out to the paper ’ s authors for comment but did not hear back from them . ) A preprint study in China also claimed to show that hydroxychloroquine benefitted COVID-19 patients , but it had significant methodology problems , Keshtkar-Jahromi says . The issues included confounding variables , such as the fact that all of the subjects received other antiviral and antibacterial treatments .
Some scientists say the preclinical evidence is strong enough to support chloroquine ’ s use , however . “ We know how it acts at the cellular level against the virus . We have preclinical proof , ” says Andrea Cortegiani , an intensivist and researcher in the departments of anesthesia and intensive care and of surgical , oncological and oral sciences at the University of Palermo in Italy . “ Second , it ’ s a cheap drug , available all over world , ” adds Cortegiani , who is also a clinician at University Hospital “ Paolo Giaccone ” in Italy .
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been hypothesized to work against COVID-19 by changing the pH required for SARS-CoV-2 to replicate . Given their use in autoimmune disorders , these medications could also play a role in dampening the immune response to the virus—which can be deadly in some patients .
But these drugs ’ cardiac toxicity is a concern , Keshtkar-Jahromi says . There have been some reports of myocarditis , or inflamed heart tissue , in people with COVID-19 who have not taken chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine . If patients receiving one of these medications die of heart complications—and are not in a clinical trial—doctors can not know if the drug contributed to higher chance of death . *
A drug that modulates the immune response could also make someone more vulnerable to other viral or bacterial infections . “ It ’ s a double-edged sword , ” says Sina Bavari , chief science officer and founder of Edge BioInnovation Consulting in Frederick , Md. , who co-authored Keshtkar-Jahromi ’ s article in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine . Giving a drug to suppress the immune system has to be done with extreme care .
“ We are not saying , ‘ Don ’ t [ prescribe chloroquine ] , ’ ” Bavari says . “ We are saying , ‘ More data is needed to better understand how the drug works—if it works . ’ ”
This experimental antiviral drug was developed to treat Ebola , and it has been shown to be safe for use in humans . It is a broad-spectrum antiviral that blocks replication in several other coronaviruses , according to studies in mice and in cells grown in a lab . In addition to the WHO investigation , at least two trials in China and one in the U.S. are currently evaluating remdesivir in COVID-19 patients . Results for the Chinese trials are expected later this month .
“ As of this moment , we don ’ t have data for remdesivir in human COVID-19 disease , ” says Barry Zingman , a professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and clinical director of infectious diseases at Montefiore Health System ’ s Moses Campus . The two related institutions , both located in New York City , recently joined a nationwide clinical trial of the drug . “ Our patients are randomized , so we don ’ t know who ’ s getting the drug or a placebo . [ But ] we have seen some patients do remarkably well , ” Zingman says . Trial results are on track for publication sometime in the next six to eight weeks , he adds .
As ███ reported previously , remdesivir works by inhibiting an enzyme called an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase , which many RNA viruses—including SARS-CoV-2—use to replicate their genetic material . Timothy Sheahan of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and his colleagues have shown the drug is effective against the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) , respectively , as well as some of the viruses behind the common cold . The team is currently in the process of testing the drug ’ s efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 . A recent study of compassionate use of remdesivir in 53 severe COVID-19 patients found that 63 percent of those taking the drug improved , but it was not a randomized controlled trial .
“ Remdesivir has some chance , ” Perlman says . “ If we can give [ the drug ] early in the disease course , it could work. ” To know for sure , scientists must await the results of the ongoing clinical trials .
One limitation with remdesivir is that it must be given intravenously , so patients can only get it in a hospital . Sheahan and his colleagues at Emory University have recently developed a related drug called EIDD-2801 , which can be taken in pill form . Like remdesivir , the medication works as a nucleoside analogue , interfering with viral replication . It was effective at preventing SARS-Cov-2-infected lung cells from replicating in a lab dish and related viruses from doing so in mice .
The HIV drugs ritonavir and lopinavir ( sold as a combination therapy by AbbVie under the brand name Kaletra ) have been tested against COVID-19 in a few clinical trials . The initial data have not shown them to be effective , however . A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found they conferred no benefit beyond standard care .
The drug combination is what is known as a protease inhibitor , and it works by blocking an enzyme involved in viral replication . But its action is specific to HIV and so is unlikely to work for SARS-CoV-2 , Perlman says . “ If you have the key to a car , and you try to put it in your car , the odds of it working are one in a million , ” he says . “ Kaletra [ targets ] a completely different lock ” than the one for COVID-19 .
Nevertheless , the WHO trial includes a group of COVID-19 patients who will receive these drugs on their own—and another group that will receive them in combination with interferon beta , a small cell-signaling molecule used to treat multiple sclerosis . The molecule is a “ massive orchestrator of immune response , ” Perlman notes , so it must be used carefully . In mouse studies of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses , it halted the infections when administered early . When it was given later , he says , the mice died . Using a drug that activates the immune system could be helpful in the beginning of an infection , but giving it too late could be deadly .
Researchers are also considering a number of other therapies that tamp down the rampant immune response seen in severe COVID-19 cases . Such a flood of immune cells in the lungs—known as a cytokine storm—can lead to death . Many of the sickest patients have elevated levels of an inflammatory protein called interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . Research in China has suggested that Actemra ( tocilizumab ) , an IL-6-blocking antibody drug made by Roche , shows promise against COVID-19 . And Chinese authorities have recommended the drug in their treatment guidelines . Roche has since initiated a phase III randomized controlled clinical trial for the medication . In the U.S. , Michelle Gong—chief of the division of critical care at Montefiore and Albert Einstein and director of critical care research at Montefiore—and her colleagues are among dozens of groups conducting a double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial of a related drug called sarilumab , which is already approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis . Sarilumab will only be given to the sickest individuals : to be part of the trial , patients must be hospitalized with COVID-19 and in severe or critical condition .
Another treatment approach involves injecting COVID-19 patients with blood plasma from people who have recovered from the illness . The FDA recently issued guidance on the investigational use of such “ convalescent plasma , ” which contains antibodies to the coronavirus , and clinical trials are underway .
Blood from disease survivors has been used as a treatment throughout history—from polio-infected horses in the 1930s to former Ebola patients in 2014 . “ There is a long-lasting rationale for the use of convalescent plasma against any infectious disease , ” Cortegiani says . One problem , however , is that scientists do not know whether people develop strong immunity against SARS-CoV-2 . And it is not easy to collect plasma containing enough antibodies , he adds . Another issue is the shortage of eligible donors . Some companies are looking into ways to produce these antibodies artificially . In the meantime , a number of hospitals are searching for volunteers to donate plasma .
None of the therapies described above have yet been proved to treat COVID-19 . But some answers can be expected in the next few weeks and months as the results of clinical trials emerge . Until then , Cortegiani says , “ we can not say , ‘ This drug is more promising than the other one. ’ We can only say , ‘ There is a rationale for it . ’ ”

Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine

Remdesivir

This experimental antiviral drug was developed to treat Ebola, and it has been shown to be safe for use in humans. It is a broad-spectrum antiviral that blocks replication in several other coronaviruses, according to studies in mice and in cells grown in a lab. In addition to the WHO investigation, at least two trials in China and one in the U.S. are currently evaluating remdesivir in COVID-19 patients.

coronavirus,Daily Chela,0,https://www.dailychela.com/covid-19-disinformation-must-be-combated/,COVID-19 Disinformation Must Be Combated,2020-06-25,Roberto Camacho,"Disinformation poses a unique threat to our stability and society in the age of COVID-19 .
As the coronavirus continues to scorch its way across the U.S. and nations throughout the world , the coronavirus pandemic is swiftly becoming one of the defining global missteps and challenges of the early 21st century .
As governments across the world continue to lock down cities and implement social distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus ; in hopes of buying medical personnel precious time in an effort to try and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed , the world in many ways has come to a halt as the virus continues its spread .
However , in the midst of the pandemic as the coronavirus advances across the globe , another outbreak has been quietly festering . Not a virological one , but one that involves disinformation and misinformation regarding the coronavirus itself .
Help support Latino Media . Subscribe for only $ 1.00 your first month .
Since gaining a foothold outside of China , misinformation regarding the coronavirus has exploded online amid the outbreak . In the wake of stay-at-home orders , non-essential business closures , economic turmoil and a botched federal response , people have turned to the internet in search of clarity and reassurance on things such as preventive measures , self-diagnoses , and information regarding the nature of the virus .
Amidst a sea of confusion , the planet is caught in what is possibly the deadliest information crisis that the world has ever faced .
While the world has weathered outbreaks , epidemics and even global pandemics before in the past , never before has the world faced one in the midst of a technologically advanced landscape like the one that we have today .
If you ’ ve spent even a little bit of time on the internet , chances are you ’ ve probably come across numerous examples of disinformation regarding the coronavirus . In fact , it ’ s one of the few things that might spread just as fast as the virus itself .
Some examples include claims that eating garlic or taking sips of water can prevent infection . Others however are more nefarious , with outrageous claims that the virus is actually caused by 5G Wi-Fi , that it originated in a laboratory as a bioweapon or that social distancing measures are being used to condition the public for martial law .
Of course , none of this is true . Despite what you might have heard on social media downplaying the pandemic ’ s severity , the coronavirus is very real . It ’ s not a figment of the public ’ s imagination . It ’ s not just another strain of the flu or the common cold . It ’ s not an escaped bioweapon , it ’ s not a hoax , and it ’ s not a ruse to institute any sort of social conditioning .
Statewide public safety and social distancing measures aren ’ t part of some covert plot to curtail civil liberties . What we are facing is a brand-new , dangerous virus that the world has never seen before , one that we know relatively little about and has quickly spread throughout the world . Thousands of people have died , millions are now jobless , and in the absence of clear facts , data and strong leadership from the federal government , misinformation and disinformation has quickly filled the void .
Misinformation , disinformation , and even conspiracy theories , of course , are nothing new . However , in an increasingly interconnected world , disinformation is increasingly being given a global audience with just a few clicks on a keyboard .
In the wake of the coronavirus ’ spread in the U.S. and the federal government ’ s mismanagement of the crisis , a wave of misinformation , disinformation , and conspiracy theories have spread like wildfire online as panicked and fear-stricken people search for answers and clarity in a digital landscape rife with disinformation .
Help support Latino Media . Subscribe for only $ 1.00 your first month .
Often times with the help of social media platforms passed along through viral tweets , Facebook posts , Instagram videos , and across other platforms like a perverse game of telephone , disinformation can spread to hundreds of thousands or even millions in just a matter of hours .
In the past , misinformation and even disinformation has seldom been viewed as threat to the general public . However , disinformation in today ’ s climate can have the real potential to reap serious and even dangerous consequences . Especially that which leaves the realm of the internet and comes from places of authority such as the white house .
Since declaring the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency nearly a month ago , Donald Trump has repeatedly lied and misled the public about the coronavirus and the threat that it poses to public safety .
Some of Trump ’ s lies include statements such as claims that the virus would dissipate as warmer weather approaches , despite the fact that health experts have warned that it ’ s far too early to tell if the virus ’ spread will slow in warmer conditions . Others claims include that pharmaceutical companies would be producing vaccines , despite the fact that Trump ’ s own experts have said a vaccine could take anywhere from a year to 18 months to produce .
They also include the claim that the FDA had approved the antimalarial drug chloroquine to treat COVID-19 , despite the fact that as of now there are still no proven safe and effective therapies for the coronavirus .
This of course , is just a very small cross-section of the lies Donald Trump has told over the course the outbreak . Trump ’ s remarks and comments are not only disingenuous , they continue to be a dangerous hindrance to getting accurate information out to inform and protect the public . Imperiling countless lives of with every passing day .
Where the real harm lies is the fact that whether concocted online or coming from the white house ; disinformation at a critical time like this ultimately muddies and obscures public discussions regarding public safety . Disinformation doesn ’ t just misinform or push an agenda , it effectively over time exhausts the public ’ s critical thinking on a mass level .

As the coronavirus continues to scorch its way across the U.S. and nations throughout the world, the coronavirus pandemic is swiftly becoming one of the defining global missteps and challenges of the early 21st century.

As governments across the world continue to lock down cities and implement social distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus; in hopes of buying medical personnel precious time in an effort to try and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, the world in many ways has come to a halt as the virus continues its spread.

However, in the midst of the pandemic as the coronavirus advances across the globe, another outbreak has been quietly festering. Not a virological one, but one that involves disinformation and misinformation regarding the coronavirus itself.

Since gaining a foothold outside of China, misinformation regarding the coronavirus has exploded online amid the outbreak. In the wake of stay-at-home orders, non-essential business closures, economic turmoil and a botched federal response, people have turned to the internet in search of clarity and reassurance on things such as preventive measures, self-diagnoses, and information regarding the nature of the virus.

Amidst a sea of confusion, the planet is caught in what is possibly the deadliest information crisis that the world has ever faced.

While the world has weathered outbreaks, epidemics and even global pandemics before in the past, never before has the world faced one in the midst of a technologically advanced landscape like the one that we have today.

If you’ve spent even a little bit of time on the internet, chances are you’ve probably come across numerous examples of disinformation regarding the coronavirus. In fact, it’s one of the few things that might spread just as fast as the virus itself.

Some examples include claims that eating garlic or taking sips of water can prevent infection. Others however are more nefarious, with outrageous claims that the virus is actually caused by 5G Wi-Fi, that it originated in a laboratory as a bioweapon or that social distancing measures are being used to condition the public for martial law.

Of course, none of this is true. Despite what you might have heard on social media downplaying the pandemic’s severity, the coronavirus is very real. It’s not a figment of the public’s imagination. It’s not just another strain of the flu or the common cold. It’s not an escaped bioweapon, it’s not a hoax, and it’s not a ruse to institute any sort of social conditioning.

Statewide public safety and social distancing measures aren’t part of some covert plot to curtail civil liberties. What we are facing is a brand-new, dangerous virus that the world has never seen before, one that we know relatively little about and has quickly spread throughout the world. Thousands of people have died, millions are now jobless, and in the absence of clear facts, data and strong leadership from the federal government, misinformation and disinformation has quickly filled the void.

Misinformation, disinformation, and even conspiracy theories, of course, are nothing new. However, in an increasingly interconnected world, disinformation is increasingly being given a global audience with just a few clicks on a keyboard.

In the wake of the coronavirus’ spread in the U.S. and the federal government’s mismanagement of the crisis, a wave of misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories have spread like wildfire online as panicked and fear-stricken people search for answers and clarity in a digital landscape rife with disinformation.

Often times with the help of social media platforms passed along through viral tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram videos, and across other platforms like a perverse game of telephone, disinformation can spread to hundreds of thousands or even millions in just a matter of hours.

In the past, misinformation and even disinformation has seldom been viewed as threat to the general public. However, disinformation in today’s climate can have the real potential to reap serious and even dangerous consequences. Especially that which leaves the realm of the internet and comes from places of authority such as the white house.

Since declaring the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency nearly a month ago, Donald Trump has repeatedly lied and misled the public about the coronavirus and the threat that it poses to public safety.

Some of Trump’s lies include statements such as claims that the virus would dissipate as warmer weather approaches, despite the fact that health experts have warned that it’s far too early to tell if the virus’ spread will slow in warmer conditions. Others claims include that pharmaceutical companies would be producing vaccines, despite the fact that Trump’s own experts have said a vaccine could take anywhere from a year to 18 months to produce.

They also include the claim that the FDA had approved the antimalarial drug chloroquine to treat COVID-19, despite the fact that as of now there are still no proven safe and effective therapies for the coronavirus.

This of course, is just a very small cross-section of the lies Donald Trump has told over the course the outbreak. Trump’s remarks and comments are not only disingenuous, they continue to be a dangerous hindrance to getting accurate information out to inform and protect the public. Imperiling countless lives of with every passing day.

Where the real harm lies is the fact that whether concocted online or coming from the white house; disinformation at a critical time like this ultimately muddies and obscures public discussions regarding public safety. Disinformation doesn’t just misinform or push an agenda, it effectively over time exhausts the public’s critical thinking on a mass level.

Disinformation not only obliterates truth, it destroys any sense of belief or confidence in the very concept of objective truth. Sowing seeds of uncertainty, ensuring that even when the truth is reported, it is swallowed up in a sea of half-truths and lies that feeds into a perpetual cycle of confusion and disillusionment.

Misinformation does more than just merely misinform, it destroys the institution of public consensus. And at a time when waiting days and even hours can make a difference, we desperately need public consensus regarding the facts and inherent dangers of the coronavirus.

There is a vast difference between cautious skepticism of developing stories and blindly parroting falsehoods megaphoned from the white house and factually bankrupt theories peddled online.

By in large most disinformation is scant in actual facts, evidence and seldom holds up under the pressure of principled, critical analysis. We cannot afford to perpetuate fallacies and lies that only contribute to furthering public confusion and ignorance regarding the coronavirus.

Disinformation does nothing to help public health and safety. If anything, it only creates more doubt and panic, squandering precious time and resources that could be better spent educating the public on the facts and ways they can protect themselves.

In a time where every day and hour counts, and lives literally hang in the balance, ultimately it starts with us holding ourselves responsible in not abetting the proliferation of disinformation that ultimately will only hinder public health efforts, whether that comes from the web or the president himself.

Here’s how CNN framed the situation:

coronavirus,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2020/0406/The-doctor-won-t-see-you-now.-Rethinking-health-care-delivery-in-a-crisis,‘The doctor won’t see you now.’ Rethinking health care delivery in a crisis.,2020-04-06,Lenora Chu,"“ If there is one positive aspect , this crisis is proving that reforming healthcare doesn ’ t necessarily take decades . It ’ s just a matter of will , ” says Nicola Draoli , an Italian nurse .
Hospitals and clinics are also ramping up telemedicine , out of necessity , amid a pandemic that requires social distancing and has put huge strain on health care resources . This pivot has drawn attention to telemedicine as a longer-term solution that could help overcome , at least in some aspects of medicine , the shortfalls in medical staff in rich aging societies like Italy and Germany .
Long before COVID-19 hit the headlines , health care systems across Europe and the U.S. had been struggling to plug recruitment gaps , particularly in their nursing ranks . Now that shortfall has become a crisis , leading to a call-up of recent retirees and new graduates to support front-line staff treating patients .
Veteran Seattle nurse Carolyn Grant had just finished kicking off her retirement with a trip to Hawaii when she got a text from her old boss : Would Ms. Grant come out of retirement to help the medical center ’ s COVID-19 testing program ? That night , she said yes .
In Germany , where “ not a single hospital has enough staff , ” says a Berlin ICU nurse , the government is calling medical students to action , and dissolving bureaucratic hurdles so hospitals can mobilize more medical workers .
In Italy , which has seen the world ’ s highest coronavirus death toll , the government has asked recently retired doctors to come back to work , and allocated funding to hire 20,000 more health professionals .
Chronic worker shortages can be patchworked during normal times , but as the COVID-19 pandemic slams medical systems around the globe , having the right personnel can mean the difference between life and death . Administrators are rehiring retired professionals , tapping medical students before they even graduate , and turning to the military and volunteers to supplement a stretched workforce that even before the current crisis was coming up short .
“ It is like we have a blanket that is too short and everyone is trying to pull it to his side , ” says Nicola Draoli , an Italian nurse .
From Berlin to Seattle , hospitals and clinics are also ramping up telehealth options , which in a few weeks have been overcoming medical , bureaucratic , and consumer resistance that had stymied advocates for years . As COVID-19 brings waves of patients through hospital and clinic doors , health care systems are turning to solutions that might become increasingly attractive going forward .
“ If there is one positive aspect , this crisis is proving that reforming health care doesn ’ t necessarily take decades . It ’ s just a matter of will , ” says Mr. Draoli , a member of the central committee of Italy ’ s national federation of nursing .
In Berlin , a nurse in an intensive care unit who prefers to be called Nico because he ’ s not authorized to speak to the news media loves working with patients , and the undersupply of nurses means ironclad job stability . “ I think I could work at any hospital or any ICU in Germany , ” he says .
But the shortage has downsides : The hospital had closed a quarter of its ICU beds over the last two years due to lack of staff . Nico was constantly on call to pick up extra shifts , and also needed to clean patient rooms and tidy pharmacies due to a shortage of assistants . Over the years , Nico has seen colleagues vote with their feet . “ The workload is so heavy , ” he says .
Today , Nico ’ s hospital is prepping for the COVID-19 crisis by adding ICU beds and training non-ICU staff . Administrators are also preparing to hire medical students , who now have government-mandated flexibility for education , training , and licensing requirements .
“ We ’ re waiting for the big wave of patients , expecting it to hit in late April , ” says Nico .
Germany is currently facing a shortage of 70,000 nurses in hospitals alone , according to Verdi , a German trade union . “ We ’ ve lost 300,000 health care workers each year to retirement , ” says Stefan Sell , a professor of economics and social policy at the University of Koblenz . “ And the younger generation is very small , and young people go into other jobs . ”
The situation is no better in other developed countries . Italy is currently short about 53,000 nurses , estimates Mr. Draoli of the nursing federation . The United Kingdom ’ s National Health Service is missing about 100,000 health care workers of all kinds , and the United States needs to recruit at least 200,000 more registered nurses each year . All have aging populations that need more elder and long-term care .
The main reasons are high turnover and not enough new nursing graduates entering the workforce in wealthy countries . Sociocultural factors also come into play ; most health care workers are women , who are more likely to take part-time shifts because of child care requirements , says Dr. Sell , meaning you need more hires to provide full-time coverage .
Put simply , the job isn ’ t attractive enough , as pay for nursing and medical assistant work hasn ’ t remained competitive . In Italy , for example , health care salaries have declined from roughly 40 % of the country ’ s annual public health budget two decades ago , to less than a third today .
“ In the U.K. , we have a lot of vacancies that remain unfilled , ” says Dr. Rocco Friebel , a London School of Economics health policy professor . “ Working conditions are poor . It ’ s a very high-pressure job . ”
Staffing projections worldwide are sobering . By 2030 , countries in North , Central and South America are expected to face a combined shortage of roughly 2.5 million doctors , nurses , and other workers , with Europe ’ s shortfall at around 1.4 million , according to a 2017 study by medical researchers .
Governments in the U.S. and Europe have attempted to tackle shortages by shifting workloads , digitizing services , providing funding to create elder care positions , and looking at worker wage increases , among other initiatives .
“ In the U.K. , we ’ ve seen a push to employ clinical assistants , who can do bookkeeping and a lot of the day-to-day tasks , which then frees up fully qualified nurses to take care of the most severe cases , ” says Dr. Friebel .
But the main strategy in wealthy nations is to fill their ranks with foreign nurses and health care workers . The German government is working with Kosovo , Mexico , and the Philippines to integrate workers into its health care system . In the U.K. , the National Health Service has long tapped European Union nationals , especially those from Poland and other Eastern European countries , to fill jobs .
That ’ s only a partial solution , says Dr. Sell , the German economist , in part because of the competition . “ A lot of other countries such as the Netherlands , France , and Switzerland are also trying to get people from Russia , Ukraine , and other countries , ” he says . Also , he points out , many potential migrants don ’ t speak the adopted country ’ s language .
“ Ultimately , we have to get additional staff from our [ home ] labor force , ” says Dr. Sell . “ That will require a multidimensional strategy such as improving working conditions and education ” for workers .
A shortage that will take decades to solve feels acute in the face of a pandemic .
In the U.S. , top officials are crying out for medical volunteers of all stripes . In New York , more than 50,000 health care workers have answered Gov . Andrew Cuomo ’ s pleas . In California , a newly created health corps to expand the workforce has garnered more than 70,000 registrations from “ underemployed ” medical professionals of all stripes .
In Washington state , Gov . Jay Inslee last week told recent medical retirees and qualified students , “ Like Uncle Sam , we want you ! ”
Another infusion of medical manpower is coming from the U.S. military . Three hundred soldiers from an Army unit in Fort Carson , Colorado , arrived in Seattle last week to set up a 250-bed hospital inside the Seattle Seahawks ’ football stadium , and a Navy hospital ship has docked in New York City . By caring for patients without COVID-19 , they can free up local hospital beds for those who have the virus .
Health care workers are also being asked to shift gears , as they ’ re redeployed to other units , such as from transplant ICUs to respiratory care .
Italy ’ s worst-hit regions like Lombardy are also tapping another strategy : emphasizing primary-care monitoring and home care rather than hospital admissions . “ Hospitals have always seen too many people that don ’ t belong in the hospital , ” says Dr. Friebel , the analyst .
As Italian doctors have discovered by necessity , initial screenings of suspected COVID-19 patients can be done without a physical visit .
“ It turns out that a lot of both screening and follow-up of [ COVID-19 ] patients – the mild cases – is about asking questions about symptoms , ” says Joseph Kvedar , a Harvard Medical School professor and incoming president of the American Telemedicine Association . “ It ’ s a perfect setup for [ telehealth ] technology . ”
Advocates of telemedicine say many health care needs can , in fact , be serviced without stepping foot into an office , clinic , or hospital .
Inquiries from U.S. clinicians about telehealth have skyrocketed , Dr. Kvedar says , at the same time that states and the federal government are loosening requirements for licensing across state borders and privacy issues around technology . They ’ re also reexamining what ’ s defined as a “ visit ” for insurance purposes .
“ There ’ s been a staggering amount of creativity and collaboration , ” says Dr. Charlotte Wu , a physician and founder of Harness Health Partners , a Boston-based consultancy . “ We ’ re seeing an increased acceptance of virtual medicine , leveraging the skills of diverse team members , and collaborating across institutions – who were traditionally competitors . ”
At Asian Counseling and Referral Service in Seattle , counselors are now offering mental health care by phone and video apps such as Zoom and Doxy.me . “ We can accept consent via telephone versus in writing ” in treating substance use disorders , says Michael Byun , who runs the nonprofit .
COVID-19 is spurring innovations that might eventually pave the way for routine remote-monitoring of chronic illnesses . The possibilities are legion . Seventy percent of U.S. health care costs go to treating health conditions like high blood pressure or high cholesterol that are attributed to or worsened by smoking , lack of exercise , or poor eating habits ; they can be followed by a virtual-care quick check-in , says Dr. Kvedar .
“ We don ’ t have enough people to deliver service one-to-one in a room at a time , ” says Dr. Kvedar . “ There ’ s a lot of inefficiency in the way we deliver care . When the dust settles , I hope we don ’ t go back to doing every single thing in the office . ”
New technologies are also helping tackle staffing shortages . Germany recently called on the public to suggest COVID-19 related innovations , and among the entries was a “ digital waiting room ” that vets a patient ’ s symptoms , and an app that rotates nurses more effectively . Practitioners and researchers are also using artificial intelligence to help forecast disease spread , implement rapid-testing technologies , and develop new approaches to contact tracing .
Back in Seattle , the veteran nurse Ms. Grant has bid her short-lived retirement goodbye ; she ’ s now working 10- to 12-hour days , six days a week , managing COVID-19 testing sites . Her day begins early to ensure adequate supplies for the testers , as she leads a team of nurses at the University of Washington Medical Center – Northwest who were displaced from outpatient surgery centers and clinics .
Ms. Grant was part of a wave of nurses who entered the workforce during a severe nursing shortage in the U.S. during the 1980s . “ Many people in that age bracket are exiting the workforce , ” she says , so it ’ s no surprise they ’ re being called back to fill the gaps they ’ ve left . Ms. Grant feels a “ loyalty ” and a call to duty . “ I am able to help this community at a difficult time . ”

A structural staff shortfall

Germany is currently facing a shortage of 70,000 nurses in hospitals alone, according to Verdi, a German trade union. “We’ve lost 300,000 health care workers each year to retirement,” says Stefan Sell, a professor of economics and social policy at the University of Koblenz. “And the younger generation is very small, and young people go into other jobs.”

The situation is no better in other developed countries. Italy is currently short about 53,000 nurses, estimates Mr. Draoli of the nursing federation. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service is missing about 100,000 health care workers of all kinds, and the United States needs to recruit at least 200,000 more registered nurses each year. All have aging populations that need more elder and long-term care.

The main reasons are high turnover and not enough new nursing graduates entering the workforce in wealthy countries. Sociocultural factors also come into play; most health care workers are women, who are more likely to take part-time shifts because of child care requirements, says Dr. Sell, meaning you need more hires to provide full-time coverage.

Put simply, the job isn’t attractive enough, as pay for nursing and medical assistant work hasn’t remained competitive. In Italy, for example, health care salaries have declined from roughly 40% of the country’s annual public health budget two decades ago, to less than a third today.

“In the U.K., we have a lot of vacancies that remain unfilled,” says Dr. Rocco Friebel, a London School of Economics health policy professor. “Working conditions are poor. It’s a very high-pressure job.”

Staffing projections worldwide are sobering. By 2030, countries in North, Central and South America are expected to face a combined shortage of roughly 2.5 million doctors, nurses, and other workers, with Europe’s shortfall at around 1.4 million, according to a 2017 study by medical researchers.

Recruiting foreign nurses

Governments in the U.S. and Europe have attempted to tackle shortages by shifting workloads, digitizing services, providing funding to create elder care positions, and looking at worker wage increases, among other initiatives.

“In the U.K., we’ve seen a push to employ clinical assistants, who can do bookkeeping and a lot of the day-to-day tasks, which then frees up fully qualified nurses to take care of the most severe cases,” says Dr. Friebel.

But the main strategy in wealthy nations is to fill their ranks with foreign nurses and health care workers. The German government is working with Kosovo, Mexico, and the Philippines to integrate workers into its health care system. In the U.K., the National Health Service has long tapped European Union nationals, especially those from Poland and other Eastern European countries, to fill jobs.

That’s only a partial solution, says Dr. Sell, the German economist, in part because of the competition. “A lot of other countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Switzerland are also trying to get people from Russia, Ukraine, and other countries,” he says. Also, he points out, many potential migrants don’t speak the adopted country’s language.

“Ultimately, we have to get additional staff from our [home] labor force,” says Dr. Sell. “That will require a multidimensional strategy such as improving working conditions and education” for workers.

A turn to volunteers, telemedicine

A shortage that will take decades to solve feels acute in the face of a pandemic.

In the U.S., top officials are crying out for medical volunteers of all stripes. In New York, more than 50,000 health care workers have answered Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pleas. In California, a newly created health corps to expand the workforce has garnered more than 70,000 registrations from “underemployed” medical professionals of all stripes.

In Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee last week told recent medical retirees and qualified students, “Like Uncle Sam, we want you!”

Another infusion of medical manpower is coming from the U.S. military. Three hundred soldiers from an Army unit in Fort Carson, Colorado, arrived in Seattle last week to set up a 250-bed hospital inside the Seattle Seahawks’ football stadium, and a Navy hospital ship has docked in New York City. By caring for patients without COVID-19, they can free up local hospital beds for those who have the virus.

Health care workers are also being asked to shift gears, as they’re redeployed to other units, such as from transplant ICUs to respiratory care.

Italy’s worst-hit regions like Lombardy are also tapping another strategy: emphasizing primary-care monitoring and home care rather than hospital admissions. “Hospitals have always seen too many people that don’t belong in the hospital,” says Dr. Friebel, the analyst.

As Italian doctors have discovered by necessity, initial screenings of suspected COVID-19 patients can be done without a physical visit.

“It turns out that a lot of both screening and follow-up of [COVID-19] patients – the mild cases – is about asking questions about symptoms,” says Joseph Kvedar, a Harvard Medical School professor and incoming president of the American Telemedicine Association. “It’s a perfect setup for [telehealth] technology.”

Advocates of telemedicine say many health care needs can, in fact, be serviced without stepping foot into an office, clinic, or hospital.

Inquiries from U.S. clinicians about telehealth have skyrocketed, Dr. Kvedar says, at the same time that states and the federal government are loosening requirements for licensing across state borders and privacy issues around technology. They’re also reexamining what’s defined as a “visit” for insurance purposes.

“There’s been a staggering amount of creativity and collaboration,” says Dr. Charlotte Wu, a physician and founder of Harness Health Partners, a Boston-based consultancy. “We’re seeing an increased acceptance of virtual medicine, leveraging the skills of diverse team members, and collaborating across institutions – who were traditionally competitors.”

Virtual care, digital fixes

At Asian Counseling and Referral Service in Seattle, counselors are now offering mental health care by phone and video apps such as Zoom and Doxy.me. “We can accept consent via telephone versus in writing” in treating substance use disorders, says Michael Byun, who runs the nonprofit.

COVID-19 is spurring innovations that might eventually pave the way for routine remote-monitoring of chronic illnesses. The possibilities are legion. Seventy percent of U.S. health care costs go to treating health conditions like high blood pressure or high cholesterol that are attributed to or worsened by smoking, lack of exercise, or poor eating habits; they can be followed by a virtual-care quick check-in, says Dr. Kvedar.

“We don’t have enough people to deliver service one-to-one in a room at a time,” says Dr. Kvedar. “There’s a lot of inefficiency in the way we deliver care. When the dust settles, I hope we don’t go back to doing every single thing in the office.”

New technologies are also helping tackle staffing shortages. Germany recently called on the public to suggest COVID-19 related innovations, and among the entries was a “digital waiting room” that vets a patient’s symptoms, and an app that rotates nurses more effectively. Practitioners and researchers are also using artificial intelligence to help forecast disease spread, implement rapid-testing technologies, and develop new approaches to contact tracing.

Back in Seattle, the veteran nurse Ms. Grant has bid her short-lived retirement goodbye; she’s now working 10- to 12-hour days, six days a week, managing COVID-19 testing sites. Her day begins early to ensure adequate supplies for the testers, as she leads a team of nurses at the University of Washington Medical Center – Northwest who were displaced from outpatient surgery centers and clinics.

Ms. Grant was part of a wave of nurses who entered the workforce during a severe nursing shortage in the U.S. during the 1980s. “Many people in that age bracket are exiting the workforce,” she says, so it’s no surprise they’re being called back to fill the gaps they’ve left. Ms. Grant feels a “loyalty” and a call to duty. “I am able to help this community at a difficult time.”

The United States may soon face a dangerous shortage of health care workers to fight the sprawling Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic .
With the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US expected to soon surpass anywhere else in the world , the medical workforce is more strained than ever . Doctors and nurses are reporting gear shortages , lax protocols , and a high level of stress in their workplaces — with the worst still to come . Some of them told ███ that they consider getting infected with the coronavirus an inevitability .
Staffing problems are already becoming acute in New York City , the epicenter of the US pandemic so far with more than 20,000 cases and approaching 300 deaths , as of March 25 . City officials were not able to provide any numbers on how many medical workers there have tested positive for Covid-19 , but doctors work in fear for their own safety .
An internal medicine physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan shared an internal communication with ███ that said staff are being required to wear masks “ only when clinically indicated. ” This person requested anonymity to avoid potential retribution from their employer . They found the potential for exposure to the virus without protective equipment upsetting . Given how extensive community spread is and how high-risk health workers are , some other hospitals are requiring all staff to keep their masks on at all times .
The New York hospital is also reevaluating its current policy of not having staff wear scrubs when they treat Covid-19 patients , though that is the standard in places like China . And it has required pregnant people on its staff to continue working , though there is limited information about the risk to that population . The hospital cited the 2003 SARS outbreak , Covid-19 cases in South Korea and China , the assessment of the hospital ’ s senior medical staff , and the effectiveness of the protective gear in an internal communication seen by ███ .
“ My frustration is that I have never felt like my safety is important , ” this physician said . “ When I ’ m going to work , I could endanger me and my family and I feel like my institution doesn ’ t even care at all . ”
Reached for comment about the concerns of its staff , New York-Presbyterian said it is “ treating a large influx of COVID-19 patients , as anticipated . The health and safety of every patient in our care , as well as our entire staff , continues to be our highest priority . ”
“ We continue to implement measures to increase capacity , including triage tents and reassignment of beds and units , cancellations of all elective surgeries , and utilization of telemedicine if possible , ” the hospital said in a statement . “ We are also conserving supplies , including personal protective equipment , to help meet this challenge , which we expect to continue . ”
New York is living through what other cities may soon experience . Morale is low and the mood anxious across the country , as the pandemic continues to worsen . Based on what we ’ ve seen already in other countries , a lot of doctors and nurses are highly likely to get sick .
“ As soon as you have the first case , you immediately have a staffing problem ; you ’ re probably furloughing people who made the first contacts before you had test results , ” Chip Kahn , president of the Federation of American Hospitals , said . “ Then as you get further into it , it gets more and more intense . ”
And the problem that other countries face may be worse in America .
“ With already lower staffing ratios plus the very real risk of losing more [ health care workers ] due to illness , this could spiral and get much worse , ” Jen Kates , who leads the global health program at the Kaiser Family Foundation , said .
If too many doctors and nurses get infected themselves and can ’ t care for patients , or if hospitals lay off workers because they are losing revenue with many of their other operations on hold , the health system ’ s capacity is going to deteriorate even further .
Health care workers face more exposure to the coronavirus , and they may also get sicker
Doctors and nurses may have a higher chance of getting seriously ill from the coronavirus if they do get infected . The numbers from the initial Wuhan , China , outbreak indicate 15 percent of the roughly 1,700 Covid-19 cases for medical personnel as of mid-February were critical or severe . Five had died .
The World Health Organization ’ s report found that health care workers were actually not more at risk of infection than other people . But the WHO also noted that “ attention to the prevention of infection in health care workers is of paramount importance in China . Surveillance among health care workers identified factors early in the outbreak that placed [ health care workers ] at higher risk of infection , and this information has been used to modify policies to improve protection . ”
“ It ’ s not that they ’ re getting infected at higher rates ; instead , they ’ re getting sicker than one might expect on the basis of their age , ” says Peter Hotez , the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College , of health care workers in Wuhan .
One theory for why that could be : Medical staff are exposed to high levels of the virus as they work in hospitals and interact with patients . But we don ’ t know for sure .
The early data from the European countries hit the hardest by Covid-19 indicates health care workers account for a significant share of their Covid-19 cases . In Spain , government officials reported on Tuesday that medical staff accounted for 14 percent of the country ’ s nearly 40,000 reported cases . In Italy as of March 22 , almost 1 in 10 coronavirus cases was a health care worker .
And in America , given our known shortage of protective medical gear and lax protocols reported at some hospitals , we can not necessarily expect the same resilience among our medical staff as China saw . More than 100 workers in Boston ’ s three biggest hospitals have already tested positive for Covid-19 , according to local news reports on Wednesday .
“ The burden it ’ s placing on our hospitals , with the lack of equipment — we feel ill-prepared for it , ” said Stefan Flores , an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University in New York City .
“ It ’ s like showing up to war with a knife at this point . I don ’ t know if I am going to have a mask the next day , ” Flores said . He keeps two or three masks in a bioprotective bag at the end of the workday , washing it and preventing it from being soiled , because he doesn ’ t know when they ’ re going to get more . He leaves them in a designated section of his apartment .
An ER doctor in Pennsylvania told ███ that as hospitals face personal protective gear shortages , incomplete protection from exposure means more doctors and medical staff out sick . That will lead to worse outcomes overall for coronavirus patients .
But they have no choice but to adapt to these circumstances ; hospitals and ERs can ’ t shutter in the middle of an outbreak because they lack protective equipment .
Demand for personal protective gear has been extraordinary ; one health care supply company reported it had seen demand for N95 masks double during the outbreak . Some hospitals have reportedly run out of a month ’ s worth of supplies in just a few days .
Meanwhile , hospitals are already pushing staff to the limit in an effort to keep enough doctors and nurses on call to respond to the pandemic . One nurse at a major metropolitan hospital , who asked for anonymity to avoid angering their employer , told ███ that staff had been instructed to come to work as long as their temperature did not exceed 101 degrees Fahrenheit and they weren ’ t coughing , regardless of their known exposure to the coronavirus . They were given brown bags to keep their N95 mask in so the mask could be reused .
Flores said that initially , doctors and medical staff at his hospital were asked to quarantine if they were simply exposed to a coronavirus patient . “ Obviously , that very changed quickly once we realized with the sheer number of people who actually were infected with [ coronavirus ] was so high that it was fine ; you were going to be exposed . Now , it ’ s as long as you ’ re symptomatic . ”
It ’ s not just infections that could shrink hospital staff . Many hospitals are starting to postpone elective surgeries ( which can include procedures for serious conditions like cancer and heart disease , as well as less urgent surgeries ) so as to free up more staff for coronavirus response and to reduce the risk of more people getting infected .
Canceled surgeries mean a loss in revenue for those hospitals . One rural hospital in Georgia told Modern Healthcare it could lose half of its revenue with elective services delayed . Industry leaders have warned that hundreds of hospitals could close without a huge infusion of cash from Congress . The deal recently struck in the Senate would pump $ 100 billion into US hospitals in a bid to stave off disaster .
If doctors and nurses can ’ t work , hospitals can ’ t care for as many people
Before the coronavirus ever came to our shores , America was at a hospital staffing disadvantage compared to other rich countries . Overall , US hospitals employ as many people or more per capita as our economic peers . But staffing is disproportionately tilted toward administrative work in the United States .
If you focus on health care professionals specifically , US hospitals trail behind most European countries and Canada . Our hospitals employ almost as many administrative staff as medical staff , according to estimates from the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker .
And US hospitals were already at risk of being overrun if the number of Covid-19 cases explodes before fears about staffing shortages fully set in .
America has about 924,000 hospital beds , about 98,000 of which can be used for people who need intensive care , according to the American Hospital Association . The number of Covid-19 cases that will require ICU care could expand far beyond what the US is currently capable of providing .
Imperial College London projections from last week , while just one set of estimates among many and based largely on modeling for influenza outbreaks instead of the current facts on the ground , painted a grim picture . It found even the most aggressive mitigation strategies — general social distancing , quarantines , closing schools — would not be enough to prevent US hospitals from eventually being overwhelmed unless the country is willing to commit to these drastic measures until a vaccine becomes available .
For people 60 and older , between 17 and 25 percent of cases are expected to require hospitalization ; of those , 25 percent or more will require intensive care ( as many as 70 percent for patients 80 and older ) , according to this analysis . The ability of hospitals to provide that care will be imperative if we are to protect those most vulnerable populations .
Italian hospitals could provide a frightening preview of what ’ s to come in the US as their system is overwhelmed by coronavirus and medical personnel are put at risk . A group of doctors from a hospital in Bergamo , Italy , facing 4,305 Covid-19 cases in their city with just 48 ICU beds available , painted a grave picture in a recent New England Journal of Medicine op-ed :
We are learning that hospitals might be the main Covid-19 carriers , as they are rapidly populated by infected patients , facilitating transmission to uninfected patients . Patients are transported by our regional system,1 which also contributes to spreading the disease as its ambulances and personnel rapidly become vectors . Health workers are asymptomatic carriers or sick without surveillance ; some might die , including young people , which increases the stress of those on the front line .
The toll on hospital workers will manifest in many ways . Research out of China found high levels of stress and depression among health care workers who were responding to the coronavirus outbreak .
Already , US doctors are on edge . Kevin Tien , a pediatric resident at a hospital in Houston , Texas , which has so far seen a small number of cases , described the mood as “ a quiet simmering of anxiety . ”
“ Everyone is on edge , waiting for the crest of the wave to crash . ”
The highest priorities right now are to prevent any more health care workers from getting sick , and to help ill hospital staff return to swabbing noses , running tests , and treating patients . But these efforts remain hampered by shortages in critical equipment , so resolving these shortfalls is essential to slowing the spread of Covid-19 .
President Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act but has not yet used it to order US manufacturers to make more medical supplies to address these shortfalls . But whether there is an official order or not , it will take some time for assembly lines to spool up .
Testing could also help health care workers who were sick with Covid-19 return to the job . In particular , serologic tests can establish whether someone has been infected and has mounted an immune response to the infection . These tests look for antibody proteins to the virus . They aren ’ t as accurate for diagnosing active infections since it can take days for an infected person to produce antibodies , but serologic tests are useful for finding out who has fought off the virus .
Some researchers are optimistic about using these tests in exposed health workers , but only if they can know for sure that surviving the virus grants immunity from future infections .
“ I ’ ve publicly stated that I support that if we can verify that [ testing positive for an immune response to Covid-19 ] really is protective ” against the disease , said Marc Lipsitch , a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University . “ We need to check to make sure the protection is real before doing that on a large scale , but I do think that will be an important part of the strategy because we ’ ll need to keep health care workers in action . ”
But Covid-19 tests remain in short supply , which means hospitals and health officials will have to decide whether to use what they have to find out who has the virus , or to probe past infections .
States and localities are also preparing for this oncoming staffing crisis by trying to recruit retirees and even medical students to fill the voids , when they happen . In New York , Gov . Andrew Cuomo said 40,000 people have signed up to be part of the state ’ s health care reserve . New York University is allowing some medical students to graduate early help with coronavirus patients , provided they can get the proper certifications .
However , one of the most important ways to protect hospital workers remains public health measures to slow the spread of the virus . Proper hand-washing and social distancing can reduce the number of simultaneous cases of Covid-19 . Flattening the curve of cases will help ensure that there are enough beds , ventilators , protective equipment , and medical staff to attend to patients at a given time . That , in turn , will reduce stress on doctors , nurses , and orderlies and allow them to spread out potential exposures to the virus .
So everyone else staying home from work can help keep hospitals working .
Still , new Covid-19 cases are increasing , and the situation for health workers seems poised to get worse before it gets better . “ It ’ s almost a question , I feel like , for us as health care workers : not if we get sick , when we get sick , ” Flores said .
“ It ’ s definitely anguishing , and it ’ s definitely scary , ” he added . “ But just like anything , too , I think it will pass . I think we ’ re taking appropriate measures . It ’ s just unfortunately going to get worse before it gets better . ”","Share All sharing options for: The next coronavirus crisis will be a shortage of doctors and nurses

But these efforts remain hampered by shortages in critical equipment, so resolving these shortfalls is essential to slowing the spread of Covid-19.

President Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act but has not yet used it to order US manufacturers to make more medical supplies to address these shortfalls. But whether there is an official order or not, it will take some time for assembly lines to spool up.

Testing could also help health care workers who were sick with Covid-19 return to the job. In particular, serologic tests can establish whether someone has been infected and has mounted an immune response to the infection. These tests look for antibody proteins to the virus. They aren’t as accurate for diagnosing active infections since it can take days for an infected person to produce antibodies, but serologic tests are useful for finding out who has fought off the virus.

Some researchers are optimistic about using these tests in exposed health workers, but only if they can know for sure that surviving the virus grants immunity from future infections.

“I’ve publicly stated that I support that if we can verify that [testing positive for an immune response to Covid-19] really is protective” against the disease, said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University. “We need to check to make sure the protection is real before doing that on a large scale, but I do think that will be an important part of the strategy because we’ll need to keep health care workers in action.”

But Covid-19 tests remain in short supply, which means hospitals and health officials will have to decide whether to use what they have to find out who has the virus, or to probe past infections.

States and localities are also preparing for this oncoming staffing crisis by trying to recruit retirees and even medical students to fill the voids, when they happen. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said 40,000 people have signed up to be part of the state’s health care reserve. New York University is allowing some medical students to graduate early help with coronavirus patients, provided they can get the proper certifications.

However, one of the most important ways to protect hospital workers remains public health measures to slow the spread of the virus. Proper hand-washing and social distancing can reduce the number of simultaneous cases of Covid-19. Flattening the curve of cases will help ensure that there are enough beds, ventilators, protective equipment, and medical staff to attend to patients at a given time. That, in turn, will reduce stress on doctors, nurses, and orderlies and allow them to spread out potential exposures to the virus.

So everyone else staying home from work can help keep hospitals working.

Still, new Covid-19 cases are increasing, and the situation for health workers seems poised to get worse before it gets better. “It’s almost a question, I feel like, for us as health care workers: not if we get sick, when we get sick,” Flores said.

“It’s definitely anguishing, and it’s definitely scary,” he added. “But just like anything, too, I think it will pass. I think we’re taking appropriate measures. It’s just unfortunately going to get worse before it gets better.”

It wasn’t a surprise when the U.S. Navy announced Sunday that the fast-spreading coronavirus had made its way on board one of its ships, infecting a sailor on the USS Boxer, docked in San Diego.

But what happened next raises questions about how the Navy will respond to the virus within the tight quarters of its seabound vessels.

coronavirus,Daily Beast,0,https://www.thedailybeast.com/idahos-lt-gov-janice-mcgeachin-has-gone-rogue-over-coronavirus?ref=home,Idaho’s Anti-Lockdown Lieutenant Governor Has Gone Rogue,2020-05-25,Justin Rohrlich,"When the Republican governor of Idaho issued a plan to safely reopen businesses in the state , he ordered bars to stay closed until at least June 13 . Last weekend , in defiance of those guidelines , Idaho ’ s lieutenant governor—also a Republican—reopened the tavern she owns with her family in Idaho Falls .
A few days before reopening The Celt Pub and Grill , Lt. Gov . Janice McGeachin penned a scathing op-ed in which she slammed Gov . Brad Little ’ s oversight of the coronavirus pandemic .
“ As Lieutenant Governor , I am one heartbeat away from the governor ’ s chair , ” McGeachin wrote . State residents , she added , were “ sidelined and left to watch silently as the government closed Main Street by unilaterally deciding which businesses were ‘ essential ’ and which ones were not . ”
The definition of “ essential ” workers came from the White House , not the statehouse , but that was lost in the remarkable animosity between Idaho ’ s top leaders . According to the Idaho Statesman , McGeachin and Little have not spoken in weeks .
As the country enters its third month of lockdown amid a slumping economy , right-wing protesters often funded by a network of deep-pocketed conservative groups , have called for states to be “ liberated ” from a patchwork of measures meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 . But public health experts warn that reopening prematurely will only make things worse . Weeks after it reopened , Texas has experienced a surge in COVID-19 deaths .
A majority of Americans , on both sides of the aisle , say the nation is reopening too quickly , but among politicians the dispute is largely split down party lines . In Georgia , the Democratic mayors of Atlanta , Savannah , and Albany are opposed to Republican governor Brian Kemp ’ s reopening plan , saying it is too early . The Democratic mayor of Des Moines , Frank Cownie , has criticized Iowa governor Kim Reynolds , a Republican , for the same reason .
However , the feud between McGeachin and Little is playing out among two conservatives in a deep red state . Idaho state representative Greg Chaney , a Republican who has been openly critical of McGeachin ’ s position on reopening , told The ███ he hasn ’ t seen anything like it in his lifetime .
“ This particular administration has been in office not quite two years , and so their working relationship is relatively new , ” said Chaney , “ but historically I ca n't recall a similar example , even [ back in the 1980s ] when we had a Repubiclan lieutenant governor and a Democratic governor . ”
In Idaho , the governor and lieutenant governor are elected individually . Little clinched Idaho ’ s 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary with 37 percent of the vote ; McGeachin won with 29 percent . They both were voted into office with 60 percent of the vote in the general election .
The day after Little ’ s broad stay-at-home order eased earlier this month , McGeachin attended a “ Disobey Idaho ” protest outside the state capitol building . “ Disobey Idaho ” was organized by the Idaho Freedom Foundation ( IFF ) , a right-wing group backed by the conservative State Policy Network . In a blog post , Wayne Hoffman , the IFF ’ s executive director , told followers that the state , country , and economy “ are in a death spiral , inflicted by our elected officials and their teams of ‘ health experts . ’ ”
Following her appearance at the demonstration , McGeachin flew to the town of Kendrick with Idaho GOP chairman Raul Labrador to support the reopening of the Hardware Brewery , a local brewpub , which authorities said was restricted from opening until mid-June . A week later , the Idaho State Alcohol Beverage Control Bureau warned the establishment that its liquor license could be pulled if it continued to violate the governor ’ s order by staying open .
McGeachin accused Little of abusing his power to “ harass and intimidate private businesses. ” Hardware Brewery co-owner Christine Lohman took it a step further , comparing Idaho under Little ’ s leadership to Nazi Germany .
The brewery has remained open , contrary to state orders , Lohman told The ███ . She said she is unsure if the business will be fined or penalized , but that she has been in touch with the Idaho Department of Health about safety guidelines . The establishment has “ met them on some of it , ” including canceling events and using paper plates and disposable cutlery , Lohman explained , but said they ’ re still “ trying to work on the social distancing . ”
“ I don ’ t have so much of an issue that they want us to do it , but I do n't think private businesses should be told by the government to police the public , ” she continued . “ Our public are critical-thinking adults , for me to say , ‘ I need to check your temperature , ’ or that only six people can sit together although eight or 10 came in together ... I say , ‘ When is it going to stop ? ’ ”
Lohman and her husband have depleted their retirement savings in an attempt to keep the brewery ’ s lights on , she said . Little , however , “ has not lost his check , he has not lost his medical . ”
“ The lieutenant governor has more stones than the governor , ” said Lohman . “ Brad Little has acted like a Democrat through this whole thing , and the people know it . These are people who want their freedom . This is the perfect time for America to fight for its civil rights . ”
McGeachin , 57 , was a delegate for Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican National Convention , and vice-chair of Idaho ’ s statewide committee to elect Trump . Her 2018 campaign website for lieutenant governor , which is still active , boasts a photo of her in a MAGA hat alongside Donald Trump Jr. , under the headline : “ President Trump Keeps Making America Great Again ! ”
Born in New Mexico , the staunchly anti-abortion McGeachin is Idaho ’ s first female lieutenant governor . In addition to The Celt , which opened in 2012 , McGeachin and her husband operate a successful auto transmission business . Last year , on the 24th anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City by white supremacists , McGeachin administered an oath at a rally hosted by a right-wing militia called the Real Three Percent of Idaho , which the Southern Poverty Law Center says is part of an “ extreme anti-government ” movement . A month earlier , McGeachin was photographed posing with far-right militia members in what appeared to be a message of support for Todd Engel , who is currently serving a 14-year sentence for his part in an armed confrontation with federal agents .
The escalating conflict seen now between McGeachin and Little is “ emblematic of the same chaotic approach to the pandemic we are seeing at the federal level , ” Craig Holman , a government affairs expert at the watchdog nonprofit Public Citizen , told The ███ .
“ Though Trump and Pence are more or less in agreement , the constant contradicting of senior health officials by Trump has rendered the government 's response to the pandemic listless at best , ” said Holman . “ Fortunately for some states , Trump has now decided to turn over control of the pandemic policies to the states . However , for Idaho , the state response will be as divided and chaotic as it has been at the federal level . ”
As a business owner , McGeachin clearly has a financial stake in reopening , though she has pushed back at the idea that her family broke any rules by re-launching dine-in and drink-in service in mid-May .
Under the state order , bars don ’ t reopen until May 30 , but McGeachin said in a Facebook post that The Celt is a restaurant and was allowed to reopen earlier . But she also put The Celt in the same category as Hardware Brewery , which has already been cited for breaking the rules.The Celt says it is taking precautions : operating at 50 percent capacity ; capping parties at six people ; using paper menus . But while employees are required to wear face masks during their shifts , customers are not .
That endangers staff as well as other diners in the space , said Luisa Franzini , chair of the School of Public Health at the University of Maryland , College Park .
“ There should be social distancing , wearing of masks , and so on , ” even for outdoor dining , Franzini told The ███ , adding that she believes indoor dining remains unsafe . “ I have n't found two jurisdictions that have the same policy . It makes you feel that your health and safety are really dependent on where you happen to live . ”
An employee who answered the phone at The Celt told The ███ that staff members were instructed not to speak with reporters .
Idaho has more than 2,400 confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date .
In some parts of the state , the rate of COVID-19 infections has been low . Of Idaho ’ s 44 counties , 11 haven ’ t had a single case , Greg Chaney explained . Yet , he said , Blaine County , where the Sun Valley ski resort is located , at one point exceeded the per capita infection rate of any other place in the country , including New York City—the “ hottest spot ” in the U.S .
“ I think it ’ s understandable to express disagreement , or even frustration , given everything that ’ s going on , ” Chaney said , “ but I think it ’ s important that we all look for constructive ways to express that . “ While we ’ re in the heat of the moment , trying to get people to work together to address what ’ s happening , it ’ s certainly poor timing to undermine the governor in charge . ”
“ Governors across the country have proven themselves to be real leaders during this time , particularly given the dearth of strategy from the White House , ” adds Democratic strategist Andrew Taverrite . “ I would think Idahoans—like the rest of the country—are looking for science-based information rather than political fights right now . ”
McGeachin ’ s stance on reopening doesn ’ t much surprise Deborah David-Simonds , a retired RN living in Idaho Falls .
David-Simonds notes that while McGeachin has actively encouraged Idahoans to disobey Gov . Little ’ s stay-at-home order , Little has taken a “ thoughtful approach ” to reopening . He has listened to advice from state health officials , further drawing criticism from the right , David-Simonds told The ███ . She sees the issue as a health concern , nothing more , and can ’ t comprehend “ why masks are seen as a violation of someone ’ s constitutional rights . ”
And although business closures have taken a great toll on people ’ s finances , Luisa Franzini urges people to consider the bigger picture .
“ Of course there is individual freedom , but the freedom ends when your freedom starts hurting someone else , ” she said . “ In the case of an epidemic , it ’ s justified to put some restrictions on people , and some just ideologically are not accepting that . ”","When the Republican governor of Idaho issued a plan to safely reopen businesses in the state, he ordered bars to stay closed until at least June 13. Last weekend, in defiance of those guidelines, Idaho’s lieutenant governor—also a Republican—reopened the tavern she owns with her family in Idaho Falls.

A few days before reopening The Celt Pub and Grill, Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin penned a scathing op-ed in which she slammed Gov. Brad Little’s oversight of the coronavirus pandemic.

“As Lieutenant Governor, I am one heartbeat away from the governor’s chair,” McGeachin wrote. State residents, she added, were “sidelined and left to watch silently as the government closed Main Street by unilaterally deciding which businesses were ‘essential’ and which ones were not.”

The definition of “essential” workers came from the White House, not the statehouse, but that was lost in the remarkable animosity between Idaho’s top leaders. According to the Idaho Statesman, McGeachin and Little have not spoken in weeks.

As the country enters its third month of lockdown amid a slumping economy, right-wing protesters often funded by a network of deep-pocketed conservative groups, have called for states to be “liberated” from a patchwork of measures meant to slow the spread of COVID-19. But public health experts warn that reopening prematurely will only make things worse. Weeks after it reopened, Texas has experienced a surge in COVID-19 deaths.

A majority of Americans, on both sides of the aisle, say the nation is reopening too quickly, but among politicians the dispute is largely split down party lines. In Georgia, the Democratic mayors of Atlanta, Savannah, and Albany are opposed to Republican governor Brian Kemp’s reopening plan, saying it is too early. The Democratic mayor of Des Moines, Frank Cownie, has criticized Iowa governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican, for the same reason.

However, the feud between McGeachin and Little is playing out among two conservatives in a deep red state. Idaho state representative Greg Chaney, a Republican who has been openly critical of McGeachin’s position on reopening, told The Daily Beast he hasn’t seen anything like it in his lifetime.

“This particular administration has been in office not quite two years, and so their working relationship is relatively new,” said Chaney, “but historically I can't recall a similar example, even [back in the 1980s] when we had a Repubiclan lieutenant governor and a Democratic governor.”

In Idaho, the governor and lieutenant governor are elected individually. Little clinched Idaho’s 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary with 37 percent of the vote; McGeachin won with 29 percent. They both were voted into office with 60 percent of the vote in the general election.

Neither responded to requests for comment for this story.

The day after Little’s broad stay-at-home order eased earlier this month, McGeachin attended a “Disobey Idaho” protest outside the state capitol building. “Disobey Idaho” was organized by the Idaho Freedom Foundation (IFF), a right-wing group backed by the conservative State Policy Network. In a blog post, Wayne Hoffman, the IFF’s executive director, told followers that the state, country, and economy “are in a death spiral, inflicted by our elected officials and their teams of ‘health experts.’”

Following her appearance at the demonstration, McGeachin flew to the town of Kendrick with Idaho GOP chairman Raul Labrador to support the reopening of the Hardware Brewery, a local brewpub, which authorities said was restricted from opening until mid-June. A week later, the Idaho State Alcohol Beverage Control Bureau warned the establishment that its liquor license could be pulled if it continued to violate the governor’s order by staying open.

McGeachin accused Little of abusing his power to “harass and intimidate private businesses.” Hardware Brewery co-owner Christine Lohman took it a step further, comparing Idaho under Little’s leadership to Nazi Germany.

The brewery has remained open, contrary to state orders, Lohman told The Daily Beast. She said she is unsure if the business will be fined or penalized, but that she has been in touch with the Idaho Department of Health about safety guidelines. The establishment has “met them on some of it,” including canceling events and using paper plates and disposable cutlery, Lohman explained, but said they’re still “trying to work on the social distancing.”

“I don’t have so much of an issue that they want us to do it, but I don't think private businesses should be told by the government to police the public,” she continued. “Our public are critical-thinking adults, for me to say, ‘I need to check your temperature,’ or that only six people can sit together although eight or 10 came in together... I say, ‘When is it going to stop?’”

Lohman and her husband have depleted their retirement savings in an attempt to keep the brewery’s lights on, she said. Little, however, “has not lost his check, he has not lost his medical.”

“The lieutenant governor has more stones than the governor,” said Lohman. “Brad Little has acted like a Democrat through this whole thing, and the people know it. These are people who want their freedom. This is the perfect time for America to fight for its civil rights.”

McGeachin, 57, was a delegate for Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican National Convention, and vice-chair of Idaho’s statewide committee to elect Trump. Her 2018 campaign website for lieutenant governor, which is still active, boasts a photo of her in a MAGA hat alongside Donald Trump Jr., under the headline: “President Trump Keeps Making America Great Again!”

It is possible that responses to the coronavirus could shift the long-term paradigm for journalism in unforeseen ways , in the same way the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , fueled the global expansion of anti-terrorism laws – and in turn , ushered in an uptick in the jailing of journalists that continues today .
Global press freedom violations that CPJ has documented in relation to the pandemic can roughly be divided into 10 categories to monitor ( with examples cited ) :
The pandemic has provided governments with a new excuse to wield laws criminalizing the spread of “ fake news , ” “ misinformation , ” or “ false information ” — and offered a reason to implement new ones . Over the past seven years , the number of journalists imprisoned on charges of “ fake news ” or “ false news ” has climbed , according to CPJ research .
Carlos Gaio , a U.K.-based senior legal officer with the Media Legal Defence Initiative , told CPJ that “ fake news ” laws will continue to spread as governments try to control messaging about the virus , affecting journalists and fact-checkers alike . “ It ’ s a very complicated subject to outlaw something like that [ and it ] is very , very dangerous , ” Gaio said .
Disinformation is a real problem , but these legal measures give governments latitude to decide what they consider to be false , sending a chilling message to critical journalists . In the U.S. , President Donald Trump frequently disparages the media ’ s COVID-19 coverage and uses the term “ fake news ” when he disagrees with reporting , a strategy that CPJ has found effectively discredits the media and erodes public trust . It serves as a green light for authoritarians to deride and prosecute their own press .
South Africa on March 18 criminalized disinformation about the pandemic with penalties that include hefty fines and jail time – a particularly worrying move since the country often serves as a regional model .
Puerto Rico , a U.S. territory , on April 6 made it illegal for media outlets to “ transmit or allow the transmission ” of “ false information. ” Violators could face up to six months in prison and fines up to $ 5000 .
Arresting journalists has long been a tactic of authoritarian governments looking to silence critical reporting ; at least 250 journalists were jailed worldwide at CPJ ’ s last annual count in December . With COVID-19 in circulation , imprisonment could be deadly ; journalists are held in unsanitary conditions and forced into close proximity with others who could be infected . CPJ and more than 190 partner organizations have called on authorities worldwide to release all journalists jailed because of their work .
In India , authorities in Tamil Nadu state arrested on April 23 the founder of SimpliCity news portal and accused him of violating the antiquated Epidemic Diseases Act and other laws . The website had alleged government corruption in food distribution efforts related to the pandemic .
Jordan ’ s military arrested two journalists for satellite channel Roya TV on April 10 in relation to a report on worker complaints about the economic impact of a curfew .
Somali authorities arrested an editor for Goobjoog Media Group on April 14 and accused him of spreading false news and offending the president ’ s honor after the journalist posted criticism on Facebook of the government ’ s handling of the crisis .
Some governments ’ emergency measures have revoked or suspended the right to free speech for the duration of the emergency .
Liberia ’ s constitution protects freedom of expression “ save during an emergency ” and affords presidential power to “ suspend or affect certain rights , freedoms and guarantees ” during a state of emergency like the one imposed April 11 .
Honduras on March 16 declared a temporary state of emergency that suspended some articles of the constitution , including the one that protects the right to free expression ( though the government reversed that measure days later ) .
Authorities in several countries suspended newspaper distribution and printing in what they called an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19 . Elsewhere , media regulators have blocked websites or removed articles with critical coverage .
Jordan , Oman , Morocco , Yemen , and Iran all suspended newspaper distribution in March .
Tajikistan blocked independent news website Akhbor on April 9 , after it reported critically on the government .
Russia ’ s media regulator , Roskomnadzor , ordered radio station Ekho Moskvy to take down an interview with a disease expert , and news website Govorit Magadan to remove an article about a local pneumonia death .
Government officials and private citizens alike have responded to critical reporting on the pandemic response with violence and threats . In places where the reporting environment was already hazardous , the situation has grown more fraught .
Chechnya ’ s leader , Ramzan Kadyrov , threatened a Novaya Gazeta reporter after she wrote on April 12 that Chechens had stopped reporting coronavirus symptoms for fear of being labeled “ terrorists . ”
Haitian journalists were assaulted by unidentified men at the government ’ s National Identification Office on April 2 as they investigated claims that the office was violating COVID-19 guidelines on social distancing .
Ghanaian soldiers enforcing restrictions related to the pandemic assaulted journalists in two separate incidents in April .
Authorities have restricted journalists ’ ability to move about freely , such as if they want to report during curfews , or enter hospitals to get a first-hand account of health care . Sometimes the press is granted special access , but requiring members of the media to have government-issued press credentials allows leaders to decide who gets counted as a journalist .
CPJ research shows that this leaves open the possibility that they will exclude those not affiliated with major outlets or those who report critically on the authorities .
Indian police assaulted at least four journalists in three separate incidents in Hyderabad and Delhi on March 23 as they transited to or from work during the lockdown , even though national authorities have stated that journalists are exempt from the restrictions .
Nigeria required journalists to carry a valid identification card to move around certain locked down areas , including the capital Abuja , and designated only 16 journalists as allowed to enter the president ’ s villa .
Laws on freedom of information that allow journalists to request government data and records have been suspended . Government proceedings that journalists usually attend have moved online , with varying degrees of access for the press . In the U.S. , Trump ’ s antagonism to journalists sets a poor example for U.S. state and local officials .
Gaio told CPJ that these trends are likely to persist . “ [ Governments ] will make it more difficult for officials to provide information . Access to information will take longer , and it will make it more complicated for journalists to access public spaces because of infection risks , ” he said .
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on March 23 signed a measure into law that suspends deadlines for public authorities and institutions to respond to requests for information , and does away with appeals in case of denial . ( Brazil ’ s Supreme Court overturned the measure on April 30 , according to news reports . )
United States governors and mayors have created a patchwork of access to press conferences around the country . In Florida , the governor on March 28 barred one reporter from attending a press conference after she asked about social distancing measures .

The COVID-19 pandemic has sent public health officials scrambling, the global economy into shock, and governments everywhere into crisis. It has also reshaped the way journalists work, not least because many authorities in many countries have cited the contagion as a reason to crack down on the news media.

Certain dangers will subside with time: a vaccine for COVID-19 should ultimately protect people, including journalists, from spreading or contracting the virus. But some of the measures put into place that restrict press freedom – whether intended or not — could continue well into the future, experts say. Click to explore a map of the data

It is possible that responses to the coronavirus could shift the long-term paradigm for journalism in unforeseen ways, in the same way the attacks of September 11, 2001, fueled the global expansion of anti-terrorism laws – and in turn, ushered in an uptick in the jailing of journalists that continues today.

Global press freedom violations that CPJ has documented in relation to the pandemic can roughly be divided into 10 categories to monitor (with examples cited):

1. Laws against “fake news”

The pandemic has provided governments with a new excuse to wield laws criminalizing the spread of “fake news,” “misinformation,” or “false information” — and offered a reason to implement new ones. Over the past seven years, the number of journalists imprisoned on charges of “fake news” or “false news” has climbed, according to CPJ research.

Carlos Gaio, a U.K.-based senior legal officer with the Media Legal Defence Initiative, told CPJ that “fake news” laws will continue to spread as governments try to control messaging about the virus, affecting journalists and fact-checkers alike. “It’s a very complicated subject to outlaw something like that [and it] is very, very dangerous,” Gaio said.

Disinformation is a real problem, but these legal measures give governments latitude to decide what they consider to be false, sending a chilling message to critical journalists. In the U.S., President Donald Trump frequently disparages the media’s COVID-19 coverage and uses the term “fake news” when he disagrees with reporting, a strategy that CPJ has found effectively discredits the media and erodes public trust. It serves as a green light for authoritarians to deride and prosecute their own press.

South Africa on March 18 criminalized disinformation about the pandemic with penalties that include hefty fines and jail time – a particularly worrying move since the country often serves as a regional model.

Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, on April 6 made it illegal for media outlets to “transmit or allow the transmission” of “false information.” Violators could face up to six months in prison and fines up to $5000.

2. Jailing journalists

Arresting journalists has long been a tactic of authoritarian governments looking to silence critical reporting; at least 250 journalists were jailed worldwide at CPJ’s last annual count in December. With COVID-19 in circulation, imprisonment could be deadly; journalists are held in unsanitary conditions and forced into close proximity with others who could be infected. CPJ and more than 190 partner organizations have called on authorities worldwide to release all journalists jailed because of their work.

Nonetheless, arrests continue.

In India, authorities in Tamil Nadu state arrested on April 23 the founder of SimpliCity news portal and accused him of violating the antiquated Epidemic Diseases Act and other laws. The website had alleged government corruption in food distribution efforts related to the pandemic.

Jordan’s military arrested two journalists for satellite channel Roya TV on April 10 in relation to a report on worker complaints about the economic impact of a curfew.

Somali authorities arrested an editor for Goobjoog Media Group on April 14 and accused him of spreading false news and offending the president’s honor after the journalist posted criticism on Facebook of the government’s handling of the crisis.

3. Suspending free speech

Some governments’ emergency measures have revoked or suspended the right to free speech for the duration of the emergency.

Liberia’s constitution protects freedom of expression “save during an emergency” and affords presidential power to “suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees” during a state of emergency like the one imposed April 11.

Honduras on March 16 declared a temporary state of emergency that suspended some articles of the constitution, including the one that protects the right to free expression (though the government reversed that measure days later).

4. Blunt censorship, online and off

Authorities in several countries suspended newspaper distribution and printing in what they called an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. Elsewhere, media regulators have blocked websites or removed articles with critical coverage.

Jordan, Oman, Morocco, Yemen, and Iran all suspended newspaper distribution in March.

Tajikistan blocked independent news website Akhbor on April 9, after it reported critically on the government.

Russia’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor, ordered radio station Ekho Moskvy to take down an interview with a disease expert, and news website Govorit Magadan to remove an article about a local pneumonia death.

5. Threatening and harassing journalists, online and off

Government officials and private citizens alike have responded to critical reporting on the pandemic response with violence and threats. In places where the reporting environment was already hazardous, the situation has grown more fraught.

Chechnya’s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, threatened a Novaya Gazeta reporter after she wrote on April 12 that Chechens had stopped reporting coronavirus symptoms for fear of being labeled “terrorists.”

Haitian journalists were assaulted by unidentified men at the government’s National Identification Office on April 2 as they investigated claims that the office was violating COVID-19 guidelines on social distancing.

Ghanaian soldiers enforcing restrictions related to the pandemic assaulted journalists in two separate incidents in April.

6. Accreditation requirements and restricted freedom of movement

Authorities have restricted journalists’ ability to move about freely, such as if they want to report during curfews, or enter hospitals to get a first-hand account of health care. Sometimes the press is granted special access, but requiring members of the media to have government-issued press credentials allows leaders to decide who gets counted as a journalist.

CPJ research shows that this leaves open the possibility that they will exclude those not affiliated with major outlets or those who report critically on the authorities.

Indian police assaulted at least four journalists in three separate incidents in Hyderabad and Delhi on March 23 as they transited to or from work during the lockdown, even though national authorities have stated that journalists are exempt from the restrictions.

Nigeria required journalists to carry a valid identification card to move around certain locked down areas, including the capital Abuja, and designated only 16 journalists as allowed to enter the president’s villa.

7. Restricted access to information

Laws on freedom of information that allow journalists to request government data and records have been suspended. Government proceedings that journalists usually attend have moved online, with varying degrees of access for the press. In the U.S., Trump’s antagonism to journalists sets a poor example for U.S. state and local officials.

Gaio told CPJ that these trends are likely to persist. “[Governments] will make it more difficult for officials to provide information. Access to information will take longer, and it will make it more complicated for journalists to access public spaces because of infection risks,” he said.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on March 23 signed a measure into law that suspends deadlines for public authorities and institutions to respond to requests for information, and does away with appeals in case of denial. (Brazil’s Supreme Court overturned the measure on April 30, according to news reports.)

United States governors and mayors have created a patchwork of access to press conferences around the country. In Florida, the governor on March 28 barred one reporter from attending a press conference after she asked about social distancing measures.

8. Expulsions and visa restrictions

In order to control the narrative of how the government is responding to COVID-19, some states are being inhospitable to foreign media, which in some places has traditionally enjoyed greater latitude than locals to report critically.

China and the United States have been engaged in a tit-for-tat over journalist access since early in 2020. Among the developments: In February, China forced out three Wall Street Journal reporters, ostensibly in retaliation for a headline on an opinion piece about COVID-19. In March, the U.S. imposed a limit of 100 on the number of visas for Chinese state media; China retaliated by terminating visas for at least 13 U.S. reporters from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.

Egypt expelled Guardian reporter Ruth Michaelson in retaliation for her report on March 15 that cast doubt on the government’s official statistics regarding the pandemic.

9. Surveillance and contact tracing

Governments around the world are monitoring mobile phone location data and testing or rolling out new tracking apps to follow the spread of COVID-19, according to news reports. the surveillance could imperil source confidentiality. The systems are introduced with limited oversight, and could endure long after the pandemic.

“There’s always a concern that emergency situations create new baseline expectations for what kind of surveillance the government is authorized to conduct. We certainly saw this through 9-11, but I think the same issue is presented here,” said Carrie DeCell, a staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute in New York. “Actions that might be justified in that particular context certainly would not be justified once governments get a handle on this pandemic and once the crisis subsides somewhere in the near future.”

Telecom companies in Italy, Germany, and Austria are turning over location data to public health officials, though aggregated and anonymized; governments in South Korea and South Africa are monitoring individual cell phone locations, and Israel authorized security agents to access location and other data from millions of mobile phone users.

10. Emergency Measures

Authoritarian rulers can take an opportunistic approach to emergency measures that criminalize or restrict newsgathering activities, as CPJ has documented previously.

Hungary’s parliament on March 30 approved a set of emergency laws enabling Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree.

Thailand introduced on March 26 a state of emergency that allows the government to “correct” reports it considers incorrect and allows for charges against journalists under the Computer Crimes Act, which carries five-year prison penalties for violations.

With many countries still under states of emergency that grant authorities power to rule by decree — and the virus only beginning to take hold in some developing countries – even more restrictions could be on the way.

Gov . Andrew Cuomo referred to the method as `` splitting '' and said it involves adding a second set of tubes to a ventilator .
`` It 's not ideal , '' Cuomo said on Thursday , `` but we believe it 's workable . ''

Wednesday , the state had 4,000 ventilators in hospitals and another 4,000 on the way from the federal government . New York has also purchased 7,000 ventilators and is `` still shopping , '' the governor said .
The ventilators are the `` difference between life and death for thousands of New Yorkers , '' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said .
In San Francisco , Mayor London Breed said her city could see a surge in cases similar to that seen in New York City .
She estimated San Francisco could need as many as 1,500 more ventilators and 5,000 more hospital beds .
`` If people who are out on the streets continue to congregate with one another , continue to interact with one another which increases the spread of this virus , we will not have enough beds , enough ICU units , enough ventilators to support the people that we know are going to need them , '' Breed said .

Georgia and Florida do not have statewide rules , but Atlanta enacted its own stay-at-home order , and Miami announced a nighttime curfew .
In Chicago , Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Thursday that bike trails , paths and green spaces will be closed after crowds were spotted on the city 's lakefront .
`` Congregating on our lakefront , to be blunt , is going to create a risk that is unacceptable and could lead to death , '' Lightfoot said . `` Dear God , stay home , save lives . ''
The decision comes after Interim Chicago Police Superintendent Charlie Beck said police will start issuing citations Thursday to residents who do not follow rules around social distancing and staying at home .
Breaking the orders is a misdemeanor punishable by a citation with a fine of up to $ 500 , Beck said . If violation continues , it could result in physical arrest .
New York state has restricted nonessential business and gatherings . Residents are asked to limit outdoor activities to non-contact activities .
Civil fines will be issued to non-compliant businesses , but not to individuals , Cuomo said .
In Los Angeles , Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city also will be enforcing restrictions against non-essential businesses that are staying open .
But Los Angeles police will not stop people for exercising and leaving their homes , Garcetti said .
The widespread shutdown of businesses to try to control the outbreak has led to a record number of Americans filing for their first week of unemployment benefits .
About 3.3 million Americans filed for initial jobless claims during the week that ended Saturday , according to newly released Department of Labor statistics .
That 's the highest number of initial jobless claims since the Department of Labor started tracking the data in 1967 . The previous high was 695,000 claims filed in the week ending October 2 , 1982 .
Last week 's jump marked a massive increase from a revised 282,000 claims in the prior week .

`` We are going to be living with this , in one form or another , for 12 to 18 months if we are lucky , '' said Dr. Ashish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute .

`` Once we have a vaccine that 's effective and widely deployed , we can bring the pandemic to an end , '' Jha said . `` Until that time , we are going to continue to have to confront and deal with the virus .

As of Thursday, more than half of US coronavirus cases were in New York state, with more than 37,000, according to CNN's tally of cases reported by state health officials nationwide.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo referred to the method as ""splitting"" and said it involves adding a second set of tubes to a ventilator.

""It's not ideal,"" Cuomo said on Thursday, ""but we believe it's workable.""

New York hospitals need about 30,000 ventilators and have enough personal protection equipment for only the next two weeks, the governor has said.

Wednesday, the state had 4,000 ventilators in hospitals and another 4,000 on the way from the federal government. New York has also purchased 7,000 ventilators and is ""still shopping,"" the governor said.

The ventilators are the ""difference between life and death for thousands of New Yorkers,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

In San Francisco, Mayor London Breed said her city could see a surge in cases similar to that seen in New York City.

She estimated San Francisco could need as many as 1,500 more ventilators and 5,000 more hospital beds.

""If people who are out on the streets continue to congregate with one another, continue to interact with one another which increases the spread of this virus, we will not have enough beds, enough ICU units, enough ventilators to support the people that we know are going to need them,"" Breed said.

'Dear God, stay home, save lives'

Across the country, 21 states have issued stay-at-home orders , with some not going into effect until the end of the week.

Georgia and Florida do not have statewide rules, but Atlanta enacted its own stay-at-home order, and Miami announced a nighttime curfew.

In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Thursday that bike trails, paths and green spaces will be closed after crowds were spotted on the city's lakefront.

""Congregating on our lakefront, to be blunt, is going to create a risk that is unacceptable and could lead to death,"" Lightfoot said. ""Dear God, stay home, save lives.""

The decision comes after Interim Chicago Police Superintendent Charlie Beck said police will start issuing citations Thursday to residents who do not follow rules around social distancing and staying at home.

Breaking the orders is a misdemeanor punishable by a citation with a fine of up to $500, Beck said. If violation continues, it could result in physical arrest.

New York state has restricted nonessential business and gatherings. Residents are asked to limit outdoor activities to non-contact activities.

Civil fines will be issued to non-compliant businesses, but not to individuals, Cuomo said.

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city also will be enforcing restrictions against non-essential businesses that are staying open.

But Los Angeles police will not stop people for exercising and leaving their homes, Garcetti said.

Record-setting unemployment claims

The widespread shutdown of businesses to try to control the outbreak has led to a record number of Americans filing for their first week of unemployment benefits.

About 3.3 million Americans filed for initial jobless claims during the week that ended Saturday, according to newly released Department of Labor statistics.

That's the highest number of initial jobless claims since the Department of Labor started tracking the data in 1967. The previous high was 695,000 claims filed in the week ending October 2, 1982.

Last week's jump marked a massive increase from a revised 282,000 claims in the prior week.

Outbreak could last 12 to 18 months -- if we're 'lucky'

Hopes that the outbreak could subside by summer might not be realistic, a Harvard doctor said Thursday.

""We are going to be living with this, in one form or another, for 12 to 18 months if we are lucky,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.

That time frame refers to how long health officials predict it will take to make a publicly available vaccine

""Once we have a vaccine that's effective and widely deployed, we can bring the pandemic to an end,"" Jha said. ""Until that time, we are going to continue to have to confront and deal with the virus.""",www.cnn.com,left,6krjh9HZ8vvPKKvf

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone wear some kind of face covering in public places , especially where social distancing is difficult to maintain . And health workers are donning additional coverings , such as gowns . Yet all such protective gear shares one significant problem : people still risk becoming infected with the novel coronavirus if they accidentally touch areas of the fabric that are contaminated with viral particles . So researchers are working to develop cloth that could inactivate or repel coronaviruses—ideally including the one that causes COVID-19—and other pathogens .
People can transfer infectious particles to their hands if they touch the front of a mask during use or when they remove gowns or other PPE , according to Chandan Sen , director of the Indiana Center for Regenerative Medicine and Engineering at Indiana University . He and his colleagues have been developing a way to render those particles and other infectious agents harmless . The team researches “ electroceutical ” materials that wirelessly “ generate electric fields across the surface of the fabric , ” Sen says . Those fields can disrupt the behavior of bacteria or viruses on the cloth .
“ The beauty of this [ technology ] is the inherently simple design , ” he says . The polyester material is printed with alternating spots of silver and zinc resembling polka dots . They are one to two millimeters wide and spaced one millimeter apart . When the electroceutical material is dry , it functions as an ordinary fabric . But if it gets dampened—say , with saliva , vapor from a coughed up droplet or other bodily fluids—ions in the liquid trigger an electrochemical reaction .

A clinical trial is underway to further evaluate the fabric ’ s effectiveness as a Food and Drug Administration–cleared dressing for wound care , Sen says .
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic , Sen ’ s team tested its existing material on a different coronavirus strain that causes a respiratory illness in pigs and on an unrelated type of pathogen called a lentivirus . “ We wanted to know how broadly this principle could be applicable , ” he says . In a study posted on the preprint server ChemRxiv in May , Sen ’ s team reported that its electroceutical fabric destabilized both viruses , leaving them unable to infect cells .

To study the fabric ’ s action , they placed a liquid solution containing viral particles onto the electroceutical fabric and a polyester control fabric without the metal dots .

Karp , who was not involved with the study , adds that the researchers did not test all of the virus that they had placed on the cloth . “ In fact , the majority of virus was not recovered from the textiles examined in this study , ” he says . Sen responds that his team focused on sampling only enough viral particles to show that the fabric had rendered them unable to infect cells . The researchers recovered roughly 44 percent of the particles from the electroceutical fabric samples that had rested for one minute . And they retrieved 24 percent of them from the samples that had rested for five minutes .
The material ’ s virus-fighting abilities have not been tested specifically on SARS-CoV-2 , the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 . The researchers ’ findings with the two viruses they studied , however , gave them “ hope that this could apply more widely , ” Sen says . He adds that large-scale manufacturing of the electroceutical fabric is already possible and that the costs of producing it are relatively low .

Metal dots are not the only potential approach . Paul Leu , director of an advanced materials laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh , and his colleagues are developing a textile coating that repels bodily fluids , proteins and bacteria .

At the outset , the freedom of speech of whistleblowers—such as since-deceased Dr. Li Wenliang and others like him—was denied.REF Citizen journalists documenting events in Wuhan were forcibly disappeared , and in many cases , have not reappeared since.REF And , Chinese citizens were prevented from forming a robust civil society response to the outbreak.REF
Article 35 of the Chinese constitutionREF guarantees freedom of speech , and the CCP affirmed its commitment to uphold and protect those rights by signing the United Nation ’ s Universal Declaration of Human Rights , a document the CCP helped to craft.REF The CCP ’ s response to the novel coronavirus flies in the face of those commitments .
The CCP ’ s repressive activities do not stop with the individual . They extend to the collective . Studies now suggest that the CCP grossly underreported the number of COVID-19 infections as well as the death rate in China .
The coronavirus outbreak revealed that what the Chinese government does internally—restricting fundamental freedoms and fudging statistics—is not just an internal matter . Silencing those with information and downplaying the rate of infection made the rest of the world less prepared to combat their own domestic outbreaks of the virus .
As a result , there is now interest from the international community in taking measures to hold the CCP accountable . The U.S. should lead the way . It should press the international community to coalesce around pursing an international investigation into the CCP ’ s mishandling of the COVID-19 outbreak . And , in partnership with like-minded countries , the U.S. should press the CCP to respect civil society and individual liberties that can help prevent future catastrophes .
The Chinese government ’ s mishandling of the response to the coronavirus outbreak reveals the fragility of the CCP . The CCP has long prized internal stability as a top domestic and foreign policy priority.REF It sees pandemics , such as SARS and COVID-19 , as threatening to that stability and , as such , has instituted policies that isolate and prioritize the containment of any political impact on the CCP .
The decision to do so means that any success—and conversely , any failure—is attributable to the CCP . In an attempt to be seen as the hero of the COVID-19 response , China has made the very individuals and entities it hoped to protect more vulnerable to international scrutiny .
The following events leading up to and during the CCP ’ s response demonstrate the need for the international community to pursue accountability measures , not only to ensure a better ongoing response in the midst of COVID-19 , but to ensure a better response to future outbreaks :
Misreporting the rate of infection , number of deaths , and transmissibility of COVID-19 . The Chinese government is notorious for distorting many figures , including on economic growth , household income , and now facts on pandemics.REF Some of the discrepancies in the numbers reported on COVID-19 are understandable . One article noted that the Chinese government adjusted the way that it counted coronavirus cases based on an increasing understanding of symptoms of the virus—an experience shared by other countries attempting to measure COVID-19 cases and deaths.REF But the number of discrepancies can not be explained away by a revision in counting . The Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker ( reporting figures provided by the Chinese government ) lists only 84,000 cases of COVID-19 in China as of May 2020 , with the majority of infections in Wuhan , where the virus originated.REF However , one study conservatively estimates that China had at least 2.9 million and possibly as many as 4 million COVID-19 cases based on migration patterns , population size , and the known rate of infections in other countries.REF This is too wide a gap to be excused as a mere counting error . If the Chinese government misrepresented the rate of infection , it likely misrepresented the death rate , as well . Authorities in Wuhan adjusted the number of reported deaths from the original number of 1,290 to 3,869—a 50 percent increase in the death toll in Wuhan—which brought the total number of deaths in China to just over 4,500 by April 2020.REF Even with the adjustments , the death rate in China is likely much higher than reported.REF The Chinese government further misled the international community when it issued claims that human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was not possible despite seeing cases of human-to-human transmission.REF This assessment was parroted by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on Twitter.REF The decision to purposefully relay inaccurate information about the novel coronavirus to the WHO and the world undermines China ’ s already tarnished reputation as a responsible stakeholder . The CCP also suppressed vital information about health care workers infected with COVID-19 by patients , for example , and silenced doctors , such as Dr. Ai Fen , who provided insight into the disease.REF Decisions to obfuscate the very real and dangerous nature of the novel coronavirus meant that the world had less time to prepare and less visibility into the scope and scale of the threat posed by the new virus .
Silencing critics and arresting citizen journalists . The silencing of Dr. Li Wenliang will go down in the annals of history as symbolic of the consequences of the CCP ’ s repression . In December 2019 , Dr. Li sent a private WeChat message to other doctors , alerting them to the emergence of a highly infectious , pneumonia-like disease , now known as COVID-19.REF He was called in for questioning by Chinese authorities and forced to recant his statement . On February 7 , 2020 , Dr. Li died of the same disease about he had tried to warn Chinese citizens and the world.REF History was repeating itself . During the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak , cases were reported in early November and December 2002 , but the Chinese government did not make the public aware of the disease until February 2003—and the international community did not become aware of the extent of the disease until April 2003 , when a whistleblower , Dr. Jiang Yanyong , released a letter to international media revealing that six people had already died , and another 60 were infected with the virus.REF Some public health experts credit his open letter to the media with helping to prevent a pandemic . The Chinese government also sidelined various citizen journalists who tried to alert the public about COVID-19 . In some cases , citizen journalists , such as Fang Bin , Chen Qiushi , and Li Zehua , were the only individuals providing on-the-ground evidence for what was taking place in Wuhan.REF All three disappeared into “ quarantine. ” Only one of them , Li Zehua , has since re-emerged , and he says he was questioned and detained by Chinese authorities.REF The fate of the other citizen journalists remains unknown . One study from University of Southampton highlighted the impact of the Chinese government ’ s failure to report the nature of COVID-19 to the world sooner—a side effect of sidelining whistleblowers and citizen journalists . The study found that “ if interventions in the country could have been conducted one week , two weeks , or three weeks earlier , cases could have been reduced by 66 percent , 86 percent and 95 percent respectively—significantly limiting the geographical spread of the disease. ” REF
Sidelining civil society . The CCP ’ s decision to be the primary—and in many cases , the sole—provider of assistance during COVID-19 sidelined much-needed help from domestic and international civil society organizations . This goal was accomplished through pre-existing restrictions China has placed on domestic civil society through various onerous registration requirements . There are many examples of how religious organizations bear the brunt of the CCP ’ s restrictions , despite the immense value they add in coming to the aid of those in need in other humanitarian contexts across the globe.REF In other countries , religious organizations are often the first to arrive and the last to leave during humanitarian disasters , but in China , only a few faith-based organizations have the capacity to respond , due to the draconian restrictions put in place by the government . Most of the faith-based organizations in China , like Jinde Charities and Amity Corporations , are CCP-affiliated through their registration as patriotic religious associations.REF During COVID-19 , patriotic religious associations stepped in with financial assistance equivalent to more than $ 30 million.REF But after seven house churches in Beijing donated $ 10,000 in face masks and disinfectants to the people of Wuhan , police called their leaders in for questioning.REF This is emblematic of the obstacles religious organizations in China face . The CCP also places onerous restrictions on international nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) that substantially limited organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross from providing much-needed medical assistance , equipment , and expertise to the Chinese public in the midst of the pandemic.REF The CCP does so in order to favor CCP-affiliated organizations like the Chinese Red Cross , which , during COVID-19 , re-allocated medical supplies intended for the Chinese public to the party.REF In addition to restricting aid organizations ’ responses to COVID-19 , China has also restricted Chinese academics from pursuing research related to the origins of the novel coronavirus.REF A government directive intended to remain private , but posted on both Fudan University ’ s and China University of Geosciences ’ s websites , warned that any research on the origins of the coronavirus would be subject to heightened scrutiny by the State Council in China.REF This allegedly extended to any academic partners of these universities . Restrictions on academic freedom also hamper the ability of the international community to derive valuable lessons from how the disease spreads , and the implications of what happened in China for other countries currently battling an outbreak .
Diplomatic sidelining of critical international actors . The CCP exploited the problems generated from COVID-19 to achieve other political objectives—some of which arguably made it more difficult to combat the novel coronavirus within its own borders . As early as the first week of January , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) offered assistance to China , which Chinese authorities refused.REF The extent to which the Chinese government has granted access to the CDC today is unclear . Additionally , China has refused to grant access to the WHO , which wanted to launch an investigation into the origins of the disease.REF In addition to refusing help or granting only limited access to the CDC and the WHO , there is some evidence that China has used the outbreak as an additional means of sidelining Taiwan . During an interview with a Hong Kong media outlet , Bruce Aylward , a WHO assistant-director general , refused to discuss Taiwan , even going so far as to pretend to not hear the question from the reporter and eventually hanging up mid-interview.REF Both of the situations with the CDC and the WHO demonstrate how the CCP can manipulate other entities to restrict speech and solidify its own worldview .
There is significant appetite both in the executive and legislative branches in the U.S. to hold China accountable for both its gross negligence and its active disregard for the lives of the Chinese people and people around the globe when it comes to its handling of COVID-19 .
Representative John Curtis ( R–UT ) introduced the Li Wenliang Global Public Health Accountability Act of 2020 , which calls for financial sanctions and travel bans on individuals who intentionally conceal or distort information related to a public health crisis.REF A companion bill has been introduced by Senators Tom Cotton ( R–AK ) and Josh Hawley ( R–MO ) .REF The bills move from merely naming and shaming to levying direct consequences on individuals who hamper the response to pandemics or global health crises like China has done during COVID-19 .
Representative Chris Smith ( R–NJ ) called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to form a task force to identify and investigate individuals for sanctioning , and for purposes of accountability in response to China ’ s gross mishandling of COVID-19.REF Representative Smith also notes that it is possible to use pre-existing Global Magnitsky sanctions authorities to target individuals on the basis of human rights violations committed during the pandemic.REF
Other actors around the world have also expressed a desire to pursue investigations into China ’ s misconduct . Australia ’ s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called for an independent investigation , REF as did the European Union and individual countries , such as Germany and Sweden.REF With support coming from various corners of the world , there may be political will and momentum to form a level-headed , apolitical investigation into the CCP ’ s mishandling of COVID-19 .
There are many elements of the CCP ’ s response to COVID-19 that merit further investigation . And , beyond investigation , there are individuals and entities within the party ( and perhaps outside it ) who should be held accountable for their willful mishandling of COVID-19 . The international community should seize on the current momentum and political will to form a coalition to investigate and hold accountable individuals responsible for suppressing information and human rights during pandemic in ways that contributed to its spread .
An international investigative mechanism responsible for identifying individuals and entities in the Chinese government culpable for suppressing information , misleading the public , and repressing freedom during COVID-19 . Responsible stakeholders , like those already calling for an investigation , as well as others , such as Taiwan , should be a part of a broader effort to hold the Chinese government to account for its mishandling of the COVID-19 outbreak . Given its obvious usefulness to the exercise , a failure to include Taiwan would point to a disqualifying concern for Beijing ’ s sensitivities . This coalition could be formed in partnership with , but preferably not led by , the WHO . Any inquiry should investigate the facts and events pertinent to China ’ s response as well as identify and levy consequences against individuals and entities responsible for distorting information about COVID-19 in China .

Global Magnitsky sanctions authorities permit the U.S. Treasury Department to designate individuals on human rights and corruption grounds .

Silencing those with information and downplaying the rate of infection made the rest of the world less prepared to combat their own domestic outbreaks of the virus.

As a result, there is now interest from the international community in taking measures to hold the CCP accountable. The U.S. should lead the way. It should press the international community to coalesce around pursing an international investigation into the CCP’s mishandling of the COVID-19 outbreak. And, in partnership with like-minded countries, the U.S. should press the CCP to respect civil society and individual liberties that can help prevent future catastrophes.

How the Chinese Government Mishandled the Response

The Chinese government’s mishandling of the response to the coronavirus outbreak reveals the fragility of the CCP. The CCP has long prized internal stability as a top domestic and foreign policy priority.REF It sees pandemics, such as SARS and COVID-19, as threatening to that stability and, as such, has instituted policies that isolate and prioritize the containment of any political impact on the CCP.

The decision to do so means that any success—and conversely, any failure—is attributable to the CCP. In an attempt to be seen as the hero of the COVID-19 response, China has made the very individuals and entities it hoped to protect more vulnerable to international scrutiny.

The following events leading up to and during the CCP’s response demonstrate the need for the international community to pursue accountability measures, not only to ensure a better ongoing response in the midst of COVID-19, but to ensure a better response to future outbreaks:

Misreporting the rate of infection, number of deaths, and transmissibility of COVID-19. The Chinese government is notorious for distorting many figures, including on economic growth, household income, and now facts on pandemics.REF Some of the discrepancies in the numbers reported on COVID-19 are understandable. One article noted that the Chinese government adjusted the way that it counted coronavirus cases based on an increasing understanding of symptoms of the virus—an experience shared by other countries attempting to measure COVID-19 cases and deaths.REF But the number of discrepancies cannot be explained away by a revision in counting. The Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker (reporting figures provided by the Chinese government) lists only 84,000 cases of COVID-19 in China as of May 2020, with the majority of infections in Wuhan, where the virus originated.REF However, one study conservatively estimates that China had at least 2.9 million and possibly as many as 4 million COVID-19 cases based on migration patterns, population size, and the known rate of infections in other countries.REF This is too wide a gap to be excused as a mere counting error. If the Chinese government misrepresented the rate of infection, it likely misrepresented the death rate, as well. Authorities in Wuhan adjusted the number of reported deaths from the original number of 1,290 to 3,869—a 50 percent increase in the death toll in Wuhan—which brought the total number of deaths in China to just over 4,500 by April 2020.REF Even with the adjustments, the death rate in China is likely much higher than reported.REF The Chinese government further misled the international community when it issued claims that human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was not possible despite seeing cases of human-to-human transmission.REF This assessment was parroted by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Twitter.REF The decision to purposefully relay inaccurate information about the novel coronavirus to the WHO and the world undermines China’s already tarnished reputation as a responsible stakeholder. The CCP also suppressed vital information about health care workers infected with COVID-19 by patients, for example, and silenced doctors, such as Dr. Ai Fen, who provided insight into the disease.REF Decisions to obfuscate the very real and dangerous nature of the novel coronavirus meant that the world had less time to prepare and less visibility into the scope and scale of the threat posed by the new virus.

Silencing critics and arresting citizen journalists. The silencing of Dr. Li Wenliang will go down in the annals of history as symbolic of the consequences of the CCP’s repression. In December 2019, Dr. Li sent a private WeChat message to other doctors, alerting them to the emergence of a highly infectious, pneumonia-like disease, now known as COVID-19.REF He was called in for questioning by Chinese authorities and forced to recant his statement. On February 7, 2020, Dr. Li died of the same disease about he had tried to warn Chinese citizens and the world.REF History was repeating itself. During the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak, cases were reported in early November and December 2002, but the Chinese government did not make the public aware of the disease until February 2003—and the international community did not become aware of the extent of the disease until April 2003, when a whistleblower, Dr. Jiang Yanyong, released a letter to international media revealing that six people had already died, and another 60 were infected with the virus.REF Some public health experts credit his open letter to the media with helping to prevent a pandemic. The Chinese government also sidelined various citizen journalists who tried to alert the public about COVID-19. In some cases, citizen journalists, such as Fang Bin, Chen Qiushi, and Li Zehua, were the only individuals providing on-the-ground evidence for what was taking place in Wuhan.REF All three disappeared into “quarantine.” Only one of them, Li Zehua, has since re-emerged, and he says he was questioned and detained by Chinese authorities.REF The fate of the other citizen journalists remains unknown. One study from University of Southampton highlighted the impact of the Chinese government’s failure to report the nature of COVID-19 to the world sooner—a side effect of sidelining whistleblowers and citizen journalists. The study found that “if interventions in the country could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier, cases could have been reduced by 66 percent, 86 percent and 95 percent respectively—significantly limiting the geographical spread of the disease.”REF

Sidelining civil society. The CCP’s decision to be the primary—and in many cases, the sole—provider of assistance during COVID-19 sidelined much-needed help from domestic and international civil society organizations. This goal was accomplished through pre-existing restrictions China has placed on domestic civil society through various onerous registration requirements. There are many examples of how religious organizations bear the brunt of the CCP’s restrictions, despite the immense value they add in coming to the aid of those in need in other humanitarian contexts across the globe.REF In other countries, religious organizations are often the first to arrive and the last to leave during humanitarian disasters, but in China, only a few faith-based organizations have the capacity to respond, due to the draconian restrictions put in place by the government. Most of the faith-based organizations in China, like Jinde Charities and Amity Corporations, are CCP-affiliated through their registration as patriotic religious associations.REF During COVID-19, patriotic religious associations stepped in with financial assistance equivalent to more than $30 million.REF But after seven house churches in Beijing donated $10,000 in face masks and disinfectants to the people of Wuhan, police called their leaders in for questioning.REF This is emblematic of the obstacles religious organizations in China face. The CCP also places onerous restrictions on international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that substantially limited organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross from providing much-needed medical assistance, equipment, and expertise to the Chinese public in the midst of the pandemic.REF The CCP does so in order to favor CCP-affiliated organizations like the Chinese Red Cross, which, during COVID-19, re-allocated medical supplies intended for the Chinese public to the party.REF In addition to restricting aid organizations’ responses to COVID-19, China has also restricted Chinese academics from pursuing research related to the origins of the novel coronavirus.REF A government directive intended to remain private, but posted on both Fudan University’s and China University of Geosciences’s websites, warned that any research on the origins of the coronavirus would be subject to heightened scrutiny by the State Council in China.REF This allegedly extended to any academic partners of these universities. Restrictions on academic freedom also hamper the ability of the international community to derive valuable lessons from how the disease spreads, and the implications of what happened in China for other countries currently battling an outbreak.

Diplomatic sidelining of critical international actors. The CCP exploited the problems generated from COVID-19 to achieve other political objectives—some of which arguably made it more difficult to combat the novel coronavirus within its own borders. As early as the first week of January, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offered assistance to China, which Chinese authorities refused.REF The extent to which the Chinese government has granted access to the CDC today is unclear. Additionally, China has refused to grant access to the WHO, which wanted to launch an investigation into the origins of the disease.REF In addition to refusing help or granting only limited access to the CDC and the WHO, there is some evidence that China has used the outbreak as an additional means of sidelining Taiwan. During an interview with a Hong Kong media outlet, Bruce Aylward, a WHO assistant-director general, refused to discuss Taiwan, even going so far as to pretend to not hear the question from the reporter and eventually hanging up mid-interview.REF Both of the situations with the CDC and the WHO demonstrate how the CCP can manipulate other entities to restrict speech and solidify its own worldview.

U.S. Government Response to China’s Mishandling of COVID-19

There is significant appetite both in the executive and legislative branches in the U.S. to hold China accountable for both its gross negligence and its active disregard for the lives of the Chinese people and people around the globe when it comes to its handling of COVID-19.

Representative John Curtis (R–UT) introduced the Li Wenliang Global Public Health Accountability Act of 2020, which calls for financial sanctions and travel bans on individuals who intentionally conceal or distort information related to a public health crisis.REF A companion bill has been introduced by Senators Tom Cotton (R–AK) and Josh Hawley (R–MO).REF The bills move from merely naming and shaming to levying direct consequences on individuals who hamper the response to pandemics or global health crises like China has done during COVID-19.

Representative Chris Smith (R–NJ) called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to form a task force to identify and investigate individuals for sanctioning, and for purposes of accountability in response to China’s gross mishandling of COVID-19.REF Representative Smith also notes that it is possible to use pre-existing Global Magnitsky sanctions authorities to target individuals on the basis of human rights violations committed during the pandemic.REF

Other actors around the world have also expressed a desire to pursue investigations into China’s misconduct. Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called for an independent investigation,REF as did the European Union and individual countries, such as Germany and Sweden.REF With support coming from various corners of the world, there may be political will and momentum to form a level-headed, apolitical investigation into the CCP’s mishandling of COVID-19.

Next Steps to Hold China Accountable

There are many elements of the CCP’s response to COVID-19 that merit further investigation. And, beyond investigation, there are individuals and entities within the party (and perhaps outside it) who should be held accountable for their willful mishandling of COVID-19. The international community should seize on the current momentum and political will to form a coalition to investigate and hold accountable individuals responsible for suppressing information and human rights during pandemic in ways that contributed to its spread.

The U.S. should take the lead in pressing for:

An international investigative mechanism responsible for identifying individuals and entities in the Chinese government culpable for suppressing information, misleading the public, and repressing freedom during COVID-19. Responsible stakeholders, like those already calling for an investigation, as well as others, such as Taiwan, should be a part of a broader effort to hold the Chinese government to account for its mishandling of the COVID-19 outbreak. Given its obvious usefulness to the exercise, a failure to include Taiwan would point to a disqualifying concern for Beijing’s sensitivities. This coalition could be formed in partnership with, but preferably not led by, the WHO. Any inquiry should investigate the facts and events pertinent to China’s response as well as identify and levy consequences against individuals and entities responsible for distorting information about COVID-19 in China.

Sanctions on officials and entities under Global Magnitsky for their misconduct during COVID-19. The Chinese government continues to engage in severe restrictions on speech, association, and religious freedom in response to the coronavirus. Global Magnitsky sanctions authorities permit the U.S. Treasury Department to designate individuals on human rights and corruption grounds. REF Individuals involved in the disappearances of whistleblowers and citizen journalists, who put in place limits on freedom of speech and academic freedom may find themselves in the crosshairs of financial sanctions even in the midst of COVID-19.

There may be some officials in the CCP who engaged in no human rights violations or corruption who may be eligible for sanctioning (both financial sanctions and visa sanctions) for their responsibility in obfuscating and distorting facts about COVID-19. The U.S. government should either create new authorities or make use of pre-existing authorities to target them for the actions they took that exacerbated the scope of the pandemic globally.

The release of all political prisoners or persons who have disappeared during COVID-19, such as Fang Bin and Chen Qiushi. Under Xi Jinping, many individuals have been imprisoned. There are an estimated 2 million predominately Uighur Muslims held in political re-education facilities today. REF The Trump Administration has pressed for their release—but should use concerns related to COVID-19 disappearances to continue to raise concerns over the CCP’s practice of arbitrary detention and forced disappearances.

More specifically, the U.S. should press the Chinese government to lift the political requirements involved in NGO registration as mandated by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and Ministry of Public Security, including sponsorship by a government entity. REF The U.S. should also press China to eliminate the requirement that all faith-based NGOs register with a religious affairs bureau and be affiliated with one of the five patriotic religious associations, which are in essence an extension of the CCP.

Sign up here .
President Trump said Wednesday he could not confirm the veracity of the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths being reported by China , as he warned Americans to brace for more “ horrific ” days in dealing with the virus .
While Trump said the numbers being reported by Beijing “ seem to be a little on the light side , ” the president and National Security Adviser Robert C. O'Brien said they currently have no way to confirm the number of COVID-19 cases being reported by the Chinese government . The comments follow accusations from critics that China is underreporting its cases .
“ We are not in the position to confirm any of the numbers coming from China , ” O ’ Brien said during the daily White House coronavirus task force press briefing . “ We just have no way to confirm any of those numbers . ”
The president put it more bluntly : “ As far as the numbers , I ’ m not an accountant from China . ”
TRUMP ANNOUNCES ENHANCED NARCOTIC OPERATIONS AMID CORONAVIRUS , DEPLOYS DESTROYERS AND AIR FORCE ASSETS
Trump also reiterated his somber message from Tuesday 's briefing that the country is in for a hard time as it continues to battle the virus .
`` We are going to have a couple of weeks starting pretty much now but especially a few days from now that are going to be horrific , '' Trump said .
The White House announced on Tuesday the extension of the social distancing guidelines after Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and other public health officials on the White House coronavirus task force ominously warned that even if the U.S. were to continue to do what it was doing -- keeping the economy closed and most Americans in their homes -- the coronavirus could still leave 100,000 to 240,000 people in the United States dead and millions infected .
Without any measures in place to mitigate the contagion 's spread , those projections jump to between 1.5 and 2.2 million deaths from COVID-19 .
To slow the spread of the virus , Trump said his administration is weighing stopping domestic flights in the U.S. , although he he is reticent to do so given the economic impact and said if implemented it would only be from virus `` hot spots . '' He also advised faith leaders against violating stay-at-home orders and holding services amid reports of some churches holding gatherings .
“ If you do that you are really giving this invisible enemy a really big advantage , '' he said .
With the U.S. leading the world in the number of confirmed cases -- by almost 100,000 -- both public health officials and lawmakers in the United States have expressed skepticism about the numbers of coronavirus cases coming out of China -- fueled by official efforts to quash bad news in the early days and a general distrust of the government .

President Trump said Wednesday he could not confirm the veracity of the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths being reported by China, as he warned Americans to brace for more “horrific” days in dealing with the virus.

While Trump said the numbers being reported by Beijing “seem to be a little on the light side,” the president and National Security Adviser Robert C. O'Brien said they currently have no way to confirm the number of COVID-19 cases being reported by the Chinese government. The comments follow accusations from critics that China is underreporting its cases.

“We are not in the position to confirm any of the numbers coming from China,” O’Brien said during the daily White House coronavirus task force press briefing. “We just have no way to confirm any of those numbers.”

The president put it more bluntly: “As far as the numbers, I’m not an accountant from China.”

TRUMP ANNOUNCES ENHANCED NARCOTIC OPERATIONS AMID CORONAVIRUS, DEPLOYS DESTROYERS AND AIR FORCE ASSETS

Trump also reiterated his somber message from Tuesday's briefing that the country is in for a hard time as it continues to battle the virus.

""We are going to have a couple of weeks starting pretty much now but especially a few days from now that are going to be horrific,"" Trump said.

The White House announced on Tuesday the extension of the social distancing guidelines after Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other public health officials on the White House coronavirus task force ominously warned that even if the U.S. were to continue to do what it was doing -- keeping the economy closed and most Americans in their homes -- the coronavirus could still leave 100,000 to 240,000 people in the United States dead and millions infected.

Without any measures in place to mitigate the contagion's spread, those projections jump to between 1.5 and 2.2 million deaths from COVID-19.

To slow the spread of the virus, Trump said his administration is weighing stopping domestic flights in the U.S., although he he is reticent to do so given the economic impact and said if implemented it would only be from virus ""hot spots."" He also advised faith leaders against violating stay-at-home orders and holding services amid reports of some churches holding gatherings.

“If you do that you are really giving this invisible enemy a really big advantage,"" he said.

With the U.S. leading the world in the number of confirmed cases -- by almost 100,000 -- both public health officials and lawmakers in the United States have expressed skepticism about the numbers of coronavirus cases coming out of China -- fueled by official efforts to quash bad news in the early days and a general distrust of the government. Long lines of people waiting to collect the ashes of loved ones at funeral homes last week revived the debate.

The Democratic caucus denied unanimous consent to a bill floated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) that would have added the funds . Democrats then offered their own bill , which would have included not just $ 250 billion for small businesses but an additional $ 250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments—Republicans likewise objected .
The dispute comes as new data show unemployment claims surged by 6.6 million over the past week , with a total of over 17 million people now out of work because of the coronavirus shutdown . A passed bill would have infused billions into small businesses that preserved their payrolls—businesses that now face further uncertainty amid dispute in Congress .
`` Senate Democrats just blocked urgent money for a popular , bipartisan job-saving program which they themselves literally coauthored with us two weeks ago , '' McConnell wrote on Twitter . `` I complimented both sides and asked to increase the dollar amount without changing anything else . But they blocked it . ''
Had the Republicans ' proposal been approved , it would have allocated another $ 250 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) , a key plank of the $ 2 trillion coronavirus relief package passed two weeks ago . Originally allocating $ 350 billion in funding , the PPP offers loans to small businesses which would be forgiven if all employees are kept on the payroll for eight weeks and the money is used for wages , rent , mortgage interest , or utilities . The program aims to maintain the pre-crisis employment structure , an approach experts believe could facilitate a swift end to the recession when the crisis has passed .
The program has experienced tremendous demand despite initial uncertainty among large lenders about how to issue loans . Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin previously told lawmakers that as of Wednesday afternoon , the program had doled out $ 90 billion in loans , while Sen. Marco Rubio ( R. , Fla. ) , who chairs the Senate Small Business Committee , said the program was approving over $ 3 billion an hour .
This burn rate makes refilling the fund increasingly urgent—experts have estimated that businesses may need up to $ 1 trillion to replace expected revenues lost due to the nationwide shutdown . Democrats ' no vote on Thursday , Rubio wrote , does not reflect their opposition to the plan , but their desire for `` other things '' to be funded as well . McConnell told CNN that while he and his colleagues do not necessarily oppose additional assistance , the PPP is the only fund currently in danger of depletion .
Thursday 's vote is just the latest example of Democratic slow-walking during the ongoing crisis .

The deployment of temporary morgues across the city—known to emergency planners as Body Collection Points , or BCPs—marks a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic for New Yorkers , whose city has rapidly become the global center of the crisis . By late Monday , the state ’ s death toll had surpassed 1,200 , with more than 66,000 confirmed infections . More than 900 of the deaths were in New York City .
Until now , it had been largely possible for residents to shut out the worst of this calamity , retreat into their homes and only go out for short trips around the neighborhood , all without confronting anything more grim than empty streets and people wearing face masks .
The arrival of the morgues and makeshift hospitals—which have been installed in public spaces—has thrust the pandemic into full view as it envelops the nation ’ s largest city , making this escapism difficult . Anyone strolling through Central Park could observe a field hospital erected on the lawns to alleviate the patient load at hospitals like Wyckoff Heights . Another pop-up hospital has been set up at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan , and on Monday , the Navy ship Comfort docked in New York to take on more patients .

Why it matters : Iran has the largest coronavirus outbreak outside of China , with 3,513 confirmed cases and 107 deaths . But experts fear the real numbers are much higher , and that the government ’ s instinct to control information and prevent fear undermined hopes of containing it .
Flashback : When coronavirus reached Iran , apparently via a businessman traveling from China , top officials including President Hassan Rouhani insisted life would swiftly return to normal .
Quarantines were mocked , elections went ahead and medical workers were reportedly reprimanded for wearing masks — all in the name of preserving public calm .
Flash forward : The list of those infected now includes 23 members of parliament , a vice president and the deputy health minister .
A top adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei died of the virus , as did a former ambassador to the Vatican .
State of play : As pressure grew , the government belatedly took action .
Friday prayers were canceled across major cities for the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Schools are closed at least for the next two weeks , and public gatherings are discouraged . 54,000 prisoners have been released to avert contagion in Iran 's prison .
One plan under discussion would see some 300,000 militia members dispatched to test for the virus and disinfect homes , though experts caution that could spread the virus rather than containing it .
But , but , but : The holy city of Qom , the epicenter of the outbreak , remains open to pilgrims . Some have chosen to travel to shrines there — even “ licking the gold-plated lattice windows ” — to show their faith that god will protect them , the FT reports .
Medical workers contacted by the NY Times describe security agents inside hospitals warning employees not to discuss shortages of supplies or deaths from the virus .
One doctor based in the U.S. said colleagues in Iran had been forced to misreport causes of death for people who appeared to have coronavirus .
“ By turning this into a national security issue , they are putting more pressure and stress on doctors and medical teams and creating an environment of chaos and fear , ” a pathologist in Tehran said .
The big picture : No one knows how widely the coronavirus has spread in Iran , but based on data from hospitals in Tehran leaked to the Washington Post , epidemiologist Ashleigh Tuite estimated that there were now 28,000 cases .
Other estimates are lower , but still greatly exceed the official total .
U.S. sanctions are making it harder to access emergency medical supplies , Esfandyar Batmanghelidj and Abbas Kebriaeezadeh write in Foreign Policy .
The bottom line : “ The more the officials are scared of scaring people , the more the virus will spread and the country will be further paralyzed , ” a doctor in Khuzestan province told the FT .","Iran’s coronavirus outbreak has reached the upper echelons of power, and ordinary citizens fear that the information filtering down can’t be trusted.

Why it matters: Iran has the largest coronavirus outbreak outside of China, with 3,513 confirmed cases and 107 deaths. But experts fear the real numbers are much higher, and that the government’s instinct to control information and prevent fear undermined hopes of containing it.

Flashback: When coronavirus reached Iran, apparently via a businessman traveling from China, top officials including President Hassan Rouhani insisted life would swiftly return to normal.

Quarantines were mocked, elections went ahead and medical workers were reportedly reprimanded for wearing masks — all in the name of preserving public calm.

Flash forward: The list of those infected now includes 23 members of parliament, a vice president and the deputy health minister.

A top adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei died of the virus, as did a former ambassador to the Vatican.

State of play: As pressure grew, the government belatedly took action.

Friday prayers were canceled across major cities for the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Schools are closed at least for the next two weeks, and public gatherings are discouraged. 54,000 prisoners have been released to avert contagion in Iran's prison.

One plan under discussion would see some 300,000 militia members dispatched to test for the virus and disinfect homes, though experts caution that could spread the virus rather than containing it.

But, but, but: The holy city of Qom, the epicenter of the outbreak, remains open to pilgrims. Some have chosen to travel to shrines there — even “licking the gold-plated lattice windows” — to show their faith that god will protect them, the FT reports.

Information is still being tightly controlled.

Medical workers contacted by the NY Times describe security agents inside hospitals warning employees not to discuss shortages of supplies or deaths from the virus.

One doctor based in the U.S. said colleagues in Iran had been forced to misreport causes of death for people who appeared to have coronavirus.

“By turning this into a national security issue, they are putting more pressure and stress on doctors and medical teams and creating an environment of chaos and fear,” a pathologist in Tehran said.

The big picture: No one knows how widely the coronavirus has spread in Iran, but based on data from hospitals in Tehran leaked to the Washington Post, epidemiologist Ashleigh Tuite estimated that there were now 28,000 cases.

Other estimates are lower, but still greatly exceed the official total.

U.S. sanctions are making it harder to access emergency medical supplies, Esfandyar Batmanghelidj and Abbas Kebriaeezadeh write in Foreign Policy.

`` The CDC devolved into an agency incapable of adequately addressing the serious threat posed by infectious disease , particularly novel diseases for which there is little information about risk , spread , and treatment , '' says Michelle Minton , a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a free market think tank .

In addition to combating dangerous infectious diseases like HIV and malaria , the CDC now also studies alcohol and tobacco use , athletic injuries , traffic accidents , and gun violence .

They do , however , explain why the CDC 's budget has ballooned from $ 590 million in 1987 to more than $ 8 billion last year . If the agency had grown with inflation since 1987 , it would have a budget of about $ 1.3 billion today . Total federal spending , meanwhile , has grown from a hair over $ 1 trillion in 1987 to $ 4.4 trillion last year—which means that the CDC 's budget has grown faster the government 's overall spending .
Has all that extra funding made America safer ?

The CEI report notes that there are at least 10 other federally funded agencies—mostly within the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) —engaged in similar health and wellness research .
Instead of spending billions of dollars in recent years to duplicate work being done by other federal agencies , hindsight now suggests that the CDC should have spent more time and money researching emergent influenza-like infectious diseases , a project that received just $ 185 million in funding last year . This is a failure of priority-setting by both the CDC and Congress , which ultimately controls the purse strings .
Instead , the CDC was doing things like spending $ 1.75 million on the creation of a `` Hollywood liaison '' whose job was to help movies and TV shows write more accurate storylines about infectious diseases . A 2007 report published by the office of late Sen. Tom Coburn ( R–Okla . ) found that the CDC funded the position with money originally earmarked for combating bioterrorism and appointed a semi-retired employee to run the office . The same report calls out the CDC for lavish spending on a new headquarters and visitor center that opened in 2006 . The agency blew through more than $ 10 million in new office furniture and built a $ 200,000 fitness center and $ 30,000 sauna on site .
It would be one thing if the CDC was merely wasting money on saunas and duplicative research , but the agency has also been pushing agendas that were counterproductive to public health . In the months before the coronavirus pandemic hit , the CDC was on the front lines of a `` war on vaping '' that came in response to a brief panic over deaths caused by black market THC vape pens .
`` Even though it was clear early on that vaping-related lung injuries overwhelmingly involved black-market cannabis products , the CDC repeatedly intimated that legal , nicotine-delivering e-cigarettes might kill you , '' ███ 's Jacob Sullum reported in March . `` That message endangered public health by implying that people—teenagers as well as adults—would be better off smoking , which is demonstrably not true .

Two planes carrying hundreds of US citizens from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan have arrived in the US.

One plane landed at a US Air Force base in California and the other in Texas. Passengers will be isolated at military facilities for 14 days.

There were about 400 Americans on board the Diamond Princess. The ship, with some 3,700 passengers and crew, has been in quarantine since 3 February.

Meanwhile, China has reported 2,051 new cases in the past 24 hours.

Of those new cases, 94% were from Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.

More than 70,600 people across China have been infected by the virus, with 1,771 deaths. Most new cases and deaths have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei's largest city.

What will happen to the repatriated US passengers?

More than 300 passengers were repatriated voluntarily, the US state department said. Fourteen of them were reported during transit to have tested positive for the virus and were being kept separate from the other passengers, it said.

They will all undergo a 14-day quarantine, on top of the time they have already spent confined on the ship.

US officials later said 13 of the passengers thought to be ""high risk"" were sent on to a special facility at the University of Nebraska in Omaha.

At least 40 US citizens who were already showing symptoms prior to the evacuation were not allowed on the planes and would be treated in Japan, Dr Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told US broadcaster CBS.

What's happening on the Diamond Princess?

The cruise ship was put in quarantine in Japan's port of Yokohama after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus.

On Monday, Japanese officials said there were 99 new cases of infections on board the ship, bringing the total to 454 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China.

A Russian woman who was on board and tested positive is thought to be the first Russian national to contract the virus, Reuters news agency reports.

She will be taken to a hospital for treatment, the Russian embassy in Japan said.

To assist with relief efforts, Japan's government has given away 2,000 iPhones to passengers on the ship - one for each cabin.

The smartphones were distributed so people could use an app, created by Japan's health ministry, which links users with doctors, pharmacists and mental health counsellors. Phones registered outside of Japan are unable to access the app.

Other evacuation flights have been arranged to repatriate residents of Israel, Hong Kong and Canada. On Monday, Australia announced that it would evacuate 200 of its citizens too and the UK said it was considering organising an evacuation flight.

What is happening in China?

According to official figures for 16 February, 100 people died from the virus in Hubei, down from 139 on Saturday.

The Chinese authorities are tightening curbs on movement to combat the outbreak. People in Hubei province, which has 60 million people, have been ordered to stay at home, though they will be allowed to leave in an emergency.

In addition, a single person from each household will be allowed to leave the building or compound they live in every three days to buy food and essential items.

On housing estates, one entrance will be kept open. It will be guarded to ensure that only residents can enter or leave.

All businesses will stay closed, except chemists, hotels, food shops and medical services.

There will be a ban on the use of private cars, but vehicles used for the delivery of essential goods are exempt.

In the Chinese capital, Beijing, authorities have ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment.

China's central bank will also disinfect and store used banknotes before recirculating them in a bid to stop the virus spreading.

New cases spiked last week after a change in the way they were counted, but have been falling since.

National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the figures showed China was managing to curb the outbreak.

Taiwan has reported a death from the illness - a taxi driver, 61, who had not travelled abroad recently but had diabetes and hepatitis B, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said.

The minister said many of his passengers had come from China.

Outside China, there have been more than 600 cases in nearly 30 countries. Four others have died outside mainland China - in France, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.

The virus is a new strain of coronavirus and causes an acute respiratory disease which has been named Covid-19.

The news and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings .
For Sarah Bowen , it all started with a sore throat . Not the kind of searing pain she ’ d feel with strep , she said , but a throat irritation that just didn ’ t feel right .
“ By the end of the day , it just got a little worse and I didn ’ t feel great . I felt like I might be coming down with something . And the next day , things got worse , ” Bowen , 31 , of Portland , Oregon , said .
Bowen works at a doctor ’ s office , where she was immediately able to get tested for COVID-19 , on May 8 . It came back negative , and her doctor said the symptoms were most likely allergies or another virus .
But from there , things snowballed . Bowen developed headaches , a stuffy nose , hot flash symptoms and constant headaches . By day six , she felt like she was hit by a truck . She had extreme fatigue and a burning sensation in her chest .
“ I started getting shortness of breath if I went upstairs to get water or something , ” Bowen said . “ It got worse when I moved around . ”
Two days later , she took another test for COVID . Again , it came back negative .
But despite her symptoms , her doctor didn ’ t believe she had the virus , because there weren ’ t many cases in the Portland suburb where she lives . Frustrated , Bowen continued to isolate alone in the downstairs of her home . She didn ’ t want to take any chances .
“ It ’ s one thing to get sick and know it ’ s a cold or the flu . But to get sick during a pandemic and to be kind of dismissed , makes you feel crazy , ” she said .
Bowen ’ s diagnosis remains unclear , but her experience raises questions about the accuracy of diagnostic tests for the disease . Indeed , as more and more people have access to testing , new data show that false negatives on COVID-19 tests may be more common than first realized .
And as the U.S. starts to reopen , accurate testing is one of the most important tools in states ' arsenals to track — and stop — the spread of the coronavirus .
Since the pandemic started spreading across the United States in March , nearly 70 tests have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration . Many of these tests were developed at a breakneck pace in an effort to get tests out to the American people .
But while no test is perfect , experts told NBC News that these particular tests — used to diagnose COVID-19 — may be missing up to 20 percent of positive cases .
One key reason behind these so-called false negatives may be how the testing samples are collected .
“ The false negatives are mainly due to specimen acquisition , not the testing per se , ” said Dr. Alan Wells , medical director for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center clinical laboratories and a professor of pathology at the University of Pittsburgh .
Most tests use a method called polymerase chain reaction or PCR . It detects coronavirus genetic material that ’ s present when the virus is active . Clinicians typically collect a sample for testing from the back of a person ’ s throat — where the virus is presumed to be — with a long nasopharyngeal swab .

But scientists say that collection method is ripe for error .
“ You ’ re sampling blindly . You ’ re hoping you get the right spot . Then as the disease progresses , the virus might migrate down into your lungs , ” Wells said , adding that once it ’ s in the lungs , that nasopharyngeal swab may not pick up any virus if it ’ s already been cleared from the throat .
“ You have to be at the right place at the right time , ” he said .
Another type of diagnostic test forgoes the uncomfortable swab altogether , and instead uses saliva collected in a test tube . Once the sample arrives in the lab , it ’ s tested the same way , with PCR .
“ The reason for pharyngeal swabs is the virus preferentially infects and replicates starting way back in the inner cavities of the nose and not out in front , ” where it may come into contact with saliva , he said , adding that saliva tests could end up missing up to 50 percent of asymptomatic positive cases .
Making things even more complicated , a May 13 study in Annals of Internal Medicine , from researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore , found that test timing is also essential to getting an accurate result .
Lead study author Dr. Lauren Kucirka , a medical resident at Johns Hopkins Medicine , said testing too early after exposure to the virus substantially raises the risk of a false negative .
“ If you have someone who has been exposed and they ’ ve started to develop symptoms , it probably makes sense to wait a few days before testing , ” Kucirka told NBC News .
Her study found that three days after the onset of symptoms is when the test is most likely valid .
But besides issues with how and when test samples are collected , questions are also being raised about the quality of the diagnostic tests themselves .
The biggest problem with that is you create a false sense of security .
In other words , even if samples are collected perfectly , at the ideal time , the tests could turn up incorrect results . A commentary published in April in Mayo Clinic Proceedings criticized the reliance on PCR tests , saying that even when tests are 90 percent accurate , that still leaves a substantial number of false test results .
The article ’ s co-author , Dr. Priya Sampathkumar , an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic , used California as an example in a statement : If the entire population of 40 million people were tested , there would be 2 million false negative results . Even if only 1 percent of the population was tested , there would be 20,000 false negatives .
“ The biggest problem with that is you create a false sense of security , ” Wells said .
Another type of COVID-19 diagnostic test , Abbott Labs ’ popular ID NOW point-of-care test , has also come under fire in recent weeks , after the FDA issued an alert that it may not always be accurate .
The test , which uses a method different from PCR , called isothermal nucleic acid amplification , can deliver results in five to 13 minutes . It ’ s used by doctors across the country and touted by the White House as what ’ s used to test President Donald Trump and other staffers .
One small study by NYU Langone Health found that the test returned false negatives for nearly 50 percent of certain samples that a rival test had found to be positive . The study has not yet been peer-reviewed .
In response , Abbott last week released interim data on several of its own studiesfinding that accuracy was significantly better , in some cases nearly 100 percent , especially when performed in patients who were tested early after their onset of symptoms .
But anecdotal reports have also found issues with accuracy , leading some of the nation ’ s largest medical centers to stop or never even start using it .
NBC News spoke with 10 medical centers and hospitals across the country ; seven said they weren ’ t using the Abbott test .
All seven cited issues with accuracy , including Jackson Memorial Hospital System in Miami , which said in a statement that they “ identified some issues with the accuracy , which is to be expected when the medical science is so new and evolving so quickly around this virus . The best fit for Jackson was to transition to other testing platforms that have high-quality accuracy rates and quick turnaround times for results . ”
A Vanderbilt University Medical Center spokesman told NBC News that “ No patient at Vanderbilt University Medical Center has been tested via the Abbott ID NOW rapid test . Here , there were concerns about the sensitivity of that test . ”
Some hospitals continuing to use the Abbott test , such as Sutter Health Hospitals in California , said they often will confirm any negative results with another PCR test if there is clinical suspicion of COVID-19 .
Abbott told NBC News in a statement that to date , the company has delivered more than 2 million tests to all 50 states .
`` Our customers are telling us that they ’ re seeing positivity rates from ID NOW testing at or above local community infection rates , which means that ID NOW is detecting the virus at the same level as lab-based testing , '' the statement said in part . `` If there were any systemic problem with ID NOW producing false negatives , that wouldn ’ t be the case . ''
The bigger issue may be that test manufacturers just haven ’ t caught up to science . It ’ s not just COVID-19 tests that have issues with accuracy . In fact , diagnostic tests for all sorts of common diseases are not even close to perfect .
Take rapid strep throat tests , for instance . According to a Cochrane Review , those tests have a sensitivity of just 86 percent . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says rapid flu tests are even worse , with a sensitivity ranging from 50 to 70 percent .
Rapid strep and rapid flu tests look for antigens — proteins made by the infectious pathogen — rather than genetic material . The first antigen test for COVID-19 received an emergency use authorization from the FDA earlier this month , but questions have already been raised about its accuracy .
Taken together , it ’ s why Dr. Ania Wajnberg , associate director of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , said that diagnostic tests need to be put together with clinical suspicion .
“ We still have a lot to learn , but testing itself is hugely important , ” Wajnberg said . “ If it ’ s not perfect , it doesn ’ t mean it ’ s not useful . ”","Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Accuracy issues

Since the pandemic started spreading across the United States in March, nearly 70 tests have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Many of these tests were developed at a breakneck pace in an effort to get tests out to the American people.

Not just PCR problems

Another type of COVID-19 diagnostic test, Abbott Labs’ popular ID NOW point-of-care test, has also come under fire in recent weeks, after the FDA issued an alert that it may not always be accurate.

The test, which uses a method different from PCR, called isothermal nucleic acid amplification, can deliver results in five to 13 minutes. It’s used by doctors across the country and touted by the White House as what’s used to test President Donald Trump and other staffers.

One small study by NYU Langone Health found that the test returned false negatives for nearly 50 percent of certain samples that a rival test had found to be positive. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.

In response, Abbott last week released interim data on several of its own studiesfinding that accuracy was significantly better, in some cases nearly 100 percent, especially when performed in patients who were tested early after their onset of symptoms.

But anecdotal reports have also found issues with accuracy, leading some of the nation’s largest medical centers to stop or never even start using it.

NBC News spoke with 10 medical centers and hospitals across the country; seven said they weren’t using the Abbott test.

All seven cited issues with accuracy, including Jackson Memorial Hospital System in Miami, which said in a statement that they “identified some issues with the accuracy, which is to be expected when the medical science is so new and evolving so quickly around this virus.

""Our customers are telling us that they’re seeing positivity rates from ID NOW testing at or above local community infection rates, which means that ID NOW is detecting the virus at the same level as lab-based testing,"" the statement said in part. ""If there were any systemic problem with ID NOW producing false negatives, that wouldn’t be the case.""

Catching up to science

The bigger issue may be that test manufacturers just haven’t caught up to science. It’s not just COVID-19 tests that have issues with accuracy. In fact, diagnostic tests for all sorts of common diseases are not even close to perfect.

Take rapid strep throat tests, for instance. According to a Cochrane Review, those tests have a sensitivity of just 86 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says rapid flu tests are even worse, with a sensitivity ranging from 50 to 70 percent.

Rapid strep and rapid flu tests look for antigens — proteins made by the infectious pathogen — rather than genetic material. The first antigen test for COVID-19 received an emergency use authorization from the FDA earlier this month, but questions have already been raised about its accuracy.

His staff says he is asymptomatic .
In a statement released on Sunday , Paul 's deputy chief of staff , Sergio Gor , wrote :
`` Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for COVID-19 . He is feeling fine and is in quarantine . He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events . He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person . He expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends and will continue to work for the people of Kentucky at this difficult time . Ten days ago , our D.C. office began operating remotely , hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Paul . ''
Paul , a physician , was one of eight Republican senators who voted against a coronavirus relief package last week , after the Senate opposed his efforts to offset spending on the legislation .
Paul 's staff explained his decision to get tested in a statement later on Sunday .
`` Similar to the President and the Vice President , Senator Rand Paul decided to get tested after attending an event where two individuals subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 , even though he was n't aware of any direct contact with either one of them , '' the statement read . `` Additionally , due to a prior lung injury , and subsequent surgery on his lung , Senator Paul is in a higher risk category as it relates to pulmonary issues .

His positive test comes amid continuing shortages of tests nationwide . As NPR 's Vanessa Romo reported on Saturday :
State and local government leaders have been putting pressure on the Trump administration and the coronavirus task force led by Vice President Mike Pence to address widespread testing shortages . In response , the administration has turned to the private sector to help develop tests , vaccines and therapeutic medicines to help stem the pandemic .
As of 5:30 p.m . ET Sunday , at least two Republican senators had announced they are self-quarantining after contact with Paul — Utah 's Mitt Romney and Mike Lee . Sens . Cory Gardner , R-Colo. , and Rick Scott , R-Fla. , were already in self-quarantine due to contact with others who tested positive for the virus . That leaves 48 Republicans in the Senate available to vote , which could affect legislation , as any measure would need either unanimous consent or 60 votes to pass a necessary procedural vote . As a reminder , Congress does not currently allow remote voting .","Sen. Rand Paul Has Tested Positive For The Coronavirus

""Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for COVID-19. He is feeling fine and is in quarantine. He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person. He expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends and will continue to work for the people of Kentucky at this difficult time. Ten days ago, our D.C. office began operating remotely, hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Paul.""

Paul, a physician, was one of eight Republican senators who voted against a coronavirus relief package last week, after the Senate opposed his efforts to offset spending on the legislation.

Paul's staff explained his decision to get tested in a statement later on Sunday.

""Similar to the President and the Vice President, Senator Rand Paul decided to get tested after attending an event where two individuals subsequently tested positive for COVID-19, even though he wasn't aware of any direct contact with either one of them,"" the statement read. ""Additionally, due to a prior lung injury, and subsequent surgery on his lung, Senator Paul is in a higher risk category as it relates to pulmonary issues.""

His positive test comes amid continuing shortages of tests nationwide. As NPR's Vanessa Romo reported on Saturday:

State and local government leaders have been putting pressure on the Trump administration and the coronavirus task force led by Vice President Mike Pence to address widespread testing shortages. In response, the administration has turned to the private sector to help develop tests, vaccines and therapeutic medicines to help stem the pandemic.

As of 5:30 p.m. ET Sunday, at least two Republican senators had announced they are self-quarantining after contact with Paul — Utah's Mitt Romney and Mike Lee. Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., were already in self-quarantine due to contact with others who tested positive for the virus. That leaves 48 Republicans in the Senate available to vote, which could affect legislation, as any measure would need either unanimous consent or 60 votes to pass a necessary procedural vote. As a reminder, Congress does not currently allow remote voting.",www.npr.org,center,CgkandgL3OTrxibo

( CNN ) The big lie of the Trump administration is that China is the cause of America 's problems . The meme has worked for a while , since it plays into American smugness that if China is succeeding , they must be cheating .
Trump and his right-wing allies upped this game recently by claiming the Covid-19 pandemic was the result of an accidental release from a Chinese laboratory and that China 's `` cover up '' blocked an effective global response .
Yet just this past Sunday , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asserted , `` There is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan . ''
Such charges by the Trump administration and by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas are reckless and dangerous . They could push the world to conflict just as the Bush Administration 's lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq pushed the US into war in 2003 .

The Army exposed McCarthy 's lies , and in immortal words , the Army 's lawyer Joseph Welch ended McCarthy 's career . `` Until this moment , Senator , I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness ... You have done enough . Have you no sense of decency ? ''
The right-wing charges against China made no sense . First , some on the US right charged that the coronavirus might have been a Chinese bio-weapon , a claim that was quickly shot down by scientists by analyzing the virus . Then they charged that the virus was accidentally released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology , with a subsequent cover-up . That too was illogical .
The virus was in circulation in Wuhan for weeks , and eventually killed thousands of Chinese people . In the confusion of the time , Wuhan authorities organized a major New Year 's event on January 18 that spread the virus . Why would the Chinese authorities have done that if they knew , and were covering up , a laboratory release from several weeks earlier ? The actual answer is almost surely that they were still in the fog of war against the new virus .
In fact , neither the biology nor chronology support the laboratory-release story . Biologists note that the Wuhan lab did not even have the Covid-19 virus under study . The virus is of a kind that originates in bats , but Covid-19 may have had an intermediate mammal host , perhaps one that was traded in the Wuhan live animal market implicated in a majority of the cases with onset before January 1 , 2020 . The Wuhan market was shut down on January 1 after the initial outbreak . Perhaps we will learn that the earliest human cases were not even in Wuhan at all and were brought to the Wuhan market by an infected individual traveling from Western China .
Aside from the claim of a laboratory release , the administration and the right-wing media also charge that China covered up the outbreak more generally for weeks . Yet consider the record . The doctors in Wuhan first noted unusual cases of viral pneumonia in mid-December . Wuhan health officials notified the World Health Organization office in China on December 31 . The China health agency called the US CDC on January 3 . The genome was fully sequenced and published online on January 11 , and Wuhan was locked down on January 23 .
Given the inevitable early confusion about a new disease that had never before been seen , that is a rapid timeline . Were there mistakes ? On December 30 , Dr. Li Wenliang sent fellow doctors a warning of a new an outbreak that resembled SARS . His brave warning was correct in essence even as the disease turned out to be a new one . Yet the Wuhan Public Security Bureau forced Dr. Li to sign a statement admitting to disturbing the public order .
Tragically , Dr. Li succumbed to the disease in February . In March he was exonerated by a national investigation . Also , the Chinese authorities waited until January 20 to declare definitively that the virus transmitted human to human . This too was a mistake , a tragic delay of several days that may have resulted from an incorrect and unrealistic hope that closing the Wuhan live animal markets would stop the disease , or from more general uncertainties , or a desire not to disrupt the start of the Chinese New Year .

But rather than acknowledging the general rapid timeline culminating in the shutdown on January 23 , Trump has played fast and loose with the facts , hitting at China at every turn . But that has been par for the course in Trump 's China bashing . For example , the administration has claimed repeatedly that Huawei and other high-tech Chinese companies are direct threats to US security , without providing any direct evidence . That 's why America 's closest allies such as the United Kingdom and Germany have gone in a different direction , continuing to do business with Huawei and to cooperate more generally with China .
The bottom line on the epidemic and Trump 's dismal failure is this . On December 31 , 2019 , China notified WHO . On January 23 , China locked down Wuhan . On January 30 , WHO declared a global public health emergency
As of January 30 , there was not yet one single Covid-19 death in the United States . The first is now thought to have occurred on February 6 .

The virus is of a kind that originates in bats, but Covid-19 may have had an intermediate mammal host, perhaps one that was traded in the Wuhan live animal market implicated in a majority of the cases with onset before January 1, 2020. The Wuhan market was shut down on January 1 after the initial outbreak. Perhaps we will learn that the earliest human cases were not even in Wuhan at all and were brought to the Wuhan market by an infected individual traveling from Western China.

Aside from the claim of a laboratory release, the administration and the right-wing media also charge that China covered up the outbreak more generally for weeks. Yet consider the record. The doctors in Wuhan first noted unusual cases of viral pneumonia in mid-December. Wuhan health officials notified the World Health Organization office in China on December 31. The China health agency called the US CDC on January 3. The genome was fully sequenced and published online on January 11, and Wuhan was locked down on January 23.

Given the inevitable early confusion about a new disease that had never before been seen, that is a rapid timeline. Were there mistakes? On December 30, Dr. Li Wenliang sent fellow doctors a warning of a new an outbreak that resembled SARS. His brave warning was correct in essence even as the disease turned out to be a new one. Yet the Wuhan Public Security Bureau forced Dr. Li to sign a statement admitting to disturbing the public order.

Tragically, Dr. Li succumbed to the disease in February. In March he was exonerated by a national investigation. Also, the Chinese authorities waited until January 20 to declare definitively that the virus transmitted human to human. This too was a mistake, a tragic delay of several days that may have resulted from an incorrect and unrealistic hope that closing the Wuhan live animal markets would stop the disease, or from more general uncertainties, or a desire not to disrupt the start of the Chinese New Year.

But rather than acknowledging the general rapid timeline culminating in the shutdown on January 23, Trump has played fast and loose with the facts, hitting at China at every turn. But that has been par for the course in Trump's China bashing. For example, the administration has claimed repeatedly that Huawei and other high-tech Chinese companies are direct threats to US security, without providing any direct evidence. That's why America's closest allies such as the United Kingdom and Germany have gone in a different direction, continuing to do business with Huawei and to cooperate more generally with China.

The bottom line on the epidemic and Trump's dismal failure is this. On December 31, 2019, China notified WHO. On January 23, China locked down Wuhan. On January 30, WHO declared a global public health emergency

As of January 30, there was not yet one single Covid-19 death in the United States. The first is now thought to have occurred on February 6.

There was plenty of warning, Messrs. Trump and Pompeo. To this moment, Americans have not fully gauged your recklessness. You have done enough. Have you no shame?",www.cnn.com,left,6FXTzAo8daKvWfNX

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to hold up federal funds for two election battleground states that are trying to make it easier and safer to vote during the coronavirus pandemic . He backed away from that threat but stuck with his unsupported claim that widespread voting by mail promotes “ a lot of illegality . ”
The president targeted Michigan with an inaccurate tweet on its voting plans and also went after Nevada in the latest — and the most confused — episode in his campaign against mail-in voting .
As states have shifted to remote voting , following health officials recommendations on safety , Trump has denigrated the practice and sought to limit access . He has said repeatedly , without evidence , that mailed ballots allow widespread fraud and has worried publicly that wide availability could lead so many people to vote that Republicans would lose in November . His GOP allies , meanwhile , have fought changes to voting in court and opposed funding to expand mail-in voting in Congress .
Wednesday marked the first time Trump has tried to use federal aid money to beat it back .
Trump began by going after Michigan , misstating Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson ’ s announcement that she would send applications for absentee ballots to every voter in the state . Though Republican secretaries of state have taken this step elsewhere , Trump pounced on the move in a state key to his reelection hopes .
“ Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election , ” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning . That brought strong criticism from Democrats in Michigan and elsewhere , pointing out that the state was sending applications , not actual ballots , an error the president corrected in a subsequent tweet six hours later . He stuck with the rest of his tweet : “ This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State . I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path ! ”
Trump later tweeted a similar threat to pull back funds from Nevada , which has sent ballots to voters for its June 9 state primary . A federal judge recently cleared Nevada ’ s decision to mail ballots , which were sent by the Republican secretary of state .
It was not clear exactly what funds Trump was referencing , but the states are paying for the voting changes with federal aid intended to support elections during the pandemic . By Wednesday evening , Trump told reporters he had spoken with Democratic Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer and did not think funding would have to be cut .
“ I don ’ t think it ’ s going to be necessary , ” he said , adding that he stood by his opposition to mail voting . “ Voting is an honor . It shouldn ’ t be something where they send you a pile of stuff and you send it back . ”
Trump himself has requested an absentee ballot to vote in Florida .
Trump ’ s tweets and statements came the day before he is slated to visit Michigan to tour Ford ’ s ventilator assembly plant in Ypsilanti . The state is one of three Rust Belt states that helped deliver his 2016 victory . In recent months , it has become a national hot spot for the coronavirus and watched its economy collapse , both factors contributing to what T rump ’ s advisers see as a shift toward Democrats .
The president ’ s comments appeared to reflect growing GOP concerns that Democrats ’ swift embrace of mail-in voting will give them an edge in November . Some key Democratic areas have moved to make it easier for voters to request ballots , while Republican areas have not . And even though Trump ’ s campaign encourages absentee voting , along with several state Republican Party officials , GOP voters , like Trump , have expressed growing skepticism .
Democrats noted Trump seems more concerned about mail-in voting in battleground states and has not threatened Republican-dominated states that are doing the same thing as Michigan . West Virginia Gov . Jim Justice , an ally of the president , noted Wednesday he ’ s concerned about Trump ’ s threats even though his administration approved mailing absentee ballot applications to all registered voters in the state .
“ I can ’ t imagine that the president is going to withhold funding in any way to West Virginia ; that ’ s not going to happen , ” Justice told reporters .
On Monday , before Trump ’ s Twitter threat , the Republican National Committee sought to clarify its position on vote by mail , arguing that the party opposes mailing ballots to every voter , as Nevada has done , but does not oppose mailing applications , as Michigan did .

coronavirus,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/3/18/21182063/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-social-distancing,This pandemic will expose who we are as a country,2020-03-18,Sean Illing,"As the coronavirus sweeps across the US , a term you ’ ve probably heard a lot is “ social distancing ” : a way to flatten the epidemic curve by asking people to stay home and limit their nonessential travel .
While social distancing is our best tool for slowing the spread of this virus , it ’ s also likely to create what my ███ colleague Ezra Klein has called a “ loneliness epidemic. ” In a fragmented society like ours , asking people to isolate themselves for an extended period will be hard on vulnerable populations , like older people and those with disabilities and existing medical conditions .
To reduce those effects , we ’ ll need what Eric Klinenberg , a sociologist at New York University , calls “ social solidarity. ” We ’ ll have to care about more than “ our own personal security , ” he wrote in a New York Times article . We ’ ll have to knock on our older neighbor ’ s door , call friends and loved ones , volunteer to deliver food to people who can ’ t leave their homes , and whatever else we can do to be of use to the people around us .
But the reality , Klinenberg says , is that American culture will make this kind of collective effort difficult . We live in a deeply individualistic society , and that way of thinking is corrosive to the cooperation we now need . Yet despite all that , Klinenberg believes there are many things you can do individually to make a significant difference .
I spoke to him by phone about how we can promote more solidarity in this tumultuous time , why the costs of social distancing are so high for marginalized populations , and why extreme situations like this one reveal deep truths about who we are as a country .
What happens to societies under sustained periods of “ social distancing ” ?
I don ’ t think we have a long track record of this , so it ’ s hard to say . We do know that there ’ s variation from society to society , state to state . As a sociologist , what I expect is that these extreme situations expose the essence of who we are and what we value .
If you have a society that holds the public good in high regard , and that has been bolstered by strong investments in public institutions , you reap real rewards in moments like this . But if you live in a society that doesn ’ t value the common good , that doesn ’ t have strong social bonds , then periods like this will be much harder for everyone .
If that ’ s right , the US is especially unprepared for this crisis . We ’ re politically divided , socially fragmented , and we live in a deeply individualistic culture — that seems like a nightmarish cocktail at a moment like this .
It is , and I ’ m really worried about it . When you see videos of 20-somethings dancing in crowded nightclubs across the country , that ’ s a sign that the urgent public health messaging about why it ’ s important to be physically distanced is not getting across . It ’ s a sign that people just don ’ t care about the consequences of their actions for others .
When you have politicians telling residents that if they ’ re healthy it ’ s fine to go out to restaurants , bars , to support their local businesses , that ’ s a problem . When you have the most popular cable news channel in the country raising questions about the scientific legitimacy of the crisis , and praising the bumbling leader as if he ’ s doing everything right , you ’ re sending a very confusing message to the public .
In the best-case scenario , a diverse and fragmented society would be a kind of testing ground where you could see which places operate best and then model their programs . But that ’ s not the situation we ’ re in . What we have is widespread confusion and dysfunction . That ’ s why I ’ m nervous .
Let ’ s set America ’ s cultural pathologies aside for a second and assume that , as things get more dire , more and more people will be practicing social distancing . Which population groups suffer the most under that kind of social isolation ?
Well , there ’ s different varieties of suffering , so I am concerned about poor people who are already living paycheck to paycheck , who are already on the edge , who are losing their jobs and not getting enough support to pay the bills , who will be unable to feed themselves and their children , and possibly worse . It ’ s incredibly serious .
And there are real health concerns for people who already live alone and are isolated , who really suffer from lack of social contact . We have a massive number of Americans who live alone and who are aging alone . Under ordinary circumstances , or under ordinary conditions , they can go out into public and find companionship in libraries , and senior centers , and parks , and other shared gathering places , but at a time like this , they ’ re at real risk of falling through the cracks .
I want to talk about what we can do to help those people , but first I ’ d love to know if we have a lot of data showing the impact of social distancing on marriages , on relationships , on mental health , or any other relevant indicators ?
I ’ m not aware of any solid data on this , but you could see it going either way . The best-case scenario is that families hunker down together , and come to appreciate that they have each other , and learn to cherish fundamental things that we take for granted too often .
The worse-case scenario is that couples are stuck together under periods of incredible stress and anxiety , and if they lack the skills and emotional resources to manage the intense feelings that they ’ ll have , you could see a lot of relationships fall apart .
So it ’ s an open question as to whether nine months from now we have a baby boom or a divorce spike .
Are there any other analogous experiences in the past that we can learn from right now ?
We ’ ve seen extreme social distancing responses in China , and we could certainly learn something from them , but we have to remember these are very different situations . There are much higher levels of surveillance in China and also much more compliance from the public . Their culture is much less individualistic than our culture . People don ’ t worship the market in the same way we do .
America also has a paucity of public programs . We have a weak public health system , weak public support for all kinds of caring activities , and we rely mostly on the marketplace and on ourselves . But now we ’ re at a moment where the market is failing and we ’ ve been made far weaker . We , as individuals and families , can only do so much when we ’ re on our own , so I think we ’ re bumping up against the limits of excessive American individualism and market society .
What you ’ re saying is true , and all of America ’ s cultural weaknesses are being exposed right now . But if we ’ re going to get through this , people are going to have to step up on their own and do their part . You say the only antidote to social distancing is “ social solidarity. ” Can you lay out your vision ?
Social solidarity is the strength we gain as a collective . It ’ s what happens when we recognize our interdependence and linked fate . When solidarity is stronger , we ’ re more likely to invest in each other ’ s well-being , to make individual sacrifices for the common good . We ’ re more equal , more just , more honest with ourselves and each other .
When social solidarity is low , we see runaway inequality . We see social atomization . We see disagreement over basic facts . We ’ re probably close to a record low in American solidarity right now . The country is bigger and more isolated than it ’ s ever been . And this is a social crisis on top of our public health crisis .
And yet it ’ s possible that this is the kind of shock event that changes our culture in profound ways . You ’ ve argued that crises can be “ switching points for states and societies. ” What does that mean ?
“ Social solidarity is the strength we gain as a collective . It ’ s what happens when we recognize our interdependence and linked fate . ”
It means there are some crises in which our convictions get tested . Ideology can fold more quickly than you think when your health and your life is on the line . Think about how many anti-vaxxers would walk away from a coronavirus vaccine right now — I suspect a lot of them would change their minds in a hurry .
So I ’ m not totally pessimistic about our situation . I think it ’ s moments like this that compel us to support one another in new ways . And already I ’ m seeing all kinds of small , local programs where people who want to help are finding new ways to do it , and that goes for everything from finding ways to make home meal deliveries to older people who feel too afraid to go outside , to culture and education programs for parents whose children are stuck at home .
I think a lot of people find it hard to embrace social solidarity while social distancing at the same time . How do you connect with people when you ’ re forced to self-isolate ?
Some of us will have to leave our houses some of the time . We have to get food . We have to get medicine . We have to go for walks , and move around , and so we ’ re going to need some people to do deliveries of food to older people , and people with underlying medical conditions , who really need to hunker down . And already there are local projects to set up new food delivery systems for those who can do it . It ’ s obviously not easy because there are risks involved , but there ’ s no way to get food from the grocery store or restaurant into someone else ’ s kitchen without some human effort .
I ’ m talking about small-scale solidarity , about what you can do as an individual to help people in your neighborhood , but there ’ s also larger acts of social solidarity , which involve making demands on the government to make paid sick leave mandatory during a crisis , or to provide additional Social Security payments or a universal basic income to everyone , at least during a crisis .
Cutting the interest rates to zero is not the only way that you can boost an economy in a moment like this , and so I think it would be an act of solidarity to push the policies that are better for ordinary people , too .
Any other recommendations for people who are reading this and want to engage constructively but don ’ t know how ?
I think it goes from the very basic , which is to pick up your phone and text or call the people in your life you ’ re concerned about , or just friends you haven ’ t spoken to for a while , to say hello and check in . There ’ s something profoundly affirming about staying connected in a moment like this , and showing some compassion .
And doing these things will boost your own mood . It feels good to be engaged , to care for other people . The basic sense of solidarity that comes from feeling like you ’ re in it together with other people . These are the moments to embrace that .
I ’ d also recommend calling homeless shelters in your neighborhood , and seeing if there ’ s anything they need , anything you can do . Find out who ’ s running the senior centers in your city or community , and see if they need assistance , or if they have programs to try to provide contact for older people who are isolated .
I have friends who are single , without children , who have started creating shared programming online for people who are stuck at home with children . I think there are a wide variety of things that we can do , and at times in our history the American capacity for civic imagination and innovation has been impressive .
Unfortunately , when we talk about innovation these days , we ’ re mainly talking about figuring out ways to make more money . I think this is a moment where we have to shift our priorities and put our minds to work on protecting each other .","As the coronavirus sweeps across the US, a term you’ve probably heard a lot is “social distancing”: a way to flatten the epidemic curve by asking people to stay home and limit their nonessential travel.

People are stepping up.

Sean Illing

I think a lot of people find it hard to embrace social solidarity while social distancing at the same time. How do you connect with people when you’re forced to self-isolate?

Eric Klinenberg

Some of us will have to leave our houses some of the time. We have to get food. We have to get medicine. We have to go for walks, and move around, and so we’re going to need some people to do deliveries of food to older people, and people with underlying medical conditions, who really need to hunker down. And already there are local projects to set up new food delivery systems for those who can do it. It’s obviously not easy because there are risks involved, but there’s no way to get food from the grocery store or restaurant into someone else’s kitchen without some human effort.

I’m talking about small-scale solidarity, about what you can do as an individual to help people in your neighborhood, but there’s also larger acts of social solidarity, which involve making demands on the government to make paid sick leave mandatory during a crisis, or to provide additional Social Security payments or a universal basic income to everyone, at least during a crisis.

Cutting the interest rates to zero is not the only way that you can boost an economy in a moment like this, and so I think it would be an act of solidarity to push the policies that are better for ordinary people, too.

Sean Illing

Any other recommendations for people who are reading this and want to engage constructively but don’t know how?

Eric Klinenberg

I think it goes from the very basic, which is to pick up your phone and text or call the people in your life you’re concerned about, or just friends you haven’t spoken to for a while, to say hello and check in. There’s something profoundly affirming about staying connected in a moment like this, and showing some compassion.

And doing these things will boost your own mood. It feels good to be engaged, to care for other people. The basic sense of solidarity that comes from feeling like you’re in it together with other people. These are the moments to embrace that.

I’d also recommend calling homeless shelters in your neighborhood, and seeing if there’s anything they need, anything you can do. Find out who’s running the senior centers in your city or community, and see if they need assistance, or if they have programs to try to provide contact for older people who are isolated.

I have friends who are single, without children, who have started creating shared programming online for people who are stuck at home with children. I think there are a wide variety of things that we can do, and at times in our history the American capacity for civic imagination and innovation has been impressive.

Unfortunately, when we talk about innovation these days, we’re mainly talking about figuring out ways to make more money. I think this is a moment where we have to shift our priorities and put our minds to work on protecting each other.",www.vox.com,left,TLa4xMbBTqRQVVzX

Trump suggested Monday that `` many people say '' that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the disease is patriotic , in a tweet using ambiguous language that hinted at his discomfort over the reversal . The grudging move followed weeks of the President politicizing and undermining government advice on face coverings . Once he shared a tweet mocking his Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing one .
Trump also promised he 'd return to front briefings on the government 's response to the crisis on television as early as Tuesday , after weeks of trying to distract from fast climbing infection rates and attacking the science-based advice of government officials . No members of the White House 's coronavirus task force -- including Drs . Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx -- are currently expected to join Trump 's Tuesday briefing , a person familiar with the plan told CNN , but cautioned that could change .
Five months into the worst domestic crisis since World War II , and after his disastrous call to open up states that had not yet purged the disease sparked a surge of infections , the President may finally be understanding that his performance during the pandemic will be decisive in November 's election . But his recent comments and the actions of his government also indicate a mostly cosmetic public relations attempt to convince the public he 's in charge rather than a complete rethink of strategy as the virus rages out of control .
Briefings will offer Trump a return to the television screens that he craves and likely not coincidentally will resume after he told supporters at the weekend that the worsening pandemic will keep him off the campaign trail for now .
His reversal on masks could be positive if it convinces conservatives who see covering up as an infringement of their freedoms to take a step that could slow the spread . But his delay in acting may have irrevocably damaged public trust in government health recommendations and contributed to the wildfire spread of the disease , especially in western and southern states .
The President is hardly leading here -- he 's following the example of many Republican governors wh o broke with him on masks as the virus pulverized their states . There 's also no guarantee that Trump 's higher profile on the disease will reverse his political slide since the last round of the Trump Covid show ended after his testy , meandering appearances degenerated into open musing of whethe r ingesting disinfectant could cure the virus — making him look absurdly ill-suited to handle the situation .
Several sources told CNN on Monday that aides , after seeing Trump 's polling slide ahead of November 's election , have spent considerable energy trying to convince him he needs to show leadership on the accelerating pandemic and to get ahead of the story .
Trump 's new briefings will be watched for signs that he is committed to leveling with the American people about the true nature of the challenge and that he 's learned from and acknowledged his mistakes and offers true leadership .
But he made clear Monday that his greatest concern was not rampant figures on new infections or a death toll of more than 140,000 Americans .
When he unveiled the comeback of his briefings in the Oval Office alongside Republican congressional leaders , it was as though it was Sweeps week when TV networks preview new seasons of their top shows .
`` We had very successful briefings . I was doing them , and we had a lot of people watching , record numbers watching . And in the history of cable television , television , there 's never been anything like it , '' Trump said .
The President implied that he would yet again paint a misleadingly positive vision of the pandemic , over-hyping good news on issues like treatments and vaccine developments rather than the discouraging reality of the situation . And as before , it seems likely that he will lay blame with others .
`` I will be discussing , as I call it , the China virus , the China plague , '' Trump said Monday .
The President 's decision to again make himself the face of the pandemic appears to represent a characteristic gut call that no one can present his case better than he can .
If the President can limit skepticism about his handling of the virus in suburban areas that he is currently targeting with a searing law-and-order message , it 's possible he could begin to improve his political fortunes . His reversal on masks comes amid increasing signs of frustration among Washington Republicans as Election Day approaches .
It follows a torrent of polling suggesting that Trump is at risk of a thumping loss to former Vice President Joe Biden in November 's election and that the public is despairing of his management of the virus as it marches across states like Texas , Florida and Arizona . In a Washington Post/ABC News poll at the weekend , Trump trailed the Democrat presumptive nominee by 20 points when voters were asked who would better handle the pandemic .
`` He just seems to have given up . He 's raised the white flag , '' Biden told a virtual fundraiser on Monday . `` Just ignoring the pandemic wo n't make it go away even though he thinks it . ''
There is little evidence of that the administration has actually decided to change the way it is fighting the pandemic .
In a contentious interview on Fox News Sunday , Trump repeated the untruth that the only reason the US is experiencing more cases is because it increased testing . The administration has clashed with Republican senators who want to fund a new testing and tracing scheme that could slow the spread of the virus .
Trump 's return to briefings also comes a week after White House officials sought to destroy the reputation of the government 's top infectious disease specialist , Fauci , who unlike the President has been telling the truth that new outbreaks are not embers but a raging nationwide inferno .
Fauci , however , appeared with Vice President Mike Pence on a coronavirus task force call with state governors and asked them to take recommended mitigation efforts to halt the spread of the disease .
Suspicions that Trump will simply use a new round briefings to perpetuate his lies and false narratives on the pandemic are bolstered by his fresh claims that the United States leads the world in terms of mortality rates . In reality , the US one of the highest death rates from the coronavirus . It does better than the United Kingdom , Spain and Sweden but fares worse than several badly hit countries like Brazil , Mexico and Russia , according to Johns Hopkins University data .
Perhaps the President will finally absorb such data and take a more serious approach . But the experience of his term so far suggests that he will vastly overstate optimistic data points -- he repeatedly predicted light at the end of the tunnel in his previous round of briefings , for instance . He also used the spotlight to promote what he billed as game changer treatments like hydroxychloroquine , which turned out to be ineffective against the virus .
Trump 's demand for a full time opening of all schools in the coming weeks also shows how he tends to put his own political interests ahead of scientific assessments and a perception of what might be in the national interests .
It is in many ways a repeat of his calamitous call for states to crank up their economies before the science supported the return of bars , restaurants and shopping , especially with many people following the President 's example and spurning the use of face coverings to avoid the spread of infection .
Despite Trump 's adamant calls for kids to go back to class , the administration has done none preparatory work that might convince parents and teachers that it is safe to do so even as the virus infects tens of thousands of people every day .
The consequences of no return to classes are grave , especially for poorer children whose only source of stability and nutrition often comes at school . Abuse at home is often first spotted by teachers . And online learning programs are in many school districts a poor substitute for school .
Sources have told CNN that the President believes that he can play on frustration with continued school closures among suburban voters so far spurning his reelection campaign .

In Georgia , Tammy Noboa has seized on her state 's blessing to open her hair salon after weeks of closure -- and she says deciding to do so was n't hard .
`` I have to work . I 've got bills to pay , '' said Noboa , who accepted seven appointments Saturday at her newly reopened Dominican Hair Salon in Douglasville .
Georgia is one of the states that allowed some businesses to reopen Friday , weeks after shutting them down to help prevent the spread of coronavirus .
More than 53,600 Covid-19 deaths have been reported in the US so far , with more than 200,000 deaths reported worldwide , according to Johns Hopkins University . The US has reported more than 938,600 cases of the disease .
Georgia businesses allowed to reopen include places where clients and workers get close : barber shops and hair salons , tattoo parlors , gyms and bowling alleys -- with some guidelines for social distancing and sanitation .
In Oklahoma , salons , barbershops , spas and pet groomers took appointments Friday , and some state parks and outdoor recreation areas also reopened .
The states ' moves run counter to the advice of experts who 've run a University of Washington model suggesting no state should reopen their economies before May 1 and many should wait longer .
Georgia should not begin to reopen until at least June 22 , according to those behind the model at the university 's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation .
In the Atlanta-area city of Brookhaven , Mayor John Ernst would rather nonessential businesses stay closed until his state proves it meets federal guidelines , calling for milestones like a 14-day downward trend in coronavirus cases .
`` Even the ( business owners ) who open up say , ' I do n't know if I 'm doing the right thing , '' Ernst said Saturday . `` ( Reopening ) needs to be an orderly process . ''
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms bluntly told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Friday evening that people should ignore the governor 's plan , saying , `` Stay home , nothing has changed . ''
Besides Georgia and Oklahoma , these states also are easing restrictions :
• Alaska allowed salons and restaurants to open in many areas Friday , though restaurants must keep distance between tables and ca n't exceed 25 % of their normal capacity .
Texas on Friday allowed retail stores to make curbside sales .
• Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer allowed some businesses -- landscapers , lawn-service companies , plant nurseries and bike repair shops -- to reopen Friday , subject to social-distancing rules .
• In Iowa , elective surgeries and farmers markets can reopen on Monday .
• In Tennessee , restaurants can reopen Monday at 50 % capacity . Retail stores may reopen Wednesday under the same guideline , state Gov . Bill Lee said .
Colorado , Minnesota and Montana also will ease restrictions in varying degrees in the coming week . And other governors are setting dates for when their reopening plans will kick into action .
Yet other leaders have stopped short of setting a timeline . In San Francisco , which issued the country 's first sweeping stay-at-home order in mid-March , Mayor London Breed said the order is `` very likely '' to be extended for a few more weeks past May 3 .
`` How we reopen is going to be important to ensuring that we do it responsibly so that we do n't go backwards , '' said Breed , who stressed the importance of having enough PPE , testing and requirements for social distancing .
Even some states without reopening plans have decisions to make : More than 10 have stay-at-home orders expiring by the end of next week , though they can be extended .
Some business owners in Georgia told CNN they felt wary of reopening , but they did so to pay their bills .
`` I 'm at the point where I have to do something ... I 'm about to lose my business if I do n't , '' said Tim Timmons , owner of Salon Gloss in Woodstock , on Friday .
Hairstylists and barbers in Georgia wore masks and gloves when people arrived for trims and hair colors Friday .
Timmons said he put measures in place to guard against the spread of the virus . The salon was n't running on full staff , and employees stood 14 feet apart . Customers had their temperatures taken when they arrived and were asked if they 've come into contact with anyone who 's had the virus .
But other owners said now was n't the time to reopen .
`` I said , 'No , absolutely not . Get your hair done for what ? ' '' Sabrina Watkins said of her hair salon in College Park , an Atlanta suburb . `` There 's a pandemic , people are dying . As much as I love the business , now is not the time , regardless of who says it is . ''
`` No way we 're opening back up , '' said Zeb Stevenson , chef at Atlanta restaurant Redbird . `` I do n't think it 's safe . If we reopened and then had to close back down again it would be a grave situation for the business . Better to wait it out and use science and common sense as a guide . ''
Lequawn James , an Atlanta nurse practitioner and bodybuilder , said Saturday he would not yet visit any reopened gyms .

He survived coronavirus after spending 10 days in intensive care . And he 's exercising , but alone , with equipment that he 's put into a rented storage unit .
He said he understands workers ' struggles . But he thinks it 's too soon to work at or exercise at places like gyms .
`` I know money is what people need to survive , but you may not be around to spend it if you contract this virus , '' he said .
At a bowling alley in Douglasville , a suburb east of Atlanta , Leon Perpignan was in line 10 minutes before it opened Friday at noon . Typically , he bowls four times a week , he said . About a dozen bowlers were there shortly after opening .
`` I know a lot of people disagree and say they should have waited , '' he said , `` but I was 100 % ready ( for this ) . ''
In Southern California , the social distancing challenge involved leisure , not business .
Crowds descended on Newport Beach as a heat wave hit the region , but most beachgoers appeared to be keeping their distance from each other , police and lifeguards said .
Surfer John Ton observed the crowd and said , `` I think people should stay home unless they 're surfing or exercising or something , and I think it 's weird people from out of the state or county are coming . ''
Beaches in Los Angeles and San Diego counties were closed this weekend , but other beaches were open .
Hawaii has relaxed beach restrictions , Gov . David Ige said during a Saturday news conference .
Beaches are now open for exercise like jogging , running or walking but people can not loiter on the beach and must maintain social distance , Ige said . Groups of two people or more are now allowed to fish for subsistence or commercial purposed , Ige said . A previous restriction was two or less .
Ige said Hawaii has seen a 98 % decrease in travelers arriving at airports since the 14-day quarantine rule was put in place .
No evidence yet on immunity from a 2nd infection , WHO warns
The World Health Organization is warning that it 's too early to say whether people who have had Covid-19 are necessarily immune from a second infection . It is urging governments to not yet issue any kind of `` immunity certificate '' to people who had the disease .
`` There is no evidence yet that people who have had Covid-19 will not get a second infection , '' the WHO said in a scientific brief Friday .
The WHO published the brief as guidance on how to adjust public health and social measures for the next phases of the Covid-19 response . The health agency said it is reviewing evidence on antibody responses to the novel coronavirus . The brief says `` most '' studies show that people who have `` recovered from infection have antibodies to the virus . ''
But as of Friday , no study has `` evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to ( the virus ) confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans , '' the WHO brief says .
The US Food and Drug Administration has now authorized three new coronavirus antibody tests , bringing the total number of FDA-authorized tests to seven .
The tests were approved under emergency-use authorizations , a lower regulatory standard used when the FDA believes a test 's benefits could outweigh any risks .
On Saturday , the CEO of a group helping lead the vaccine effort said it might be necessary to start manufacturing coronavirus vaccines even before they have been fully tested to see if they can protect people from infection .
Manufacturing could begin even while some of the Covid-19 vaccines are in the first phase of human clinical testing , which is designed to demonstrate only safety , said Dr. Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations .
This plan could cut time without cutting corners or sacrificing efficacy or safety , he said on a National Academy of Sciences Covid-19 Update webcast .","(CNN) A few states this weekend are running a tricky experiment: Trying to reopen certain businesses and services amid the coronavirus pandemic , even against the advice of some health experts who say it risks dangerously spiking the number of cases.

Georgia businesses allowed to reopen include places where clients and workers get close: barber shops and hair salons, tattoo parlors, gyms and bowling alleys -- with some guidelines for social distancing and sanitation.

In Oklahoma, salons, barbershops, spas and pet groomers took appointments Friday, and some state parks and outdoor recreation areas also reopened.

The states' moves run counter to the advice of experts who've run a University of Washington model suggesting no state should reopen their economies before May 1 and many should wait longer.

Georgia should not begin to reopen until at least June 22, according to those behind the model at the university's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

In the Atlanta-area city of Brookhaven, Mayor John Ernst would rather nonessential businesses stay closed until his state proves it meets federal guidelines , calling for milestones like a 14-day downward trend in coronavirus cases.

""Even the (business owners) who open up say, 'I don't know if I'm doing the right thing,"" Ernst said Saturday. ""(Reopening) needs to be an orderly process.""

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms bluntly told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday evening that people should ignore the governor's plan, saying, ""Stay home, nothing has changed.""

Georgia and Oklahoma aren't alone

Besides Georgia and Oklahoma, these states also are easing restrictions:

• Alaska allowed salons and restaurants to open in many areas Friday, though restaurants must keep distance between tables and can't exceed 25% of their normal capacity.

Texas on Friday allowed retail stores to make curbside sales.

• Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer allowed some businesses -- landscapers, lawn-service companies, plant nurseries and bike repair shops -- to reopen Friday, subject to social-distancing rules.

• In Iowa, elective surgeries and farmers markets can reopen on Monday.

• In Tennessee, restaurants can reopen Monday at 50% capacity. Retail stores may reopen Wednesday under the same guideline, state Gov. Bill Lee said.

Colorado, Minnesota and Montana also will ease restrictions in varying degrees in the coming week. And other governors are setting dates for when their reopening plans will kick into action.

Yet other leaders have stopped short of setting a timeline. In San Francisco, which issued the country's first sweeping stay-at-home order in mid-March, Mayor London Breed said the order is ""very likely"" to be extended for a few more weeks past May 3.

""How we reopen is going to be important to ensuring that we do it responsibly so that we don't go backwards,"" said Breed, who stressed the importance of having enough PPE, testing and requirements for social distancing.

Even some states without reopening plans have decisions to make: More than 10 have stay-at-home orders expiring by the end of next week , though they can be extended.

Business owners struggle with reopening decisions

Some business owners in Georgia told CNN they felt wary of reopening, but they did so to pay their bills.

""I'm at the point where I have to do something ... I'm about to lose my business if I don't,"" said Tim Timmons, owner of Salon Gloss in Woodstock, on Friday.

Hairstylists and barbers in Georgia wore masks and gloves when people arrived for trims and hair colors Friday.

Timmons said he put measures in place to guard against the spread of the virus. The salon wasn't running on full staff, and employees stood 14 feet apart. Customers had their temperatures taken when they arrived and were asked if they've come into contact with anyone who's had the virus.

But other owners said now wasn't the time to reopen.

""I said, 'No, absolutely not. Get your hair done for what?'"" Sabrina Watkins said of her hair salon in College Park, an Atlanta suburb. ""There's a pandemic, people are dying. As much as I love the business, now is not the time, regardless of who says it is.""

""No way we're opening back up,"" said Zeb Stevenson, chef at Atlanta restaurant Redbird. ""I don't think it's safe. If we reopened and then had to close back down again it would be a grave situation for the business. Better to wait it out and use science and common sense as a guide.""

Lequawn James, an Atlanta nurse practitioner and bodybuilder, said Saturday he would not yet visit any reopened gyms.

He survived coronavirus after spending 10 days in intensive care . And he's exercising, but alone, with equipment that he's put into a rented storage unit.

He said he understands workers' struggles. But he thinks it's too soon to work at or exercise at places like gyms.

""I know money is what people need to survive, but you may not be around to spend it if you contract this virus,"" he said.

At a bowling alley in Douglasville, a suburb east of Atlanta, Leon Perpignan was in line 10 minutes before it opened Friday at noon. Typically, he bowls four times a week, he said. About a dozen bowlers were there shortly after opening.

""I know a lot of people disagree and say they should have waited,"" he said, ""but I was 100% ready (for this).""

""Besides,"" he added, ""all my 'honey-do' lists are done.""

Southern California beaches are busy

In Southern California, the social distancing challenge involved leisure, not business.

Crowds descended on Newport Beach as a heat wave hit the region, but most beachgoers appeared to be keeping their distance from each other, police and lifeguards said.

Surfer John Ton observed the crowd and said, ""I think people should stay home unless they're surfing or exercising or something, and I think it's weird people from out of the state or county are coming.""

Beaches in Los Angeles and San Diego counties were closed this weekend, but other beaches were open.

Hawaii has relaxed beach restrictions, Gov. David Ige said during a Saturday news conference.

Beaches are now open for exercise like jogging, running or walking but people cannot loiter on the beach and must maintain social distance, Ige said. Groups of two people or more are now allowed to fish for subsistence or commercial purposed, Ige said. A previous restriction was two or less.

Ige said Hawaii has seen a 98% decrease in travelers arriving at airports since the 14-day quarantine rule was put in place.

No evidence yet on immunity from a 2nd infection, WHO warns

The World Health Organization is warning that it's too early to say whether people who have had Covid-19 are necessarily immune from a second infection. It is urging governments to not yet issue any kind of ""immunity certificate"" to people who had the disease.

""There is no evidence yet that people who have had Covid-19 will not get a second infection,"" the WHO said in a scientific brief Friday.

The WHO published the brief as guidance on how to adjust public health and social measures for the next phases of the Covid-19 response. The health agency said it is reviewing evidence on antibody responses to the novel coronavirus. The brief says ""most"" studies show that people who have ""recovered from infection have antibodies to the virus.""

But as of Friday, no study has ""evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to (the virus) confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans,"" the WHO brief says.

The US Food and Drug Administration has now authorized three new coronavirus antibody tests, bringing the total number of FDA-authorized tests to seven.

The tests were approved under emergency-use authorizations, a lower regulatory standard used when the FDA believes a test's benefits could outweigh any risks.

On Saturday, the CEO of a group helping lead the vaccine effort said it might be necessary to start manufacturing coronavirus vaccines even before they have been fully tested to see if they can protect people from infection.

Manufacturing could begin even while some of the Covid-19 vaccines are in the first phase of human clinical testing, which is designed to demonstrate only safety, said Dr. Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

This plan could cut time without cutting corners or sacrificing efficacy or safety, he said on a National Academy of Sciences Covid-19 Update webcast.",www.cnn.com,left,qKsa4AUbYg4pW1Go

Under Wyden ’ s plan , the federal boost to unemployment benefits would remain at $ 600 a week until a state ’ s three-month average total unemployment rate falls below 11 percent .
Weekly federal unemployment compensation would drop by $ 100 a week for each percentage point decline in a state ’ s joblessness , bottoming out at 6 percent .

""It's absolutely wrong and inappropriate to call this the Chinese coronavirus – I assume you would agree with that,"" asked Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., to which Redfield replied ""yes,"" adding the virus had spread through Iran, Italy, and South Korea as well.",www.usatoday.com,center,nKmNBidtVxFRTwmU

The state of Texas , which has implemented some of the most aggressive “ reopening ” strategies so far , experienced its largest single-day jump in reported coronavirus cases over the weekend . The state of Georgia , which was one of the first states to reopen , is such a mess that the state government was caught trying to mislead people about the direction cases are trending . The thing that experts predicted would happen as states reopen appears to be happening : People are getting sick . Ad Policy
That ’ s a terrifying problem , now that , as of yesterday , all 50 states have begun to lift their lockdowns . The pandemic isn ’ t “ over , ” but the country ’ s patience has apparently run out . People are willing to risk their lives to get their hair cut , and state governments have decided to let them . When reached for comment , Covid-19 took the form of Al Pacino and said : “ Vanity , definitely my favorite sin . ”
It ’ s tempting to conclude that the newly infected deserve their fate . There ’ s a video going around of people gathering on a beach in Galveston , Tex. , for “ Go Topless Jeep Weekend ” ( the lack of punctuation is important , I believe ) and I ’ m hard-pressed to find anybody in the video who should be allowed back into the gene pool . Watching these dispatches , there ’ s a hope that only the people who seem to be trying to get sick will get sick , that it ’ s their choice to be irrational , and , if that ’ s the case , that we should all be quiet while Darwin ’ s theory does its work .
Unfortunately , that ’ s not how our society works . That ’ s not how communicable diseases work . That ’ s not how any of this works . Cell phone data shows that the small groups of largely white confederates who have attended anti-lockdown protests spread themselves across hundreds of miles , even into neighboring states , within 48 hours of attending one of their Covid parties . And , of course , the people most likely to congregate in large groups without wearing a mask are also the people most likely to show up at your local grocery store or Costco without wearing a mask , sneeze on your potential purchases , and then amble off in search of more “ freedom ” while leaving sickness and death in their wake .
Quite simply : It ’ s the people who are most vocal about wanting the country to reopen who are making it too dangerous to reopen the country . It ’ s the people who are least concerned about their own health who are putting everybody else ’ s health at risk .
The only rational response to these people who refuse to abide by social distancing guidelines is for people who want to protect themselves to shelter in place even longer . At this point , even if the government provided widespread testing ( which it still has not ) and these people knew they had Covid , I wouldn ’ t trust them to stay inside . Society is only as strong as its weakest link , and right now our weakest links are showing themselves to be literal mouth breathers who can ’ t be bothered to cover their faces .
The problem is that the rational response is not available to everybody equally . For the most part , the people who want the stores and bars and beaches open are not the people who have to work at the stores and bars and beaches . The people who refuse to serve the greater good by wearing a mask demand service . Every time a business is badgered into opening , there ’ s a whole host of people who are pressed into service : not just the employees of that business but also the many folks who make up our whole societal support apparatus—police , sanitation workers , transit workers , parking valets . Scores of humans have to risk their health just so a Trump voter can drink unobstructed by a face mask until they puke into a trashcan . Current Issue View our current issue
If these people were serious about restoring economic activity for the workers in need of a paycheck , rather than just for their own personal enjoyment , then they ’ d be begging to wear a mask so that those workers could return to their jobs as safely as possible . They ’ d be begging to stay six feet apart to show that Americans can be trusted to look out for each other . If everybody could just be smart and follow the rules , we might be at a point where limited social engagement and economic activity could be possible without causing a dramatic spike in disease . People could take their tops off if they would just keep their masks on . We could go to the beach and even spend money if people would just use the giant ocean to maintain social distance . If we were smart and careful , we might not have to spend the summer completely alone and afraid .
We can ’ t have these nice things because we have too many selfish people spoiling it for everybody else . We can ’ t manage the crisis , because too many people have decided to be unmanageable . We are slowly beginning to understand how to protect ourselves from the virus . But we have no clue how to protect ourselves from the virulent people who insist on spreading the virus because they ’ ve determined they can live with other people dying . A person walking around without a mask isn ’ t telegraphing that they don ’ t care about their own life ; they ’ re shouting that they don ’ t care about yours . They ’ re willing to be the one who kills you , because they don ’ t value anybody ’ s life but their own .
The most aggressive reopeners know exactly whose lives they aren ’ t interested in protecting : black and brown people , old people , and working people . The Washington Post grabbed some quotes from giddy “ reopeners ” gathered in crowds without protective equipment outside a Georgia mall . The quotes are breathtaking examples of people saying the quiet part aloud :
“ I think you have to live life , ” said Jeff Lampel , taking a sip of beer . “ When you start seeing where the cases are coming from and the demographics—I ’ m not worried , ” agreed his friend Scott Friedel . “ I know what people are going to say— ‘ Those selfish idiots are killing our old people ! ’ ” said Lampel . “ How do you give up a day like this—really , how ? ” Friedel said , enjoying the last rays of sun as the music kept playing and the crowds kept coming .
Jeff Lampel is right about one thing : He and his friend are selfish idiots .
The calculus by these two guys is instructive . The costs and risks of reopening are not borne by the people clamoring for it , and they know it . Nikole Hannah Jones ( the Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter behind The 1619 Project ) has said that the push to reopening is “ linked to the belief that Covid is disproportionately killing black and brown folks. ” It ’ s objectively insane to risk lives so Tweedledee and Tweedledum can get together and drool on each other on a sunny day . The only thing that allows them to be so unbothered and so unwilling to take minimum precautions is their belief about who is really getting sick .
I can ’ t fix these people . I can ’ t educate them . I can ’ t teach them to care about somebody other than themselves . In some deep , vengeful part of my brain , I might hope that they get sick—sick enough to realize the error of their ways—but that wouldn ’ t solve anything . Covid can not fill the gaping hole where their empathy is supposed to be ; it will just add to their endless reserves of self-pity .

coronavirus,Human Rights Watch,1,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/08/uk-failing-domestic-abuse-victims-pandemic,UK Failing Domestic Abuse Victims in Pandemic,2020-06-08,,"Click to expand Image © 2020 Alberto Pezzali via AP
( London ) – The government of the United Kingdom is stalling on establishing a robust legal framework to address violence against women and girls even as reported domestic abuse spikes during the pandemic , ███ said today .
Insufficient measures to ensure critical support and services for survivors of violence – especially those least likely to get help – before and during the Covid-19 pandemic have left organizations that help some of the most vulnerable women scrambling to meet needs .
“ The pandemic has exposed longstanding flaws in the UK government ’ s approach to domestic violence , ” said Hillary Margolis , senior women ’ s rights researcher at ███ . “ Erosion of support for specialist domestic abuse services was already a national crisis , and this is a critical moment for the government to demonstrate commitment to long-term investment in these services for every woman and girl . ”
The government has repeatedly said it prioritizes protection and support for women and girls experiencing violence , but it has yet to ratify a landmark European treaty on violence against women signed by the government eight years ago today . The Domestic Abuse Bill before Parliament fails to ensure protection for all women and girls .
Service providers say the Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated a lack of access to services for migrant and Black , Asian , and minority ethnic ( BAME ) women . Representatives of organizations serving these communities say that persistent inequality leads to additional difficulties in providing services remotely . “ Twenty-five percent of the women we support don ’ t even have a phone , let alone a smart phone , ” said Rosie Lewis of the Angelou Centre , a black feminist service provider in Newcastle . “ [ Digital services ] assume a baseline of access . ”
Language barriers can exclude women in these communities from getting information about services . The # YouAreNotAlone campaign introduced by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel during the Covid-19 response aimed to raise public awareness about domestic violence and encourage those experiencing abuse to seek help , but messaging is only in English .
Services are struggling to remain fully operational during the pandemic . A Women ’ s Aid survey showed that 38 of 45 service providers had reduced or suspended at least 1 service due to Covid-19 as of April 6 . These include services that provide shelter , which already fell short of Council of Europe standards . Shelter spaces designated for women in marginalized groups are especially limited – as of May 2019 , Women ’ s Aid found that there were only 418 dedicated shelter spaces across England for BAME women , 4 dedicated spaces for women over 45 , 12 for women with learning disabilities , and none for deaf women .
During the pandemic , representatives of organizations that provide services for women experiencing violence said some shelters have had to leave spaces vacant due to social distancing or quarantine measures .
Migrant women face particular barriers to getting critical services . Their abusers use their immigration status to control them or prevent them from seeking help , and they may fear approaching authorities due to risk of detention , deportation , or separation from their children . People on visas such as spousal or fiancé visas have “ No Recourse to Public Funds ” under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 , making them ineligible for most government benefits .
Because refuges often depend on government housing benefit payments for financial support , many can not accept survivors with “ No Recourse to Public Funds. ” Policy intended to address this gap still excludes women with this status who are not on spousal visas . While Wales and Scotland instructed local authorities to ensure safe shelter for all of those who have this status and are fleeing domestic abuse during the pandemic , England and Northern Ireland have not issued such explicit instructions .
Service providers also told ███ that they are incurring up-front costs – which can be prohibitive for smaller organizations – to urgently establish remote services due to Covid-19 . Weeks into the crisis , on May 2 , the government announced £76 million to support “ the most vulnerable ” during the pandemic , including £28 million for domestic abuse services .
However , service providers raised concerns that this is insufficient to meet needs , that no funds are designated for organizations “ led by and for ” marginalized groups such as migrant , Black , Asian , or minority ethnic women or women with disabilities , and that the process for accessing funds remains cumbersome and time-intensive .
“ We are a small organization dealing with an increased number of cases , with complex cases and with [ women facing ] digital inequality , and on top of that we have to do complex funding applications , ” said Elizabeth Jimenez-Varga of the Latin American Women ’ s Rights Service . “ The fact that organizations like ours won ’ t access funds means that the most marginalized women won ’ t be able to access services . ”
Ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence , or “ Istanbul Convention , ” would bind the government to standards for preventing violence against women and girls , supporting survivors , and holding abusers to account , regardless of survivors ’ age , ethnicity , sexual orientation , or immigration status .
The government has attributed delays in ratification to the need to bring domestic legislation in line with the convention , including through passage of the long-awaited Domestic Abuse Bill . The bill , reintroduced to parliament in March , would establish a statutory definition of domestic violence . But it does not include critical measures to protect migrant women and girls – a necessity for compliance with the convention , which mandates that services and support for survivors must be nondiscriminatory and without regard to residency or immigration status .
The bill is currently at the committee stage in the House of Commons , with a report by the Public Bill Committee scheduled for June 25 . The government should use this opportunity to address remaining gaps in the legislation , including by introducing amendments that would guarantee protections for migrant and other marginalized women and girls , and move toward ratification of the Istanbul Convention .
As in many countries , reports of domestic violence have increased markedly in the UK since lockdown measures were instituted in March . The charity Refuge reported on May 27 that average weekly calls and contacts to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline for England and Wales had risen by 66 percent and visits to the website – where people can request a safe time to be contacted – had jumped by 950 percent compared with levels before the pandemic .
As Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs and Victims ’ Commissioner Vera Baird noted in a March 3 statement , “ For the [ Domestic Abuse ] Bill to be transformative , it needs to send a clear message that domestic abuse is unacceptable , whoever the victim is . ”
The bill should be urgently amended to ensure access to essential services , including shelter , for migrant women , ███ said . It should also establish safe reporting systems and reflect migrant women ’ s groups ’ call for a “ firewall ” between immigration authorities and domestic violence reporting and services . The government should take these and all other necessary steps to ensure that the bill fully complies with the Istanbul Convention to facilitate urgent ratification .
Over 30 organizations , including ███ , signed a June 2 letter urging the government to ratify the Istanbul Convention .

(London) – The government of the United Kingdom is stalling on establishing a robust legal framework to address violence against women and girls even as reported domestic abuse spikes during the pandemic, Human Rights Watch said today.

Insufficient measures to ensure critical support and services for survivors of violence – especially those least likely to get help – before and during the Covid-19 pandemic have left organizations that help some of the most vulnerable women scrambling to meet needs.

“The pandemic has exposed longstanding flaws in the UK government’s approach to domestic violence,” said Hillary Margolis, senior women’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Erosion of support for specialist domestic abuse services was already a national crisis, and this is a critical moment for the government to demonstrate commitment to long-term investment in these services for every woman and girl.”

The government has repeatedly said it prioritizes protection and support for women and girls experiencing violence, but it has yet to ratify a landmark European treaty on violence against women signed by the government eight years ago today. The Domestic Abuse Bill before Parliament fails to ensure protection for all women and girls.

Service providers say the Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated a lack of access to services for migrant and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) women. Representatives of organizations serving these communities say that persistent inequality leads to additional difficulties in providing services remotely. “Twenty-five percent of the women we support don’t even have a phone, let alone a smart phone,” said Rosie Lewis of the Angelou Centre, a black feminist service provider in Newcastle. “[Digital services] assume a baseline of access.”

Language barriers can exclude women in these communities from getting information about services. The #YouAreNotAlone campaign introduced by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel during the Covid-19 response aimed to raise public awareness about domestic violence and encourage those experiencing abuse to seek help, but messaging is only in English.

Services are struggling to remain fully operational during the pandemic. A Women’s Aid survey showed that 38 of 45 service providers had reduced or suspended at least 1 service due to Covid-19 as of April 6. These include services that provide shelter, which already fell short of Council of Europe standards. Shelter spaces designated for women in marginalized groups are especially limited – as of May 2019, Women’s Aid found that there were only 418 dedicated shelter spaces across England for BAME women, 4 dedicated spaces for women over 45, 12 for women with learning disabilities, and none for deaf women.

During the pandemic, representatives of organizations that provide services for women experiencing violence said some shelters have had to leave spaces vacant due to social distancing or quarantine measures.

Migrant women face particular barriers to getting critical services. Their abusers use their immigration status to control them or prevent them from seeking help, and they may fear approaching authorities due to risk of detention, deportation, or separation from their children. People on visas such as spousal or fiancé visas have “No Recourse to Public Funds” under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, making them ineligible for most government benefits.

Because refuges often depend on government housing benefit payments for financial support, many cannot accept survivors with “No Recourse to Public Funds.” Policy intended to address this gap still excludes women with this status who are not on spousal visas. While Wales and Scotland instructed local authorities to ensure safe shelter for all of those who have this status and are fleeing domestic abuse during the pandemic, England and Northern Ireland have not issued such explicit instructions.

Service providers also told Human Rights Watch that they are incurring up-front costs – which can be prohibitive for smaller organizations – to urgently establish remote services due to Covid-19. Weeks into the crisis, on May 2, the government announced £76 million to support “the most vulnerable” during the pandemic, including £28 million for domestic abuse services.

However, service providers raised concerns that this is insufficient to meet needs, that no funds are designated for organizations “led by and for” marginalized groups such as migrant, Black, Asian, or minority ethnic women or women with disabilities, and that the process for accessing funds remains cumbersome and time-intensive.

“We are a small organization dealing with an increased number of cases, with complex cases and with [women facing] digital inequality, and on top of that we have to do complex funding applications,” said Elizabeth Jimenez-Varga of the Latin American Women’s Rights Service. “The fact that organizations like ours won’t access funds means that the most marginalized women won’t be able to access services.”

Ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, or “Istanbul Convention,” would bind the government to standards for preventing violence against women and girls, supporting survivors, and holding abusers to account, regardless of survivors’ age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or immigration status.

The government has attributed delays in ratification to the need to bring domestic legislation in line with the convention, including through passage of the long-awaited Domestic Abuse Bill. The bill, reintroduced to parliament in March, would establish a statutory definition of domestic violence. But it does not include critical measures to protect migrant women and girls – a necessity for compliance with the convention, which mandates that services and support for survivors must be nondiscriminatory and without regard to residency or immigration status.

The bill is currently at the committee stage in the House of Commons, with a report by the Public Bill Committee scheduled for June 25. The government should use this opportunity to address remaining gaps in the legislation, including by introducing amendments that would guarantee protections for migrant and other marginalized women and girls, and move toward ratification of the Istanbul Convention.

As in many countries, reports of domestic violence have increased markedly in the UK since lockdown measures were instituted in March. The charity Refuge reported on May 27 that average weekly calls and contacts to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline for England and Wales had risen by 66 percent and visits to the website – where people can request a safe time to be contacted – had jumped by 950 percent compared with levels before the pandemic.

As Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs and Victims’ Commissioner Vera Baird noted in a March 3 statement, “For the [Domestic Abuse] Bill to be transformative, it needs to send a clear message that domestic abuse is unacceptable, whoever the victim is.”

The bill should be urgently amended to ensure access to essential services, including shelter, for migrant women, Human Rights Watch said. It should also establish safe reporting systems and reflect migrant women’s groups’ call for a “firewall” between immigration authorities and domestic violence reporting and services. The government should take these and all other necessary steps to ensure that the bill fully complies with the Istanbul Convention to facilitate urgent ratification.

Over 30 organizations, including Human Rights Watch, signed a June 2 letter urging the government to ratify the Istanbul Convention. On April 20, the Committee of the Parties to the Istanbul Convention provided guidance on steps governments can take to uphold their obligation to combat violence against women and domestic violence in line with the convention during the pandemic. These include “reinforcing” financial and human resources for service providers, implementing targeted information and communications campaigns in multiple languages, and ensuring that services continue to be available while upholding public health guidelines.

“The attention paid to reports of domestic abuse during the Covid-19 pandemic should be matched by concerted action to protect and support victims of violence now and in the wake of the global crisis,” Margolis said. “Lockdowns may be easing, but government responsibility isn’t – and some of the UK’s most at-risk women and girls are counting on this government to protect their lives.”",www.hrw.org,center,oWcGFsxqT81wOpYZ

Being told what to do by epidemiologists and officials wielding SCIENCE as their authority has been enough to bring Tea Party–era liberty back in vogue.

It’s 2009 again, or feels like it.

That was when spontaneous, grassroots protests against overweening government sprang up and were widely derided in the media as dangerous and wrong-headed.

The protesters then were inveighing against Obamacare; the protesters now are striking out against the coronavirus lockdowns.

The anti-lockdown agitation shows that, despite the revolution in Republican politics wrought by President Donald Trump, opposition to government impositions is deeply embedded in the DNA of the Right and likely will reemerge even more starkly if former vice president Joe Biden is elected president.

As of Friday , what is being called `` coronavirus '' ( this is actually a name for a family of viruses including the common cold ; medical experts are calling the actual virus in question COVID-19 ) had supposedly infected 75,567 people in China and killed 2,239 of them . Outside China , another 1,152 cases had been reported in 26 other countries , causing eight deaths , including recent outbreaks in South Korea and Iran . The director general of the World Health Organization , Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , said Friday : `` Our window of opportunity [ to stop the outbreak ] is narrowing . ''
It remains to be seen whether China and other countries will be able to control the outbreak . But one thing is clear : Authoritarian political systems are lousy at dealing with disease pandemics . We see this in China today and in the United States as well .
COVID-19 originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan , and as Laurie Garrett writes in Foreign Policy , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) horribly botched its initial response to the coronavirus outbreak : `` China now faces international vilification and potential domestic unrest as it blunders through continued cover-ups , lies , and repression that have already failed to stop the virus and may well be fanning the flames of its spread . ''
One primary reason the Chinese government failed to contain the outbreak is because corruption and incompetence are inherent features of tyrannical rule . The CCP ca n't point to democratic elections to obtain the consent of the governed , so they instead rely on techniques like a massive patronage machine to cultivate loyalty . Political reliability is a major prerequisite for filling any of the millions of positions in the vast Chinese bureaucracy , which tends to inculcate a culture of blind order-following , telling one 's superiors what they want to hear , and leveraging one 's position for personal advantage .
At the same time , the CCP , like any tyranny , uses violent political repression to frighten the populace against challenging its rule . Both freedom of speech and freedom of the press are sharply restricted there — and anyone perceived as a threat to CCP rule gets a treatment straight out of 1984 . There are reportedly about a million Uighur Muslims in horrific re-education camps in western China — essentially , the CCP is attempting to commit cultural genocide in a fit of paranoia .
The first person to call attention to the COVID-19 outbreak was a doctor named Li Wenliang , who told colleagues via social media that it looked like a SARS outbreak . This is the kind of honest competence that is absolutely vital in any rapid disease response , but tyrannies often try to suppress bad news rather than deal with the problem . So as Garrett writes , `` for the so-called crime of rumormongering , Li and seven other physicians were brought before China 's security police and compelled to sign a document admitting to 'spreading lies . ' ''
For the critical first few weeks , when aggressive quarantine measures might have stopped the virus in its tracks , the Chinese state first insisted there was no new virus , then that they had this situation well in hand — all while it continued to spread . When the epidemic became undeniable , the CCP looked like the liars they were , sowing panic as Chinese citizens wondered how bad it really was . When Li caught the virus and died on Feb. 6 , heroically trying to raise the alarm to the end , flames of distrust and anger were fanned higher still — and foreign governments reasonably began to suspect they could not trust the numbers coming out of China .
Trust is a vital component of any efficient disease response effort . The population must believe that the government is not lying about what is happening , and that its response measures are based on science and reason — especially so people do not panic and try to flee , possibly spreading disease further by accident . The CCP has proved beyond any question it is not trustworthy , and is relying on yet more brutal repression , locking down entire cities and herding thousands into poorly-equipped quarantine facilities . So far these efforts have not successfully curtailed the virus ' spread .
Americans should not take much comfort in our somewhat-less authoritarian system . The Trump regime 's style of rule bears all the marks of typical tyrannical rule — the bureaucracy stacked with corrupt idiot stooges , the legal system corrupted to protect the president and his cronies from facing criminal charges , and inconvenient information denied by a howling propaganda apparatus .
As Michael Lewis writes in his book The Fifth Risk , the entire federal bureaucracy has been rotting under Trump rule , as he neither knows nor cares to take the most basic actions to keep it functioning . Most of the people running what remains of the American state are either committed ideologues ( like the virulent racist Stephen Miller ) , interested parties , or career civil servants operating without official leadership . Only 35 percent of the key positions in the Department of Homeland Security that require Senate confirmation are currently filled . The department does not even have a nominee for secretary , deputy secretary , or general counsel . The Federal Emergency Management Agency has no nominee for deputy administrator or deputy administrator for resilience .
As Garrett writes in another article , `` In 2018 , the Trump administration fired the government 's entire pandemic response chain of command , including the White House management infrastructure . '' As a result , Trump 's COVID-19 response has been flailing and helpless . `` In numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the U.S. government , the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion , '' she writes . Recently The Washington Post reported experts at the Centers for Disease Control said 14 infected Americans who caught the virus on a cruise ship should stay in Japan for the moment rather than fly on a plane with hundreds of others and risk spreading it further . But the Trump administration higher-ups overruled the CDC , and all the passengers came back to California and Texas — the infected individuals separated behind plastic screening , but still posing an unknown risk .
Reactionaries often argue that ruthless authoritarian rule is more efficient than the democratic sort . But the world is getting a brutal lesson in how false that is . It was false in fascist Italy and Germany — the Nazi state was a chaotic disaster of corruption and incompetence — and it 's false today . There is no substitute for democratic legitimacy and the patient , dull work of building and maintaining a competent , honest bureaucracy . The tyrannical idiocy of Donald Trump and China 's communist dictatorship may get millions of people killed .

As a result, Trump's COVID-19 response has been flailing and helpless. ""In numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the U.S. government, the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion,"" she writes. Recently The Washington Post reported experts at the Centers for Disease Control said 14 infected Americans who caught the virus on a cruise ship should stay in Japan for the moment rather than fly on a plane with hundreds of others and risk spreading it further. But the Trump administration higher-ups overruled the CDC, and all the passengers came back to California and Texas — the infected individuals separated behind plastic screening, but still posing an unknown risk.

Reactionaries often argue that ruthless authoritarian rule is more efficient than the democratic sort. But the world is getting a brutal lesson in how false that is. It was false in fascist Italy and Germany — the Nazi state was a chaotic disaster of corruption and incompetence — and it's false today. There is no substitute for democratic legitimacy and the patient, dull work of building and maintaining a competent, honest bureaucracy. The tyrannical idiocy of Donald Trump and China's communist dictatorship may get millions of people killed.

Source: Not enough medical equipment is stockpiled

First, virtually nothing Trump says about himself, his actions, the world and his advisers can be taken at face value.

This summer in America, we are approaching the end of a civilized and free society as we have known it.

The freedom to walk outside without worrying for your life and the reliance that constitutional freedoms are guarantees that the government will honor have dissipated.

The effects are anarchy in the streets and a loss of liberty for everyone.

The root cause of both is the failure of government.

The anarchy was born in legitimate dissent and has morphed into deadly violence.

The dissent was provoked by the public torture and murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer. For many folks — I among them — this was too much to bear.

It was the final public impetus to the release of pent-up rage over the disparate treatment of the races by the government in general and the police specifically, and over public officials who have known of this for generations and looked the other way.

Since the adoption of the Civil War Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, the governmen — local, state and federal — was supposed to have become colorblind.

We know it has not.

But the death of one innocent Black man by one vicious white cop may have succeeded in achieving what 150 years of legislation and litigation have failed to achieve: turning the tide of public opinion against a culture that looked the other way in the face of governmental racial abuse and disparity.

But what began as legitimate, constitutional and laudatory dissent has become, in some places, violence and anarchy. The longer the violence remains unabated, the more pervasive it will become. It is largely unabated because many public officials rely on those committing the violence and their supporters for political backing.

Hence, the utter anarchy in Seattle, where a mayor and a governor declined to restore basic legal protections on the streets. A group of armed thugs, claiming to be liberators, took over a six-block area of that once beautiful city.

They destroyed property, prevented travel and commerce and even caused the deaths of innocents. Until death reared its unforgiving head, the police stayed away because the mayor told them to leave the neighborhood alone.

At the other end of the societal breakdown are the profoundly unconstitutional power grabs by mayors and governors in the name of public health. They have effectively nullified the Bill of Rights by using the police to infringe upon religion, speech, assembly, travel, self-defense, privacy, commercial intercourse, due process and the sanctity of voluntary contracts.

These government leaders have concocted their own rules and had them enforced as if they were law. The hypocritical New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy violated his own social distancing rules by marching arm-in-arm with protestors, and his own restaurant lockdown orders by visiting a restaurant secretly serving food indoors — and he famously mocked the Bill of Rights as above his paygrade during an appearance on Fox News.

What's wrong here?

It is exquisitely wrong for mayors and governors to write their own laws. It is also unconstitutional; in America, only a popularly elected representative body — not the entity that enforces the laws — can write them.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo takes refuge in legislation enacted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic giving him the power to regulate private behavior. But that legislation is unconstitutional because it violates the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution.

That clause mandates that the states have the same separation of powers as the federal government does, and thus only the legislative branch writes the laws.

When the governor both writes a law and enforces it, he ceases to be a governor and becomes a prince.

James Madison's constitutional genius irretrievably separated these two functions, just as it separated the judicial function from the legislative and the executive.

American civilization is being squeezed this summer by two factions — anarchists, enabled by politicians who want their support, and tyrannical mayors and governors.

Often — in an irony that history will find to be bitter — by same folks.

Their victim is personal liberty in a free society. The liberty to walk the streets of Seattle or New York City unmolested and the liberty to be oneself and take chances.

The liberty to be free from thugs in the streets and the liberty to exercise our formerly guaranteed fundamental rights.

What to do?

The Supreme Court needs to invalidate its opinions that hold that the police have no duty to protect life and property. That would mean that their moral and legal duty to enforce the laws would transcend the mayoral and gubernatorial interference with those laws. Stated differently, the law would supersede the decision of the Seattle mayor that kept the cops off — and the thugs on — the city's streets.

And state legislatures need to abrogate the concept of qualified immunity for the police.

That doctrine has immunized cops from being sued personally when they commit crimes or engage in psychotic behavior. Might the uniformed thug who took eight and a half minutes to choke the life out of George Floyd have thought twice about it were he to have been financially liable for his terror?

The same legislatures need to enact laws absolutely prohibiting governors from trampling the Bill of Rights, because the Constitution has no emergency exceptions.

How does this end?

Will a pliant majority accept uniformed and nonuniformed thugs in the streets? Will it accept tyrannical governance in the name of public health? Will the tyrants return our freedoms when the pandemic has passed? Will this lead to vigilantes or martial law?

More surprising, perhaps, is the 82% of Republicans who align with the view that social distancing and stay-at-home orders are responsible, life-saving actions, while only 17% believe the restrictive measures are a government overreaction that infringes on an individual's freedom.

Which of the following statements comes closest to your point of view even if not exactly right? ABC News/Ipsos Poll

That number comes against the backdrop of scattered demonstrations across the country, organized by protesters angry by the rigid stay-at-home orders in place as a response to the coronavirus, which has forced millions to claim unemployment benefits and ground most economic activity to a halt.

A potentially record-setting demonstration is on the horizon, as thousands are expected to protest outside Wisconsin's state capital in Madison on Friday.

Even as Trump alternates between openly encouraging the protests and breaking with one of his allies, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, over a sudden timeframe for reopening businesses in his state, the country believes the drastic efforts to contain and control the spread of COVID-19 are appropriate.

Partisan colors still show with Democrats being more likely to be worried about the outbreak (87%), back the stringent limitations on daily life, such as social distancing and the emergency orders issued by the nation's governors (98%), and believe that moving too quickly is a threat to the country's progress (92%). And 92% of Democrats also said they are unlikely to go out in public under immediate loosened restrictions.

The new survey also finds that independents largely trace the views of the country, with a near 80%-20% margin across the board on each question.

Among independents, 80% are concerned about contracting the virus, compared to 20% who are not; 72% see more risk for the country in moving too quickly than too slowly (28%); 80% support social distancing and the stay-at-home orders, compared to 20% who believe they are a government overreach; and 76% say they would be unlikely to leave home, compared to 24% who said they would be likely, if those emergency measures were instantly lifted.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump incorrectly stated in his address to the nation that the health insurance industry has agreed to waive patient co-payments for treatment of COVID-19 . The industry has not made such a commitment .
Instead , insurers agreed to cover the full cost of diagnostic tests to see whether people have the disease . That step does not shield insured people from potentially high medical bills as a result of getting sick from the coronavirus .

THE FACTS : No , they did not say they will cover co-pays for treatment . And Trump ’ s statement about surprise medical billing is questionable .
As Vice President Mike Pence stated more accurately , the insurers agreed to cover coronavirus testing with no cost sharing — so no co-pays or deductibles . That assurance applies to tests that can confirm or rule out the virus , and doesn ’ t extend to treatment or to other tests that the patient ’ s doctor may order .

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump incorrectly stated in his address to the nation that the health insurance industry has agreed to waive patient co-payments for treatment of COVID-19. The industry has not made such a commitment.

Instead, insurers agreed to cover the full cost of diagnostic tests to see whether people have the disease. That step does not shield insured people from potentially high medical bills as a result of getting sick from the coronavirus.

He inaccurately described part of his own plan to restrict travel from Europe and appeared to hold out false hope that people infected in the current outbreak will see new treatments to hasten their healing.

On Thursday, he misrepresented another aspect of U.S. defenses against the virus, saying inaccurately that everyone coming into the country is being tested for it.

A look at his remarks Wednesday night and Thursday:

TRUMP: “Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of (the) health insurance industry, who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.”

THE FACTS: No, they did not say they will cover co-pays for treatment. And Trump’s statement about surprise medical billing is questionable.

But a key testing component is in short supply.,2020-03-11,,"A shortage of a testing component is hobbling the U.S. battle against COVID-19 as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rises .
Earlier testing was marred by problems that produced potentially inaccurate results . As U.S. testing ramps up , some labs have run short on the kits and components needed to determine whether samples taken from ailing patients confirm the presence of the novel coronavirus .
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the USA rose to 1,050 , and there have been 29 deaths , as of Wednesday morning , according to Johns Hopkins University .
In some cases , the shortage prompted lab personnel to borrow components from colleagues using similar kits for testing unrelated to COVID-19 , said Marc Lipsitch , a Harvard University epidemiologist . The extent of the problem could not immediately be determined .
`` What we need is a lot more testing , right now , '' Lipsitch said , but testing kits and components `` are in very short supply . ''
Some of the testing components are manufactured by Qiagen , a multinational leader in molecular testing headquartered in Germany . Responding to spiking demand for its products , the company increased production to three shifts a day , seven days a week , at plants in Germany and Spain .

`` Given our ongoing supply to the United States , '' Theuringer said , `` we are now working directly with the customers to understand their flexibility and specific needs in order to be able to ensure broad availability of our products . ''","A shortage of a testing component is hobbling the U.S. battle against COVID-19 as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rises.

Earlier testing was marred by problems that produced potentially inaccurate results. As U.S. testing ramps up, some labs have run short on the kits and components needed to determine whether samples taken from ailing patients confirm the presence of the novel coronavirus.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the USA rose to 1,050, and there have been 29 deaths, as of Wednesday morning, according to Johns Hopkins University.

In some cases, the shortage prompted lab personnel to borrow components from colleagues using similar kits for testing unrelated to COVID-19, said Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University epidemiologist. The extent of the problem could not immediately be determined.

""What we need is a lot more testing, right now,"" Lipsitch said, but testing kits and components ""are in very short supply.""

Some of the testing components are manufactured by Qiagen, a multinational leader in molecular testing headquartered in Germany. Responding to spiking demand for its products, the company increased production to three shifts a day, seven days a week, at plants in Germany and Spain.

""This now is an unprecedented situation,"" said Qiagen corporate spokesman Thomas Theuringer. ""Demand is exploding, especially in the United States ... and this is stretching our capacity.""

Sign up here .
Dr. Anthony Fauci , the face of the White House coronavirus task force , warned in testimony Tuesday before the Senate Health Committee that reopening the economy before certain `` checkpoints '' set up in the Trump administration 's coronavirus recovery plan are met could bring `` serious '' consequences .
`` As I have said many times publicly , what we have worked out is a guideline framework for how to open America again , ” Fauci said , referencing a set of guidelines the White House has released for states and localities to begin opening their economies . In order to proceed to the first of three stages , states would need to see an uninterrupted decrease in coronavirus cases over a 14-day period .
`` Depending on the dynamics of an outbreak in a particular region , state , city or area , that would really determine the speed and the pace with which one does reenter or reopen , '' Fauci said . `` If some areas – cities states or what have you – jump over those barriers , checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively , and efficiently , my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks . ''
GOP SEN. ALEXANDER : 'STAYING AT HOME INDEFINITELY IS NOT THE SOLUTION '
Fauci warned that prematurely lifting coronavirus restrictions closing schools and businesses and limiting travel would lead to `` suffering and death '' and `` turn the clock back instead of going forward . ''
When asked by Sen. Patty Murray , D-Wash. , what could happen if areas do ignore the `` checkpoints , '' Fauci said , `` The consequences could be really serious . ''
Further , when asked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , if the virus was under control , Fauci said it is not .
`` Right now it depends on what you mean by containment , '' Fauci said , noting the virus is not completely under control . `` So when you look at the dynamics of new cases , even though some are coming down , the curve looks flat with some coming down . So I think we 're going in the right direction , but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak . ''
He added that without proper measures , the U.S. could face a `` resurgence '' in cases . He said the U.S. should be in a much better place by the fall , but said if adequate measures are not taken , `` there will be problems . ''
`` The time for magical thinking is over here , '' Warren said of President Trump 's pushes to reopen the economy quickly and optimism that the virus `` will go away . ''
The hearing , which features Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , as well as three other top administration health officials , is the biggest congressional hearing since the coronavirus crisis began . It comes as states across the country are plotting their own courses for reopening their economies , with some already opening sectors and others maintaining strict lockdowns . President Trump himself has stressed the importance of getting America back to work , leading to criticism from some Democrats that this approach could be too risky .
Fauci did not rip on the Trump administration 's response to the pandemic in his planned remarks , instead emphasizing efforts by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) to develop vaccines and other medical means to fight the coronavirus .
NATIONAL PARK SERVICE TESTS REOPENING , PREPS VISITORS FOR 'NEW NORMAL ' : HERE 'S WHAT TO EXPECT
`` Hopefully our research efforts , together with the other public health efforts , will get us quickly to an end to this terrible ordeal that we are all going through , '' Fauci said .
`` NIH is focused on developing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics , and sensitive , specific , and rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests , '' Fauci also said in written remarks submitted to the committee . `` These efforts will improve our response to the current pandemic and bolster our preparedness for the next , inevitable emerging disease outbreak ''
FAUCI , OTHER HEALTH OFFICIALS TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE PANEL VIA VIDEOCONFERENCE AMID CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS
On one point , Fauci said the government is focusing on several different vaccine candidates , using the hockey term `` multiple shots on goal '' to describe the increased chances that one would work . Additionally , he said if more than one is successful that would help increase the availability of the vaccines globally .
But , Fauci noted , `` there 's no guarantee that a vaccine is going to be effective . ''
Given the chance to attack Trump in an exchange with Sen. Tim Kaine , D-Va. , Fauci declined to . Kaine pushed Fauci on whether South Korea 's success on fighting the coronavirus showed that the U.S. response to the pandemic was inadequate . Fauci noted that there is a `` big difference '' between the U.S. and South Korea .
Fauci appeared remotely due to concerns that he might have been exposed to the coronavirus . Multiple senators also appeared virtually for the hearing , including Sen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tenn. , the chairman of the committee , and Murray , the ranking member .
`` After consulting with Dr. Fauci , and in an abundance of caution for our witnesses , senators , and the staff , all four Administration witnesses will appear by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances , '' Alexander said in a statement .
Alexander , in his opening remarks , emphasized the necessity of testing and also said the government might make an effort to mass-manufacture a vaccine before it ’ s been proven to work so it can be quickly distributed once it ’ s officially approved .
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI : CORONAVIRUS TESTING AVAILABILITY , SPEED WILL PLAY PART IN FOOTBALL 'S RETURN
“ Those vaccines , those treatments , are the ultimate solution , ” he said . “ But until we have them , all roads back to work and school go through testing . ''
Murray wasted no time hitting the president in her opening remarks .
`` Families across the country are counting on us for the truth about the COVID-19 pandemic , especially since it is clear they will not get it from President Trump , '' she said . `` Truth is essential ... The president is n't telling the truth . We must . And our witnesses must . ''
STEAK ' N SHAKE PERMANENTLY CLOSES NEARLY 10 PERCENT OF ITS RESTAURANTS AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS
She also criticized the Trump administration 's tangible response to the virus , saying it has been marked by delays and insufficient assistance to states and health professionals . Additionally , she advocated for another coronavirus stimulus bill to help ease the burden of the economic shutdowns across the country aimed at slowing the spread of the virus .
Fauci , when questioned by Alexander , said it would not be reasonable to expect a vaccine to be ready for back-to-school season this year . Trump has said he would like to have a vaccine by the end of the year .
`` The idea of having treatments or a vaccine ... ready by the fall ... would be something of a bridge too far , '' he said .
RED LOBSTER CUSTOMERS TURNED AWAY DUE TO LARGE VOLUME OF MOTHER 'S DAY ORDERS
Fauci also added that there is a good chance to see further rebounds in the disease , but that he hopes the U.S. will be better prepared to deal with them .
`` I would hope that if we do have the threat of a second wave , we will be able to deal with it very effectively to prevent it from becoming an outbreak . Not only what we 've seen now , but much , much less , '' he said .
Admiral Brett Giroir , the Assistant Secretary for Health , emphasized that the U.S. had conducted `` more than 9 million COVID-19 tests , a number far greater than any other country and double the per capita tests performed to date in South Korea , '' a nation that many have held up as the model for handling the coronavirus ' effects .
He noted that by the late summer and early fall , he expected the U.S. to be able to perform between 40 and 50 million coronavirus tests per month .
Fauci got into a dustup with Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , over Paul 's criticism of some of the prognostications that have come from public health experts and the push to reopen schools quickly .
`` The history of this will be wrong prediction after wrong prediction after wrong predicition , '' Paul said , mentioning , among several other examples , Sweden , which left its schools open . `` I do n't think you 're an end-all , I do n't think you 're the one person that gets to make a decision . ''
`` I have never made myself out to be the end-all and only voice in this , '' Fauci said . `` I 'm a scientist , a physician and a public health official . I give advice , according to the best scientific evidence . ''
He continued , emphasizing that it is not clear children are generally immune from the harmful effects of the coronavirus : `` We should be humble about what we do n't know . And I think that falls under the fact that we do n't know everything about this virus , and we really got to be very careful , particularly when it comes to children . Because the more and more we learn , we 're seeing things about what this virus can do that we did n't see from the studies in China or in Europe . ''
During questioning , self-proclaimed Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , pushed the witnesses on whether or not a vaccine , once developed , would be broadly available to people regardless of their income .
`` If , God-willing , a vaccine is developed , and if we 're able to produce it as quickly as we all hope we can , I imagine that that vaccine would be distributed to all people free of charge , or at least make sure that everybody in America that needs that vaccine will get it regardless of their income ? '' Sanders asked Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn .
Hahn said that issue was not under his purview as the FDA commissioner , but Giroir said he would advocate within the Trump administration to make sure the vaccine is accessible .
`` They should gain access to it ... I will certainly advocate that everyone is able to receive the vaccine regardless of income or any other circumstance , '' Hahn said .
Democrats , ahead of the hearing , made clear they saw it as an opportunity to separate Fauci from President Trump , whom the medical expert is almost always with when he appears publicly , so that Fauci will feel free to criticize Trump . Critics of the president have argued his response to the coronavirus crisis was wholly inadequate , alleging Trump initially downplayed the threat before letting petty politics get in the way of helping states and then moving too quickly to reopen the economy .
`` Until now , we 've mostly heard from the members of the coronavirus task force through the distorted lens of the White House press conference where the president often prevents them from answering fully , interrupts their response , or even contradicts their fact-based evidence , '' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , said on Monday .
`` This will be one of the first opportunities for Dr. Fauci to tell the American people the unvarnished truth without the president lurking over his shoulder . Dr. Fauci , let it rip , '' he added .
Trump previously blocked Fauci from appearing before a House committee , saying the members of the Democrat-controlled House are `` haters . ''
Fauci , like he had previously , avoided criticizing Trump directly on Tuesday , but did issue stern warnings on what could happen if measures to slow the disease 's spread are lifted too soon .
Under questioning from Sen. Kelly Loeffler , R-Ga. , all four witnesses said their relationships with the president are not `` confrontational '' and said they felt free to give their opinions and advice on the coronavirus pandemic .

""Until now, we've mostly heard from the members of the coronavirus task force through the distorted lens of the White House press conference where the president often prevents them from answering fully, interrupts their response, or even contradicts their fact-based evidence,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Monday.

""This will be one of the first opportunities for Dr. Fauci to tell the American people the unvarnished truth without the president lurking over his shoulder. Dr. Fauci, let it rip,"" he added.

Trump previously blocked Fauci from appearing before a House committee, saying the members of the Democrat-controlled House are ""haters.""

Fauci, like he had previously, avoided criticizing Trump directly on Tuesday, but did issue stern warnings on what could happen if measures to slow the disease's spread are lifted too soon.

Under questioning from Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., all four witnesses said their relationships with the president are not ""confrontational"" and said they felt free to give their opinions and advice on the coronavirus pandemic.

Fauci was joined by Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hahn and Giroir.

coronavirus,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/1/21202987/coronavirus-pandemic-trump-deaths,Trump’s coronavirus death toll estimate exposes his failure,2020-04-01,German Lopez,"President Donald Trump revealed a grim projection in the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday : Even with the social distancing the US is doing now , 100,000 to 200,000 Americans will likely die as a result of the ongoing outbreak . “ When you see 100,000 people , that ’ s a minimum number , ” Trump said .
It ’ s a horrifying figure . That ’ s more people than ever died in a single year from HIV/AIDS , drug overdoses , gun violence , or car crashes in the US . It ’ s more than American casualties during the entire Vietnam War .
But it ’ s also a horrifying number , in part , because much of it was likely preventable . If the US — including the Trump administration — had better prepared for pandemics , the country likely could have avoided ever talking about 100,000 to 200,000 deaths .
The estimated death toll “ was not inevitable , ” Céline Gounder , an epidemiologist at New York University , told me . “ If we ’ d jumped into contract tracing and testing , social distancing , and health system preparedness as soon as we heard reports from China , we ’ d be in a very different situation now . ”
Under Trump , the US had years to prepare . With warnings from President Barack Obama ’ s administration and activists like Bill Gates , it was always clear that America was vulnerable to a pandemic . ( ███ did a whole episode about it for Netflix . ) For many , the 2014- ’ 16 Ebola outbreak exposed the threat ; Jeremy Konyndyk , who worked in the Obama administration during the Ebola outbreak , told me he “ came away from that experience just completely horrified at how unready we would be for something more dangerous than Ebola , ” which , thankfully , was relatively hard to transmit .
In the years leading to the coronavirus outbreak , though , Trump did not take the concerns seriously . His administration shut down the White House office , set up after the Ebola outbreak , that oversaw disease outbreaks and pandemics . It repeatedly proposed cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and other public health agencies ( although Congress largely rejected those cuts ) . The administration cut a public health position that was meant to help detect disease outbreaks in China , where the coronavirus outbreak began .
By the time it became clear that the world was facing a serious threat in January and February , Trump and his administration were again slow to act . Despite declaring a public health emergency , the administration failed to establish the infrastructure for nationwide testing — holding up private testing labs with bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles while sending out its own faulty test kits . The administration did nothing of substance to really scale up the production of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) for health care workers , allowing a shortage to take root . Trump still hasn ’ t leveraged the full might of the Defense Production Act to get medical supplies to hospitals and clinics that need them to fight the outbreak .
The failure on testing alone is massive — one that remains today . As Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo told the New York Times , “ Had we had done more testing from the very beginning and caught cases earlier , we would be in a far different place . ”
The result is an outbreak that looks very different in the US than in the few countries , like South Korea and Taiwan , that have better contained Covid-19 , the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus .
This isn ’ t solely on Trump . Some of it comes down to chance — that the coronavirus is popping up now and is so deadly and contagious is obviously not under any president ’ s control . Konyndyk ’ s experience under Obama shows the previous administration wasn ’ t ready for a pandemic either . Experts and advocates argue that pandemic preparedness , along with public health more broadly , is notoriously underfunded not just in the US but around the world . Some local and state officials , such as in New York City and Florida , have also underreacted to the crisis , making it worse .
But Trump , perhaps more than any other president , had plenty of warning about what was to come . He squandered all the opportunities given to him to do better , leaving much of the aggressive action that has reduced the death toll — down from the millions the White House and experts say is possible without interventions — to local and state officials who simply don ’ t have the reach of the federal government .
So now 100,000 to 200,000 Americans are likely to die .
Every step of the way , the Trump administration failed to take the threat of a pandemic seriously .
The threat was long well-known , including to the federal government . Government simulations and exercises before the outbreak revealed that there were a lot of problems , from the lack of sufficient PPE to simple confusion between the cities , states , and many federal agencies about who ’ s in charge during a crisis .
Trump reacted to the risks by deprioritizing pandemic preparedness . In 2018 , then–National Security Adviser John Bolton fired Tom Bossert , a homeland security adviser who , the Washington Post reported , “ had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks. ” Then Bolton let go the head of pandemic response , Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer , and his global health security team . The team , the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense , was the main group within the White House for pandemic preparedness — and it was never replaced .
At the time , the Trump administration and Bolton said the cuts were needed to streamline the National Security Council . But what it did , experts have told me , is leave the US unready for a crisis of the magnitude it ’ s facing now .
“ The basic systems need to be in place for global , state , and local responses , ” Jen Kates , director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation , previously told me . “ When you don ’ t shore those up , you ’ re not starting from scratch , but you ’ re catching up every single time . ”
Even once it became clear that the coronavirus pandemic was a real threat , Trump downplayed the outbreak . He compared the novel coronavirus to the seasonal flu , when the coronavirus is in fact much deadlier and more contagious than the flu . He called concerns about the virus a “ hoax. ” He said on national television that , based on nothing more than a self-admitted “ hunch , ” the death rate of the disease was much lower than public health officials projected . Even after his administration invoked social distancing guidelines , Trump talked up the idea of doing away with them by Easter to allow for “ packed churches . ”
Ashish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute , described the administration ’ s early messaging as “ deeply disturbing , ” adding that it ’ s “ left the country far less prepared than it needs to be for what is a very substantial challenge ahead . ”
Trump ’ s tone has changed in recent weeks . He ultimately extended his task force ’ s social distancing guidelines through April . On Tuesday , he went after the claim — that , again , he repeatedly made before — that coronavirus is like flu : “ It ’ s not the flu . It ’ s vicious , ” he said .
But however Trump may feel now , his administration ’ s failure to take this threat seriously early on left the country in a much worse place .
A recent investigation by the New York Times exposed how the Trump administration failed to scale up testing . The CDC developed its own test for coronavirus — seemingly to make a more accurate test than what was available from other places — but the test turned out to be faulty , and the CDC took weeks to provide a fix . Meanwhile , the administration put up all sorts of regulatory hurdles that prevented private labs from rolling out their own tests .
The result : The US was only testing about 100 samples a day by mid-February , according to the Times .
The Times concluded , “ Across the government , [ experts ] said , three agencies responsible for detecting and combating threats like the coronavirus failed to prepare quickly enough . Even as scientists looked at China and sounded alarms , none of the agencies ’ directors conveyed the urgency required to spur a no-holds-barred defense . ”
This failure alone doomed the US to a much bigger outbreak , forcing Americans to rely far more on social distancing and suffer many more deaths . That ’ s because testing is crucial , especially in the early stages , to curtailing an outbreak : First , it lets public health officials identify sick people , isolate them , and trace their recent contacts to make sure those people aren ’ t sick and get them into quarantine as well . Second , testing lets officials detect which places are hardest hit and , therefore , require the most attention and help .
Yet , even today , testing remains a problem . Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) said this week that Trump ’ s claim that testing is no longer a problem is “ just not true ” and states are still “ flying blind ” due to insufficient testing .
Testing is only one example among many . The country is also experiencing a shortage of PPE for health care workers and ventilators for treatment . Both problems were repeatedly raised in pandemic simulations , but the federal government failed to replenish its Strategic National Stockpile and failed to scale up domestic production and supply chains . Even now , Trump has refused to use the full powers of the Defense Production Act , which would allow the federal government to demand more domestic production of these goods ( although it ’ d likely take at least weeks for this production to scale up ) .
The lack of medical supplies is one reason experts worry the US won ’ t have the health care capacity to deal with a flood of Covid-19 patients , leading to sickness , suffering , and death due to insufficient treatment .
Again , a lot of this goes back to poor preparation in the years before the Covid-19 pandemic — and , indeed , the years before Trump was in office — but Trump and his administration failed to prepare even once the threat of the coronavirus became clear .
These outcomes weren ’ t inevitable . Other countries that were more aggressive earlier seemed to reduce their potential death tolls .
Just take a look at this chart comparing Covid-19 cases between different countries and places :
The US ’ s trajectory in this chart is exponential : The number of cases is clearly rising every single day . But while US cases seemed to explode about two weeks after the 100th case , a few places — like South Korea , Taiwan , and Hong Kong — managed to flatten their curves with early , aggressive action around the same time .
South Korea did this , as Max Fisher and Choe Sang-Hun reported at the New York Times , with a lot of testing . While the US was still doing at most 100 tests a day , South Korea was pumping them out in the thousands , if not tens of thousands , a day . This allowed officials in South Korea to detect where outbreaks were happening and contain them — particularly by getting people to isolate and quarantine , along with some restrictions on movement , travel , and socializing — before things got too out of control .
The US is obviously not South Korea . It ’ s much bigger , more sprawling , and more populous . But the South Korean experience shows that aggressive testing , as one example , could help contain coronavirus . The US , due largely to the Trump administration ’ s failures , just didn ’ t have the capabilities South Korea did here .
There ’ s plenty of other evidence that early , aggressive action can help contain epidemics . During the 1918 flu pandemic , some US cities took quick , decisive action while others didn ’ t . A 2007 study in PNAS exposed the different outcomes in St. Louis , which quickly imposed restrictions to force social distancing , and Philadelphia , which didn ’ t , in this telling chart :
The study concluded that “ cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈50 % lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves . Cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality , but the difference was smaller ( ≈20 % ) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates . ”
If Trump had acted sooner , the US could have had a better chance at replicating the results from St. Louis in 1918 or South Korea in 2020 . But that moment has passed — and Americans are now facing the deaths of potentially hundreds of thousands of their friends , family , and peers as a result .","President Donald Trump revealed a grim projection in the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday: Even with the social distancing the US is doing now, 100,000 to 200,000 Americans will likely die as a result of the ongoing outbreak. “When you see 100,000 people, that’s a minimum number,” Trump said.

Trump failed to prepare, then downplayed the coronavirus outbreak

The threat was long well-known, including to the federal government. Government simulations and exercises before the outbreak revealed that there were a lot of problems, from the lack of sufficient PPE to simple confusion between the cities, states, and many federal agencies about who’s in charge during a crisis.

There’s another way this could have gone

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The reopening of Tucson ’ s historic Hotel Congress lasted less than a month .
General manager Todd Hanley on June 4 ended a two-month coronavirus lockdown and reopened the 39-room hotel at half-capacity , along with an adjoining restaurant for outdoor dining . Yet with reported COVID-19 cases spiking across Arizona , Hanley made the painful decision last weekend to give up , for now .
“ We are closing everything , ” he said . “ We are going to live to fight another day . ’ ’
The move means that once again , most of Hanley ’ s employees will lose their jobs , at least temporarily . Except for roughly a dozen who are needed to maintain the century-old property , more than 50 workers he had recalled will be laid off for a second time .
A resurgence of confirmed COVID cases across the South and West — and the suspension or reversal of re-openings of bars , hotels , restaurants and other businesses — is endangering hopes for an economic rebound in the region and perhaps nationally . At stake are the jobs of millions of people who have clung to hopes that their layoffs from widespread business shutdowns this spring would prove short-lived .
On Thursday , the government is expected to issue another robust monthly jobs report . Economists have forecast that employers added 3 million jobs in June , on top of 2.5 million added in May , clawing back a portion of the record-high 21 million that vanished in April at the height of the viral shutdowns .
Yet any such news might already be outdated : The jobs report won ’ t fully capture the impact of the COVID upsurge in the South and West and the desperate steps being pursued to try to control it . The re-closings of restaurants and bars , and resulting job cuts , mark an about-face from what appear to have been premature efforts to restart the economy before the pandemic had been contained .
“ We ’ re still in a very deep hole , ” said Diane Swonk , chief economist at the firm Grant Thornton . “ This makes the June employment report backward-looking instead of forward-looking . ’ ’
Eager to jump-start their economies , governors in several states across the Sun Belt had lifted their lockdowns before their states had met reopening guidelines that were set — yet largely shrugged off — by the White House .
Reported infections quickly spiked . From April 9 to June 8 , the five-day daily average of confirmed new cases had dropped from 32,150 to below 19,400 . Then it began rising again , surging past the April level to nearly 42,100 on Sunday before dipping to 41,000 on Monday . The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested , and studies suggest that people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick .
The governors began to backtrack . Texas Gov . Greg Abbott last week ordered all bars closed . Arizona Gov . Doug Ducey told residents to stay home and declared that the state was “ on pause ” as the COVID cases stacked up . Florida also banned alcohol consumption at its bars .
Kylie Davis , a 23-year-old bartender in Tampa , Florida , had returned to work May 23 after two months without a job , struggling to collect unemployment benefits from Florida ’ s backlogged system . The tips , she said , were good .
“ People were so understanding , ” she said , “ that we had been out of work for a while and were extremely generous . ”
Yet after a few weeks , Davis was coughing and exhausted and had lost her sense of taste and smell . On June 12 , she tested positive for the virus and couldn ’ t return to work when Florida bars reopened . Neither , it turns out , could many others . As Florida ’ s reported cases spiked to record highs the past two weeks , with 9,000 cases recorded in one day last week , Gov . Ron DeSantis ordered bars to shut down again .
And just like that , Davis and others found themselves unemployed for the second time this year .
The jarring reversal underscores what many economists had been stressing for months : That the economy and the job market can ’ t regain their health until business shutdowns have lasted long enough to reduce infections and most Americans feel confident enough to return to restaurants , bars , hotels , shopping malls and airports .
In the meantime , a resurgence of cases and re-closings of businesses is increasingly evident . The data firm Womply found that the proportion of bars that are closed in Texas , Florida , Tennessee and some other states started climbing last week after having declined fairly steadily since April or early May .
In many cases , it seems , customers themselves , rather than government edict , have driven that trend . A study by Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson of the University of Chicago found that Americans chose to stay home or avoid crowded stores this spring not so much because authorities told them to as out of fear stemming from reports of COVID deaths . Their study used cellphone data to track consumer traffic .
“ It is the virus , not lockdowns , that dictates the course of the economy , ” said Yongseok Shin , an economist at Washington University and a research fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis . “ We can not have a full economic recovery without reining in the epidemic .
“ We were worried about a second wave in the fall , but it now appears that we may have one very long wave . With the number of new cases high and rising , people will be slow to return to normal activities for fear of infection , and businesses will delay hiring and investment , lockdown or no lockdown . ”
Even before Texas ’ s governor shut down bars in the states again last week , Michael Neff had decided to re-close his , the Cottonmouth Club in Houston . In March , Neff had initially closed the Cottonmouth and laid off his 10 employees . Late last month , he reopened . He brought back two employees with precautions — requiring customers to wear masks except when seated , eliminating bar seating , developing a contactless menu and erecting a barrier at the bar ’ s entrance .
It didn ’ t work . After being cooped up for months , bar-goers appeared in no mood for social distancing , especially when they could visit other bars with fewer restrictions . Employees at the Cottonmouth were spending most of their time monitoring customers ’ behavior .
“ You can ’ t create an environment people want to be in if you are scolding them the whole time , ” Neff said .
Then he began hearing of bars where the entire staff had tested positive for the coronavirus . Two weeks ago , Neff decided to shut down again on his own .
“ We couldn ’ t just be a magical COVID-free zone , ” he said .
Financially , it has been difficult . But Neff said his landlord has allowed him to pay what he can so far .
Likewise , Omar Yeefoon reopened his Dallas restaurant June 10 to “ a pretty good reception , ” after having been shuttered for three months . The comeback was fleeting . After four days , Yeefoon had to shut down again in the face of a COVID-19 resurgence in Texas and lay off two of the four workers he ’ d brought back .
“ People ’ s minds — they still don ’ t feel comfortable , ” Yeefoon said . “ Psychologically , forcing this reopening and forcing everyone to go out -- I don ’ t know how it is playing out ... We in Texas have not been doing this right . ”
Some business people have voiced frustration over the often contradictory and evolving directives from government authorities and by the impossible situation the virus has put them in .
“ You open too soon , and people die , ” said Dawn Nielsen , chief operating officer at Kolache Factory , which has 27 bakeries mostly around Houston . “ You don ’ t open soon enough , and businesses die . ’ ’
Kolache Factory had reopened dining rooms for two weeks , then shut them back down on June 19 and returned to takeout and delivery only .
The re-closings are complicating prospects for a enduring economic recovery from the sudden and deep U.S. economic downturn . In a worst-case scenario , economists at IHS Markit warn , after a brief rebound , the economy could slip back into recession by the end of the year .
Economists Mark Vitner and Charlie Dougherty at Wells Fargo Securities note that the uptick in reported viral cases is occurring in cities like Dallas , Houston and Atlanta that have accounted for a disproportionate share of economic growth in recent years .

WASHINGTON (AP) — The reopening of Tucson’s historic Hotel Congress lasted less than a month.

General manager Todd Hanley on June 4 ended a two-month coronavirus lockdown and reopened the 39-room hotel at half-capacity, along with an adjoining restaurant for outdoor dining. Yet with reported COVID-19 cases spiking across Arizona, Hanley made the painful decision last weekend to give up, for now.

“We are closing everything,” he said. “We are going to live to fight another day.’’

The move means that once again, most of Hanley’s employees will lose their jobs, at least temporarily. Except for roughly a dozen who are needed to maintain the century-old property, more than 50 workers he had recalled will be laid off for a second time.

A resurgence of confirmed COVID cases across the South and West — and the suspension or reversal of re-openings of bars, hotels, restaurants and other businesses — is endangering hopes for an economic rebound in the region and perhaps nationally. At stake are the jobs of millions of people who have clung to hopes that their layoffs from widespread business shutdowns this spring would prove short-lived.

On Thursday, the government is expected to issue another robust monthly jobs report. Economists have forecast that employers added 3 million jobs in June, on top of 2.5 million added in May, clawing back a portion of the record-high 21 million that vanished in April at the height of the viral shutdowns.

Yet any such news might already be outdated: The jobs report won’t fully capture the impact of the COVID upsurge in the South and West and the desperate steps being pursued to try to control it. The re-closings of restaurants and bars, and resulting job cuts, mark an about-face from what appear to have been premature efforts to restart the economy before the pandemic had been contained.

“We’re still in a very deep hole,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the firm Grant Thornton. “This makes the June employment report backward-looking instead of forward-looking.’’

Eager to jump-start their economies, governors in several states across the Sun Belt had lifted their lockdowns before their states had met reopening guidelines that were set — yet largely shrugged off — by the White House.

Reported infections quickly spiked. From April 9 to June 8, the five-day daily average of confirmed new cases had dropped from 32,150 to below 19,400. Then it began rising again, surging past the April level to nearly 42,100 on Sunday before dipping to 41,000 on Monday. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest that people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.

The governors began to backtrack. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week ordered all bars closed. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey told residents to stay home and declared that the state was “on pause” as the COVID cases stacked up. Florida also banned alcohol consumption at its bars.

Kylie Davis, a 23-year-old bartender in Tampa, Florida, had returned to work May 23 after two months without a job, struggling to collect unemployment benefits from Florida’s backlogged system. The tips, she said, were good.

“People were so understanding,” she said, “that we had been out of work for a while and were extremely generous.”

Yet after a few weeks, Davis was coughing and exhausted and had lost her sense of taste and smell. On June 12, she tested positive for the virus and couldn’t return to work when Florida bars reopened. Neither, it turns out, could many others. As Florida’s reported cases spiked to record highs the past two weeks, with 9,000 cases recorded in one day last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered bars to shut down again.

And just like that, Davis and others found themselves unemployed for the second time this year.

The jarring reversal underscores what many economists had been stressing for months: That the economy and the job market can’t regain their health until business shutdowns have lasted long enough to reduce infections and most Americans feel confident enough to return to restaurants, bars, hotels, shopping malls and airports.

In the meantime, a resurgence of cases and re-closings of businesses is increasingly evident. The data firm Womply found that the proportion of bars that are closed in Texas, Florida, Tennessee and some other states started climbing last week after having declined fairly steadily since April or early May.

In many cases, it seems, customers themselves, rather than government edict, have driven that trend. A study by Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson of the University of Chicago found that Americans chose to stay home or avoid crowded stores this spring not so much because authorities told them to as out of fear stemming from reports of COVID deaths. Their study used cellphone data to track consumer traffic.

“It is the virus, not lockdowns, that dictates the course of the economy,” said Yongseok Shin, an economist at Washington University and a research fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “We cannot have a full economic recovery without reining in the epidemic.

He added:

“We were worried about a second wave in the fall, but it now appears that we may have one very long wave. With the number of new cases high and rising, people will be slow to return to normal activities for fear of infection, and businesses will delay hiring and investment, lockdown or no lockdown.”

Even before Texas’s governor shut down bars in the states again last week, Michael Neff had decided to re-close his, the Cottonmouth Club in Houston. In March, Neff had initially closed the Cottonmouth and laid off his 10 employees. Late last month, he reopened. He brought back two employees with precautions — requiring customers to wear masks except when seated, eliminating bar seating, developing a contactless menu and erecting a barrier at the bar’s entrance.

It didn’t work. After being cooped up for months, bar-goers appeared in no mood for social distancing, especially when they could visit other bars with fewer restrictions. Employees at the Cottonmouth were spending most of their time monitoring customers’ behavior.

“You can’t create an environment people want to be in if you are scolding them the whole time,” Neff said.

Then he began hearing of bars where the entire staff had tested positive for the coronavirus. Two weeks ago, Neff decided to shut down again on his own.

“We couldn’t just be a magical COVID-free zone,” he said.

Financially, it has been difficult. But Neff said his landlord has allowed him to pay what he can so far.

Likewise, Omar Yeefoon reopened his Dallas restaurant June 10 to “a pretty good reception,” after having been shuttered for three months. The comeback was fleeting. After four days, Yeefoon had to shut down again in the face of a COVID-19 resurgence in Texas and lay off two of the four workers he’d brought back.

“People’s minds — they still don’t feel comfortable,” Yeefoon said. “Psychologically, forcing this reopening and forcing everyone to go out -- I don’t know how it is playing out ... We in Texas have not been doing this right.”

Some business people have voiced frustration over the often contradictory and evolving directives from government authorities and by the impossible situation the virus has put them in.

“You open too soon, and people die,” said Dawn Nielsen, chief operating officer at Kolache Factory, which has 27 bakeries mostly around Houston. “You don’t open soon enough, and businesses die.’’

Kolache Factory had reopened dining rooms for two weeks, then shut them back down on June 19 and returned to takeout and delivery only.

The re-closings are complicating prospects for a enduring economic recovery from the sudden and deep U.S. economic downturn. In a worst-case scenario, economists at IHS Markit warn, after a brief rebound, the economy could slip back into recession by the end of the year.

Economists Mark Vitner and Charlie Dougherty at Wells Fargo Securities note that the uptick in reported viral cases is occurring in cities like Dallas, Houston and Atlanta that have accounted for a disproportionate share of economic growth in recent years.

“The second-half economic recovery will be weaker and more sluggish than what we hoped for,” Shin of Washington University said, “precisely because we failed to contain the epidemic as effectively as we should have.’’

“ Boston Judy ” later clarified that Oscar was not producing tests , but that the company would get to “ bill the feds for evaluating people for COVID and referring them to a testing center if they meet the criteria [ for testing ] . ” While the legislation that would allow for such a reimbursement likely will include a fund for covering the cost of these tests , the legislation has not yet been finalized , and it ’ s unclear that it would really be a windfall for Oscar , either .
On March 13 , 2020 , U.S. House Democrats and the White House reached a deal on a package of legislation that included a requirement that insurance companies cover the full cost of COVID-19 with no cost sharing . As described by the Brookings Institute , this legislation , if and when it is passed by the Senate and signed by the president :
Would offer financial support to state governments by temporarily increasing the share of Medicaid spending financed by the federal government , require almost all forms of health insurance to cover COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing , and create mechanisms to pay for COVID-19 testing for uninsured people .
In other words , while the government will likely be subsidizing insurance companies like Oscar , they are doing so to cover losses incurred by the requirement for full reimbursement to members . These laws , and the federal reimbursement they would authorize , would apply to any health insurance company in America , not only Oscar .
Joshua Kushner co-founded Oscar in 2012 . His venture capital firm , Thrive Capital , holds a significant ownership share .

Jared Kushner recently divested from another of his brother ’ s enterprises : the “ real estate crowdfunding platform ” Cadre . In that instance , the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) obtained a certificate of divestiture documenting Jared Kushner ’ s involvement in that company . Thus far , however , no certificate of divestiture has been produced publicly that documents Jared Kushner ’ s divestment in the company that owns Oscar .
That being said , the assertion that the Kushners as a family are involved in the business of COVID-19 testing is not entirely accurate . The company ’ s coronavirus response so far is limited to an online form that allows users to find a testing location if their symptoms call for it . Health insurance companies are likely to be reimbursed for covering the cost of COVID-19 testing once legislation is passed , but this would apply to all insurance providers , not just Oscar .

Oscar Health’s COVID-19 Testing Locator

Today, Oscar, a tech-driven health insurance company, launched the first testing center locator for COVID-19 in the U.S., featuring more than 100 centers today. It is accessible to the general public and more testing centers are being added every day.

A well-shared post by a user named “Boston Judy,” for example, asserted that “we didn’t have testing because the Trump family circle wanted to wait till they could make a profit.”

Even if this assertion had merit, the actions Oscar took merely help locate unaffiliated testing centers. As an insurance company, Oscar does not manufacture, perform, analyze, or sell any actual COVID-19 test. Further, the test-center locator that Oscar developed is open to the general public and is not limited to people who get insurance through Oscar.

While the service also acts as a promotion for the company, it can serve as a testing center locator for any interested party.

Will Oscar Health Profit from COVID-19?

“Boston Judy” later clarified that Oscar was not producing tests, but that the company would get to “bill the feds for evaluating people for COVID and referring them to a testing center if they meet the criteria [for testing].” While the legislation that would allow for such a reimbursement likely will include a fund for covering the cost of these tests, the legislation has not yet been finalized, and it’s unclear that it would really be a windfall for Oscar, either.

On March 13, 2020, U.S. House Democrats and the White House reached a deal on a package of legislation that included a requirement that insurance companies cover the full cost of COVID-19 with no cost sharing. As described by the Brookings Institute, this legislation, if and when it is passed by the Senate and signed by the president:

Would offer financial support to state governments by temporarily increasing the share of Medicaid spending financed by the federal government, require almost all forms of health insurance to cover COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing, and create mechanisms to pay for COVID-19 testing for uninsured people.

In other words, while the government will likely be subsidizing insurance companies like Oscar, they are doing so to cover losses incurred by the requirement for full reimbursement to members. These laws, and the federal reimbursement they would authorize, would apply to any health insurance company in America, not only Oscar.

Does Jared Kushner Have Anything to Do With Oscar?

Joshua Kushner co-founded Oscar in 2012. His venture capital firm, Thrive Capital, holds a significant ownership share. According to financial-disclosure forms released by Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, covering the year 2018, the couple owned and received profit from shares of Thrive:

This document also appears to assert that the couple divested from Thrive during the 2018 financial year:

Jared Kushner recently divested from another of his brother’s enterprises: the “real estate crowdfunding platform” Cadre. In that instance, the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) obtained a certificate of divestiture documenting Jared Kushner’s involvement in that company. Thus far, however, no certificate of divestiture has been produced publicly that documents Jared Kushner’s divestment in the company that owns Oscar.

That being said, the assertion that the Kushners as a family are involved in the business of COVID-19 testing is not entirely accurate. The company’s coronavirus response so far is limited to an online form that allows users to find a testing location if their symptoms call for it. Health insurance companies are likely to be reimbursed for covering the cost of COVID-19 testing once legislation is passed, but this would apply to all insurance providers, not just Oscar. For these reasons, we rank the truth of this claim as a “Mixture.”",www.snopes.com,center,5m5eB8Lzg06BaiyJ

There is an optimistic scenario if a second virus begins to spread: The new pathogen finds it harder to move around an alert world, is rapidly detected wherever it arrives, and fizzles out because cautious citizens have their guard up.

As long as people stay vigilant against the current pandemic—keeping their distance, wearing masks, avoiding indoor crowds—they should theoretically be guarded against a second respiratory virus. It used to be common for measles and pertussis to interfere with each other, so that if one spiked, the other would subside.

A 'very encouraging' 107,000 are so far signed up.",2020-07-20,,"At a time when some Americans are concerned about the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine , tens of thousands have already volunteered to help bring oneinto existence .
As of Monday , more than 138,600 people had signed up to take part in testing .
“ That ’ s why we ’ re optimistic that we ’ re going to be able to get the trials enrolled in an expeditious way . I think we can do what we need to do , ” said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
The milestone was reached just a week after the National Institutes of Health launched a clinical trial network for vaccines and other prevention tools to fight the pandemic .
More are still needed , but the initial surge will go a long way toward filling the requirement for at least 30,000 volunteers each for the four companies that plan to launch Phase 3 clinical trials of their potential vaccines by early fall .
Together , the Moderna , Pfizer BioNTech , AstraZeneca and Inovio trials will require at least 120,000 volunteers .
“ I would say it ’ s very encouraging at this stage , ” said Barry Bloom , an immunologist and vaccine expert who is a professor of public health at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health .
'No one is safe until everyone is safe ' : Vaccine nationalism threatens global coronavirus effort
Regulation : FDA says a coronavirus vaccine would have to be at least 50 % effective to be approved
Vaccine countdown : We 're one-third of the way to a widely available coronavirus vaccine , experts say
Hundreds of clinical trials for drugs , medical devices and vaccines are going on across the United States at any one time , but most are relatively small . Putting together four large trials at the same time , with even more planned to come online later in the fall and winter , is a massive undertaking .
It doesn ’ t just require volunteers but also a robust complement of clinics , hospitals and medical centers around the nation with staff and physicians experienced in running clinical trials .
To make that happen , the NIH launched the COVID-19 Prevention Trials Network , merging four existing clinical trial networks . It launched on July 8 with a website where volunteers can sign up .
The network builds on decades worth of work creating clinical trial networks that goes back to the AIDS epidemic in the late 1980s , Fauci said .
“ It would take literally years to build up a network that I ’ ve build up over the last 30 years . So why do it ? We ’ re going to use what we have , ” he said .
People chosen to take part will be racially , ethnically and geographically diverse . In its guidance for companies testing possible vaccines , the Food and Drug Administration says it wants the vaccine candidates to be tested in populations most affected by COVID-19 , including ethnic and racial minorities , pregnant women , the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions that can worsen COVID-19 .
While the effort is coming together quickly , the process is following the same strict protocols required of all vaccine developers .
“ The guidelines for these trials are really clear . They will be scientifically rigorous and there are no shortcuts , ” Bloom said .
Phase 3 clinical trials come only after months of other tests that first begin in cells and then moves on to animals . Only if all goes well with animal tests does the process move to humans .
In Phase 1 trials , the goal is to determine any immediate adverse effects . This is done through tests in a small number of healthy people , generally fewer than 100 . For example , for the Phase 1 trial of the Moderna vaccine candidate , 45 people took part .
Phase 2 trials expand the safety testing and look at dosing – how high a dose can be given before there are adverse effects ? Typically several dose levels are tested . In addition , these trials look to see if the vaccine causes an immune response in the subject . They can end up including several hundred people and expand to include older subjects .
Phase 3 trials begin when it ’ s clear the vaccine doesn ’ t cause immediate adverse effects and appears to provoke an immune response . The goal is to see if the vaccine actually protects the subjects against getting COVID-19 or , if they do get it , causes the illness to be less severe .
`` Each vaccine needs to be tested on about 30,000 volunteers , '' Dr. Francis Collins , director of the NIH , said in June . `` We do n't believe that we have enough power in the analysis to be able to document the vaccine works unless you get to roughly that number . ''
Half the participants will get the vaccine candidate , the other half will get a placebo .
“ A lot of people drop out right there . They say , ‘ No , I don ’ t want it if I don ’ t get the vaccine , ’ ” said Dr. Robert Hiatt , a professor of epidemiology at the University of California-San Francisco , who has led multiple large clinical trials .

`` The altruistic aspect of this is appealing , ” he said . “ People want to be part of the cure . ”","At a time when some Americans are concerned about the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine, tens of thousands have already volunteered to help bring oneinto existence.

As of Monday , more than 138,600 people had signed up to take part in testing.

“That’s why we’re optimistic that we’re going to be able to get the trials enrolled in an expeditious way. I think we can do what we need to do,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The milestone was reached just a week after the National Institutes of Health launched a clinical trial network for vaccines and other prevention tools to fight the pandemic.

More are still needed, but the initial surge will go a long way toward filling the requirement for at least 30,000 volunteers each for the four companies that plan to launch Phase 3 clinical trials of their potential vaccines by early fall.

Together, the Moderna, Pfizer BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Inovio trials will require at least 120,000 volunteers.

“I would say it’s very encouraging at this stage,” said Barry Bloom, an immunologist and vaccine expert who is a professor of public health at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health.

Hundreds of clinical trials for drugs, medical devices and vaccines are going on across the United States at any one time, but most are relatively small. Putting together four large trials at the same time, with even more planned to come online later in the fall and winter, is a massive undertaking.

It doesn’t just require volunteers but also a robust complement of clinics, hospitals and medical centers around the nation with staff and physicians experienced in running clinical trials.

To make that happen, the NIH launched the COVID-19 Prevention Trials Network, merging four existing clinical trial networks. It launched on July 8 with a website where volunteers can sign up.

The network builds on decades worth of work creating clinical trial networks that goes back to the AIDS epidemic in the late 1980s, Fauci said.

“It would take literally years to build up a network that I’ve build up over the last 30 years. So why do it? We’re going to use what we have,” he said.

People chosen to take part will be racially, ethnically and geographically diverse. In its guidance for companies testing possible vaccines, the Food and Drug Administration says it wants the vaccine candidates to be tested in populations most affected by COVID-19, including ethnic and racial minorities, pregnant women, the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions that can worsen COVID-19.

While the effort is coming together quickly, the process is following the same strict protocols required of all vaccine developers.

“The guidelines for these trials are really clear. They will be scientifically rigorous and there are no shortcuts,” Bloom said.

Phase 3 clinical trials come only after months of other tests that first begin in cells and then moves on to animals. Only if all goes well with animal tests does the process move to humans.

In Phase 1 trials, the goal is to determine any immediate adverse effects. This is done through tests in a small number of healthy people, generally fewer than 100. For example, for the Phase 1 trial of the Moderna vaccine candidate, 45 people took part.

Phase 2 trials expand the safety testing and look at dosing – how high a dose can be given before there are adverse effects? Typically several dose levels are tested. In addition, these trials look to see if the vaccine causes an immune response in the subject. They can end up including several hundred people and expand to include older subjects.

Phase 3 trials begin when it’s clear the vaccine doesn’t cause immediate adverse effects and appears to provoke an immune response. The goal is to see if the vaccine actually protects the subjects against getting COVID-19 or, if they do get it, causes the illness to be less severe.

These will be large trials.

""Each vaccine needs to be tested on about 30,000 volunteers,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, said in June. ""We don't believe that we have enough power in the analysis to be able to document the vaccine works unless you get to roughly that number.""

Half the participants will get the vaccine candidate, the other half will get a placebo.

“A lot of people drop out right there. They say, ‘No, I don’t want it if I don’t get the vaccine,’” said Dr. Robert Hiatt, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California-San Francisco, who has led multiple large clinical trials.

Part of the work of the clinical trial workers is overcoming such hesitation. People in the control group, the ones who don’t actually get the vaccine, are vital to understanding if the real vaccine works, Hiatt said.

""Without them you can’t proceed,” he said.

Researchers take care that participants understand what they’re signing up for. First there is an initial intake interview, which might be done over the phone or online. Those who are chosen must go through a thorough consent process.

The informed consent agreement can run 50 to 100 pages, said Dr. Mohamud Daya, a professor of emergency medicine at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon, who runs a large clinical trial network studying drugs for emergency conditions such as brain injuries, strokes and heart attacks.

“The average consent form takes anywhere between 30 to 60 minutes, to go through,” Daya said. “You need to spend time with people, give them time to have things explained and ask questions.”

Participants might be asked not just for their medical histories but also the names, addresses and phone number of the volunteer’s friends, family and neighbors, as well as information about their social media accounts. The information collected about friends and family helps researchers find participants if they lose track of them, to ask if they still want to take part, Hiatt said.

The COVID-19 vaccine trials won’t last for months but years as researchers watch for long-term side effects, so staying in touch is crucial.

“There are all sorts of people who drop out. They lose interest. They move, they get a new cell phone,” Hiatt said.

While it’s unethical to pay volunteers large sums of money to take part in clinical trials, volunteers can expect to be compensated for their time and effort. What other trials will offer isn’t known, but the Moderna Phase 1 trial, which launched in March, offered participants $100 for each in-person visit they completed.

The real cost is the medical staff who recruit, interview and track all the participants. It typically costs several hundred dollars per participant in staff time alone. For a clinical trial with 30,000 people in it, that’s upwards of $6 million. Every person who drops out means another must be added.

coronavirus,The Week - Opinion,0,https://www.theweek.com/articles/906134/compassion-fatigue-about-set-dont-succumb,Compassion fatigue is about to set in. Don't succumb.,2020-04-02,Jeva Lange,"This week , President Trump presented Americans with what his administration considers to be a realistic scenario : by the time the COVID-19 outbreak is over , somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans will be dead . That is `` a very low number , '' Trump explained to the press , adding that if fewer than 200,000 people die , he will consider his administration to have done `` a very good job . ''
Well , will they have ? It 's hard to wrap your head around a number like `` 100,000 , '' much less `` 200,000 '' or `` 2.2 million '' — the latter being the projection of the highly-regarded Imperial College study in the `` absence of any control measures , '' as well as the point of comparison by Trump for his projection being a success . But while the president has dramatically moved his own goalposts , having claimed a mere three weeks ago that 14,000 people dying is a `` disaster , '' it should go without saying that the conservative estimate of 100,000 people dead is not , in fact , `` a very good job . '' It is cataclysmic . It is also difficult to comprehend — it means 100,000 mothers , fathers , children , grandparents , cousins , neighbors , friends , teachers , health care workers , heroes , villains , billionaires , and homeless are gone forever . As the outbreak wears on and the death toll climbs , it is imperative that we do not stop reminding ourselves what the numbers truly mean — that we do not lose sight of the fact that while one death is a tragedy , a million are too .
Predictions for how many people will die by the time the outbreak is over run the gamut , so it 's difficult to pin down exactly what sort of numbers we 're actually talking about . Dr. Anthony Fauci described the estimate of between 100,000 and 200,000 as `` middle-of-the-road , '' NPR reports , while the higher-end estimates of 1 to 2 million dead are `` not impossible , but very , very unlikely , '' thanks to the growing lockdown measures being implemented across the country . The Imperial College study estimated 2.2 million dead in a scenario where no measures — like social distancing or the prohibition of nonessential businesses and gatherings — were taken , so it 's a bit misguiding to begin with . But some still think even the upper-end estimate of 200,000 is naïve ; Dr. Neil M. Ferguson , an epidemiologist who is `` regarded as one of the best disease modelers in the world , '' told The New York Times on March 20 that the best case scenario at this point is 1.1 million deaths in the United States .
But let 's stick with the most optimistic number for the moment : Trump 's 100,000 . That is a mind-bogglingly huge loss , the equivalent of 66 Titanics sinking , or 41 Pearl Harbors . It 's only about 16,000 or so short of the number of Americans who died in the first World War . According to The New York Times ' calculator , if 109,000 people die — still vastly fewer than the upper end of the White House 's estimate — coronavirus would be more deadly for Americans than diabetes , drug overdoses , pneumonia , the flu , and car crashes this year . It would be the sixth greatest overall cause of death in the country , and a top-10 cause of death for anyone over 50 , or under 19 . If 480,000 people die — that being the number presented by public heath researcher Dr. James Lawler to hospital executives , and quoted by the Times — COVID-19 would be the third leading cause of death in the country behind only heart disease and cancer , and with more total American victims than U.S. soldiers who died in World War II . If over 1.1 million people die , COVID-19 would have more victims than soldiers who died during the Civil War , or citizens who died during the 1918 Spanish Influenza . It would also be the leading cause of death in the country , with nearly as many fatalities as heart disease and cancer combined .
Those are just numbers , though ; even with context , they are elusive to grasp . The human psyche is n't built to comprehend tragedy at such a scale , and there is a real danger to succumbing to the belief that 100,000 or more dead is in fact `` very good '' and `` very low . '' What does 100,000 people even look like ? ( If each person was a second , it 'd total more than 27 hours ; if each person was a star , it 'd take 50 clear night skies to see them all ) . And thus , here we are , falling prey to two of our most seductive coping mechanisms when faced with calamity : compassion fatigue , and psychic numbing .
Compassion fatigue is a phrase more commonly used in relation to disaster relief , when too much bad news in the media eventually exhausts the empathy of readers or potential donors . What 's alarming is that the fatigue sets in fast ; in a study by economists Philip Brown and Jessica Minty , cited by Psychology Today , `` donations to disaster victims made through the internet peaked approximately one week after the disaster . From then on , fatigue kicked in ... By the end of three weeks post-disaster , donations had slowed to a trickle . '' While Americans are going through a catastrophe distinctly different than , say , a hurricane devastating some far-away city — this is more like the entire world is in a hurricane together , and it 's going to last months — we 're nevertheless reaching the end of our `` compassion '' window right about now . Particularly for those Americans who are lucky enough to not have had their own lives or loved ones threatened by COVID-19 , it can be wearying to maintain a heightened sense of alarm and care about some anonymous 100,000 .
Psychic numbing is also a challenge . Numbers like 100,000 are difficult to care about ; we can understand abstractly that it 's horrifying , but it 's also sterile and detached . A number does n't tell you about the excruciating pain of `` effectively drowning '' as the virus takes over your body , or about husbands who never get to say goodbye to their wives , or about decisions made by anguished doctors over who gets to live , and who 's going to die . `` The reported numbers of deaths represent dry statistics , 'human beings with the tears dried off , ' that fail to spark emotion or feeling and thus fail to motivate action , '' writes University of Oregon psychologist Paul Slovic , specifically in reference to our reaction to atrocities like genocide , although it also applies here .
What 's even more terrifying is how few people it takes dying for us to start losing the ability to muster empathy ; as Slovic and his colleagues found , `` 'compassion fade ' can occur when an incident involving a single person expands to as few as two people . '' Slovic , though , is not the first to have studied this phenomenon ; it was first observed after the incomprehensible toll of the Hiroshima bombing ( in which 146,000 people died , in the middle range of the White House 's coronavirus estimates ) . There , numbness was beneficial ; it helped first responders and survivors to not become paralyzed with trauma . But also , as psychologist Robert Ornstein and biologist Paul Ehrlich once argued , and as Paul Slovic and his son Scott Slovic have paraphrased , `` we were , in a sense , cave men and cave women , struggling to deal with modern problems , like nuclear annihilation , to which our minds were not suited . ''
Our minds are not suited for a tragedy of this scale either . That is both a blessing and a curse — a blessing , in that we need to be able to move forward somehow , and function as a society , to help as many as people as possible now and to so restore whatever we can for those left after . It is a curse , too , because we are at a loss for grasping the magnitude of what is happening , and it is our compassion and empathy that make us human .
Just listen to that number : One hundred thousand . Do not let anyone tell you it is nothing . Do n't accept it as the toll that must dutifully be paid . Do not forget that many of those deaths will have been preventable . Do not lose your ability to be horrified , do not lose your ability to grieve . Even if only briefly , for a moment , for a pause , for a heartbeat , remember that each person in that 100,000 will have had a life , as precious and real as your own .

coronavirus,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/16/politics/donald-trump-reopening-guidelines-coronavirus/index.html,"Trump completes reversal, telling govs 'you are going to call your own shots' and distributes new guidelines",2020-04-16,"Kevin Liptak, Kristen Holmes, Ryan Nobles","( CNN ) President Donald Trump unveiled new guidelines on Thursday meant to help states loosen their social distancing restrictions , but in a retreat from his onetime claim of `` absolute authority '' to restart the economy , he told governors on an afternoon telephone call it was their decision on when and how to reopen .
`` You are going to call your own shots , '' Trump said , according to a person familiar with the conversation . `` I 've gotten to know almost all of you , most of you I 've known and some very well . You are all very capable people , I think in all cases , very capable people . And you 're going to be calling your shots . ''
It was a turnabout from his Monday claim that `` the President of the United States calls the shots '' in how to ease restrictions that have kept most Americans indoors and forced closures of schools , restaurants , gyms and other businesses . And it was an indication that even as he tries to ease the country out of its virtual shutdown , Trump will place responsibility elsewhere should cases spike again .
As business leaders , lawmakers and governors warn persistent testing shortfalls could hamper any effort to reopen the country , Trump is pushing ahead with attempts to revive an economy moribund by the coronavirus pandemic . He said during his daily news conference the new guidelines amount to the start of the country 's `` rejuvenation . ''
`` We 're starting our life again , '' Trump said , even as it remains to be seen just how quickly any state returns to normal .
The new guidelines , meant to speed Trump 's goal of restarting the country , wo n't be mandatory . Many governors have already extended restrictions into May or banded into regional collectives that will determine their own reopening plans . The newest consortium was created in the Midwest on Thursday by Democratic and Republican governors .
But Trump , eager to see a return to normalcy for housebound Americans , wants to provide at least a framework for how places can reopen despite warnings from all corners that testing capacity for coronavirus is still too small .

''","(CNN) President Donald Trump unveiled new guidelines on Thursday meant to help states loosen their social distancing restrictions, but in a retreat from his onetime claim of ""absolute authority"" to restart the economy, he told governors on an afternoon telephone call it was their decision on when and how to reopen.

""You are going to call your own shots,"" Trump said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. ""I've gotten to know almost all of you, most of you I've known and some very well. You are all very capable people, I think in all cases, very capable people. And you're going to be calling your shots.""

It was a turnabout from his Monday claim that ""the President of the United States calls the shots"" in how to ease restrictions that have kept most Americans indoors and forced closures of schools, restaurants, gyms and other businesses. And it was an indication that even as he tries to ease the country out of its virtual shutdown, Trump will place responsibility elsewhere should cases spike again.

As business leaders, lawmakers and governors warn persistent testing shortfalls could hamper any effort to reopen the country, Trump is pushing ahead with attempts to revive an economy moribund by the coronavirus pandemic. He said during his daily news conference the new guidelines amount to the start of the country's ""rejuvenation.""

""We're starting our life again,"" Trump said, even as it remains to be seen just how quickly any state returns to normal.

The new guidelines , meant to speed Trump's goal of restarting the country, won't be mandatory. Many governors have already extended restrictions into May or banded into regional collectives that will determine their own reopening plans. The newest consortium was created in the Midwest on Thursday by Democratic and Republican governors.

But Trump, eager to see a return to normalcy for housebound Americans, wants to provide at least a framework for how places can reopen despite warnings from all corners that testing capacity for coronavirus is still too small.

He said Thursday there were some states that, according to his new plan, could be ready to reopen tomorrow.

""If you look at Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota -- that's a lot different than New York, it's a lot different than New Jersey,"" Trump said.

New guidelines

In a document provided to all 50 US governors during an afternoon phone call and obtained by CNN, the White House spelled out a three-phase approach to easing restrictions that depends on meeting specific case count and hospital capacity thresholds.

The benchmarks for the first phase include a sustained decrease in cases over a 14-day period and a return to pre-crisis conditions in hospitals, according to the document.

States should have the ""ability to quickly set up safe and efficient screening and testing sites,"" the guidelines read, and ""quickly and independently supply sufficient Personal Protective Equipment"" in hospitals.

The phased approach encourages all individuals to continue good hygiene practices like washing hands and to ""strongly consider"" using face coverings in public. And the document encourages employers to enact social distancing, temperature checks, testing and sanitation practices in their workplaces.

In the first phase of reopening, the document suggests schools that are currently closed should remain so and employees who are able to telework should keep working from home.

Large venues, including some restaurants, can operate under strict social distancing protocols. Gyms can open as long as they maintain social distancing guidelines, but bars should remain shuttered.

The guidelines still recommend minimizing nonessential travel, and indicate vulnerable populations should remain sheltered-in-place.

Phases two and three gradually decrease the recommended restrictions.

Trump unveiled the guidelines publicly at an early evening news conference.

""We are not opening all at once but one careful step at a time,"" Trump said, indicating each state could ""tailor"" its own reopening plan. ""If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that.""

In his call with governors, Trump previewed the plan but insisted it would be up to the individual governors to make the decision in their own states when they begin that process.

""It was a little bit of a negotiation that that's the way it should be,"" Trump said. ""I guess, I hope it is that way usually, but we all do want to see things open.""

Birx described the guidelines as ""fairly strict"" in order to give states time to get testing and surveillance ready.

""That's to give states really the time to really set up exactly how they're going to contact trace with the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in the background as supporting,"" Birx said on CNN's Global Town Hall, ""Coronavirus: Facts and Fears.""

""I think those two pieces together, we really need to move forward over the next few weeks as the states move through, and really decrease the number of cases.""

Trump said he believed there could be nearly 30 states in ""extremely good shape,"" and repeated his assertion that certain places may be able to reopen sooner than May 1.

As part of Pelosi’s coronavirus plan, House Democrats slipped in multiple measures from their H.R. 1 legislation that would implement nationwide ballot harvesting for federal elections — effectively allowing political operatives to collect and deliver an endless number of absentee ballots from voters.

Pelosi’s coronavirus plan allows “any person to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot” to a designated election office or post office and does not limit the number of absentee ballots that any one person can collect.

California is the only state in the United States to legalize ballot harvesting, though the practice occurs in other states as well. Pelosi’s coronavirus plan would legalize California-style ballot harvesting in every state for federal elections.

Pelosi’s coronavirus plan also mandates nationwide same-day voter registration, where eligible voters are allowed to register to vote on the same day as the 2020 presidential election and every federal election after that. Pelosi would also ban states from requiring voter registration applicants to provide more than the last four digits of their Social Security Numbers when applying to vote.

Likewise, Pelosi’s coronavirus plan mandates:

Early voting in every state for 15 consecutive days, open for at least 10 hours a day

Free mail-in absentee ballots for all registered voters

Expansion of election ballots in foreign languages

Pelosi’s coronavirus plan uses the pandemic to cram provisions of the House Democrats’ H.R. 1 legislation into federal law. That legislation went even further in its efforts to create loopholes for voter fraud, allowing convicted felons to vote in federal elections.

House Democrats on Monday blocked the passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which would have provided direct relief to American workers, citizens, and small businesses impacted by the coronavirus crisis.

A state official called Kapoor the next day and told him to get tested at the Agra District Hospital .
He was positive - and so were his father , mother , son , wife and brother . All six were moved to a hospital in New Delhi , about 200km ( 124 miles ) to the north . `` My brother and I had a sore throat and the other four did n't have any symptoms , '' Kapoor told Reuters News Agency .

Local authorities identified an epicentre for each cluster of infections and drew three-kilometre ( 1.9-mile ) wide containment zones around them . They surveyed residents in those areas , looking for those who had contact with people who tested positive for the coronavirus or who were showing symptoms . Nearly 3,000 workers screened some 165,000 households , according to a government presentation .
Meanwhile , epidemiologists from the federal government 's India Epidemic Intelligence Service arrived in Agra to help with containment , contact tracing and analysing data , said Dr Anshul Pareek , who leads the city 's coronavirus rapid response team .

The effort was helped by the nationwide lockdown on March 25 that stopped all public transport , shut businesses and kept residents at home .
`` Without a lockdown , we could not have done anything , '' Singh said .
By early April , a patient linked to the Tablighi group showed up at an Agra hospital and later tested positive for COVID-19 , officials said . The disease spread rapidly among patients and staff who went on to infect their families and relatives . New cases also popped up in Agra 's other healthcare facilities .
Worst hit was Paras Hospital , the source of at least 92 coronavirus cases , Singh said . One staff member infected 14 others in a two-room home , he said . In another case , a patient from the hospital infected 32 others in a nearby town , he added .
The hospital was sealed off on April 6 . Late last month , a chart tracking contacts of positive patients linked to the facility still stood next to Singh 's desk .

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo welcomed the president's claim to his commander in chief role in the crisis and his resolve, ""The president and I agreed yesterday. . . we're fighting the same war — and this is a war.""

Some measures already taken do call to mind actions in wartime.

Commercial airline flights have been reduced or canceled.

Schools have been closed. Universities have shut their doors.

Where Ford, Chrysler, GM and other great auto companies shifted production to jeeps, tanks and bombers in 1942, U.S. auto factories have today been shut down to prevent the spread of the virus.

Bars and restaurants are being closed.

This month, millions of Americans will be added to unemployment rolls, and millions of senior citizens and elderly have already followed government directives to ""self-isolate"" or ""shelter in place.""

There is talk of quarantines lasting not days or weeks, as Americans knew in the days of measles, mumps, chickenpox, scarlet fever and polio, but months.

While a new social solidarity and spirit of self-sacrifice seem to be manifesting themselves in this pandemic, can it endure?

Is the country prepared for months, or years, of social isolation, if that is what is required to win this war?

It's a question that needs to be addressed.

Consider. The Chinese government, whose word is admittedly suspect, claims to have achieved a deceleration in the daily number of new coronavirus infections. The South Koreans say they, too, have broken and reversed the momentum of the spread of the virus.

On March 3, the number of new cases of the coronavirus reported across South Korea was 852. On St. Patrick's Day, March 17, exactly two weeks later, the count was 85 new cases— a plunge of 90%.

South Korea appears to have ""flattened the curve.""

We Americans, however, are far from that.

Exactly how far behind South Korea we are cannot be known until more tens of thousands of Americans are tested, and we learn how many cases of the disease are out there undiscovered and unreported.

But whatever the success of Asian nations in containing the virus, are we politically and socially able to impose the same draconian measures?

Ordering people to ""shelter in place"" in their own homes, not just for days or weeks but months — can this be done in a free society, as it can be done in the surveillance state of Communist China?

Can mayors and governors of beach towns along the East Coast from Maine to Miami, and the Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas, keep tens of millions from gathering on beaches this summer?

Last week, we saw college kids cavorting on Florida's beaches, despite warnings that any one among them infected with COVID-19 could transmit it to the rest, leading to grave illness and, in some cases, death.

Moreover, they could become carriers of the disease to parents and siblings.

They did not seem to care. As Prohibition proved, Americans are a rule-breaking people.

Scores of thousands are injured in auto accidents and thousands killed each year from driving under the influence of alcohol — despite tough laws against drunk driving.

Since the 1960s, laws against the use of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, have not halted the rampant ingestion of illegal narcotics and dangerous drugs.

We are endlessly admonished that climate change poses an existential threat to the planet.

But have the elites who profess to believe this given up flying in private jets?

Have Americans given up their SUVs or ceased to heat their homes with oil and gas?

Are parents going to be able to confine to their homes children whose lives are built around friends on playgrounds? Is the crowd on Martha's Vineyard going to give up socializing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus?

But if, in diverse cities, minority communities come out for block parties in summer, are we going to have the police march them back into their homes?

Do we have enough cops for that?

A prediction: The longer the orders to shelter in place and self-isolate remain in force, the greater the probability they will begin to be ignored and people will take the risks to end their isolation and be with friends.

Will Americans suffer in social isolation, inside their own homes for months, while a state-induced Great Depression washes over the land?

My guess is that many will rebel.

The number of people infected with a new virus in China tripled over the weekend, with the outbreak spreading from Wuhan to other major cities.

There are now more than 200 cases, mostly in Wuhan, though the respiratory illness has also been detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.

Three people have died. Japan, Thailand and South Korea have reported cases.

What we know about the virus

2019-nCoV, as it's been labelled, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans

Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people

Scientists believe an animal source is ""the most likely primary source"" but that some human-to-human transmission has occurred

Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties

People are being advised to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms

Who has been infected?

Authorities in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million that has been at the heart of the outbreak, on Monday said 136 new cases had been confirmed over the weekend, with a third person dying of the virus. There had previously been only 62 confirmed cases in the city.

As of late Sunday, officials said 170 people in Wuhan were still being treated in hospital, including nine in critical condition.

Beijing also confirmed its first cases, with five people infected. Shanghai confirmed its first case on Monday - a 56-year-old woman who came from Wuhan.

In the city of Shenzhen, a major tech hub close to Hong Kong, officials said a 66-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan.

State media reported 14 other cases in Guangdong province.

Four cases have been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand, one in Japan and one in South Korea - all of them involving people who are either from Wuhan or have visited the city.

In South Korea, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 35-year-old Chinese woman was suffering from a fever and respiratory problems after travelling there from Wuhan. She was put into isolation and treated at a local hospital.

The World Health Organization said it was currently not recommending restrictions on travel or trade, but was providing guidance to countries preparing for any outbreak.

Airports in Singapore, Hong Kong and the Japanese capital Tokyo have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities last week announced similar measures at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.

What are the Chinese authorities saying?

How China is responding to the outbreak is under close scrutiny, given that it was widely criticised for initially covering up the Sars crisis in late 2002 and early 2003.

On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly addressed the outbreak, saying that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"".

The foreign ministry, meanwhile, said China was providing ""timely information about the disease"" and would ""work with all parties to deal with the virus"".

China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed that two cases in China were due to human-to-human transmission, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The commission had earlier said there had been no such cases, but that the virus had instead crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan.

The WHO also said it believed there had been ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"".

""As more… cases are identified and more analysis undertaken, we will get a clearer picture of disease severity and transmission patterns,"" it wrote on Twitter.

It noted that the rise in cases in China was a result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"".

What impact could Lunar New Year have?

From Friday, most Chinese will begin their week-long Lunar New Year holidays.

It's a time when hundreds of millions travel around China to visit family, raising fears that authorities will not be able to adequately monitor further spread of the disease.

Wuhan is a transport hub and authorities there have for nearly a week been using temperature scanners at airports, and train and bus stations. Those showing signs of fever have been registered, given masks and taken to hospitals and clinics.

coronavirus,Washington Post,0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/25/meat-industry-is-trying-get-back-normal-workers-are-still-getting-sick-shortages-may-get-worse/,The meat industry is trying to get back to normal. But workers are still getting sick — and shortages may get worse.,2020-05-25,"Taylor Telford, Reporter Covering National, Breaking News","Despite those efforts , the number of Tyson employees with the coronavirus has exploded from less than 1,600 a month ago to more than 7,000 today , according to a ███ analysis of news reports and public records .
What has happened at Tyson — and in the meat industry overall — shows how difficult it is to get the nation back to normal , even in essential fields such as food processing . Meat companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on measures such as protective gear , paid leave and ventilation systems since they were forced to shut dozens of plants that were among the top coronavirus hot spots outside urban areas .
But the industry has still experienced a surge in cases , and some companies say they are limited in just how much they can keep workers separated from one another . Only a portion of the labor force has gone back to work — some workers kept away on purpose — and the nation ’ s meat supply remains deeply strained as barbecue season gets underway .
A May report from CoBank , which specializes in serving rural America , warns that meat supplies in grocery stores could shrink as much as 35 percent , prices could spike 20 percent and the impact could become even “ more acute later this year ” as the knock-on effects on the U.S. agriculture supply chain are felt .
Grocery stores have been able to partially meet consumer demand thanks to meat already in the supply chain in March , when the pandemic broke out , but the report said those supplies were quickly being used up .
The prospect of long-term shortages is giving rise to an intensifying debate about whether the industry should reopen faster or whether safety should be prioritized , even at the cost of the nation ’ s food supply .
With an April 28 executive order encouraging meat plants to reopen , the Trump administration has said the food supply must be weighted equally with safety . Over the past month , more than half of the 30 meat processing plants that had shuttered because of the coronavirus have reopened .
“ Our objective is two equal goals , ” Vice President Pence said in a meeting with Iowa Gov . Kim Reynolds ( R ) in early May . “ Number one is the safety and health of the workforce in our meat processing plants , and , two , there ’ s strength in our food supply and getting people back to work . ”
But others say that safety must be the paramount concern — and that the industry still has a long way to go before facilities are safe again .
“ Absolutely , positively , no worker ’ s life is worth my getting a cheaper hamburger . No worker ’ s life is worth that , ” former vice president Joe Biden , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , said at a Yahoo News virtual town hall last week .
Officials with the meat processors say they are doing whatever they can to protect workers , while trying to make sure the nation ’ s food supply remains sound .
“ The safety of our team members is paramount , and we only reopen our facilities when we believe we can safely do so , ” said Gary Mickelson , Tyson ’ s director of media relations .
What ’ s clear is that the industry ’ s efforts so far , though they may have lessened the virus ’ s spread , have not come close to stopping it . Over the past month , the number of infections tied to three of the country ’ s biggest meat processors — Tyson Foods , Smithfield Foods and JBS — has gone from just over 3,000 to more than 11,000 , according to the Post analysis .
Throughout the industry , worker deaths have tripled , surging from 17 to at least 63 , according to the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting , which is tracking outbreaks through local news reports .
Four of the plants that reopened saw outbreaks , with more than 700 positive cases , according to the center : Tyson Foods operations in Logansport , Ind. , Perry , Iowa , and Waterloo , Iowa ; and a Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls , S.D .
In Iowa , Nebraska and South Dakota , coronavirus cases linked to meat workers represent 18 , 20 and 29 percent of the states ’ total cases , respectively , according to the Environmental Working Group , a nonprofit advocacy organization .
Many plants that have reopened are operating at reduced capacity , either because of widespread absences or to reduce the number of workers on a shift to allow for social distancing . Closures have affected 45,000 workers , according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union , the largest organization representing meatpacking workers .
JBS , the second-largest meat processor in the United States , said it is paying workers who could be particularly vulnerable to covid-19 — about 10 percent of its workforce — to stay home .
The debate over reopening , even amid safer conditions , can present difficult choices .
Meat plants are usually located in rural areas , where they are among the largest employers . Coronavirus infection rates in communities within 15 miles of meat plants are twice the national average , according to the Environmental Working Group .
The recent closures have cascaded through local economies , as farmers who supply plants are left with nowhere to take their animals . The National Pork Producers Council estimates that current plant capacities are creating backlogs of 170,000 hogs a day .
“ These hogs will eventually stay on farms too long and grow too large to be accepted by harvest facilities . It is estimated that up to 10,069,000 market hogs will need to be euthanized , ” the pork producer group said in a recent fact sheet .
Although companies have tried to get back to normal operations , union and local officials question whether they are , in fact , ready .
Tyson ’ s biggest pork plant , in Waterloo , reopened May 7 with new safety precautions and social distancing policies . “ Our top priority is the health and safety of our team members , their loved ones and our communities , ” Tom Hart , the plant ’ s manager , said in a news release .
Tyson had just finished running a national ad campaign warning , “ The food supply chain is breaking . ”
But the Waterloo plant reopened the same day that health officials in Black Hawk County , where it is located , reported that more than 1,000 employees out of 2,700 there had tested positive for the coronavirus .
“ Tyson did not go above and beyond , ” said state Rep. Ras Smith ( D ) , who represents Waterloo . “ They did what they already should have done. ” He called Tyson ’ s handling of the outbreak “ appalling . ”
Smith and fellow state Rep. Timi Brown-Powers ( D ) said they suspect that President Trump ’ s executive order encouraged Tyson to reopen faster , a point the company disputes . The plant shuttered April 22 after weeks of resisting calls from local officials . The lawmakers said they met with the plant ’ s human resources director on May 1 and were told that the facility was weeks away from reopening .
Four days later , they said , they were told that production would resume May 7 . They said there was no explanation for the new timeline .
“ It really doesn ’ t feel like our local Tyson was in this big of a hurry to reopen , ” Brown-Powers said . “ It became a hurry for them because of the pressure they ’ re getting from above . ”
Mickelson , Tyson ’ s spokesman , said in an email to The Post that the executive order had helped by providing “ clear , uniform standards ” for how processing facilities should protect workers and by giving the company better access to protective gear . But he said it didn ’ t accelerate the reopening of the facility .
When he announced the executive order on April 28 , Trump initially said it would solve “ liability problems ” for companies and force them to stay open during the pandemic .
“ Now that Trump issued that executive order , it gives plants this insurmountable feeling that they are invincible , ” said Kim Cordova , a local union president in Greeley , Colo. , where a JBS beef plant was shuttered in April amid a coronavirus outbreak that has killed at least seven workers .
In practice , the order was more narrow , legal experts said . It designated meat producers as critical infrastructure and ordered them to follow federal guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration . It also enabled Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to take steps to get meat companies federal contracts and access to protective gear .
OSHA — the federal agency in charge of worker safety — has not issued enforceable guidelines for protecting employees from the coronavirus , as it did during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 , instead opting for voluntary guidance . The agency has said it plans no enforcement action so as not to overly burden companies during the pandemic .
Smithfield cited the Trump executive order in federal court in Missouri , arguing that it meant local and state authorities no longer had authority over meat processors . It was part of the company ’ s defense in a lawsuit filed by an unnamed employee alleging that Smithfield failed to protect workers by not accommodating social distancing and by discouraging sick employees from staying home .
“ The president has identified state interference with meat and poultry processors as ‘ undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency , ’ ” Smithfield ’ s attorneys said in court documents . “ State law , whether statutory or through private lawsuits , can not be used to regulate the subject matter covered by the EO . This task belongs exclusively to the federal government . ”
U.S. District Judge David Gregory Kays dismissed the case 12 days later , citing the “ significant steps ” Smithfield had taken to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection at its plant in Milan , Mo .
In a news release , the company praised the outcome of the case , which it said was “ frivolous , full of specious allegations that were without factual or legal merit . ”
Less than two weeks after the case was dismissed , voluntary testing at the Milan plant revealed an outbreak at the facility , according to local news reports and the worker behind the lawsuit . She told The Post that fearful employees have been staying home , and those who do show up for shifts are working overtime to keep up production .
“ They could have listened to workers and protected the company and the people by being proactive , ” said David Muraskin , the worker ’ s attorney . “ Now that they ’ ve failed to do the right thing , their responsibility is to make sure they take care of their workers and pay them their wages while the company puts in place the protections that should have been there all along to protect the community . ”
Smithfield said the Milan plant is “ operational ” but declined to provide further details about absences and production capacity . The company said it would not confirm coronavirus cases “ out of respect for employees ’ legal privacy . ”
On April 16 , the JBS beef plant in Greeley was forced to shut down after roughly 100 workers contracted the virus and three died . Another worker died during the closure , and four others since the facility reopened April 24 .
Coronavirus cases at the plant now exceed 300 , Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment records show .
“ We are raising hell because the numbers continue to rise , ” said Cordova , the local union president . “ People are scared to go to work because people keep getting sick . There are hundreds of workers who have not come back . We don ’ t know if they have moved on , if they are on ventilators . We can ’ t find them . ”
Nikki Richardson , a JBS spokeswoman , said in an email that the company has adopted more than $ 100 million in enhanced safety measures throughout its facilities , including “ increased sanitation and disinfection efforts , health screening and temperature checking , team member training , physical distancing , reduced line speeds and increased availability of personal protective equipment , including face masks and face shields . ”
Cordova toured the Greeley plant last week and said improvements have been made on the processing side , where beef is cut into steaks , ribs and briskets . Metal dividers have been installed between workers , and protective equipment has been placed next to workstations so employees can avoid congregating to pick up their supplies .
Still , she said , additional safety measures need to be taken to lessen the risk of infection . Employees are still crowded in halls and stairways . Because of the loud noise in the plant , workers take off their masks and lean in close to speak to supervisors .
In the area where cattle are slaughtered , Cordova said , plastic dividers between work stations have yet to be installed .
“ They are on rafters , right next to one another , ” she said .
Richardson said the company the company is trying its hardest .
“ We are doing the best we can to ensure social distancing in the facility , but we recognize the challenges that exist to maintain social distancing in areas where people naturally congregate , ” Richardson said in an email to The Post . “ We have hired people to be part of an employee health team that is responsible for covid-19 program management , compliance and auditing , including enforcing social distancing . ”","Despite those efforts, the number of Tyson employees with the coronavirus has exploded from less than 1,600 a month ago to more than 7,000 today, according to a Washington Post analysis of news reports and public records.

What has happened at Tyson — and in the meat industry overall — shows how difficult it is to get the nation back to normal, even in essential fields such as food processing. Meat companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on measures such as protective gear, paid leave and ventilation systems since they were forced to shut dozens of plants that were among the top coronavirus hot spots outside urban areas.

But the industry has still experienced a surge in cases, and some companies say they are limited in just how much they can keep workers separated from one another. Only a portion of the labor force has gone back to work — some workers kept away on purpose — and the nation’s meat supply remains deeply strained as barbecue season gets underway.

A May report from CoBank, which specializes in serving rural America, warns that meat supplies in grocery stores could shrink as much as 35 percent, prices could spike 20 percent and the impact could become even “more acute later this year” as the knock-on effects on the U.S. agriculture supply chain are felt.

Grocery stores have been able to partially meet consumer demand thanks to meat already in the supply chain in March, when the pandemic broke out, but the report said those supplies were quickly being used up.

The prospect of long-term shortages is giving rise to an intensifying debate about whether the industry should reopen faster or whether safety should be prioritized, even at the cost of the nation’s food supply.

With an April 28 executive order encouraging meat plants to reopen, the Trump administration has said the food supply must be weighted equally with safety. Over the past month, more than half of the 30 meat processing plants that had shuttered because of the coronavirus have reopened.

“Our objective is two equal goals,” Vice President Pence said in a meeting with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) in early May. “Number one is the safety and health of the workforce in our meat processing plants, and, two, there’s strength in our food supply and getting people back to work.”

AD

But others say that safety must be the paramount concern — and that the industry still has a long way to go before facilities are safe again.

“Absolutely, positively, no worker’s life is worth my getting a cheaper hamburger. No worker’s life is worth that,” former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said at a Yahoo News virtual town hall last week.

Officials with the meat processors say they are doing whatever they can to protect workers, while trying to make sure the nation’s food supply remains sound.

“The safety of our team members is paramount, and we only reopen our facilities when we believe we can safely do so,” said Gary Mickelson, Tyson’s director of media relations.

As the first wave of COVID-19 hits communities during primary season , states are still resolving how to hold elections in the middle of a pandemic . Voter advocates and organizers see the primaries as a test run , with many assuming that the November general election will also need to adapt to COVID-19 . Since April , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield , a virologist , and epidemiologists have predicted that another , potentially worse , wave of the virus will hit communities this fall and winter .
Universal vote-by-mail is being promoted by secretaries of State and voter advocates alike as a clear solution to balancing voter access and public health concerns . In this area , the West leads the way . “ The crux of it is : Let ’ s make it as simple as possible for people to get a ballot , ” said Heather Smith , executive director for ACLU of Wyoming , South Dakota and North Dakota . “ Now is the time to be thinking about November and making sure that processes are in place for the least amount of disruption possible to the voting system . ”
When it comes to Election Day , Western states might be more prepared to face pandemic-related election challenges than the rest of the US Most of the nation uses traditional in-person voting in a poll booth . But in 2018 , 69 percent of votes in the West were cast by mail , according to the Vote at Home Institute , a nonpartisan , vote-by-mail advocacy nonprofit . That compares to just 27 percent in the rest of the nation . Of the five states that vote entirely by mail pre-COVID-19 , four are in the West : Oregon has done so since 2000 , Washington , Colorado and Utah joining in the last decade . And Western states that don ’ t have statewide vote-by-mail still have high numbers of residents who use absentee ballots . The majority of voters in Arizona , Montana and California participate in their state ’ s elections from afar ( though California Gov . Gavin Newsom has already declared November ’ s election will be entirely vote-by-mail ) . Nevada and New Mexico also depart from tradition , with the majority casting their votes early , before Election Day .
Why is the region so different from the rest of the US ? In short , it ’ s geography and a history of electoral reform . Western states are much larger and , generally , their populations are more dispersed than the rest of the country . Vote-by-mail has historically been decided on a county-by-county basis , making it a local government decision . Phil Keisling , the former Oregon secretary of State who helped usher vote-by-mail in Oregon in the 1990s , says that it ’ s popular not only among voters , but also among local election officials—a sign of its grassroots success . “ This has been one of the keys of its evolution in the West : Locally elected county clerks , some elected on a partisan basis , others on a nonpartisan basis , have been at the vanguard of this approach to elections . ”
“ Locally elected county clerks , some elected on a partisan basis , others on a nonpartisan basis , have been at the vanguard of this approach to elections . ”
The history of vote-by-mail has had its heated partisan moments , just as it does today , selectively championed by both Democrats and Republicans . In 1981 in Oregon , Linn County Clerk Del Riley wondered if he could improve the county ’ s election process by moving entirely to vote-by-mail , since the county already mailed sample and absentee ballots . Working with Secretary of State Norma Paulus , a Republican and the first woman elected to statewide office , they got the Republican-controlled Oregon state Legislature to agree to a test of vote-by-mail after observing a mailed election in San Diego in 1981 . From there , it expanded ; by 1987 , all counties could conduct local elections by mail . Less than a decade later , Republican proponents decided to take vote-by-mail to back to the Legislature , this time to expand it to statewide elections . In 1995 , legislation to apply it to primary and general elections statewide passed the Republican House and Senate , but Democratic Gov . John Kitzhaber , listening to state and national Democrats , vetoed it .
“ There ’ s really no evidence that vote-by-mail favors one party over the other . ”
The partisan views flipped , however , when Oregon held a special election for a US Senate seat using vote-by-mail in 1996 . A Democrat , Ron Wyden , won the race , and the next time vote-by-mail legislation came up , the roles had reversed ; now Democrats were the champions , and Republicans the detractors . Republican House Majority Rep. Lynn Snodgrass wrote in a 1997 op-ed that voting by mail would “ destroy the integrity of the principal of why we vote in the first place , ” arguing that coercion and fraud would take place . An aide to Republican House Speaker Bev Clarno ( who is currently secretary of State and supports vote-by-mail ) said it would help Democrats “ because there are more of them. ” Politics stymied the effort in the Legislature that year , but a volunteer-backed ballot initiative brought the question to voters in 1998 . By then , some Oregon residents had been voting in local elections by mail for 17 years already , and the majority of voters supported it statewide . It passed . “ The parties in Oregon argued back and forth about which party would get an edge from it , ” said Priscilla Southwell , professor of political science at University of Oregon . “ There ’ s really no evidence that vote-by-mail favors one party over the other . ”
Today , there is bipartisan support in states that use vote-by-mail , and recent polls show the majority of Americans would support vote-by-mail elections . Because of the last two decades of successful elections in Oregon—where voter turnout is among the nation ’ s highest—vote-at-home advocates point to a ready-made model that other states can adapt . Still , advocates say transitioning states will need to work with tribal governments , Latino communities , rural areas and other historically disenfranchised voters to make sure there ’ s awareness of the changes , and that early voting and vote centers remain an option for those unable to vote-by-mail , with social distancing measures in place .
The key difference among the Western states lies in their use of either vote-by-mail or absentee voting . And the approaches vary widely :
Before COVID-19 : Roughly 75 percent of Arizona voters were already absentee voters .
The plan : Instead of vote-by-mail , Arizona election officials will send out forms to registered voters to apply for an absentee ballot .
Will polls be open ? Yes , though it will vary county to county .
Before COVID-19 : Voters used absentee , early voting and Election Day voting . Idahoans must show their ID when voting at the polls .
The plan : Idaho will have its first statewide absentee voting election , and voters had to request an absentee ballot by May 8 . As of May 1 , more than 185,000 Idahoans had requested their ballots .
Will polls be open ? No . According to the office of Idaho ’ s secretary of State , fewer than 2 percent of the normal number of poll workers in one of the state ’ s largest counties were willing to facilitate the primaries during the pandemic .
Before COVID-19 : In the 2018 primary election , less than 10 % of voters signed up for absentee ballots , because most either voted early or used day-of polling sites .
The plan : This spring , in response to COVID-19 , the state Legislature passed a new law for universal vote-by-mail , which will send ballots to all “ active ” registered voters .
Will polls be open ? Not traditional polling sites , but every county will have at least one vote center .
Before COVID-19 : 90 percent of voters in Utah already use vote-by-mail .
Will polls be open ? No in-person voting will be available , but some counties are opting for a drive-up voting option . According to Utah ’ s secretary of State office , with the removal of in-person voting , voters will not be able to register at the polls on Election Day , though that has been allowed in the past .
Voting-access proponents say a universal vote-by-mail system is necessary , but note that accommodations such as increased educational campaigns are critical to make sure voters are not disenfranchised by the changes . “ This is particularly true for ethnic minority groups , ” said Sonja Diaz , founding director of UCLA ’ s Latino Policy & Politics Initiative . “ Young Latinos and Asian Americans in this country are the two fastest-growing demographic groups . And they are very young in age , especially in comparison to older white voters , and that means that you ’ re seeing a lot of first-time voters because they ’ re aging into the electorate . ”
Most secretary of State offices are still closed because of COVID-19 , meaning that voter registration has moved online . That ’ s a problem for many rural areas without access to broadband , including over 90 percent of Indigenous communities on reservations . Other barriers to Indigenous voters involve inadequate mailing services and lack of language assistance . According to Jacqueline De León ( Isleta Pueblo ) , an attorney for the Native American Rights Fund , it ’ s critical that state and county election officers work with tribal governments to identify and address those obstacles ahead of the primaries and the November election . “ Vote-by-mail has the potential to devastate the Native vote , ” De León said , “ because if you don ’ t have residential mail delivery , you ’ re not getting the ballot at your house . ”
This week , US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) , and House Democrats unveiled the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act , the latest coronavirus relief package . The HEROES Act would provide $ 3.6 billion to assist states in election changes like vote-by-mail , expanded early in-person voting and same-day or online voter registration . Pelosi has cited the importance of not forcing voters to choose between exercising their right to vote and contracting COVID-19 . “ What country do we want to live in ? ” said Keisling , Oregon ’ s former secretary of State . “ I ’ d rather live in a country where a lot more people are voting even when my candidates lose , than winning because we ’ ve lowered the turnout . ”","For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis and more, subscribe to Mother Jones' newsletters

As the first wave of COVID-19 hits communities during primary season, states are still resolving how to hold elections in the middle of a pandemic. Voter advocates and organizers see the primaries as a test run, with many assuming that the November general election will also need to adapt to COVID-19.

In 1981 in Oregon, Linn County Clerk Del Riley wondered if he could improve the county’s election process by moving entirely to vote-by-mail, since the county already mailed sample and absentee ballots. Working with Secretary of State Norma Paulus, a Republican and the first woman elected to statewide office, they got the Republican-controlled Oregon state Legislature to agree to a test of vote-by-mail after observing a mailed election in San Diego in 1981. From there, it expanded; by 1987, all counties could conduct local elections by mail. Less than a decade later, Republican proponents decided to take vote-by-mail to back to the Legislature, this time to expand it to statewide elections. In 1995, legislation to apply it to primary and general elections statewide passed the Republican House and Senate, but Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber, listening to state and national Democrats, vetoed it.

“There’s really no evidence that vote-by-mail favors one party over the other.”

The partisan views flipped, however, when Oregon held a special election for a US Senate seat using vote-by-mail in 1996. A Democrat, Ron Wyden, won the race, and the next time vote-by-mail legislation came up, the roles had reversed; now Democrats were the champions, and Republicans the detractors. Republican House Majority Rep. Lynn Snodgrass wrote in a 1997 op-ed that voting by mail would “destroy the integrity of the principal of why we vote in the first place,” arguing that coercion and fraud would take place. An aide to Republican House Speaker Bev Clarno (who is currently secretary of State and supports vote-by-mail) said it would help Democrats “because there are more of them.” Politics stymied the effort in the Legislature that year, but a volunteer-backed ballot initiative brought the question to voters in 1998. By then, some Oregon residents had been voting in local elections by mail for 17 years already, and the majority of voters supported it statewide. It passed. “The parties in Oregon argued back and forth about which party would get an edge from it,” said Priscilla Southwell, professor of political science at University of Oregon. “There’s really no evidence that vote-by-mail favors one party over the other.”

Today, there is bipartisan support in states that use vote-by-mail, and recent polls show the majority of Americans would support vote-by-mail elections. Because of the last two decades of successful elections in Oregon—where voter turnout is among the nation’s highest—vote-at-home advocates point to a ready-made model that other states can adapt. Still, advocates say transitioning states will need to work with tribal governments, Latino communities, rural areas and other historically disenfranchised voters to make sure there’s awareness of the changes, and that early voting and vote centers remain an option for those unable to vote-by-mail, with social distancing measures in place.

The key difference among the Western states lies in their use of either vote-by-mail or absentee voting. And the approaches vary widely:

Arizona

Primary date: Aug. 4

Before COVID-19: Roughly 75 percent of Arizona voters were already absentee voters.

The plan: Instead of vote-by-mail, Arizona election officials will send out forms to registered voters to apply for an absentee ballot.

Will polls be open? Yes, though it will vary county to county.

Idaho

Primary date: May 19

Before COVID-19: Voters used absentee, early voting and Election Day voting. Idahoans must show their ID when voting at the polls.

The plan: Idaho will have its first statewide absentee voting election, and voters had to request an absentee ballot by May 8. As of May 1, more than 185,000 Idahoans had requested their ballots.

Will polls be open? No. According to the office of Idaho’s secretary of State, fewer than 2 percent of the normal number of poll workers in one of the state’s largest counties were willing to facilitate the primaries during the pandemic.

Nevada

Primary date: June 9

Before COVID-19: In the 2018 primary election, less than 10% of voters signed up for absentee ballots, because most either voted early or used day-of polling sites.

The plan: This spring, in response to COVID-19, the state Legislature passed a new law for universal vote-by-mail, which will send ballots to all “active” registered voters.

Will polls be open? Not traditional polling sites, but every county will have at least one vote center.

Utah

Primary date: June 30

Before COVID-19: 90 percent of voters in Utah already use vote-by-mail.

Will polls be open? No in-person voting will be available, but some counties are opting for a drive-up voting option. According to Utah’s secretary of State office, with the removal of in-person voting, voters will not be able to register at the polls on Election Day, though that has been allowed in the past.

Voting-access proponents say a universal vote-by-mail system is necessary, but note that accommodations such as increased educational campaigns are critical to make sure voters are not disenfranchised by the changes. “This is particularly true for ethnic minority groups,” said Sonja Diaz, founding director of UCLA’s Latino Policy & Politics Initiative. “Young Latinos and Asian Americans in this country are the two fastest-growing demographic groups. And they are very young in age, especially in comparison to older white voters, and that means that you’re seeing a lot of first-time voters because they’re aging into the electorate.”

“Vote-by-mail has the potential to devastate the Native vote.”

Most secretary of State offices are still closed because of COVID-19, meaning that voter registration has moved online. That’s a problem for many rural areas without access to broadband, including over 90 percent of Indigenous communities on reservations. Other barriers to Indigenous voters involve inadequate mailing services and lack of language assistance. According to Jacqueline De León (Isleta Pueblo), an attorney for the Native American Rights Fund, it’s critical that state and county election officers work with tribal governments to identify and address those obstacles ahead of the primaries and the November election. “Vote-by-mail has the potential to devastate the Native vote,” De León said, “because if you don’t have residential mail delivery, you’re not getting the ballot at your house.”

This week, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and House Democrats unveiled the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, the latest coronavirus relief package. The HEROES Act would provide $3.6 billion to assist states in election changes like vote-by-mail, expanded early in-person voting and same-day or online voter registration. Pelosi has cited the importance of not forcing voters to choose between exercising their right to vote and contracting COVID-19. “What country do we want to live in?” said Keisling, Oregon’s former secretary of State. “I’d rather live in a country where a lot more people are voting even when my candidates lose, than winning because we’ve lowered the turnout.”",www.motherjones.com,left,VVN1hCVKnJobhaMg

coronavirus,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2020/3/17/21181115/coronavirus-military-response-national-guard,The Pentagon just offered ventilators for the coronavirus response. It could do much more.,2020-03-17,Alex Ward,"The Pentagon just offered ventilators for the coronavirus response . It could do much more .
Share All sharing options for : The Pentagon just offered ventilators for the coronavirus response . It could do much more .
With civilian hospitals increasingly overwhelmed and the coronavirus outbreak in America deepening , a question is coming up of whether there ’ s a bigger role the US military to play in responding .
“ We ’ re starting the process . And it ’ s a process — we hope it ’ s not going to be necessary , but it could be necessary , ” he said during the White House briefing on Tuesday morning .
Hours later , Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon would at least offer some support . He told reporters that his department would be willing to offer up to 2,000 ventilators and 5 million respirators if asked , as well as offer labs to test civilians for the disease .
But , Esper made sure to say , he believes calling up military to help in the coronavirus response should be a “ last resort . ”
That ’ s not all . The US military will also be sending the US Army Corps of Engineers to New York state to assess how to build more medical centers , and it will deploy the USNS Comfort — a large medical ship with room for 1,000 patients — off the coast of New York .
Experts tell me the Pentagon ’ s actions are a good start , but that defense officials could still do much , much more .
For over a century , America ’ s armed forces have dealt with medical crises across the globe . Many service members today have the expertise to assist with medical care ; build MASH hospitals ; provide shelter ; or transport food , medical equipment , and people to meet the needs of the public . That ’ s already happening in Georgia and Florida and New York , for example , where those states ’ National Guards were called to help combat Covid-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus .
“ The Department of Defense provides the ability to scale up like no other part of the US government can , ” Andrew Weber , the Pentagon ’ s top biological defense official from 2011 to 2014 , told me . “ Whatever is needed to mount an appropriate response , the military can do it at scale . ”
It ’ s important to note that America ’ s troops wouldn ’ t be leading efforts to combat Covid-19 . They ’ d be supporting civilian leaders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) or the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) with extra people , expertise , and technology .
That ’ s likely why , during the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night , former Vice President Joe Biden called for the military to be deployed across America . “ It ’ s a national emergency , and I would call out the military , ” he said . “ We ’ re at war with the virus . ”
But the military ’ s involvement isn ’ t a panacea , and it has strict limitations on what it can do . Laws prohibit most troops from performing law enforcement functions , for example , and its actions are curtailed to helping states with things like emergency medical treatment and evacuations .
What ’ s more , the military only has a few small hospitals in the United States that are set up to treat military medical problems like bodily trauma , top Pentagon officials told reporters on Monday . Those facilities aren ’ t particularly ready to deal with the coronavirus outbreak or provide what civilian hospitals might need .
In other words , the military can help , but it can ’ t solve the government ’ s response problems . It also doesn ’ t help that the Army alone , for instance , is short $ 1 billion to respond to the outbreak . “ We ’ re trying to be very careful about not overpromising , ” Air Force Brig . Gen. Paul Friedrichs , the Joint Staff surgeon , told reporters on Monday . However , experts and some at the Pentagon believe the military can come up with the money to help if it wanted to .
As of now , there ’ s no real indication Trump wants to deploy the military . Most jarring is that he doesn ’ t have a senior Pentagon official on his Coronavirus Task Force . ( It ’ s possible the military doesn ’ t want to be involved — more on that later . )
It ’ s therefore not as easy a call for Trump to make as some might think , but the dozen current and former defense officials and medical experts I spoke with say he should still use his authority to put the military to work now .
“ There ’ s just so much capacity in the Defense Department that ’ s completely untapped at the moment , and that ’ s a mistake , ” Kelly Magsamen , a former top Pentagon official in the Obama administration , told me .
The legality of using the US military in the coronavirus response
Before going into what the military could do to help with the coronavirus , it ’ s first important to know what it ’ s allowed to do at the president ’ s request .
The US military is barred from using its capabilities directly to enforce US domestic laws unless Congress specifically authorizes it to do so . This stipulation , known as “ posse comitatus , ” is why US troops can only support civilian agencies like FEMA but not take direct action themselves . Per FEMA ’ s own website , the military is prohibited from interdicting “ vehicles , conducting searches and seizures , making arrests or apprehensions , surveillance , investigation , or undercover work . ”
There ’ s no indication that long-standing statute is going to change anytime soon . However , this rule doesn ’ t apply to the National Guard and the Coast Guard — which means both services could perform law enforcement functions if asked by a state ’ s governor . That means they could conceivably block roads or keep people from visiting family and friends , though that would be a severe response and it ’ s unclear any governor wants to authorize that yet .
The president , or at least his lawyers , knows all this . On Friday , Trump issued two declarations to deal with the outbreak : one reliant on the Stafford Act , and one based on the National Emergencies Act .
As my colleague Ian Millhiser wrote , “ Title IV of the Stafford Act permits the president to declare that a particular crisis is a ‘ major disaster , ’ and such a declaration does provide the president with new powers that he may use to combat such a disaster. ” Additionally , the statute says “ all requests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected State . ”
So , as Millhiser notes , Trump “ can not simply issue a declaration and seize broad new powers . ”
There ’ s still plenty the US government can do under this act , including coordinating relief efforts , helping state governments , and handing out food and medicine as needed . If the military can be helpful in any of those endeavors , HHS , another agency , or a state ’ s governor can ask the Pentagon for assistance with them .
As for the National Emergencies Act , it gives the president more sweeping authorities , Elizabeth Goiten , the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center , wrote for the Atlantic on Monday . For Trump to use those authorities , though , he must “ specify which powers he intends to invoke , and he must issue updates if he adds new powers to the list , ” she explained .
It ’ s therefore possible that under this statute , Trump could order the military to do more than a state ’ s governor wants , but he ’ d have to notify everyone of those intentions .
What ’ s most likely to happen , though , is that the military will abide by its long-standing process and doctrine of “ Defense Support for Civilian Authorities , ” or DSCA .
For emergencies in the homeland like the coronavirus outbreak , the military sees its role as providing “ support to prepare , prevent , protect , respond , and recover from domestic incidents. ” Such support is “ provided in response to requests from civil authorities and upon approval from appropriate authorities . ”
US troops , then , won ’ t start deploying to parts of the country without HHS or other government agencies asking them to , and even then the military will act strictly in support of what that agency wants .
In essence , Trump couldn ’ t use the military as his own personal coronavirus response force and law enforcement agency . It ’ ll be subordinate to the government agencies that request its assistance . How a National Guard unit acts , though , is highly dependent on a state ’ s governor .
HHS has already asked the Pentagon for help with quarantining Americans coming back from Wuhan , China — where the outbreak started — as well as infected passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner . Military officials are also at the 11 feeder airports that passengers from abroad must go through for medical screenings before entering the US .
But so far , that ’ s it . “ We ’ ve not received any other [ requests ] at this time , ” Jonathan Hoffman , a top Pentagon spokesperson , told reporters on Monday .
Yet experts tell me that , if states and agencies would just request it , the Pentagon could be even more helpful .
There are four main ways the US military could assist in the country ’ s pandemic response : 1 ) provide care ; 2 ) assist with logistics ; 3 ) develop a vaccine or other treatment ; and 4 ) control crowds and provide other calming effects .
Even as Americans aim to “ flatten the curve ” to keep coronavirus cases in the country low , hospitals find that they ’ re struggling to keep up with the number of patients that need medical care . A dearth of hospital beds , ventilators , and rested physicians means a spike in people requiring hospitalization could greatly overwhelm the civilian health system .
Should those resources run low , the Defense Department “ could use authorities under the Defense Production Act to rapidly acquire a range of equipment such as N-95 respirators , gloves for medical personnel , and ventilators , ” James Miller , the top Pentagon policy official from 2012 to 2014 , told me .
The military also has thousands of physicians who could help treat patients . Dr. Angela Rasmussen , an infectious disease expert at Columbia University , told me the military could create new hospitals if needed — as New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo called on the Army Corps of Engineers to do — or repurpose current ones , for example by converting parts of hospitals into intensive care units .
But it should be noted that the military isn ’ t completely stocked up to help on all of this . As mentioned before , the Pentagon has fewer than 40 military hospitals , each of them small and geared toward healing troops in specific communities . “ Our fixed facilities are designed to the force that we have there — not 1,000-bed medical centers all over the United States , ” Friedrichs , the Joint Staff surgeon , told reporters on Monday .
By contrast , there are around 6,000 civilian hospitals in the country up and running today .
And while the military also has 424 medical clinics , including the USNS Comfort , they ’ re not built to quarantine patients that have the disease . Still , if there are many patients who require care at one time , the military would surely look to house them on their military bases as a kind of overflow facility .
The Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) could also lend its doctors and facilities for the response if the VA secretary authorizes their use . “ The VA system was explicitly designed with the idea of not only treating veterans but providing redundancy for the civilian system , ” said Sasha Baker , a top aide to former Defense Secretary Ash Carter .
And the VA says it ’ s ready to help if called upon . “ VA stands ready to surge capabilities into civilian health care systems in the event those systems encounter capacity issues , but at this time they are not encountering such issues , ” Christina Mandreucci , the VA ’ s press secretary , told me . “ Requests for such support would flow through the HHS , which is leading the federal government ’ s Covid-19 response efforts . ”
But should the National Disaster Medical System ( NDMS ) — a government program consisting of about 5,000 medical professionals — be called into action by a state or the federal government , the VA would play a huge role in making it work . “ The VA is the backbone for the NDMS , ” said Anthony Principi , the VA secretary from 2001 to 2005 .
When I asked a current Marine officer how the military could best help if called upon , the officer ’ s response was short and to the point : “ We are good at logistics . ”
“ We ’ ve got trucks , warehouses , and people , ” the officer continued , “ plus a few cargo planes and helicopters. ” In other words , the military is full of highly trained professionals with top-of-the-line equipment that could be incredibly useful for transporting civilian officials and materials around the country .
That last part is key as doctors may need additional medical tools quickly to treat patients , or those in affected areas might require food and water to survive . Indeed , if so many people are sick that even grocery stores close down , they ’ ll need all the sustenance they can get . Only the military , really , has the trucks , helicopters , and planes necessary to deliver everything in an efficient manner . They ’ d also prove useful should someone require a medical evacuation .
Armed forces could coordinate all this in command and control centers , Barry McCaffrey , a retired Army general , told me . That would help streamline all these efforts so the response isn ’ t so haphazard .
Experts also noted that the armed forces have communications equipment allowing better coordination among several parts of the government . For example , if there needs to be a teleconference meeting , the military has the technology to set up such a meeting for personnel stationed in remote places .
And troops can offer generators to provide electricity around the clock if needed . Generators are especially useful for field hospitals or if electrical workers in a particularly badly affected area have to stay home .
But , here again , there ’ s still a problem . The military is failing to come up with money for its own coronavirus response . Part of that comes from Trump administration efforts to cut the amount of military medical personnel the US can have by 18,000 , or 20 percent of the force .
3 ) Help develop a vaccine or effective treatment for the virus
The Army leads the US military ’ s medical research , primarily at Fort Detrick in Maryland . Gen. James McConville , the Army ’ s chief , told Breaking Defense earlier this month that there are already researchers working on finding a vaccine for the novel coronavirus . “ They ’ ve been dealing with Ebola , they ’ ve been dealing with Zika , they ’ ve been dealing with MERS , and now they ’ re dealing with coronavirus , ” McConville said .
Weber , now at the Council on Strategic Risks , told me that the only viable vaccine candidates and experimental drugs created during the 2014 Ebola crisis came from the Pentagon ( in partnership with the Canadian Ministry of Defense ) . Once it looked like that vaccine could work , the National Institutes of Health took it “ the last 10 yards , ” said Weber .
But that ’ s not all . Columbia ’ s Rasmussen told me that other Pentagon agencies , such as the Defense Threats Reduction Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , are working on tools that could potentially help fight the virus .
In DARPA ’ s case , it has a program called the Pandemic Prevention Platform that will “ temporarily protect someone from contracting the virus before a vaccine is ready , ” Amy Jenkins , the program ’ s director , told NPR in February .
Basically , it ’ s a treatment that protects someone from the virus for about six months . It serves as a temporary fix while waiting for a vaccine that can take several weeks to kick in , and it consists of antibodies from people who ’ ve had Covid-19 and recovered . “ This technology could be used in this current coronavirus , ” she said , “ but this is still a very early technology . ”
At the time of the interview , Jenkins noted that the technology might be available within 90 days .
The military ’ s manpower could be helpful in managing large crowds , experts say . They could direct traffic at drive-through testing centers , for example , or control the flow of entries at medical facilities .
This would mostly be a job for the National Guard , the Marine officer told me , as people tend to freak out if they see other services trying to keep people calm within the US .
And , as mentioned above , there are legal reasons why the National Guard would have to be the service doing the crowd control work and not the federal military .
So far there are about 670 National Guard members activated in 15 states .
The public ’ s trust in the military might help calm nerves that the US government has the situation under control . “ It would give the American public confidence , ” Weber told me .
Experts told me it ’ s therefore surprising that Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley , the Joint Chiefs chair , haven ’ t been more visible so far in reassuring the nation that all will be well .
The risks of having the military involved in the coronavirus response
While everyone I spoke with said the military had some role to play , many noted that deploying the armed forces also comes with very real risks .
One Air Force officer I talked to worried about exposing troops to sick people , which could increase the number of cases in the ranks . Having a large number of mostly young service members around crowds could also cause the virus to spread , since younger people may be infected without showing any symptoms . “ That hurts our ability to respond without endangering the very people we intend to protect , ” the officer said .
Plus , the military is already reluctant to help with pandemic response .
During the 2014 Ebola crisis , former defense officials told me , top military officials didn ’ t want 4,000 US troops going to West Africa to help . The feeling among some US uniformed leaders was that America ’ s service members should be focused on fighting wars , not curing diseases . Under immense White House pressure , though , the military did deploy and by most accounts proved instrumental in quelling the crisis .
Today ’ s military brass seems to hold similar views , as the Defense Department is still mainly focused on the health of the force . From March 16 to May 11 , for example , troops aren ’ t allowed to travel domestically . It ’ s unclear that Pentagon leadership has turned its attention to a national response yet , experts tell me .
The Air Force officer has one theory as to why that may be : Surging military physicians to treat civilians means there ’ s a “ risk of no treatment for your defense force in an era where soldiers are still getting rocket attacked downrange and North Korea is firing missiles into the East Sea , ” the officer said . “ There ’ s still an argument for readiness ” — meaning the military ’ s ability to respond to any contingency — “ and our physicians and medical professionals help us maintain that posture . ”
Other experts also noted that the Trump administration wants the armed forces focused on “ great power competition ” — preparing for fighting major wars in the future with the likes of China and Russia . If troops start spending months on the coronavirus crisis , they might be less prepared to engage in those conflicts .
Despite those concerns , though , most I spoke with believe Trump will turn to the military sooner rather than later — though they wish he ’ d done so earlier .
“ He downplayed the virus , and appeared not to understand what was happening , let alone what was coming , ” Miller told me . “ The price will be paid in American lives . ”","The Pentagon just offered ventilators for the coronavirus response. It could do much more.

Share All sharing options for: The Pentagon just offered ventilators for the coronavirus response. It could do much more.

With civilian hospitals increasingly overwhelmed and the coronavirus outbreak in America deepening, a question is coming up of whether there’s a bigger role the US military to play in responding.

President Donald Trump isn’t so sure, yet.

“We’re starting the process. And it’s a process — we hope it’s not going to be necessary, but it could be necessary,” he said during the White House briefing on Tuesday morning.

Hours later, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon would at least offer some support. He told reporters that his department would be willing to offer up to 2,000 ventilators and 5 million respirators if asked, as well as offer labs to test civilians for the disease.

But, Esper made sure to say, he believes calling up military to help in the coronavirus response should be a “last resort.”

That’s not all. The US military will also be sending the US Army Corps of Engineers to New York state to assess how to build more medical centers, and it will deploy the USNS Comfort — a large medical ship with room for 1,000 patients — off the coast of New York.

Experts tell me the Pentagon’s actions are a good start, but that defense officials could still do much, much more.

For over a century, America’s armed forces have dealt with medical crises across the globe. Many service members today have the expertise to assist with medical care; build MASH hospitals; provide shelter; or transport food, medical equipment, and people to meet the needs of the public. That’s already happening in Georgia and Florida and New York, for example, where those states’ National Guards were called to help combat Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

“The Department of Defense provides the ability to scale up like no other part of the US government can,” Andrew Weber, the Pentagon’s top biological defense official from 2011 to 2014, told me. “Whatever is needed to mount an appropriate response, the military can do it at scale.”

It’s important to note that America’s troops wouldn’t be leading efforts to combat Covid-19. They’d be supporting civilian leaders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with extra people, expertise, and technology.

That’s likely why, during the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night, former Vice President Joe Biden called for the military to be deployed across America. “It’s a national emergency, and I would call out the military,” he said. “We’re at war with the virus.”

But the military’s involvement isn’t a panacea, and it has strict limitations on what it can do. Laws prohibit most troops from performing law enforcement functions, for example, and its actions are curtailed to helping states with things like emergency medical treatment and evacuations.

What’s more, the military only has a few small hospitals in the United States that are set up to treat military medical problems like bodily trauma, top Pentagon officials told reporters on Monday. Those facilities aren’t particularly ready to deal with the coronavirus outbreak or provide what civilian hospitals might need.

In other words, the military can help, but it can’t solve the government’s response problems. It also doesn’t help that the Army alone, for instance, is short $1 billion to respond to the outbreak. “We’re trying to be very careful about not overpromising,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon, told reporters on Monday. However, experts and some at the Pentagon believe the military can come up with the money to help if it wanted to.

As of now, there’s no real indication Trump wants to deploy the military. Most jarring is that he doesn’t have a senior Pentagon official on his Coronavirus Task Force. (It’s possible the military doesn’t want to be involved — more on that later.)

It’s therefore not as easy a call for Trump to make as some might think, but the dozen current and former defense officials and medical experts I spoke with say he should still use his authority to put the military to work now.

“There’s just so much capacity in the Defense Department that’s completely untapped at the moment, and that’s a mistake,” Kelly Magsamen, a former top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, told me.

The legality of using the US military in the coronavirus response

Before going into what the military could do to help with the coronavirus, it’s first important to know what it’s allowed to do at the president’s request.

The US military is barred from using its capabilities directly to enforce US domestic laws unless Congress specifically authorizes it to do so. This stipulation, known as “posse comitatus,” is why US troops can only support civilian agencies like FEMA but not take direct action themselves. Per FEMA’s own website, the military is prohibited from interdicting “vehicles, conducting searches and seizures, making arrests or apprehensions, surveillance, investigation, or undercover work.”

There’s no indication that long-standing statute is going to change anytime soon. However, this rule doesn’t apply to the National Guard and the Coast Guard — which means both services could perform law enforcement functions if asked by a state’s governor. That means they could conceivably block roads or keep people from visiting family and friends, though that would be a severe response and it’s unclear any governor wants to authorize that yet.

The president, or at least his lawyers, knows all this. On Friday, Trump issued two declarations to deal with the outbreak: one reliant on the Stafford Act, and one based on the National Emergencies Act.

As my colleague Ian Millhiser wrote, “Title IV of the Stafford Act permits the president to declare that a particular crisis is a ‘major disaster,’ and such a declaration does provide the president with new powers that he may use to combat such a disaster.” Additionally, the statute says “all requests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected State.”

So, as Millhiser notes, Trump “cannot simply issue a declaration and seize broad new powers.”

There’s still plenty the US government can do under this act, including coordinating relief efforts, helping state governments, and handing out food and medicine as needed. If the military can be helpful in any of those endeavors, HHS, another agency, or a state’s governor can ask the Pentagon for assistance with them.

As for the National Emergencies Act, it gives the president more sweeping authorities, Elizabeth Goiten, the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center, wrote for the Atlantic on Monday. For Trump to use those authorities, though, he must “specify which powers he intends to invoke, and he must issue updates if he adds new powers to the list,” she explained.

It’s therefore possible that under this statute, Trump could order the military to do more than a state’s governor wants, but he’d have to notify everyone of those intentions.

What’s most likely to happen, though, is that the military will abide by its long-standing process and doctrine of “Defense Support for Civilian Authorities,” or DSCA.

For emergencies in the homeland like the coronavirus outbreak, the military sees its role as providing “support to prepare, prevent, protect, respond, and recover from domestic incidents.” Such support is “provided in response to requests from civil authorities and upon approval from appropriate authorities.”

US troops, then, won’t start deploying to parts of the country without HHS or other government agencies asking them to, and even then the military will act strictly in support of what that agency wants.

In essence, Trump couldn’t use the military as his own personal coronavirus response force and law enforcement agency. It’ll be subordinate to the government agencies that request its assistance. How a National Guard unit acts, though, is highly dependent on a state’s governor.

HHS has already asked the Pentagon for help with quarantining Americans coming back from Wuhan, China — where the outbreak started — as well as infected passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner. Military officials are also at the 11 feeder airports that passengers from abroad must go through for medical screenings before entering the US.

But so far, that’s it. “We’ve not received any other [requests] at this time,” Jonathan Hoffman, a top Pentagon spokesperson, told reporters on Monday.

Yet experts tell me that, if states and agencies would just request it, the Pentagon could be even more helpful.

How the military can help the US coronavirus response

There are four main ways the US military could assist in the country’s pandemic response: 1) provide care; 2) assist with logistics; 3) develop a vaccine or other treatment; and 4) control crowds and provide other calming effects.

1) Provide care

Even as Americans aim to “flatten the curve” to keep coronavirus cases in the country low, hospitals find that they’re struggling to keep up with the number of patients that need medical care. A dearth of hospital beds, ventilators, and rested physicians means a spike in people requiring hospitalization could greatly overwhelm the civilian health system.

Should those resources run low, the Defense Department “could use authorities under the Defense Production Act to rapidly acquire a range of equipment such as N-95 respirators, gloves for medical personnel, and ventilators,” James Miller, the top Pentagon policy official from 2012 to 2014, told me.

The military also has thousands of physicians who could help treat patients. Dr. Angela Rasmussen, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University, told me the military could create new hospitals if needed — as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the Army Corps of Engineers to do — or repurpose current ones, for example by converting parts of hospitals into intensive care units.

But it should be noted that the military isn’t completely stocked up to help on all of this. As mentioned before, the Pentagon has fewer than 40 military hospitals, each of them small and geared toward healing troops in specific communities. “Our fixed facilities are designed to the force that we have there — not 1,000-bed medical centers all over the United States,” Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon, told reporters on Monday.

By contrast, there are around 6,000 civilian hospitals in the country up and running today.

And while the military also has 424 medical clinics, including the USNS Comfort, they’re not built to quarantine patients that have the disease. Still, if there are many patients who require care at one time, the military would surely look to house them on their military bases as a kind of overflow facility.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) could also lend its doctors and facilities for the response if the VA secretary authorizes their use. “The VA system was explicitly designed with the idea of not only treating veterans but providing redundancy for the civilian system,” said Sasha Baker, a top aide to former Defense Secretary Ash Carter.

And the VA says it’s ready to help if called upon. “VA stands ready to surge capabilities into civilian health care systems in the event those systems encounter capacity issues, but at this time they are not encountering such issues,” Christina Mandreucci, the VA’s press secretary, told me. “Requests for such support would flow through the HHS, which is leading the federal government’s Covid-19 response efforts.”

But should the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) — a government program consisting of about 5,000 medical professionals — be called into action by a state or the federal government, the VA would play a huge role in making it work. “The VA is the backbone for the NDMS,” said Anthony Principi, the VA secretary from 2001 to 2005.

2) Assist with logistics

When I asked a current Marine officer how the military could best help if called upon, the officer’s response was short and to the point: “We are good at logistics.”

“We’ve got trucks, warehouses, and people,” the officer continued, “plus a few cargo planes and helicopters.” In other words, the military is full of highly trained professionals with top-of-the-line equipment that could be incredibly useful for transporting civilian officials and materials around the country.

That last part is key as doctors may need additional medical tools quickly to treat patients, or those in affected areas might require food and water to survive. Indeed, if so many people are sick that even grocery stores close down, they’ll need all the sustenance they can get. Only the military, really, has the trucks, helicopters, and planes necessary to deliver everything in an efficient manner. They’d also prove useful should someone require a medical evacuation.

Armed forces could coordinate all this in command and control centers, Barry McCaffrey, a retired Army general, told me. That would help streamline all these efforts so the response isn’t so haphazard.

Experts also noted that the armed forces have communications equipment allowing better coordination among several parts of the government. For example, if there needs to be a teleconference meeting, the military has the technology to set up such a meeting for personnel stationed in remote places.

And troops can offer generators to provide electricity around the clock if needed. Generators are especially useful for field hospitals or if electrical workers in a particularly badly affected area have to stay home.

But, here again, there’s still a problem. The military is failing to come up with money for its own coronavirus response. Part of that comes from Trump administration efforts to cut the amount of military medical personnel the US can have by 18,000, or 20 percent of the force.

3) Help develop a vaccine or effective treatment for the virus

The Army leads the US military’s medical research, primarily at Fort Detrick in Maryland. Gen. James McConville, the Army’s chief, told Breaking Defense earlier this month that there are already researchers working on finding a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. “They’ve been dealing with Ebola, they’ve been dealing with Zika, they’ve been dealing with MERS, and now they’re dealing with coronavirus,” McConville said.

Weber, now at the Council on Strategic Risks, told me that the only viable vaccine candidates and experimental drugs created during the 2014 Ebola crisis came from the Pentagon (in partnership with the Canadian Ministry of Defense). Once it looked like that vaccine could work, the National Institutes of Health took it “the last 10 yards,” said Weber.

But that’s not all. Columbia’s Rasmussen told me that other Pentagon agencies, such as the Defense Threats Reduction Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), are working on tools that could potentially help fight the virus.

In DARPA’s case, it has a program called the Pandemic Prevention Platform that will “temporarily protect someone from contracting the virus before a vaccine is ready,” Amy Jenkins, the program’s director, told NPR in February.

Basically, it’s a treatment that protects someone from the virus for about six months. It serves as a temporary fix while waiting for a vaccine that can take several weeks to kick in, and it consists of antibodies from people who’ve had Covid-19 and recovered. “This technology could be used in this current coronavirus,” she said, “but this is still a very early technology.”

At the time of the interview, Jenkins noted that the technology might be available within 90 days.

4) Crowd control and calming effects

The military’s manpower could be helpful in managing large crowds, experts say. They could direct traffic at drive-through testing centers, for example, or control the flow of entries at medical facilities.

This would mostly be a job for the National Guard, the Marine officer told me, as people tend to freak out if they see other services trying to keep people calm within the US.

And, as mentioned above, there are legal reasons why the National Guard would have to be the service doing the crowd control work and not the federal military.

So far there are about 670 National Guard members activated in 15 states.

The public’s trust in the military might help calm nerves that the US government has the situation under control. “It would give the American public confidence,” Weber told me.

Experts told me it’s therefore surprising that Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the Joint Chiefs chair, haven’t been more visible so far in reassuring the nation that all will be well.

The risks of having the military involved in the coronavirus response

While everyone I spoke with said the military had some role to play, many noted that deploying the armed forces also comes with very real risks.

One Air Force officer I talked to worried about exposing troops to sick people, which could increase the number of cases in the ranks. Having a large number of mostly young service members around crowds could also cause the virus to spread, since younger people may be infected without showing any symptoms. “That hurts our ability to respond without endangering the very people we intend to protect,” the officer said.

WASHINGTON—Millions of Americans depend on drugs that are made in part or wholly in China because U.S. manufacturers moved their supply chains and much of their manufacturing facilities to that country , the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship was told Thursday .
“ Thousands of our generic drugs and even some of the brand name products and perhaps even new therapies for coronavirus may depend on the chemicals that are sourced primarily in China , ” Rosemary Gibson , a senior adviser to the Garrison , New York-based Hastings Center Bioethics Research Institute , told the committee .
The hearing ’ s focus was on “ Coronavirus and America ’ s small business supply chain . ”
Gibson was responding to Sen. Josh Hawley ( R-Mo . ) , who asked “ how many of our drugs involve Chinese production . Maybe they ’ re not made wholly there but Chinese production is involved ? ”
Gibson continued , saying “ if you are hospitalized with coronavirus , if you have a severe case , which thankfully are small numbers , you might need a ventilator . You will need sedatives like Fentanyl and Propofol .
“ Your blood pressure may get dangerously low , so you will need pressers like Dopamine and Epinephrine . You might get a secondary infection that is bacterial in nature and you will need antibiotics . You might become septic , which is life-threatening . ”
Gibson told the committee that she was recently “ sitting in a room with the people that actually make medicines . These are the men and women in pharmaceutical engineering and pharmaceutical chemistry .
“ I said , ‘ So tell me , if you have to make these tomorrow , where do the core chemicals come from to make it ? How much are we dependent on China ? ’ They said 90 percent of the chemicals to make those basic generic drugs depend on China . ”
Earlier this month , after the U.S. restricted travel to and from China , Xinhua , China ’ s state-controlled official news agency , warned that , “ these practices [ restricting travel from China to the United States ] in the United States are very unkind . They can be described as falling into the ground and killing people while they are ill . ”
The Chinese news agency then added ominously that , “ If China retaliates against the U.S. at this time , in addition to announcing a travel ban on the United States , it will also announce strategic control over medical products and ban exports to the United States . ”
Politico reported in December that “ last year , China accounted for 95 percent of U.S. imports of ibuprofen , 91 percent of U.S. imports of hydrocortisone , 70 percent of U.S. imports of acetaminophen , 40 to 45 percent of U.S. imports of penicillin and 40 percent of U.S. imports of heparin , according to Commerce Department data . In all , 80 percent of the U.S. supply of antibiotics are made in China . ”
The situation is not totally hopeless , however , because , Gibson said , “ the good news is there is advanced manufacturing technology and really brilliant chemists right here in the United States that want to make it capable of starting production tomorrow . ”
In her prepared testimony , Gibson described the national security risks involved in U.S. dependence on Chinese drug production if Beijing follows through on the threat published by Xinhua .
“ The unleashing of this threat will cause unprecedented deaths and social disorder on a scale never seen before on our country . The civilian and military health care systems will collapse . China can wreak other havoc . Medicines in the hands of an adversary can be weaponized , ” Gibson testified .
“ Medicines can be made with lethal contaminants or sold without any real medicine in them , rendering them ineffective . These products can be distributed to specific targets . Detection is time-consuming at best , and virtually impossible at worst .
“ Dependence on China is a risk to the U.S. military , combat readiness , and force protection . The thousands of men and women on U.S. aircraft carriers in the South China Sea are dependent on the adversary for many of their essential medicines .
“ Combat readiness and force protection are at risk with the military vulnerable to disruptions in supply and contaminated and toxic medicines . In 2018 , more than 31,000 active duty military personnel , veterans , and their family members were notified they may have been given blood pressure medicines containing a cancer-causing ingredient . ”
Another witness , Dr. Tim Morrison , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , said China ’ s “ Made in China 2025 ” initiative signals Beijing ’ s long-term goal of moving from being a manufacturing power to producing higher-value products and services such as prescription drugs and related medical products .
“ I think the point of Made in China 2025 is essentially to destroy the free market and create incentives to offshore production in China . And originally this seemed like a good thing . We ’ ll save prices . We ’ ll move value , or value you can move , we ’ ll continue to do the innovation , but China is scooping that up as well . And so , without any decision by any government authority this happened and now we are going to deal with the consequences . ”
Hawley concluded his questioning by noting that “ our current drug policy seems to privilege economic considerations of maybe a few companies over public health considerations. ” Morrison said he agreed with Hawley ’ s characterization .","Senate Hearing on Coronavirus Crisis Exposes Dangers of US Drug Dependence on China Sourcing

Politico reported in December that “last year, China accounted for 95 percent of U.S. imports of ibuprofen, 91 percent of U.S. imports of hydrocortisone, 70 percent of U.S. imports of acetaminophen, 40 to 45 percent of U.S. imports of penicillin and 40 percent of U.S. imports of heparin, according to Commerce Department data. In all, 80 percent of the U.S. supply of antibiotics are made in China.”

The situation is not totally hopeless, however, because, Gibson said, “the good news is there is advanced manufacturing technology and really brilliant chemists right here in the United States that want to make it capable of starting production tomorrow.”

In her prepared testimony, Gibson described the national security risks involved in U.S. dependence on Chinese drug production if Beijing follows through on the threat published by Xinhua.

“The unleashing of this threat will cause unprecedented deaths and social disorder on a scale never seen before on our country. The civilian and military health care systems will collapse. China can wreak other havoc. Medicines in the hands of an adversary can be weaponized,” Gibson testified.

“Medicines can be made with lethal contaminants or sold without any real medicine in them, rendering them ineffective. These products can be distributed to specific targets. Detection is time-consuming at best, and virtually impossible at worst.

“Dependence on China is a risk to the U.S. military, combat readiness, and force protection. The thousands of men and women on U.S. aircraft carriers in the South China Sea are dependent on the adversary for many of their essential medicines.

“Combat readiness and force protection are at risk with the military vulnerable to disruptions in supply and contaminated and toxic medicines. In 2018, more than 31,000 active duty military personnel, veterans, and their family members were notified they may have been given blood pressure medicines containing a cancer-causing ingredient.”

Another witness, Dr. Tim Morrison, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said China’s “Made in China 2025” initiative signals Beijing’s long-term goal of moving from being a manufacturing power to producing higher-value products and services such as prescription drugs and related medical products.

“I think the point of Made in China 2025 is essentially to destroy the free market and create incentives to offshore production in China. And originally this seemed like a good thing. We’ll save prices. We’ll move value, or value you can move, we’ll continue to do the innovation, but China is scooping that up as well. And so, without any decision by any government authority this happened and now we are going to deal with the consequences.”

Hawley concluded his questioning by noting that “our current drug policy seems to privilege economic considerations of maybe a few companies over public health considerations.” Morrison said he agreed with Hawley’s characterization.

Different strokes for different states

States have moved at different paces as governors balance reopening their economies with keeping residents safe. Some states, including Georgia and Texas, rolled out aggressive reopening plans, while others have taken a more measured approach.

Ron DeSantis and President Donald Trump have tightly wound their political fates together in Florida , a state that amounts to a must-win if the president hopes to serve another term in the White House .
But as the nation hurtles toward a contentious general-election contest , Florida has emerged as a key national hot spot for the resurgent coronavirus pandemic . This even as the president is primed to try to use the state as a show of strength for his now-relocated Republican National Convention nomination acceptance speech in August—a plan that is already causing anxiety among some locals .
And the rapid ascent of COVID-19 in the Sunshine State has proven precarious for DeSantis ’ standing in Florida , raising the prospect that a reopening some residents and experts say has been rushed could mean trouble for the president come November .
The situation in the state grew even more troubling Friday , according to the Miami Herald , as the state smashed its single-day record set this week for new cases with a count of close to 9,000 testing positive . The previous high , according to the newspaper , came Wednesday when 5,508 new COVID-19 cases marked a new one-day record in the state .
“ If you look around the country , most governors , regardless of party , saw their numbers rise ” during the early part of the pandemic , noted Jeff Garcia , a Democratic political consultant based in Miami . He pointed to a decline for DeSantis from 58 percent to 51 percent in approval in an April analysis of polls by FiveThirtyEight—long before the recent surge in cases . Meanwhile , governors of 14 other states hit hard by the pandemic , such as Michigan , Washington , and New York , experienced double-digit positive gains .
“ DeSantis is in a rare category , ” added Garcia . “ He is not overwhelmingly disliked , but he has seen a precipitous drop in his approval rating . ”
Florida , on the other hand , is among the states showing the sharpest trend upward in confirmed new COVID-19 cases in recent days , according to Johns Hopkins University . And in an analysis last week , the PolicyLab at Children ’ s Hospital of Philadelphia voiced concern that “ Florida has all the makings of the next large epicenter . ”
That ’ s the fear shared by Bernard Ashby , a Florida-based cardiologist and health-policy expert . Despite Florida having a large Medicare-eligible population and many people vulnerable to COVID-19 , the state ’ s lead physician for the Committee to Protect Medicare said the governor 's response to the pandemic has been more economically focused , “ with public health being an afterthought . ”
“ I would definitely think that voters , especially voters who fall into that vulnerable population , would obviously be concerned by the lack of leadership from the federal level and the state level regarding the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic , ” Ashby said , looking ahead to November ’ s general election .
A spokesman for DeSantis did not respond to an email seeking comment on whether his handling of the coronavirus may hurt President Donald Trump ’ s ability to win the state in November . But on Thursday , DeSantis seemed to recognize the challenges the spike poses for Florida ’ s reopening moving forward .
“ We are where we are , ” DeSantis told reporters when asked about the state ’ s reopening . “ I didn ’ t say we ’ re going to go on to the next phase . ”
Before the pandemic , observers say DeSantis had made gains with voters after his narrow victory over Democrat Andrew Gillum in 2018 . But the pandemic appears to have set the governor in a more fluid position politically amid concerns over his administration ’ s response .
Rod Deal wasn ’ t a fan of DeSantis when the Republican ran for governor in 2018 . But even after voting for Gillum , the 38-year-old Miami-based photographer ’ s resistance faded and he warmed to DeSantis shortly after the GOP leader took office .

Staying in shelters or in cars and parks , they are more likely than residents living in permanent housing to have underlying health problems . That puts them at heightened risk during a pandemic , putting additional strain on medical and city services .
Propelled by the novel coronavirus , California is rushing to shelter thousands of its most vulnerable residents – homeless people who live outdoors and can ’ t “ stay at home ” to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 .
Day One of that unprecedented effort in Los Angeles revealed the daunting struggle that lies ahead across the state . By dinnertime on a recent Friday , a shuttle bus had dropped off only four homeless people at a community center that was being turned into a shelter in the Echo Park neighborhood .
The four clients sat on the curb , waiting to be checked in . But the nurse had yet to arrive . Cots had not been delivered . One of the four , a distraught older woman in gray sweatpants , kept repeating “ food , food. ” When a helper tried to escort her to a restroom across the street to wash up before eating , she would not follow . Eventually , she wandered off and could not be coaxed back .
“ It ’ s tough , ” admits Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti . “ We ’ ve never moved this many people , ever . ”
In a matter of weeks , the city is trying to voluntarily move 6,000 unsheltered people into 42 community and recreation centers that are being converted into shelters . Those who are especially vulnerable , though not showing symptoms of COVID-19 , as well as those who need to be quarantined will be sent to hotels , motels , or care centers .
But the mayor and others deeply involved in this issue are also looking ahead to after the crisis , whenever that comes . And how California responds to the needs of homeless people during a pandemic – particularly the unsheltered – may well shape thinking about what is still needed to address a vexing , complex problem that was a crisis long before the coronavirus hit .
“ It ’ s certainly something we ’ re thinking about now , ” Mayor Garcetti told a press briefing . “ What can we do … to get the homeless , not just out of this crisis , but off the streets ? ”
California is ground zero for America ’ s homelessness crisis . About 150,000 people are homeless here , living in shelters , on sidewalks , in tent encampments , canyon washes , and under bridges in the Golden State , often in highly unsanitary conditions . Many are older and in poor health , which heightens the risk of an explosion in severe virus cases that could further strain medical and city services .
Before the coronavirus hit , Democratic Gov . Gavin Newsom had made homelessness his first priority , devoting his entire State of the State speech to the subject . It polled as the top issue among voters as well . Now COVID-19 has added even more urgency to the issue , underscoring what people who work with the homeless population have known all along – that the challenge is not only in tackling a housing crisis but also a health one .
To slow the growth of the virus , the governor , in a March 18 executive order , directed $ 150 million to localities to help with shelters and hotel and motel rooms . The state also purchased more than 1,300 camper trailers for people who might need to be quarantined .
So far , the effort has been intense but spotty , accompanied by a debate about whether to move people into shared shelters or individual motel rooms .
As of April 1 , Los Angeles had converted 13 community centers to shelters with 565 beds . The shelters are 95 % full . More shelters as well as hotels , motels , and 1,000 quarantine beds are expected to come online in the next few days ; 900 are already available . So far , five cases of COVID-19 have been identified in the homeless community .
Some homeless people are skeptical about the safety of shelters in a pandemic . “ We ’ re safer out here than in a shelter , ” says Ayman Ahmed , who sleeps in a tent at Echo Park Lake , voicing a common sentiment .
Still , the crisis is clearing away barriers that would normally hinder progress . Resources are being freed up , regulations eased , and eviction moratoriums declared in an all-hands-on-deck response that people who work with the homeless population hope can be extended after the pandemic ends . As those who are unsheltered enter temporary accommodation , even gathering data about them could be helpful in the long term , because so little is known about this population .
“ We don ’ t know how many people are disconnected from homeless and health services . We don ’ t know the length of time the unsheltered have been on the streets . Both are predictive factors that show how hard or easy it may be to stably house someone , ” says Gary Painter , an expert on homelessness at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .
Meanwhile , community support for emergency sheltering – instead of resistance – has been “ pretty fantastic , ” says Heidi Marston , interim executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority . “ As bad and unfortunate and uncertain as this pandemic is , it ’ s renewing a sense of crisis response and urgency that we have been looking for across the whole system . ”
Bay Area Community Services , based in Oakland , runs programs that provide short-term and permanent housing for homeless residents , with an emphasis on seniors and those with physical or mental health conditions . Outreach workers have fanned out across the San Francisco Bay Area to educate those living on the streets and in vehicles about the coronavirus .
“ What we ’ ve seen is that a lot of people don ’ t know the severity of the crisis , ” says Jamie Almanza , the group ’ s executive director . As workers attempt to shepherd people into shelters and other temporary housing , she adds , “ The question is how to capture this moment and this sense of urgency we ’ re seeing . ”
Damian Dovarganes/AP Homeless people sleep near Los Angeles City Hall on March 27 , 2020 . On Friday , California Gov . Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the surge in COVID-19 that health officials warned about will worsen .
Governor Newsom ’ s emergency order has sliced through red tape that can slow down efforts to house those who lack permanent shelter . A pair of hotels in Oakland will provide housing for almost 400 people living in encampments , and in San Francisco , officials have identified some 8,500 vacant rooms in 30 hotels where they will seek to place homeless individuals and families in the days and weeks ahead .
As cities and counties work with state and federal agencies , Ms. Almanza says public officials are releasing emergency funds and relaxing rules on existing spending on homelessness . To locate available housing , officials are relying on local nonprofits . Ms. Almanza hopes the increased cooperation and trust will last beyond the pandemic given that , with or without the threat of COVID-19 , those living on the streets and in shelters face a daily life-or-death struggle .
“ It ’ s becoming crystal clear during this crisis that the nonprofit organizations are the front-line first responders , ” she says . “ And what this could mean for the long term is a better understanding by government funders of what can happen when we all really come together . ”
The 2007-08 housing market crash contributed to a rise in California ’ s homeless population as banks foreclosed on homeowners and large encampments sprouted in cities across the state .
In 2008 , officials in Fresno embarked on a 10-year plan to reduce homelessness , funneling more funding and resources into rapid re-housing , permanent housing , and supportive services . By 2017 , the city ’ s homeless population had fallen almost 60 % , according to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness , a much steeper decline than seen elsewhere in California .
The numbers have climbed again over the past few years as Fresno – like the state as a whole – contends with an acute shortage of affordable housing . But city officials assert that , in the same way they learned lessons from the housing crash , the pandemic response can inform policies for aiding the homeless population now and in the future .
“ This is a crisis within a crisis , ” says H. Spees , director of strategic initiatives for Fresno Mayor Lee Brand . “ You have the homelessness crisis being enveloped by the COVID-19 crisis , and with that , you have the opportunity to leverage short-term responses into long-term solutions . ”
Last week , in the span of 72 hours , the city opened up 300 new shelter beds in a vacant hotel and two other buildings and began housing homeless residents . The swift action could serve as a template for the city long after the pandemic passes .
“ We don ’ t have all the answers , ” Mr. Spees says . “ But we are seeing waves of public and private resources come together to speed up the street-to-home transition , and it ’ s demonstrating that moving people off the streets can happen quickly when we have collective effort . ”
In East Palo Alto , south of San Francisco , the Rev . Paul Bains laments that it has taken a pandemic to bring greater urgency to the cause of ending homelessness . At the same time , as the president of WeHOPE , a homeless shelter and supportive services provider , he recognizes that the coronavirus response presents an opportunity .
“ There is so much attention right now on getting people off the streets and out of the elements and giving them a chance to get healthy , ” he says . “ Barriers are being removed because people are realizing what the risks are for someone who doesn ’ t have a place to live . ”
In the past week , Mr. Bains has secured $ 230,000 in funding to expand WeHOPE ’ s fleet of mobile shower trailers and purchase 15,000 face masks to distribute to homeless individuals , outreach workers , and emergency responders . He credits local officials and Governor Newsom for creating momentum to prioritize initiatives on homelessness .
“ What we ’ re seeing is that , with community collaboration and strong leadership , we have the wherewithal to address these systemic issues , ” Mr. Bains says .
But it ’ s not just a spirit of collaboration that will be needed , says Margot Kushel , director of the Center for Vulnerable Populations at the University of California , San Francisco . It also takes a serious , sustained , financial commitment .
“ Homelessness is a catastrophe , ” she says . “ It requires a level of response that is not going to be free and is going to cost money , but is absolutely essential to preserve health . ”

Dr. Kushel believes that hotels could perhaps play a larger role in a long-term solution to homelessness in California .

How California responds now to the needs of homeless people may shape long-term thinking about what has been missing so far in its response to its housing crisis. People who work with the homeless population hope this spirit can be extended after the crisis abates.

Local officials are scrambling to move thousands of homeless people into converted shelters and locate hotel rooms to quarantine the most vulnerable people and those who may already have COVID-19. It’s proving an immense challenge. Still, the crisis is also clearing away barriers that would normally hinder progress: Resources are being freed up, regulations eased, and communities are pitching in.

Currently , there is no known specific medicine to treat the novel coronavirus , but researchers in Italy suggest that the COVID-19 disease is slow to mutate , based on its genetic material .
This finding could aid in helping large swaths of people over an extended period of time once a specific cure is found .
The study , which was produced by two independent teams in the country , used `` a new next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) research assay '' from Thermo Fisher Scientific on Italian COVID-19 patients . The experts then compared them to a sample from the original outbreak to come up with their findings .
`` Had we investigated other viruses we might have expected up to dozens of new mutations after so many infectious cycles in patients , '' professor Stefano Menzo , head of Virology at Ancona University Hospital , said in a statement . `` Our initial data show that this is a very stable RNA virus , with only five novel variants . A virus with a stable genome is good news for vaccine development because it indicates that the effectiveness of vaccines could be more consistent , possibly over many years . ''
CORONAVIRUS : COMBINATION OF ANTIMALARIAL MEDICATION AND ANTIBIOTICS COULD SHORTEN COVID-19 , RESEARCHERS SAY
Dr. Maria Rosaria Capobianchi , head of the Virology Department , Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases , said the ability to run quick , multiple samples is important in the scientific community 's fight to stay ahead of the virus .
However , Capobianchi cautioned , `` viral genomes are dynamic and these preliminary data need further analysis to determine the biological significance of the gene variants and to investigate the evolutionary path of the coronavirus . ''
The researchers will further analyze the data with Thermo Fisher 's new Ion SARS-CoV-2 analysis solution to better understand the virus and analyze the entire genome .
Scientists are looking at a number of different ways to cure the novel coronavirus , which has affected more than 428,000 people around the globe , including at least 55,000 in the U.S .
Researchers in France detailed how a combination of antimalarial medication and antibiotics could be a vital weapon against COVID-19 , Fox News previously reported .

Currently, there is no known specific medicine to treat the novel coronavirus, but researchers in Italy suggest that the COVID-19 disease is slow to mutate, based on its genetic material.

This finding could aid in helping large swaths of people over an extended period of time once a specific cure is found.

The study, which was produced by two independent teams in the country, used ""a new next-generation sequencing (NGS) research assay"" from Thermo Fisher Scientific on Italian COVID-19 patients. The experts then compared them to a sample from the original outbreak to come up with their findings.

""Had we investigated other viruses we might have expected up to dozens of new mutations after so many infectious cycles in patients,"" professor Stefano Menzo, head of Virology at Ancona University Hospital, said in a statement. ""Our initial data show that this is a very stable RNA virus, with only five novel variants. A virus with a stable genome is good news for vaccine development because it indicates that the effectiveness of vaccines could be more consistent, possibly over many years.""

CORONAVIRUS: COMBINATION OF ANTIMALARIAL MEDICATION AND ANTIBIOTICS COULD SHORTEN COVID-19, RESEARCHERS SAY

Dr. Maria Rosaria Capobianchi, head of the Virology Department, Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases, said the ability to run quick, multiple samples is important in the scientific community's fight to stay ahead of the virus.

However, Capobianchi cautioned, ""viral genomes are dynamic and these preliminary data need further analysis to determine the biological significance of the gene variants and to investigate the evolutionary path of the coronavirus.""

The researchers will further analyze the data with Thermo Fisher's new Ion SARS-CoV-2 analysis solution to better understand the virus and analyze the entire genome.

Scientists are looking at a number of different ways to cure the novel coronavirus, which has affected more than 428,000 people around the globe, including at least 55,000 in the U.S.

Researchers in France detailed how a combination of antimalarial medication and antibiotics could be a vital weapon against COVID-19, Fox News previously reported.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday the state will start coronavirus drug trials, as the hard-hit state recently acquired 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine.

From Josh Rogin:

Two years before the novel coronavirus pandemic upended the world, U.S. Embassy officials visited a Chinese research facility in the city of Wuhan several times and sent two official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab, which was conducting risky studies on coronaviruses from bats. The cables have fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus — even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.

What ’ s not clear is whether fiscal policy will be strong enough to cushion the blow of a health emergency that has idled workers and emptied schools and offices . Economists predict a severe contraction in economic activity and a surge in unemployment . The challenge for policymakers is to keep workers attached to their employers so that businesses can rev up once the worst is over . Simply bailing out struggling companies may not in itself solve that problem , which is why Congress may soon be cutting checks to American families so that spending doesn ’ t crash .
Germany , the United States , and other major economies have begun to inject money into their stricken economies , providing credit to companies like Ms. Sator ’ s . She ’ s hesitant to go into debt , given the uncertainty in her industry and others , but relieved that policymakers are acting .

A global recession , many forecasters say , is already here and is growing more severe by the day , as millions of consumers and workers in Europe , Asia , and North America have been sidelined as governments take extreme measures to stem the COVID-19 pandemic .
Finally , though , actions by governments and central banks appear to be ramping up , not so much in an effort to prevent a recession as simply to weather a storm that could easily become more severe than the global financial crisis a decade ago .
Help can ’ t come soon enough for Dominik Wilkinson and his co-workers at a restaurant in the northern German town of Bielefeld . The restaurant ’ s 40 staff members are already working sharply reduced hours , and there ’ s talk in town of curfews starting Friday . A prolonged closure would be , “ death , in terms of revenue . It ’ s basically the same for every small and medium-sized company , ” says Mr. Wilkinson , a shift manager .
In the United States , the past few days have seen automakers mothball factories , hotel chains furlough tens of thousands of workers , and major retailers trim store hours or go online only . A Labor Department report today showed claims for unemployment benefits spiking to 281,000 last week . Every day brings more turmoil in global stock and bond markets as investors seek safe havens , even as central banks cough up amounts not seen since the financial meltdown of 2008 .
Yet the situation ’ s very severity is spurring governments into action . Relief measures range from mortgage or tax holidays to cash infusions for households , while also lending or simply giving money to businesses to prevent mass layoffs or permanent closures .
Analysts say these are precisely the kinds of measures that can help , but their effectiveness will hinge greatly on their magnitude and speed of delivery . And what makes this crisis different , they add , is that a pandemic must also be tamed because the economic and health crises are intertwined .
The Group of Seven international economic organization has already issued a “ whatever it takes ” statement of determination . The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are mobilizing help for developing nations . But so far it ’ s an open question whether global leadership today can match the kind of concerted effort that emerged from the depths of the 2008 crisis .

As markets react to the pandemic , central banks have in many cases acted faster since they are inherently nimbler than legislatures . But unlike in 2008 , when the crisis began in an over-leveraged financial sector , the coronavirus has slammed into the real economy , which monetary policy alone is hard-pressed to rescue .
On Tuesday , the U.S. Federal Reserve reopened two programs last used during the global financial crisis a decade ago , to keep the flow of short-term credit from clogging .
And on Wednesday , European Central Bank President Christine LaGarde cited “ no limits ” to support efforts as the bank launched an $ 820 billion program to buy government and corporate debt .
For all the actions underway , the question economists raise is what will be enough in these extraordinary times . Forecasting the depth of the slowdown is challenging ; recent estimates suggest up to a 14 % drop in U.S. economic output ( annualized ) in the second quarter .
Although the term “ fiscal stimulus ” often is used for recession-fighting programs , the goal today is really about helping individuals and businesses survive this economic stallout . A rebound will come later . The challenge is to contain the current damage by slowing the spread of COVID-19 while minimizing job losses and firm closures .
“ Right now what needs to happen is flattening the curve [ of the outbreak ] while still doing whatever it takes ... to keep the fabric of the economy and of society alive , ” says Fabio Ghironi , an economist at the University of Washington in Seattle .
That means economic rescue should include support for stretched health care systems , he says – something far different from recessions with purely economic causes .
The U.S. and other governments are making some big efforts , but Dr. Ghironi and others argue much more will be needed .
Many less-developed economies face an especially hard time finding the resources for both a public-health crisis and an economic one .
In Mexico City , Julio Bisrreal Alcantaria stands beneath a lush green tree on the sidewalk beside his fruit truck slicing mangoes and papayas . He hasn ’ t seen much of a slowdown in business due to the coronavirus , he says , but expects nationwide school closures starting this week to hit his business hard .
“ I can make it about two weeks with slow sales , and then I ’ m in trouble , ” he says . “ If kids aren ’ t in school and people aren ’ t going to their offices , I have no one to sell to . ”
Mr. Bisrreal is one of the estimated 30 million Mexicans working in the informal economy – without social security or job protections . As with gig economy workers in the U.S. , flexibility becomes moot if a pandemic forces people indoors and consumer spending evaporates .
Mexico ’ s finance ministry has proposed lines of credit , debt refinancing , and helping small businesses stay afloat . But “ there ’ s no real discussion ” in the legislature about economic stimulus , says Valeria Moy , an economist at Mexico ¿Como Vamos ? , a think tank .
School closings aside , President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has resisted an economywide lockdown , arguing that it would hurt poor people . There are “ pressures of all types . Close the airport , shut down everything , paralyze the economy . No , ” he told a press conference .
Worldwide , the stakes are high . In Odemira , Portugal , Domingos Vicente owns a fruit distribution business with 40 employees , mostly migrants .
“ If my business shuts down , I won ’ t be able to pay them to stay at home not working , and they will not stay around , which means it will be hard to start over again once it ’ s possible and hire new workers . That means trouble for the agricultural supply in Portugal . ”
In Italy , the nation hardest hit in Europe by the virus , the government is helping employers meet their payrolls and freezing loan and mortgage payments for many who are affected by the crisis .
But as in other nations , the emergency programs take time to reach people and may not be enough . That ’ s especially true for workers in the gig economy like Claudia Bellante , a freelance journalist in Milan . Her husband , a photographer , has seen his work dry up .

Besides the respiratory issues that leave patients gasping for breath , the virus that causes COVID-19 attacks many organ systems , in some cases causing catastrophic damage .
“ We thought this was only a respiratory virus . Turns out , it goes after the pancreas . It goes after the heart . It goes after the liver , the brain , the kidney and other organs . We didn ’ t appreciate that in the beginning , ” said Dr. Eric Topol , a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla , California .
In addition to respiratory distress , patients with COVID-19 can experience blood clotting disorders that can lead to strokes , and extreme inflammation that attacks multiple organ systems . The virus can also cause neurological complications that range from headache , dizziness and loss of taste or smell to seizures and confusion .
And recovery can be slow , incomplete and costly , with a huge impact on quality of life .
The broad and diverse manifestations of COVID-19 are somewhat unique , said Dr. Sadiya Khan , a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago .
With influenza , people with underlying heart conditions are also at higher risk of complications , Khan said . What is surprising about this virus is the extent of the complications occurring outside the lungs .
Khan believes there will be a huge healthcare expenditure and burden for individuals who have survived COVID-19 .
Patients who were in the intensive care unit or on a ventilator for weeks will need to spend extensive time in rehab to regain mobility and strength .
“ It can take up to seven days for every one day that you ’ re hospitalized to recover that type of strength , ” Khan said . “ It ’ s harder the older you are , and you may never get back to the same level of function . ”

( This story corrects spelling of doctor ’ s name to Khan instead of Kahn in last two paragraphs )","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Scientists are only starting to grasp the vast array of health problems caused by the novel coronavirus, some of which may have lingering effects on patients and health systems for years to come, according to doctors and infectious disease experts.

Besides the respiratory issues that leave patients gasping for breath, the virus that causes COVID-19 attacks many organ systems, in some cases causing catastrophic damage.

“We thought this was only a respiratory virus. Turns out, it goes after the pancreas. It goes after the heart. It goes after the liver, the brain, the kidney and other organs. We didn’t appreciate that in the beginning,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.

In addition to respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 can experience blood clotting disorders that can lead to strokes, and extreme inflammation that attacks multiple organ systems. The virus can also cause neurological complications that range from headache, dizziness and loss of taste or smell to seizures and confusion.

And recovery can be slow, incomplete and costly, with a huge impact on quality of life.

The broad and diverse manifestations of COVID-19 are somewhat unique, said Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.

With influenza, people with underlying heart conditions are also at higher risk of complications, Khan said. What is surprising about this virus is the extent of the complications occurring outside the lungs.

Khan believes there will be a huge healthcare expenditure and burden for individuals who have survived COVID-19.

LENGTHY REHAB FOR MANY

Patients who were in the intensive care unit or on a ventilator for weeks will need to spend extensive time in rehab to regain mobility and strength.

“It can take up to seven days for every one day that you’re hospitalized to recover that type of strength,” Khan said. “It’s harder the older you are, and you may never get back to the same level of function.”

While much of the focus has been on the minority of patients who experience severe disease, doctors increasingly are looking to the needs of patients who were not sick enough to require hospitalization, but are still suffering months after first becoming infected.

Studies are just getting underway to understand the long-term effects of infection, Jay Butler, deputy director of infectious diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters in a telephone briefing on Thursday.

coronavirus,Vice,0,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jge3mp/a-bronx-hospital-is-demanding-psychiatrists-come-in-to-skype-patients,A Bronx Hospital Is Demanding Psychiatrists Come In to Skype Patients,2020-04-02,,"Despite a New York state mandate that companies allow as many employees as possible to work from home , the Montefiore Medical Center , an academic hospital located in the Bronx , is continuing to have `` nonessential '' workers at the Rose F. Kennedy Children 's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center ( CERC ) come into the office , much to the concern of the employees themselves .
Once there , many of the hospital workers , which include developmental pediatricians , psychologists , social workers , and language and occupational therapists , simply connect with patients on the phone or through Skype and other video-conferencing services , because their patients have been told to avoid in-person sessions with them .
`` People are so frightened and really angry , '' said one employee , who requested anonymity because they feared repercussions at their job . `` It 's dangerous . There have been tons of COVID-19 cases everywhere at this point , especially in New York , and there 's a real lack of transparency here . We do n't really know what we 're walking into , even though there are constant reassurances that we 're safe . It does n't feel that way . ''
CERC informed its employees as recently as March 11 that they were considered part of a `` nonessential medical service , '' according to internal emails reviewed by ███ . ( CERC , one of the many clinics associated with Montefiore , focuses on helping kids with language disorders , behavioral problems , and other disabilities . )
Nevertheless , CERC continued to demand these clinicians go to the office and work at full capacity until March 30 , two weeks after Mayor Bill de Blasio closed down the New York City school system . Now , employees are instead forced to commute a few times per week , as opposed to every day . The employee ███ spoke to estimated that this likely affects as many as 150 people .
The employee worried that they and others could potentially contract the coronavirus or spread it to others , when they simply did n't need to be leaving their homes to do their jobs .
`` It 's absurd , '' the employee said . `` Therapists are trying to figure out how to deliver therapy virtually all over the world . I understand it 's difficult—I do—but other hospitals are doing that more effectively . We do n't need to be here physically . '' ( Other New York hospitals , like the Mount Sinai Health System and NYU Langone Medical Center , appear to have been developing work-at-home measures for nonessential employees for close to a month . Montefiore did not respond to multiple requests for comment . )
CERC has asserted in emails that Montefiore is `` on top of things '' and appropriately responding to the global pandemic .

''","Despite a New York state mandate that companies allow as many employees as possible to work from home, the Montefiore Medical Center, an academic hospital located in the Bronx, is continuing to have ""nonessential"" workers at the Rose F. Kennedy Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center (CERC) come into the office, much to the concern of the employees themselves.

Once there, many of the hospital workers, which include developmental pediatricians, psychologists, social workers, and language and occupational therapists, simply connect with patients on the phone or through Skype and other video-conferencing services, because their patients have been told to avoid in-person sessions with them.

""People are so frightened and really angry,"" said one employee, who requested anonymity because they feared repercussions at their job. ""It's dangerous. There have been tons of COVID-19 cases everywhere at this point, especially in New York, and there's a real lack of transparency here. We don't really know what we're walking into, even though there are constant reassurances that we're safe. It doesn't feel that way.""

CERC informed its employees as recently as March 11 that they were considered part of a ""nonessential medical service,"" according to internal emails reviewed by VICE. (CERC, one of the many clinics associated with Montefiore, focuses on helping kids with language disorders, behavioral problems, and other disabilities.)

Nevertheless, CERC continued to demand these clinicians go to the office and work at full capacity until March 30, two weeks after Mayor Bill de Blasio closed down the New York City school system. Now, employees are instead forced to commute a few times per week, as opposed to every day. The employee VICE spoke to estimated that this likely affects as many as 150 people.

The employee worried that they and others could potentially contract the coronavirus or spread it to others, when they simply didn't need to be leaving their homes to do their jobs.

""It's absurd,"" the employee said. ""Therapists are trying to figure out how to deliver therapy virtually all over the world. I understand it's difficult—I do—but other hospitals are doing that more effectively. We don't need to be here physically."" (Other New York hospitals, like the Mount Sinai Health System and NYU Langone Medical Center, appear to have been developing work-at-home measures for nonessential employees for close to a month. Montefiore did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)

CERC has asserted in emails that Montefiore is ""on top of things"" and appropriately responding to the global pandemic. But the center didn't require its staff to wear masks at work until just last week, according to the employee, and it appeared to react slowly overall to the coronavirus outbreak.

The most recent survey , taken on March 16 and 17 , found that , as a group , the experts think that as of March 15 , only 12 percent of infections in the U.S. had been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . They think there ’ s a 73 percent chance of a second wave of hospitalizations this fall . And they expect approximately 200,000 deaths in the U.S. by the end of the year .
But averages can only tell you so much . When forecasting the future , it also matters what a person ( or model ) thinks the range of possibilities could be — how uncertain the forecast is , in other words . In this survey , the experts gave three answers to most questions , representing the most likely future scenario and the best-case and worst-case scenarios .
Collecting responses in this form captures both the best-guess estimate from each respondent and the uncertainty surrounding it . It also lets the people in charge of the survey — Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich , both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst — convert the responses to a probabilistic consensus forecast , something that can answer questions like , “ According to these researchers , what is the probability that we will have 50,000 reported cases by March 29 ? ”
Expert consensus forecasts give you what a model does — a forecast that gives a measure of its uncertainty — without being overly reliant on just one way of thinking about a problem . In this instance , each expert has their own assumptions about how likely the virus is to spread or to be fatal , as well as assumptions about the ways humans might try to mitigate its damage .
Here ’ s what the researchers collectively had to say in the March 16-17 survey .
How many total COVID-19 cases in the U.S. will the CDC report on March 29 ?
At the time the survey was in the field , about 3,500 cases had been reported . But the experts estimated that by Sunday , March 29 — a little under two weeks after they took the survey — the country would have seen anywhere from 10,000 to 75,000 cases . ( The current count is 15,219 . ) The experts ’ confidence in those estimates , however , varied greatly :
Andrew Lover , an epidemiologist from the University of Massachusetts who took the survey , said his estimates were “ semi-quantitative ” and based on the virus ’ s progression in other countries . “ The doubling times have been 5-8 days most places , so it ’ s a matter of applying that with some sliding-scale adjustments ( testing rates , population density , etc . ) based on the ‘ feel ’ of the epidemic curves . ”
The consensus forecast generated by the individual responses indicates that we should expect roughly 19,000 reported cases by March 29 , with an 80 percent chance of seeing between 10,500 and 81,500 cases .
What percentage of all COVID-19 cases in the U.S. had been reported as of March 15 ?
Experts estimated that , on March 15 , when the CDC had publicly identified about 3,500 cases , only between 5 percent and 40 percent of actual COVID-19 cases had been reported . But experts ’ confidence in those numbers was shaky .
The consensus model indicates that only 12 percent of cases had been reported at that time . In other words , the researchers think there were actually about 29,000 infections in the U.S. as of March 15 , more than eight times the known tally .
How likely is it that there will be a second wave of hospitalizations later this year ?
Just as flu season can have two peaks , the surveyed experts think there ’ s a good chance there will be a second wave of coronavirus-related hospitalizations sometime between August and December . Individual estimates for the likelihood of that second round of cases ranged from 40 percent to 96 percent , with an expert consensus of a 73 percent chance .
How many people will die in the U.S. due to COVID-19 this year ?
Experts ’ estimates of the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. in 2020 ranged from 4,000 all the way to 1 million , a huge range that highlights how much we still don ’ t know about this disease .
The expert consensus is to expect about 200,000 deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 this year , but the uncertainty around that number is also huge : There ’ s an 80 percent chance the final number will be between 19,000 and 1.2 million , according to these estimates .
The researchers plan to continue conducting these weekly surveys . As some elements of the pandemic become clearer — such as the virus ’ s incubation period and fatality rate , and how far the U.S. is willing to go to slow the spread of the virus — these ranges will presumably narrow .
But for now , there ’ s a lot the experts still aren ’ t certain of . Just like the rest of us .","One of the most pernicious parts of the COVID-19 crisis is how uncertain everything is. Researchers and officials cite statistical models that estimate infection rates, death counts and when things will go back to normal, but those estimates are changing rapidly. And as the forecasts bounce around, so do the rest of us living through the crisis. How can one feel settled when the future feels so volatile?

Still, there’s a way to at least get a sense for what the experts are thinking. For the past five weeks, infectious disease researchers from institutions around the United States have been taking a survey that gathers their thoughts on the trajectory of the COVID-19 virus. The researchers come from academia, government and industry and are experts in modeling the spread of viruses like this one. The survey asks about things like how many people will eventually get COVID-19 and how many Americans will die.

And there are indeed many proposals — from academic centers , from think tanks , and from the government .
While the plans differ , nearly all of them rely on some combination of surveillance , mass testing , isolation , and contact tracing . Many of them point to countries like Singapore , South Korea , and Germany as examples of how to intelligently respond to the pandemic .
But what if the successful strategies in those countries just won ’ t work in America ?
This question was posed by Keith Humphreys , a Stanford University professor who works on addiction and public health policy , in a viral Twitter thread last week . Humphreys argued that a lot of his public health colleagues weren ’ t thinking seriously enough about the cultural obstacles that might undercut the country ’ s efforts to test , trace , and isolate Americans . He later penned a Washington Post column drawing out his arguments in a little more detail .
Humphreys ’ s basic claim is that any plan we adopt , no matter how wise , is useless without “ widespread political consent ” from American citizens . And the obsession with individual liberties in America , coupled with a general distrust of government , poses an enormous challenge to even the best conceivable plan .
I spoke to Humphreys by phone about what he thinks public health experts are failing to recognize , and if he believes America is too libertarian to handle a collective action problem like the coronavirus pandemic .
Lay out America ’ s “ political-cultural ” problem for me . Why are you worried that we can ’ t deal with this pandemic the way other countries have ?
Well , I think we ’ re different from the other democracies that have handled this well in our long-term resistance to the growth of the state in general , but also in the domain of health . Why is it that every other developed country has government-guaranteed health care and we do not ? The obvious reason is that there ’ s an instinctive aversion to government power in the DNA of America . This is the only major democracy in which a huge number of people have fought to prevent a government guarantee of health care for all citizens .
This aversion is especially potent now , but it goes back to the very beginning of the country , a country founded by people who lived in fear of a king . Our Constitution was set up with checks and balances out of fear of the power of the state . And that libertarian streak is with us through everything and it also applies in the domain of health .
There are some advantages to that libertarian instinct , and I think you admit that , but the problem is that it ’ s just the wrong ideological software to be running in a pandemic—
Right . I don ’ t think we want to live in [ a more authoritarian society ] like Singapore , for example . But the question is what do you do about an epidemic when we really are all in it together and there is no way to run a test , trace , and isolate program without seriously increasing government surveillance and having access to a lot of quite intimate personal information ? Those libertarian impulses stand athwart that .
So I just don ’ t think we can do what Germany does , where there ’ s higher confidence in the state and higher trust in the state . I don ’ t think we can do what democracies in East Asia are doing , where there ’ s a more recent history of autocracy and a lot of deference to the state . Even though I ’ m a public health person and I admire all the people working on all the technical problems and thinking about what we should do to halt this virus , I just believe that we ’ re underestimating the political and cultural obstacles here .
What , exactly , can countries like South Korea and Germany do that we can ’ t ?
In South Korea , you basically had authoritarian rule up until the ’ 80s . The adults in that country grew up in a place where if the government was worried about a parasitic infection , you had to submit stool samples to the officials — it ’ s just what you did . And these are the people deciding , right now , whether or not to follow the orders of their government or whether to hand over personal information . And what we ’ ve seen is that most people are willing to do it .
The case of Germany is a little different . Contrary to stereotypes , Germans are not deferent to their state . They have a lot of concerns about health information , for example . But I think the big difference there is that people have comparatively more trust in the state . They believe their state is fundamentally competent . Virtually all the polling we have on Americans shows that many of them simply don ’ t trust the state , and that ’ s a huge problem when the state is asking you to sacrifice so much for the sake of the public good .
My problem with libertarianism has always been that it gives us a language of rights but it can ’ t give us a language of obligations — it ’ s fundamentally an individualistic philosophy . What you ’ re really saying , in my mind at least , is that America is too libertarian to deal with a collective action problem like this .
Yes , that ’ s a very pithy way to express what I ’ m saying , but it ’ s exactly right .
I should say that I ’ m raising all these questions out of anxiety . In other words , I ’ ll be delighted if I ’ m wrong . But I keep thinking about other times where we ’ ve been in precisely this situation around health , going back to Harry Truman proposing national health insurance and getting beaten . And I worked for President Obama , so I was right there as we struggled to get some version of the Affordable Care Act passed . I watched several states turn down Medicaid expansion . And I saw how the ACA was unable to get a single Republican vote and I don ’ t think anyone lost their seat because of that , because they voted against it .
So I ’ ve seen this dynamic play out over and over again in different contexts and I worry it will be the thing that limits what we ’ re able to do in our efforts to stamp out this virus . I guess I can ’ t put it any better than you : I don ’ t think we can reconcile our libertarianism with the need for a sense of shared purpose in a time of crisis .
If what you ’ re saying is true , then it makes no difference who the president is or which party is in charge , because our problems are fundamentally cultural . And in that sense , you ’ re defining the problem as insoluble .
I think that would be a little bleak . I would say that the president does matter . I was talking to a friend the other day and he said that if Trump put on a mask at a press conference and said , “ I ’ m doing this because it ’ s a smart thing to do , ” that would matter to some people who are resistant , that signal from someone they trust would matter . So it ’ s not that leadership is irrelevant , but I do think there are real limits to what ’ s possible in the country and the origins of that stretch back to our founding .
All right , Keith , you ’ ve forced me to play the optimist here . I take all your points and I don ’ t think anyone can deny our libertarian streak , but here ’ s my counter : A majority of Americans have shown a remarkable willingness to cooperate and social distance in spite of the vacuum of leadership at the top — and that ’ s true across party lines .
That ’ s a very good point and it is encouraging . And some of the data I ’ ve seen from across the country shows that most people are choosing to stay home , even in places that have lifted their lockdown , like Georgia . So there is some consensus on that .
The question for me is , does that translate into behavior ? The psychologist in me can see that 80 percent of Americans think masks are a good idea , for example , but does that mean 80 percent of Americans are actually wearing masks ? Because I ’ m not seeing that and I live in one of the places you ’ d expect to see that .
Wouldn ’ t it , at least , be fair to say that our cultural capacity might be wider than you ’ re suggesting ? I think we have to be careful not to confuse distrust of this administration with distrust of government as such , even though I agree Americans are unusually distrustful of government .
Still , there are reasons to think that there ’ s a reservoir of goodwill that could be marshaled if we had a competent leader who mapped out a clear plan to deal with this pandemic , a plan that inspired confidence and justified the sacrifices and the inconveniences—
Well , there are some places where I think you could establish that empirically by looking around the country . I live in the Bay Area , for instance , and the governor , Gavin Newsom , is pretty well-regarded . He was out ahead on this and he imposed a lot of restrictions that people mostly accepted . I suspect most people will follow their local leaders when the restrictions are wise and explained decently .
I would say , though , that I think a lot depends on there being an actual shared interest that ’ s obvious to everyone . My parents , for example , live in an assisted living community where everyone else is in exactly the same situation , so there ’ s a total consensus . They do not take visitors , they do not go out . But they can do it because everyone recognizes the shared risks .
To be even more clear , I recognize that a lot of people are willing to cooperate and sacrifice . The question we have to ask , the question that virologists , in particular , have to ask , is will it be enough ? If 20 percent of the country opts out , or if several states opt out , will that compromise our national response ? Or will it be just enough to keep the pandemic raging on ?
My worry is that we ’ ll have just enough dissent , for all the reasons we already discussed , to keep this thing going . In that case , we might want to factor that into our thinking about what ’ s possible here . We need some idea of the level of compliance we ’ ll need for any plan to work , and if we can ’ t replicate the compliance levels in countries like South Korea or Germany , we probably shouldn ’ t try to replicate their approach .
Those are good questions and I don ’ t know the answers .
Neither do I . But look , when I say we ’ re different from other countries , I ’ m not saying we ’ re bad or worse . I ’ m just making an assessment of what we ’ re good at and what we ’ re not good at . I mean , if someone wanted to write a book about how much they hate Keith Humphreys , I ’ d tell them to publish it in America , not Britain , because the libel laws are more lenient here and we value free expression and you can get away with it . So that ’ s just an assessment based on the legal culture in this country .
We have lots of strengths in America that can be of incredible value in normal times , but in a pandemic , those same strengths can become a liability . That ’ s all I ’ m really saying .
You conclude your thread by saying we ’ ll probably end up with something like a Swedish coronavirus policy by default . What does that mean exactly ? How does that scenario end ?
One of the pushbacks I got was that our approach won ’ t be as good as Sweden ’ s because we don ’ t have universal health care . So , I think what this means is that the virus will continue to spread fairly consistently across the country . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if the death toll has doubled by Labor Day . I would , of course , be incredibly happy to be wrong about that .
And there ’ s really only two things that could interrupt this : 1 ) a vaccine , which is very unlikely for at least a year or more , or 2 ) increased development of therapeutics . So maybe we ’ ll have a breakthrough in our ability to treat the symptoms . What I think is most likely is that a huge number of people contract this virus and we develop immunity over time . If that happens , the virus will diminish over time , but it won ’ t be because of our test , trace , and isolate efforts .

I take all your points and I don’t think anyone can deny our libertarian streak, but here’s my counter: A majority of Americans have shown a remarkable willingness to cooperate and social distance in spite of the vacuum of leadership at the top — and that’s true across party lines.

Does that give you any pause at all?

Keith Humphreys

That’s a very good point and it is encouraging. And some of the data I’ve seen from across the country shows that most people are choosing to stay home, even in places that have lifted their lockdown, like Georgia. So there is some consensus on that.

The question for me is, does that translate into behavior? The psychologist in me can see that 80 percent of Americans think masks are a good idea, for example, but does that mean 80 percent of Americans are actually wearing masks? Because I’m not seeing that and I live in one of the places you’d expect to see that.

Sean Illing

Wouldn’t it, at least, be fair to say that our cultural capacity might be wider than you’re suggesting? I think we have to be careful not to confuse distrust of this administration with distrust of government as such, even though I agree Americans are unusually distrustful of government.

Still, there are reasons to think that there’s a reservoir of goodwill that could be marshaled if we had a competent leader who mapped out a clear plan to deal with this pandemic, a plan that inspired confidence and justified the sacrifices and the inconveniences—

Keith Humphreys

Well, there are some places where I think you could establish that empirically by looking around the country. I live in the Bay Area, for instance, and the governor, Gavin Newsom, is pretty well-regarded. He was out ahead on this and he imposed a lot of restrictions that people mostly accepted. I suspect most people will follow their local leaders when the restrictions are wise and explained decently.

I would say, though, that I think a lot depends on there being an actual shared interest that’s obvious to everyone. My parents, for example, live in an assisted living community where everyone else is in exactly the same situation, so there’s a total consensus. They do not take visitors, they do not go out. But they can do it because everyone recognizes the shared risks.

To be even more clear, I recognize that a lot of people are willing to cooperate and sacrifice. The question we have to ask, the question that virologists, in particular, have to ask, is will it be enough? If 20 percent of the country opts out, or if several states opt out, will that compromise our national response? Or will it be just enough to keep the pandemic raging on?

My worry is that we’ll have just enough dissent, for all the reasons we already discussed, to keep this thing going. In that case, we might want to factor that into our thinking about what’s possible here. We need some idea of the level of compliance we’ll need for any plan to work, and if we can’t replicate the compliance levels in countries like South Korea or Germany, we probably shouldn’t try to replicate their approach.

Sean Illing

Those are good questions and I don’t know the answers.

Keith Humphries

Neither do I. But look, when I say we’re different from other countries, I’m not saying we’re bad or worse. I’m just making an assessment of what we’re good at and what we’re not good at. I mean, if someone wanted to write a book about how much they hate Keith Humphreys, I’d tell them to publish it in America, not Britain, because the libel laws are more lenient here and we value free expression and you can get away with it. So that’s just an assessment based on the legal culture in this country.

We have lots of strengths in America that can be of incredible value in normal times, but in a pandemic, those same strengths can become a liability. That’s all I’m really saying.

Sean Illing

You conclude your thread by saying we’ll probably end up with something like a Swedish coronavirus policy by default. What does that mean exactly? How does that scenario end?

Keith Humphreys

One of the pushbacks I got was that our approach won’t be as good as Sweden’s because we don’t have universal health care. So, I think what this means is that the virus will continue to spread fairly consistently across the country. I wouldn’t be surprised if the death toll has doubled by Labor Day. I would, of course, be incredibly happy to be wrong about that.

And there’s really only two things that could interrupt this: 1) a vaccine, which is very unlikely for at least a year or more, or 2) increased development of therapeutics. So maybe we’ll have a breakthrough in our ability to treat the symptoms. What I think is most likely is that a huge number of people contract this virus and we develop immunity over time. If that happens, the virus will diminish over time, but it won’t be because of our test, trace, and isolate efforts.

That doctor had been standing beside her patient ’ s bed . Before the patient closed her eyes , she stretched out her hand and placed it on the plastic visor that shielded her doctor ’ s face , as if looking for a last , desperate human touch .
Rizzi is the president of the health care NGO Soleterre , which works on human rights issues around health care . He ’ s also a psychologist at the San Matteo hospital in Pavia , one of the first cities affected by the COVID-19 emergency in Italy . He uses that doctor ’ s story as a portrait of what is happening in the wards of thousands of hospitals around the world . “ This virus has created a very strong sense of loneliness , ” he says . “ Doctors covered from head to toe in synthetic suits are the only link to real life for intubated patients , or imprisoned ones in oxygen helmets , often unable to say a word. ” For this reason , he and his team are on the front line , alongside the health personnel in the COVID-19 and intensive care units of the San Matteo hospital , to try to bring psychological support to this hell . “ We have been on the war front , in the Balkans , in the Donbass in Ukraine , in the refugee camps in northern Uganda . When the coronavirus emergency broke out , I felt it was important to be here . ”
There are many associations of psychologists who offer telephone consultations to health professionals , but almost no one is in the ward by their side because of the risk of infection . Right now , in Lombardy , the Italian region most affected by COVID-19 , the mental well-being of the patient and the caregiver is being treated equally . This emergency has kept health care workers in a state of continuous trauma for over a month . “ They are confused . Many find themselves doing a job they have never done , far from their departments , ” Rizzi says . “ Some experience survivor ’ s guilt , a classic for those who live through tragedies. ” They say they feel helpless , they are seeing many more people dying than they are used to seeing , they still don ’ t have the medicine to cure the disease , and sometimes they don ’ t even have the right protection .

Updated at 4:18 p.m. ET

President Trump ordered the border with Canada partly closed on Wednesday and the Pentagon said it would join the coronavirus pandemic response with hospital ships, field treatment centers and medical supplies.

Echoing the rhetoric of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who proclaimed himself ""commander of the people's war"" against the coronavirus, Trump said in a press conference on Wednesday that he had become a ""wartime president"" and that Americans now are in something like a state of war, too.

That's why the U.S.-Canada border — the longest undefended frontier in the world — would close to nonessential traffic ""by mutual consent"" with Ottawa, Trump said.

The pandemic has shut down travel around the world. Trump made his announcement about Canada on Twitter.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau then said in Ottawa that some traffic would continue to pass through, but the goal is to limit the nonurgent passage of people back and forth.

Trump said at the White House he would convene another news conference this week about ""some very important news"" from the Food and Drug Administration about the coronavirus — a pandemic he is increasingly referring to as ""the Chinese virus,"" amid criticism.

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was first diagnosed in China in December.

Details about the announcement were not immediately available, but a news conference is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET on Thursday.

Defense Department actions

Trump said the hospital ship USNS Comfort would sail from its berth in Norfolk, Va., to dock in New York City in the coming weeks in order to try to add its treatment capacity to the city's hospitals.

The hospital ship USNS Mercy, based in San Diego, also would deploy along the West Coast, the president said, but he said authorities haven't made a determination as to where it might go.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper also said the military would prepare to deploy field hospitals or treatment centers and contribute about 5 million protective masks from its stockpile.

The first batch of roughly 1 million masks is available now, Esper said, but it wasn't clear when the ships might deploy or the other measures might get underway.

The White House is scrambling to help states and cities ramp up testing sites and bolster hospitals expecting to see a surge in patients with the respiratory illness caused by the virus.

The task force leading the response had planned to meet on Wednesday with academic experts who have modeled the spread of the disease. Trump also spoke with a group of physicians and nurses.

""We must sacrifice together""

Authorities continued to implore Americans to take precautionary steps to limit the spread of the virus, including via social distancing and by avoiding large groups of people.

Dr. Deborah Birx, a leader on the White House's medical task force for the pandemic, said that younger people especially must observe the restrictions and not think themselves invulnerable from being affected or from carrying the virus.

Birx said young people should not use the disruptions associated with the pandemic as a vacation or an opening to socialize.

""We cannot have these large gatherings that continue to occur,"" she warned.

Birx said the roughly 110 deaths reported from the coronavirus as of Wednesday represent cases of infections that took place two to three weeks ago. Many Americans could yet begin to show symptoms, and many others may be unknowingly carrying the virus and transmitting it without themselves becoming sick.

That's why Birx and other officials have stressed the need to limit travel and sharply revised their warnings about precautionary measures, she said.

Researchers are still attempting to learn how much transmission comes from human-to-human contact and how much comes from interacting with contaminated surfaces.

Birx and other authorities also have stressed the importance of proper hand-washing.

Trump urged Americans to accept the disruptions and isolation that the pandemic has wrought, likening the national effort he said is needed to the American response to World War II.

""Every generation of Americans has been called to make sacrifices for the good of their nation. Now it's our time. We must sacrifice together,"" Trump said. ""We are in this together, and we'll come through this together.""

""The Chinese virus""

Trump has pivoted to using the term ""Chinese virus"" to describe the pandemic in tweets and statements. For example, on Tuesday, he used the term in a meeting with CEOs from the hotel industry — a sector ravaged by the pandemic.

Asked at Wednesday's briefing whether he would continue using the term ""Chinese virus,"" Trump rejected criticism that he was creating a stigma.

The president has said he wants to combat statements by Chinese Communist Party officials falsely alleging that the U.S. Army might have introduced the virus to its original epicenter in the city of Wuhan.

""It's not racist. It comes from China,"" Trump said of the coronavirus.

He rejected questions about the effect of his words on Asian Americans as the president and other allies escalate the focus they've placed on the Chinese origins of the pathogen.

Trump said he didn't agree with some critics of China who said that it had ""inflicted"" the virus on the U.S. and the world, but the president said he did think Chinese officials could have given the world an earlier warning about the severity of the disease.

Disruptions to airlines

Separately, Trump talked to airline CEOs on Wednesday, the second time this month he has talked to an industry that has seen its business grind to a halt as people stay home.

The airline industry says the pandemic has had a more deleterious effect on business than the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and has sought a government bailout.

""We don't want airlines going out of business. We don't want people losing their jobs,"" Trump said at a press conference on Tuesday. ""We're going big.""

Trump also was set to join a conference call with the Business Roundtable, CEOs from the country's largest companies.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is asking Congress for $45.8 billion in emergency support for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, funding for states' public health needs and research resources at the National Institutes of Health.

The request comes as the Senate is expected to vote Wednesday on a separate House-approved package that provides economic relief to those affected and resources for testing.

The White House is also pitching Congress an economic rescue package worth about $1 trillion. That's 45% more than federal defense spending in 2019 and would eclipse the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus package of $787 billion.

Trump was asked on Wednesday how much money Americans might see in potential checks directly from the federal government as part of a stimulus.

""To be determined,"" he said.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The number of laid-off workers seeking U.S. unemployment aid barely fell last week , and the reopening of small businesses has leveled off — evidence that the job market ’ s gains may have stalled just as a surge in coronavirus cases is endangering an economic recovery .
The government also reported Thursday that the economy contracted at a 5 % annual rate in the first three months of the year , a further sign of the damage being inflicted by the viral pandemic . The economy is expected to shrink at a roughly 30 % rate in the current quarter . That would be the worst quarterly contraction , by far , since record-keeping began in 1948 . Economists do expect a snap-back in the second half of the year , though not enough to reverse all the damage .
Last week , the number of people applying for jobless benefits declined slightly to 1.48 million . It was the 12th straight weekly drop . An additional 700,000 people applied through a program for self-employed and gig workers that made them eligible for aid for the first time . These figures aren ’ t adjusted for seasonal variations , so the government doesn ’ t include them in the official count .
Combining those figures , overall applications for jobless aid have edged down just 3 % in the past two weeks — a much slower pace than in late April and May .
“ There has been no real decline in weekly claims the past two weeks , ” said Julia Pollak , a labor economist at ZipRecruiter . “ There has also been no real increase in job openings . What seemed like encouraging signs of recovery in May largely stalled in June . ”
A separate government report Thursday said orders for durable goods unexpectedly jumped nearly 16 % in May , reflecting a rebound in some business activity . Still , the pace of orders and shipments remains far below pre-pandemic levels . And excluding the volatile transportation category , so-called core orders rose only modestly , reflecting still-sluggish business investment .

Should the trends continue , states may reimpose some limits on businesses that would likely trigger job cuts . And if not , consumers may choose to shop , eat out , and travel less .
Texas Gov . Greg Abbott said Thursday that that state will suspend its business reopenings amid a surge in coronavirus infections .
Real time data on small businesses suggests that the job market ’ s improvement slowed in June compared with May , when 2.5 million jobs were unexpectedly added .

In just under four months , more than 100,000 Americans are now reported to have died from the novel coronavirus , a grim milestone President Donald Trump once suggested the country would never see .
Roughly a month ago , Trump , at a White House task force briefing , said , `` It looks like we 'll be at about a 60,000 mark , which is 40,000 less than the lowest number thought of . ''
A few days later , on April 24 , he again sought to highlight a lesser number : `` Minimal numbers were going to be 100,000 people . And we 're going to be , hopefully , far below that . ''
As the politically fraught threshold neared Tuesday , he continued to play down the actual figure , using new language .
`` If we did n't act quickly and smartly we would 've had , in my opinion and the opinion of others , anywhere from 10 to 20 and maybe even 25 times the number of deaths , '' Trump said , when asked to comment at a Rose Garden news conference .
He continued to make the unverified claim , as he does at every opportunity , that his decision to impose partial restrictions on travel from China , which took effect in early February , had made all the difference .
As the numbers shifted , the president has been consistent -- characterizing the ever-increasing death estimates as a relative success , compared to the 2.2 million death toll projection from the London Imperial College if the U.S. took no action to slow the spread of the deadly virus .

Casting himself as a `` wartime president '' in command of the country 's response to an `` invisible enemy , '' he has suggested American casualties were inevitable . He has deflected questions about what death toll he finds acceptable in exchange for reopening the economy by saying `` one death is too many . ''
He acknowledged Tuesday , in a tweet , that it `` looks like '' 100,000 `` will be the number . ''
As he encourages Americans to return to life before COVID-19 , using campaign-style slogans such as `` open up American again '' and `` transition to greatness , '' Trump has continued to spin the rising death toll as relative good news .
It was only three months ago when he said the coronavirus would `` disappear . ''
`` You have 15 people , and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero , '' he said Feb. 26 at a coronavirus task force briefing .
And when the first death in the U.S. was reported on Feb. 29 ( though an April autopsy would reveal an earlier death in California on Feb. 6 ) , the president held a campaign rally in South Carolina the night before , calling criticism of his response the Democratic Party 's `` new hoax . ''
It was n't until a coronavirus task force briefing on March 31 -- the day the U.S. death toll passed 4,000 -- that Trump conceded there would be significant loss of life , after several weeks of comparing the virus to the flu .
Trump said heeding White House guidance was a `` matter of life or death , frankly '' before tossing to Dr. Deborah Birx , the White House 's coronavirus response coordinator , who displayed its model estimating 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die .
While the president said it was `` very sobering '' to see that 100,000 was the predicted minimum death toll , he also said that it was still `` a very low number . ''
At the time , even the government 's top expert of infectious diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci said he hoped the U.S. would not hit 100,000 lives but that `` as sobering a number as that is , we should be prepared for it . ''

Not even two weeks after that news conference , Trump cast doubt that the U.S. death toll would reach 100,000 lives , a point he repeated throughout the month of April at least seven times , growing more definitive with each mention .
At the start of the month , Trump said , `` I think we 'll be substantially under that number , '' when asked about the White House task force minimum prediction of 100,000 deaths , and by the end of April , he insisted the country would be `` far below '' that prediction .
On April 20 , for example , as the death toll toppled 40,000 , Trump claimed he heard the U.S. death toll could end up at 50 or 60,000 , appearing to prematurely declare a victory of sorts -- citing figures well below what he called `` the low number '' estimate of 100,000 .
`` We did the right thing , because if we did n't do it , you would have had a million people , a million and a half people , maybe two million people dead . Now , we 're going toward 50 , I 'm hearing , or 60,000 people , '' the president said . `` That 's at the lower -- as you know , the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people . We could end up at 50 to 60 . ''
On April 29 , Trump raised his prediction to 70,000 as potential for `` the final level '' -- the same day his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner called the federal government 's response a `` great success story . ''
`` If we did n't do what we did , you would have had a million people die , maybe more , maybe 2 million people die , '' Trump said April 29 . `` And if you think that we 'd be at 65 , or 70 , or 60 , or whatever the final level would be , '' Trump said .
And when that number was surpassed on May 1 and the U.S. neared 65,000 deaths , Trump suggested the country would still come in below 100,000 , again citing the London Imperial College projection .
`` Not long ago , models predicted that between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people would have died in the United States without the mitigation , '' Trump said , adding , `` We have saved thousands and thousands of lives . ''
`` And hopefully , we 're going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost , which is a horrible number nevertheless . It 's a horrible thing . It could 've been stopped . It should 've been stopped at source , but it was n't , '' the president said , blaming China .

Just days later , in a `` virtual town hall '' with Fox News as the country 's death toll neared 68,000 , Trump threw out several numbers , saying the U.S. is `` going to lose anywhere from 75 , 80 to 100,000 people . ''
When pressed on how that number had changed from when he once predicted 60,000 deaths , Trump said , `` And now I 'm saying 80 or 90 . ''
`` But it 's still going to be , no matter how you look at it , at the very lower end of the plane , '' he continued .
In an exclusive interview with ABC News `` World News Tonight '' Anchor David Muir on May 6 , Trump did acknowledge the toll could be higher than 70,000 , but again said it could have been much worse , by comparison .

`` The upper number was , as you know , 2.2 million people . And then there are some , some models or charts that showed higher than that . But 2.2 million people . I always felt 60 , 65 , 70 -- as , as horrible as that is -- I mean , you 're talking about filling up Yankee Stadium with death . So I thought it was horrible , but it 's probably going to be somewhat higher than that , '' he said .
Vice President Mike Pence , while talking more openly about the death toll , and expressing more sympathy for the victims , also at times has been too optimistic , saying last month , `` I think by Memorial Day weekend we will have this coronavirus epidemic behind us . ''
Others on the coronavirus task force more directly acknowledged the symbolic number .

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield tweeted that the U.S. has been on pace to hit more than 100,000 coronavirus deaths by June 1 since May 11 -- but his comments have largely been overshadowed as the country sees fewer task force briefings and more of the president taking questions after various events , many times without health experts by his side .
The CDC assessment cited 12 different models tracked by the agency and marked the first time Redfield explicitly addressed death toll numbers . One of the models he cited was done by Columbia University -- a finding the president immediately dismissed as partisan , after a group of researchers there said 84 % of Americans could have been saved had he and governors imposed restrictions two weeks earlier .
When asked about the Columbia analysis that more lives could have been saved , Trump attacked the Ivy League school as a `` liberal , disgraceful institution . ''
`` I saw that report . It 's a disgrace that Columbia University would do it , playing right to their little group of people that tell them what to do , '' Trump told the program `` Full Measure , '' produced by the conservative Sinclair Television Group .

As the politically fraught threshold neared Tuesday, he continued to play down the actual figure, using new language.

""If we didn't act quickly and smartly we would've had, in my opinion and the opinion of others, anywhere from 10 to 20 and maybe even 25 times the number of deaths,"" Trump said, when asked to comment at a Rose Garden news conference.

He continued to make the unverified claim, as he does at every opportunity, that his decision to impose partial restrictions on travel from China, which took effect in early February, had made all the difference.

As the numbers shifted, the president has been consistent -- characterizing the ever-increasing death estimates as a relative success, compared to the 2.2 million death toll projection from the London Imperial College if the U.S. took no action to slow the spread of the deadly virus.

Casting himself as a ""wartime president"" in command of the country's response to an ""invisible enemy,"" he has suggested American casualties were inevitable. He has deflected questions about what death toll he finds acceptable in exchange for reopening the economy by saying ""one death is too many.""

He acknowledged Tuesday, in a tweet, that it ""looks like"" 100,000 ""will be the number.""

As he encourages Americans to return to life before COVID-19, using campaign-style slogans such as ""open up American again"" and ""transition to greatness,"" Trump has continued to spin the rising death toll as relative good news.

It was only three months ago when he said the coronavirus would ""disappear.""

""You have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,"" he said Feb. 26 at a coronavirus task force briefing.

And when the first death in the U.S. was reported on Feb. 29 (though an April autopsy would reveal an earlier death in California on Feb. 6), the president held a campaign rally in South Carolina the night before, calling criticism of his response the Democratic Party's ""new hoax.""

It wasn't until a coronavirus task force briefing on March 31 -- the day the U.S. death toll passed 4,000 -- that Trump conceded there would be significant loss of life, after several weeks of comparing the virus to the flu.

Trump said heeding White House guidance was a ""matter of life or death, frankly"" before tossing to Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, who displayed its model estimating 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die.

While the president said it was ""very sobering"" to see that 100,000 was the predicted minimum death toll, he also said that it was still ""a very low number.""

At the time, even the government's top expert of infectious diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci said he hoped the U.S. would not hit 100,000 lives but that ""as sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it.""

Not even two weeks after that news conference, Trump cast doubt that the U.S. death toll would reach 100,000 lives, a point he repeated throughout the month of April at least seven times, growing more definitive with each mention.

At the start of the month, Trump said, ""I think we'll be substantially under that number,"" when asked about the White House task force minimum prediction of 100,000 deaths, and by the end of April, he insisted the country would be ""far below"" that prediction.

On April 20, for example, as the death toll toppled 40,000, Trump claimed he heard the U.S. death toll could end up at 50 or 60,000, appearing to prematurely declare a victory of sorts -- citing figures well below what he called ""the low number"" estimate of 100,000.

""We did the right thing, because if we didn't do it, you would have had a million people, a million and a half people, maybe two million people dead. Now, we're going toward 50, I'm hearing, or 60,000 people,"" the president said. ""That's at the lower -- as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people. We could end up at 50 to 60.""

On April 29, Trump raised his prediction to 70,000 as potential for ""the final level"" -- the same day his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner called the federal government's response a ""great success story.""

""If we didn't do what we did, you would have had a million people die, maybe more, maybe 2 million people die,"" Trump said April 29. ""And if you think that we'd be at 65, or 70, or 60, or whatever the final level would be,"" Trump said.

And when that number was surpassed on May 1 and the U.S. neared 65,000 deaths, Trump suggested the country would still come in below 100,000, again citing the London Imperial College projection.

""Not long ago, models predicted that between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people would have died in the United States without the mitigation,"" Trump said, adding, ""We have saved thousands and thousands of lives.""

""And hopefully, we're going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless. It's a horrible thing. It could've been stopped. It should've been stopped at source, but it wasn't,"" the president said, blaming China.

Just days later, in a ""virtual town hall"" with Fox News as the country's death toll neared 68,000, Trump threw out several numbers, saying the U.S. is ""going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people.""

When pressed on how that number had changed from when he once predicted 60,000 deaths, Trump said, ""And now I'm saying 80 or 90.""

""But it's still going to be, no matter how you look at it, at the very lower end of the plane,"" he continued.

In an exclusive interview with ABC News ""World News Tonight"" Anchor David Muir on May 6, Trump did acknowledge the toll could be higher than 70,000, but again said it could have been much worse, by comparison.

""The upper number was, as you know, 2.2 million people. And then there are some, some models or charts that showed higher than that. But 2.2 million people. I always felt 60, 65, 70 -- as, as horrible as that is -- I mean, you're talking about filling up Yankee Stadium with death. So I thought it was horrible, but it's probably going to be somewhat higher than that,"" he said.

Vice President Mike Pence, while talking more openly about the death toll, and expressing more sympathy for the victims, also at times has been too optimistic, saying last month, ""I think by Memorial Day weekend we will have this coronavirus epidemic behind us.""

Others on the coronavirus task force more directly acknowledged the symbolic number.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield tweeted that the U.S. has been on pace to hit more than 100,000 coronavirus deaths by June 1 since May 11 -- but his comments have largely been overshadowed as the country sees fewer task force briefings and more of the president taking questions after various events, many times without health experts by his side.

The CDC assessment cited 12 different models tracked by the agency and marked the first time Redfield explicitly addressed death toll numbers. One of the models he cited was done by Columbia University -- a finding the president immediately dismissed as partisan, after a group of researchers there said 84% of Americans could have been saved had he and governors imposed restrictions two weeks earlier.

When asked about the Columbia analysis that more lives could have been saved, Trump attacked the Ivy League school as a ""liberal, disgraceful institution.""

""I saw that report. It's a disgrace that Columbia University would do it, playing right to their little group of people that tell them what to do,"" Trump told the program ""Full Measure,"" produced by the conservative Sinclair Television Group.

Asked on Tuesday what the president would do when the toll passes the 100,000 mark, the White House noted he had ordered flags lowered to half-staff over the Memorial Day weekend.

Officials wouldn't disclose what else he might do or say to mark the historic moment.

The prediction is a big deal for investors for three reasons .
1 . It ’ s credible because it comes from Jefferies , a high-profile brokerage in biotech and pharma that ’ s wired in to literally hundreds of companies in the group , including the major vaccine developers . Jefferies has nine analysts covering the industry .
2 . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval of a vaccine ahead of voting could have an impact on the elections , possibly swaying the outcome in favor of President Trump .
3 . For investors , early vaccine approval would be bullish for biotech stocks , cyclical stocks , travel stocks , the economy and the market overall . The S & P 500 Index SPX , -0.56 % and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -0.80 % have recovered most of their March losses , and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , +0.03 % recently hit new highs . They ’ ll need some good news to support further advances .
Ironically , early vaccine approvals probably won ’ t mean much for investors who have already enjoyed good runs in vaccine developers . It might not mean much for most people worried about contracting the virus , either . Weird , right ? We ’ ll get to that later in this column .
We hear time and again that vaccines take 10 to 15 years to research and bring to market . So given the limited timeline of Covid-19 vaccine safety and efficacy studies to date , the following is a bold projection .
“ We believe the FDA will likely approve at least one vaccine prior to the November election , ” Jefferies health-care strategist Jared Holz said in an interview . “ Perhaps multiple vaccines could get the go-ahead at some point early in the fourth quarter and quell fears of a second wave of Covid-19 . ”
But this isn ’ t too off the wall , even if Covid-19 vaccines have only been investigated for under a year . That ’ s because Holz is basing his prediction , in part , on signals from vaccine-development companies .
He says New York-based Jefferies has heard from several vaccine developers — including Moderna MRNA , +2.15 % and AstraZeneca AZN , +0.68 % — that an emergency authorization may happen before the elections . And just as important , they ’ ll be close to having the capacity to produce millions of doses .
“ That sets a very high bar , which no one is asking them to set , ” says Holz .
Efficacy studies will continue . Moderna is moving into Phase II Covid-19 vaccine trials now , and it will start a larger Phase III clinical study at the beginning of July , the company has said . Both trials look at efficacy , and they will continue to examine safety . Many other vaccine companies are on a similar timeline .
Here are three other reasons we may well see Covid-19 vaccine approval before early November .
1 . President Trump has a penchant for timing policy decisions ( such as China trade negotiation breakthroughs ) to influence the markets and the electorate at key tactical turning points . So it won ’ t be surprising if he exerts behind-the-scenes pressure to get vaccine approval to boost ratings and his odds against the Democrats , says Holz . Sounds Machiavellian . But welcome to politics .
2 . The federal government is directly funding many of the vaccine-development programs . This “ raises the odds of near-term approval , given the inherent bias , ” says Holz .
3 . Initial approval would be for emergency use only , which lowers the research hurdles for efficacy . “ The efficacy bar will be fairly low considering the toll Covid-19 has taken on the world over the past four to six months from a health and an economic standpoint , ” says Holz .
Emergency-use approval seems like a letdown because it would take a lot of potential beneficiaries , including you and me , out of the equation . Health-care workers would be first in line . But limited-use approval would still be important for investors and the economy .
It would help the health-care system . Our leaders shut down much of the economy when Covid-19 struck because they had failed to prepare the health-care system for a pandemic . Having vaccines that might keep more front-line health care workers on the job and healthy — boosting their morale and numbers — would take some of the pressure off politicians to reimpose fresh lockdowns to “ flatten the curve ” in a resurgence .
Will we get a resurgence ? Probably , but not right now . I think the current resurgence data are just noise . The case-count data are based on non-random samples , which renders them meaningless , statistically . Florida tested more and found more , in lockstep . Exactly what you would expect . The Florida data do not show a resurgence in Covid-19 , only more testing .
But I do expect a meaningful resurgence starting in early October when the flu season begins . This is what happened with the swine flu in 2010 and the Spanish flu a century ago . However , the October resurgence won ’ t be as scary as round one , because a lot of people will already have been exposed , and we will have better testing and tracking capabilities to support selective rather than blanket lockdowns . And we might even have a vaccine .
Early approval of vaccines before the elections probably wouldn ’ t help investors in the companies developing them , including Moderna , AstraZeneca , Pfizer PFE , +0.54 % , Johnson & Johnson JNJ , +0.29 % , Sanofi SNY , +1.73 % , Inovio Pharmaceuticals INO , -0.48 % , Novavax NVAX , +9.24 % and Arcturus Therapeutics ARCT , +2.92 % , among others .
That ’ s because many of the stocks have already risen a lot , especially those closer to being pure plays because they are smaller .
Next , it would be bad PR for vaccine producers to be seen making a lot of profits off a global pandemic health crisis . ( The same goes for Covid-19 therapy developers including Gilead GILD , +4.63 % , which is researching remdesivir as a treatment . ) Given the government ’ s role in funding research , it would likewise also pressure vaccine makers to cap pricing .
But many other investors would benefit from vaccine approvals . Biotech and pharma investors would get a boost if the public and politicians view them as having “ saved the day ” in the Covid-19 crisis . That would mean there would be less pressure for them to rein in drug pricing .
That would support biotech and pharma companies and exchange traded funds including iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index IBB , +3.26 % and SPDR S & P Biotech XBI , +2.83 % . They have been plagued for years by worries the government will regulate drug prices .
“ In the end , a vaccine likely does more for the sector as whole from a sentiment standpoint , ” says Jefferies ’ Holz .
Vaccine approval would also help cyclical and travel stocks because it would lower the odds of another full lockdown . It would also benefit a group I call “ public-gathering-place ” stocks .

Bold prediction

We hear time and again that vaccines take 10 to 15 years to research and bring to market. So given the limited timeline of Covid-19 vaccine safety and efficacy studies to date, the following is a bold projection.

“We believe the FDA will likely approve at least one vaccine prior to the November election,” Jefferies health-care strategist Jared Holz said in an interview. “Perhaps multiple vaccines could get the go-ahead at some point early in the fourth quarter and quell fears of a second wave of Covid-19.”

Some are claiming that means reopening plans are not working and represent reckless behavior. In reality, however, the governors are appropriately pausing to assess the developing situation and react to the new data.

That’s a planned fallback and an important aspect of a flexible and robust reopening strategy that balances protecting both lives and livelihoods.

>>> What’s the best way for America to reopen and return to business? The National Coronavirus Recovery Commission, a project of The Heritage Foundation, assembled America’s top thinkers to figure that out. So far, it has made more than 260 recommendations. Learn more here.

As expected with reopening, we have begun to see incidences of COVID-19 begin to rise again. That’s no surprise. From the beginning, we knew reopening could result in rising case numbers and that there may be hot spots where a governor or mayor might need to target mitigation measures to stop and slow the spread of the disease.

States are in various stages of reopening, with many officials implementing a phased approach. The purpose of the phased plan was for a more predictable and manageable pattern of cases.

In fact, the incidence of COVID-19 had been fairly stable in the month of May, when Texas began its first phases of slowly reopening and returning to a modicum of normalcy.

How does South Korea compare with the U.S.?

Both countries saw their first corona­virus cases on the same day, Jan. 20. By April 2, the U.S. had more than 240,000 cases and more than 5,800 deaths. Most businesses were shut down or crippled, and more than 10 million people had filed for unemployment in two weeks. In contrast, South Korea on April 2 had fewer than 10,000 confirmed cases and 169 deaths. The disease rate there appears to be both low and stable, yet no South Korean city has gone under a full lockdown, and the main economic losses were in the tourism industry. Few people lost their jobs. The difference is that South Korea sprang into action with early mass testing, tracking and isolating all contacts of those infected. It started developing and stockpiling test kits in early January, as soon as Chinese scientists released the virus's genetic code and before a single Korean had been infected.

How did they know to do that?

An outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea in 2015 exposed vulnerabilities that terrified the populace and forced an overhaul of epidemic response. A single patient infected with MERS — caused by a different coronavirus than the one that causes COVID-19 — brought it in from the Middle East, was treated at three hospitals, and sparked outbreaks in each one, infecting 186 people and killing 38. That epidemic was quashed in two months by quarantining nearly 17,000 people, but the experience badly damaged the popularity of then–President Park Geun-hye. Seoul drew up new rules for health ­crises, empowering the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take full authority to direct local responses. And social norms established during MERS made the population willingly adopt mask wearing in public. South Koreans learned that because any new virus can spread exponentially, stamping out each new outbreak quickly is the key to avoiding catastrophic growth.

How did they react this time?

Just three days after news broke on Dec. 31 of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan, China, the KCDC set up a response team to study the virus. Once the first case appeared, authorities started tracking the health of some 3,000 people who had traveled to Wuhan over the previous two weeks. The KCDC assembled a vast public-private network to produce and administer tests, including drive-through centers, and established labs to process them. The cases that had come from China were largely contained — but then in mid-­February, a ""super-spreader"" was identified in Daegu, the third-­biggest city, who had infected hundreds of people at several services at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Over 10 days, cases soared from fewer than 50 to more than 5,000. South Korea quickly surged its testing to some 20,000 people a day, but it also took more extreme measures.

What were these?

President Moon Jae-in allowed the use of invasive surveillance tactics to track worshippers at Shincheonji churches across the country. South Korea's phone companies have each user's national ID number. So authorities were able to follow the movements of infected people and identify those they had interacted with over the past 14 days. Those contacts were then told to self-isolate and report their temperatures daily. Their compliance was voluntary, but South Koreans know the government can monitor their movements through phone data and an extensive CCTV network of 8 million cameras. Anyone who tested positive was sent to one of the quarantine centers set up in hotels and company dorms. After one worker at an insurance company in Seoul tested positive, authorities set up a tent to test everyone in the building.

Did other countries follow suit?

The other Asian countries with effective responses to the pandemic are Singapore, Vietnam, and Taiwan. All were previously hit by the 2003 epidemic of another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had a terrifying 10 percent fatality rate. Because of swift measures in affected areas, it killed just 774 people. In the aftermath, all three countries adopted new health policies involving mask wearing, testing, and tracking. When COVID-19 hit, populations in those countries had masks at home, and high enough levels of social trust to quickly obey government orders to report for testing and stay at home.

""The situation in [Western] countries now resembles the situation we were in during the first few weeks of the SARS spread in Taiwan in early 2003,"" Su Ih-jen of Taiwan's CDC told the Financial Times. ""You are not ready, you have no experience.""

What the U.S. can do

The Trump administration's failure to test and impose distancing rules for two months let the virus gain a foothold and led to the current exponential increase in cases. But it's not too late to implement much wider testing. South Korea has tested 1 in every 119 of its people. The U.S. says it has performed 1.2 million tests, but since each patient is given at least two tests, that works out to fewer than 1 in 500 Americans. Most Americans who suspected they were infected have not been able to get tested. At this point, with more than 300,000 known infections and probably far more, tracking contacts will be impossible.

If we can learn anything from Wisconsin about coronavirus and election panics, maybe it’s that it’s time to start thinking about November.”

Kylee Zempel, The Federalist

“We might beat COVID-19 by fall. But if we don’t, what happens to our November election? Two principles are paramount. The election must be held. And people who want to vote must be able to do so without fear of infection and without worsening the pandemic. To uphold those principles, we must expand no-excuse absentee voting and make drive-through voting possible…



“These changes will neither clearly help one party at the other’s expense, nor increase voter fraud. The No. 1 group that votes by mail now are the elderly, who tend to vote Republican. As the elderly are also the group most affected by COVID-19, voting by mail might help them the most. On the other hand, increased turnout is typically good for Democrats, who benefit from greater youth and minority votes…



“The truth is that no one knows whom expanded absentee voting and drive-through voting would favor in November 2020. That should make it easier to set aside our partisan identities and do what is right for democracy. So long as the change is a one-off, which can be written into state and federal legislation, it should overcome partisan bickering.”

Rachel Kleinfeld and Joshua Kleinfeld, National Review

Under the ruling overturned by the Supreme Court, “absentee ballots were eligible to be counted regardless of when they were mailed in or otherwise delivered, as long as they came in by the April 13 deadline. In effect, that meant absentee ballots could be cast after in-person primary voting had closed on April 7...



""Obviously, this could mean the election would be materially altered by events occurring after formal conclusion of the primary election — not least, news about the apparent election result. To address this problem, Judge Conley further ordered the Wisconsin Election Commission and election inspectors to suppress any report of the voting results until after the new April 13 deadline… the district court’s resolution worked a significant change in election rules. This ran afoul of Supreme Court precedent.”
