Some Democrats are pushing for Obama to have a more elevated role, but Obama has made clear he is wary of sliding back into the role of party leader, which could prevent new leaders from emerging.

Democrats acknowledge that being stuck in the Obama era is a concern, but say the party can’t afford to have him on the sidelines.

“Democrats badly need Barack Obama,” said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist. “He offers such a vivid contrast to Trump in behavior and temperament.”

“He always sounded reasonable and acted responsibly even if you disagreed with him,” Bannon continued. “None of the potential Democratic presidential candidates have the visibility or credibility to be effective.”

Others complain Obama has been doing too little to help the party at a time when it is struggling to rebuild.

Brent Budowsky, a former Democratic aide and columnist for The Hill, said Obama “should play a far more aggressive role, starting today, to win back the House and Senate in 2018.”

“America faces an enormous political crisis and it is unconscionable how little Obama and other former top officials have done to help Democrats since Trump began his ugly abuses of power.”

“Under Obama's eight years, Democrats lost power at every level of national and state government, and Obama should feel an urgent sense of duty, especially on fundraising, and act with the fierce urgency of now and not generic promises about the future,” Budowsky added. “Obama should spend less time giving paid speeches and more time raising real money for Democrats.”

Obama is expected to campaign for Democrats beginning this fall, allies close to him said. But his reemergence will a “delicate dance,” as one aide told The Hill last week.

The former president has already been involved in fundraising efforts and has met with party leaders and held private meetings with lawmakers seeking advice.

Obama’s top aides will huddle with him in the next several weeks to plan his fall schedule. And while his allies say he will play an active role in assisting the Democratic Party, much of the work will be out of public view.

One reason for the behind-the-scenes role is to keep the president from becoming a ""foil"" to Trump and Republicans, allies say.

But hundreds of miles away as he jets up and down the West Coast , he played to one of his greatest remaining strengths : raising money .
Obama 's three-day fundraising tour to bolster Democratic Party committee coffers for the 2014 election cycle is perhaps the one sure-fire way the president can help his party at a time when the political atmosphere has turned dangerously toxic for any candidate with a `` D '' next to their name .
It is a critical obligation and one that Obama as a re-elected president is finally able to turn his full attention to now that he no longer needs to build a billion-dollar war chest for his own re-election .
`` It 's kind of better late than never , '' said Jim Manley , a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and a Democratic strategist with QGA Public Affairs . `` There are a whole bunch of Democrats on the Hill who wish he had done more in years past . ''
`` It gives the Democratic campaign committees the money they need to operate in what 's going to be a tough election cycle , especially in the Senate , '' he added .
The flawed rollout of the Affordable Care Act 's federal insurance marketplace and the flap over whether Obama wittingly misled the country about whether they could keep their insurance has made Democrats across the country anxious about whether Obama 's signature legislative achievement could ultimately fail .
A parade of vulnerable red state Democrats like Sen. Mary Landrieu , R-La. , and challengers , like Michelle Nunn who is running for Senate in Georgia , have proposed everything from delaying the individual mandate to a more aggressive fix that would allow Americans to keep their health insurance coverage indefinitely .
Meanwhile , Obama 's job approval and favorability ratings have taken a turn for the worse , according to a new ███/Washington Post poll last week . /a >
And those sentiments could trickle down to Democrats who are already expected to be saddled with dissatisfaction with the president 's policies .
`` History suggests that a president 's popularity has an influence on the fortunes of his party in off year elections , '' said Bill Galston a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton and chair of the Brookings Institute 's Governance Studies program . `` If the president is way down in the public 's esteem that 's going to create a big headwind for Democrats running for re-election . ''
But it is n't as if Obama is the first ( nor will he be the last ) president to be considered a bogey man even within his own party .
And poll numbers are notoriously fleeting . Weeks ago , the government shutdown seemed to have left Republicans down for the count , but today the GOP is invigorated by the health care law 's early troubles .
If Democrats can refocus the message away from the broken website and onto bread and butter economic issues , they can do well in 2014 , said a topDemocratic pollster Joel Benenson .
`` We have work to do . We 've got to keep our focus on restoring t he nation 's economic health . That 's got to the number one priority , '' Benenson said .
But Obama is also taking flak from Democratic activists who are frustrated with the fact that his agenda on other issues has essentially gone no-where .
Silicon Valley CEOs have dumped tens of thousands of their own money to boost Obama and independently lobby for immigration reform . Yet he 'll be shaking them down for money with just about nothing to show for it . The prospects of an immigration bill passing through the House of Representatives are slim .
`` The timing of this fundraising swing could n't have been worse for the president and his political team , '' Manley said . `` I assume they 're hearing from the liberal base about just about every issue under the sun right now -- whether it 's Obamacare , NSA spying or anything in between . ''
Though Democratic officials downplay the significance , tickets to one of Obama 's fundraisers today were deeply discounted the San Francisco Chronicle reported last week .
And at an event on immigration reform in San Francisco today , Obama was heckled by pro-immigration reform activists who pressured him to end the deportations , while Congress is stalled on reform .
Republicans are coming to view the implementation of the health care law as their greatest political boon , so they wo n't be eager to shift attention away from that an onto other issues like immigration reform or gun control .
Even news of a brokered deal on Iran 's nuclear program this weekend prompted Sen. John Cornyn to suggest that the president was seeking to distract from the health care law 's troubles .
`` Amazing what WH will do to distract attention from O-care , '' he tweeted late Saturday night .
It remains to be seen whether Obama 's numbers will rebound -- as they have in the past -- and whether 2014 will prompt a full-scale revolt among vulnerable or even potentially vulnerable Democrats running .
But in the meantime , at the top of the president 's agenda should be working overtime to extend a lifeline to his fellow Democrats , Galston said .
`` The president 's position now has to be that he will be inclined to do almost everything that the party asks him to do to get them out of a tough spot , which to some extent he 's responsible for putting them in , '' Galston said .","Back in Washington, D.C., things aren't going very well for President Obama.

Ellison was an early favorite for the DNC job , winning endorsements from Vermont Sen.

Maybe they ’ d be more understanding if they knew he ’ s still fighting a stutter .
His eyes fall to the floor when I ask him to describe it . We ’ ve been tiptoeing toward it for 45 minutes , and so far , every time he seems close , he backs away , or leads us in a new direction . There are competing theories in the press , but Joe Biden has kept mum on the subject . I want to hear him explain it . I ask him to walk me through the night he appeared to lose control of his words onstage . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . “ I—um—I don ’ t remember , ” Biden says . His voice has that familiar shake , the creak and the croak . “ I ’ d have to see it . I-I-I don ’ t remember. ” We ’ re in Biden ’ s mostly vacant Washington , D.C. , campaign office on an overcast Tuesday at the end of the summer . Since entering the Democratic presidential-primary race in April , Biden has largely avoided in-depth interviews . When I first reached out , in late June , his press person was polite but noncommittal : Was an interview really necessary for the story ?
Then came the second debate , at the end of July , in Detroit . The first one , a month earlier , had been a disaster for Biden . He was unprepared when Senator Kamala Harris criticized both his past resistance to federally mandated busing and a recent speech in which he ’ d waxed fondly about collaborating with segregationist senators . Some of his answers that night had been meander­ing and difficult to parse , feeding into the narrative that he wasn ’ t just prone to verbal slipups—he ’ s called himself a “ gaffe machine ” —but that his age was a problem , that he was confused and out of touch . Detroit was Biden ’ s chance to regain control of the narrative . And then something else happened . The candidates were talking about health care . At first , Biden sounded strong , confident , presidential : “ My plan makes a limit of co-pay to be One . Thousand . Dollars . Because we— ” He stopped . He pinched his eyes closed . He lifted his hands and thrust them forward , as if trying to pull the missing sound from his mouth . “ We f-f-f-f-further
support— ” He opened his eyes . “ The uh-uh-uh-uh— ” His chin dipped toward his chest . “ The-uh , the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan. ” Biden also stumbled when trying to say immune system . Fox News edited these moments into a mini montage . Stifling laughter , the host Steve Hilton narrated : “ As the right words struggled to make that perilous journey from Joe Biden ’ s brain to Joe Biden ’ s mouth , half the time he just seemed to give up with this somewhat tragic and limp admission of defeat . ”
Several days later , Biden ’ s team got back in touch with me . One of his aides gingerly asked whether I ’ d noticed the former vice president stutter during the debate . Of course I had—I stutter , far worse than Biden . The aide said he was ready to talk about it . Recently , after Biden stumbled multiple times during the Atlanta debate , the topic became even more relevant . “ So how are you , man ? ” Biden is in his usual white button-down and navy suit , a flag pin on the left lapel . Up close , he looks like he ’ s lost weight since leaving office in 2017 . His height is commanding , but , as he approaches his 77th birthday , he doesn ’ t fill out his suit jacket like he used to . I stutter as I begin to ask my first question . “ I ’ ve only … told a few people I ’ m … d-doing this piece . Every time I … describe it , I get … caught on the w-word-uh stuh-tuh-tuh-tutter. ” “ So did I , ” Biden replies . “ It doesn ’ t ” —he interrupts himself— “ can ’ t define who you are . ”
Maybe you ’ ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter . A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult , because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly . But on other occasions , like that night in Detroit , Biden ’ s lingering stutter is hard to miss . He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office . Before addressing the debate specifically , I mention what I ’ ve just heard . “ I want to ask you , as , you know , a … stutterer to , uh , to a … stutterer . When you were … talking a couple minutes ago , it , it seemed to … my ear , my eye … did you have … trouble on s ? Or on … m ? ”
Biden looks down . He pivots to the distant past , telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid . “ But , you know , I haven ’ t stuttered in so long that it ’ s
hhhhard for me to remember the specific— ” He pauses . “ What I do remember is the feeling. ” I started stuttering at age 4 . I still struggle to say my own name . When I called the gas company recently , the automated voice apologized for not being able to understand me . This happens a lot , so I try to say “ representative , ” but r ’ s are tough too . When I reach a human , I ’ m inevitably asked whether we have a poor connection . Busy bartenders will walk away and serve someone else when I take too long to say the name of a beer . Almost every deli guy chuckles as I fail to enunciate my order , despite the fact that I ’ ve cut it down to just six words : “ Turkey club , white toast , easy mayo. ” I used to just point at items on the menu . My head will shake on a really bad stutter . People have casually asked whether I have Parkinson ’ s . I curl my toes inside my shoes or tap my foot as a distraction to help me get out of it , a behavior that I ’ ve repeated so often , it ’ s become a tic . Sometimes I shuffle a pen between my hands . When I was little , I used to press my palm against my forehead in an effort to force the missing word out of my brain . Back then , my older brother would imitate this motion and the accompanying sound , a dull whine—something between a cow and a sheep . A kid at baseball camp , Michael , referred to me as “ Stutter Boy. ” He ’ d snap his fingers and repeat it as if calling a dog . “ Stutter Boy ! Stutter Boy ! ” In college , I applied for a job at a coffee shop . I stuttered horribly through the interview , and the owner told me he couldn ’ t hire me , because he wanted his café to be “ a place where customers feel comfortable . ”
Stuttering is a neurological disorder that affects roughly 70 million people , about 3 million of whom live in the United States . It has a strong genetic component : Two-thirds of stutterers have a family member who actively stutters or used to . Biden ’ s uncle on his mother ’ s side— “ Uncle Boo-Boo , ” as he was called—stuttered his whole life . In the most basic sense , a stutter is a repetition , prolongation , or block in producing a sound . It typically presents between the ages of 2 and 4 , in up to twice as many boys as girls , who also have a higher recovery rate . During the develop­mental years , some children ’ s stutter will disappear completely without intervention or with speech therapy . The longer someone stutters , however , the lower the chances of a full recovery—­perhaps due to the decreasing plasticity of the brain . Research suggests that no more than a quarter of people who still stutter at 10 will completely rid themselves of the affliction as adults . “ Mr . Buh-Buh-Buh-Biden , what ’ s that word ? , ” a nun asked Joe Biden in front of his seventh-grade classmates . The cultural perception of stutterers is that they ’ re fearful , anxious people , or simply dumb , and that stuttering is the result . But it doesn ’ t work like that . Let ’ s say you ’ re in fourth grade and you have to stand up and recite state capitals . You know that Juneau is the capital of Alaska , but you also know that you almost always block on the j sound . You become intensely anxious not because you don ’ t know the answer , but because you do know the answer , and you know you ’ re going to stutter on it .
Stuttering can feel like a series of betrayals . Your body betrays you when it refuses to work in concert with your brain to produce smooth speech . Your brain betrays you when it fails to recall the solutions you practiced after school with a speech therapist , allegedly in private , later learning that your mom was on the other side of a mirror , watching in the dark like a detective . If you ’ re a lucky stutterer , you have friends and family who build you back up , but sometimes your protectors betray you too . A Catholic nun betrayed Biden when he was in seventh grade . “ I think I was No . 5 in alphabetical order , ” Biden says . He points over my right shoulder and stares into the middle distance as the movie rolls in his mind . “ We ’ d sit along the radiators by the window. ” The office we ’ re in is awash in framed memories : Biden and his family , Biden and Barack Obama , Biden in a denim shirt posing for InStyle . The shelf behind the desk features , among other books , Jon Meacham ’ s The Soul of America . It ’ s a phrase Biden has adopted for his campaign this time around , his third attempt at the presidency . In almost every speech , Biden warns potential voters that 2020 is not merely an election , but a battle “ for the soul of America. ” Sometimes he swaps in nation .
Joe Biden : ‘ We are living through a battle for the soul of this nation ’ But now we ’ re back in middle school . The students are taking turns reading a book , one by one , up and down the rows . “ I could count down how many paragraphs , and I ’ d memorize it , because I found it easier to memorize than look at the page and read the word . I ’ d pretend to be reading , ” Biden says . “ You learned early on who the hell the bullies were , ” he tells me later . “ You could tell by the look , couldn ’ t you ? ” For most stutterers , reading out loud summons peak dread . A chunk of text that may take a fluent person roughly a minute to read could take a stutterer five or 10 times as long . Four kids away , three kids away . Your shoulders tighten . Two away . The back of your neck catches fire . One away . Then it happens , and the room fills with secondhand embarrassment . Someone breathes a heavy sigh . Someone else laughs . At least one kid mimics your stutter while you ’ re actively stuttering . You never talk about it . At night , you stare at the ceiling above your bed , reliving it . “ The paragraph I had to read was : ‘ Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentleman . He laid his cloak upon the muddy road suh-suh-so the lady wouldn ’ t soil her shoes when she entered the carriage , ’ ” Biden tells me , slightly and unintentionally tripping up on the word so . “ And I said , ‘ Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentle man who— ’ and then the nun said , ‘ Mr . Biden , what is that word ? ’ And it was gentleman that she wanted me to say , not gentle man . And she said , ‘ Mr . Buh-Buh-Buh-Biden , what ’ s that word ? ’ ”
Biden says he rose from his desk and left the classroom in protest , then walked home . The family story is that his mother , Jean , drove him back to school and confronted the nun with the made-for-TV phrase “ You do that again , I ’ ll knock your bonnet off your head ! ” I ask Biden what went through his mind as the nun mocked him . “ Anger , rage , humiliation , ” he says . His speech becomes staccato . “ A feeling of , uh—like I ’ m sure you ’ ve experienced—it just drops out of your chest , just , like , you feel … a void. ” He lifts his hands up to his face like he did on the debate stage in July , to guide the v sound out of his mouth : void . By all accounts , Biden was both popular and a strong athlete in high school . He was class president at Archmere Academy , in Claymont , Delaware . His nickname was “ Dash ” —not a reference to his speed on the football field , but rather another way to mock his stutter . “ It was like Morse code—dot dot dot , dash dash dash dash , ” Biden says . “ Even though by that time I started to overcome it. ” I ask him to expand on the relationship between anger and humiliation , or shame . “ Shame is a big piece of it , ” he says , then segues into a story about meeting a stutterer while campaigning . I bring it back up a little later , this time more directly : “ When have you felt shame ? ” “ Not for a long , long , long time . But especially when I was in grade school and high school . Because that ’ s the time when everything is , you know , it ’ s rough . They talk about ‘ mean girls ’ ? There ’ s mean boys , too . ”
Bill Bowden had the locker next to Biden ’ s at Archmere . I called Bowden recently . “ It was just kind of a funny thing , you know ? ” he told me . “ Hopefully he wasn ’ t hurt by it. ” Bob Markel , another high-school buddy of Biden ’ s , went a little further when we spoke : “ ‘ H-H-H-H-Hey , J-J-J-J-J-Joe B-B-B-B-Biden ’ —that ’ s how he ’ d be addressed. ” Markel said the Archmere guys called him “ Stutterhead , ” or “ Hey , Stut ! ” for short . He fears that he himself may have made fun of Biden once or twice . “ I never remember him being offended . He probably was , ” Markel said . “ I think one of his coping mechanisms was to not show it. ” Bowden and Markel have remained friends with Biden to this day . Before collecting from customers on his paper route , Biden would preplay conversations in his mind , banking lines—a tactic he still sometimes uses on the campaign trail , he says . “ I knew the one guy loved the Phillies . And he ’ d asked me about them all the time . And I knew another person would ask me about my sister , so I would practice an answer. ” After trying and failing at speech therapy in kinder­garten , Biden waged a personal war on his stutter in his bedroom as a young teen . He ’ d hold a flashlight to his face in front of his bedroom mirror and recite Yeats and Emerson with attention to rhythm , searching for that elusive control . He still knows the lines by heart : “ Meek young men grow up in libraries , believing it their duty to accept the views , which Cicero , which Locke , which Bacon , have given , forgetful that Cicero , Locke , and Bacon were only young men in libraries , when they wrote these books . ”
Biden performs the passage for me with total fluency , knowing where and when to pause , knowing how many words he can say before needing a breath . This is what stutterers learn to do : reclaim control of their airflow ; think in full phrases , not individual words . I ask Biden what his moment of dread used to be in that essay . “ Well , looking back on it , ‘ Meek young men grow up in li-li-libraries , ’ ” he begins again . “ ‘ Li ’ —the l. ” “ That kind of sound , the l sound , is like the … r sound , ” I say . “ Yes. ” “ Sometimes I ’ ve noticed , watching old clips , it looks like you do have a little trouble on the r. It ’ s your middle initial. ” “ Yeah. ” “ Like ‘ ruh-ruh-ruh-remember , ’ ” I say , intentionally stuttering on the r. “ Well , I may . I-I-I-I-I haven ’ t thought I have . But I-I-I-I don ’ t doubt there ’ s probably ways people could pick up that there ’ s something . But I don ’ t consciously think of it anymore. ” Biden says he hasn ’ t felt himself caught in a traditional stutter in several decades . “ I mean , I can ’ t remember a time where I ’ ve ever worried before a crowd of 80,000 people or 800 people or 80 people—I haven ’ t had that feeling of dread since , I guess , speech class in college , ” he says , referring to an under­graduate public-speaking course at the University of Delaware . This is when I ask him what happened that night in Detroit . After saying he doesn ’ t remember , Biden opines : “ I ’ m everybody ’ s target ; they have to take me down . And so , what I found is—not anymore—I ’ ve found that it ’ s difficult to deal with some of the criticism , based on the nature of the person directing the criticism . It ’ s awful hard to be , to respond the same way in a national debate—especially when you ’ re , you know , the guy who is characterized as the white-guy-of-­privilege kind of thing—to turn and say to someone who says , ‘ I ’ m not saying you ’ re a racist , but … ’ and know you ’ re being set up . So I have to admit to you , I found my mind going , What the hell ? How do I respond to that ? Because I know she ’ s being completely unfair . ”
I eventually realize that he ’ s describing the moment from the first debate , when Harris criticized his record on race . “ These aren ’ t debates , ” he continues . “ These are one-minute assertions . And I don ’ t think there ’ s anybody who hasn ’ t been taking shots at me , which is okay . I ’ m a big boy , don ’ t get me wrong. ” Listening back to that part of the conversation after our interview made me feel dizzy . I can only speculate as to why Biden ’ s campaign agreed to this interview , but I assume the reasoning went something like this : If Biden disclosed to me , a person who stutters , that he himself still actively stutters , perhaps voters would cut him some slack when it comes to verbal misfires , as well as errors that seem more related to memory and cognition . But whenever I asked Biden about what appeared to be his present-day stuttering , the notably verbose candidate became clipped , or said he didn ’ t remember , or spun off to somewhere new . I wondered if I reminded Biden of his old self , a ghost from his youth , the stutterer he used to be . He and I are about the same height . We happened to be wearing the exact same outfit that day : navy suit , white shirt , no tie . We both went to all-male prep schools , the sort of place where displaying any weakness is a liability . As I listened to the recording of our interview , I remembered how I used to respond when people asked me about my stutter . I ’ d shut down . I ’ d try to change the subject . I ’ d almost always look away .
In early September , I got in touch with my high-school speech pathologist , Joseph Donaher , who practices at the Children ’ s Hospital of Philadelphia . I hadn ’ t heard Donaher ’ s voice for almost 15 years . Immediately , I was transported back to the little window­less room in the hospital where we used to meet . Donaher was the first therapist—­really the first person—­who ever leveled with me . I can still see his face , the neutrality in his eyes on the day he looked at me square and said the sentence my friends and parents had avoided saying my entire life : You have a severe stutter . Donaher and his colleagues try to help their patients open up about the shame and low self-worth that accompany stuttering . Instead of focusing solely on mechanics , or on the ability to communicate , they first build up the desire to communicate at all . They then share techniques such as elongating vowels and lightly approaching hard-consonant clusters , meaning just touching on the first sound in a word like stutter—the st—to keep the mouth and throat from tensing up and interfering with speech . The goal isn ’ t to be totally fluent but , simply put , to stutter better . This evolution in treatment has been accompanied by a new movement to destigmatize the disorder , similar to the drive to view autism through a lens of “ neuro­diversity ” rather than as a pathology . The idea is to accept , even embrace , one ’ s stutter . There are practical reasons for this : Research shows , according to Donaher , that the simple disclosure “ I stutter ” benefits both the stutterer and the listener—the former gets to explain what ’ s happening and ease the awkward tension so the latter isn ’ t stuck wondering what ’ s “ wrong ” with this person . Saying those two words is harder than it seems . “ I ’ m working with people who spend their whole lives and are never able to disclose it , ” Donaher told me . Biden says his father taught him about “ shouldering burdens with grace. ” Specifically , he told his son , “ Never complain . Never explain. ” Eric S. Jackson , an assistant professor of communicative sciences and dis­orders at NYU , told me he believes that Biden ’ s eye movements—the blinks , the downward glances—are part of his ongoing efforts to manage his stutter . “ As kids we figure out : Oh , if I move parts of my body not associated with the speech system , sometimes it helps me get through these blocks faster , ” Jackson , a stutterer himself , explained . Jackson credits an intensive program at the American Institute for Stuttering , in Manhattan , with bringing him back from a “ rock bottom ” period in his mid-20s , when he says his stutter kept him from meeting women or speaking up enough to reach his professional goals . Afterward , Jackson went all in on disclosure : Every day for six months , he stood up during the subway ride to and from work and announced that he was a person who stutters . “ I had this new relationship with my stuttering—I was like Hercules , ” he told me . At 41 , Jackson still stutters , but in conversation he confidently maintains eye contact and appears relaxed . He wishes Biden would be more transparent about his intermittent disfluency . “ Running for president is essentially the biggest stage in the world . For him to come out and say ‘ I still stutter and it ’ s fine ’ would be an amazing , empowering message . ”
Occasionally , Biden has used present-tense verbs when discussing his stutter . “ I find myself , when I ’ m tired , cuh-cuh-­catching myself , like that , ” he said during a 2016 American Institute for Stuttering speech . Biden has used the phrase we stutterers at times , but in most public appearances and interviews , Biden talks about how he overcame his speech problem , and how he believes others can too . You can watch videos posted by his campaign in which Biden meets young stutterers and encourages them to follow his lead . They ’ re sweet clips , even if the underlying message—­beat it or bust—is out of sync with the normalization movement . Emma Alpern is a 32-year-old copy editor who co-leads the Brooklyn chapter of the National Stuttering Association and co-founded NYC Stutters , which puts on a day-long conference for stuttering de­stigmatization . Alpern told me that she ’ s on a group text with other stutterers who regularly discuss Biden , and that it ’ s been “ frustrating ” to watch the media portray Biden ’ s speech impediment as a sign of mental decline or dishonesty . “ Biden allows that to happen by not naming it for what it is , ” she said , though she ’ s not sure that his presidential candidacy would benefit if he were more forthcoming . “ I think he ’ s dug himself into a hole of not saying that he still stutters for so long that it would strike people as a little weird. ” Biden has presented the same life story for decades . He ’ s that familiar face—Uncle Joe . He was born 11 months after Pearl Harbor and grew up in the last era of definitive “ good guys ” and “ bad guys. ” He ’ s the dependable guy , the tenacious guy , the aviators-and-crossed-arms guy . That guy doesn ’ t stutter ; that guy used to stutter .
“ My dad taught me the value of constancy , effort , and work , and he taught me about shouldering burdens with grace , ” Biden writes in the first chapter of his 2007 memoir , Promises to Keep . “ He used to quote Benjamin Disraeli : ‘ Never complain . Never explain. ’ ” Stephen Colbert launches across the Ed Sullivan Theater stage , as if from a pinball spring . It ’ s early September , and his Late Show taping is about to begin . To warm up , he takes a few questions from the studio audience . Someone asks what he ’ d want in a potential new president . “ Empathy ? ” Colbert deadpans . “ A soul ? ” Colbert tapes in Midtown Manhattan on the same stage where the Beatles made their American television debut 55 years ago , when Joe Biden was a mere 22 . Biden struts out to a standing ovation and throws up his hands in amazement : For me ? A brief “ Joe ! Joe ! Joe ! ” chant erupts . At first , Colbert lobs softballs , and Biden touches on the key parts of his 2020 stump speech : Why voters must stand up to the existential threat of Trumpism and how the Charlottesville , Virginia , white-supremacist rally crystallized his decision to run . Then Colbert goes for it . “ In the last few weeks , you ’ ve confused New Hampshire for Vermont ; said
Bobby Kennedy and MLK were assassinated in the late ’ 70s ; assured us , ‘ I am not going nuts. ’ Follow-up question : Are you going nuts ? ”
“ Look , the reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show was because— ” The audience howls . Biden flashes a flirty smile . Colbert adjusts his glasses , sticks his pen in his mouth , and nods in approval . The joke was probably canned , but Biden landed it . Colbert continues to press him about accuracy issues in his storytelling . The studio audience is silent ; I ’ m watching from the balcony and can hear the theater ’ s air-conditioning humming overhead . “ I-I-I-I-I don ’ t get wrong things like , uh , ya know , there is a , we , we should lock kids up in cages at the border . I mean , I don ’ t— ” People applaud before Biden can finish . When the interview is over , Biden receives a second standing ovation . He peers up toward the rafters , using his hand as a visor against the bright lights . A white spotlight follows him offstage . Several minutes later , he glides through the stage door and out onto West 53rd Street . People call to him from the sidewalk . “ Joe ! Joe Biden ! ” He climbs into the back of an idling black SUV , and the doors
clunk close . Read : Tyranny of the 70-Somethings I follow Biden for a couple of days while he campaigns in New Hampshire . His town halls have a distinctly Norman Rockwell vibe . One takes place in the middle of the day on the third floor of a former textile mill , another on a stretch of grass as the wind whips off the Piscataqua River . His crowds are predominantly older , filled with people who stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and wait patiently to ask questions . After he speaks , Biden typically walks offstage to Bruce Springsteen ’ s “ We Take Care of Our Own , ” then saunters down the rope line for handshakes and hugs and selfies . One voter after another tells me they ’ re unaware of Biden ’ s stutter . “ Knowing that he has had something like that to deal with and overcame it , as well as other really sad things that have happened—­­it just makes me like him more , ” says 70-year-old Grace Payne .
Back in New York , I start to wonder if I ’ m forcing Biden into a box where he doesn ’ t belong . My box . Could I be jealous that his present stutter is less obvious than mine ? That he can go sentences at a time without a single block or repetition ? Even the way I ’ m writing this piece—­keeping Biden ’ s stammers , his ums and pauses , on the page—seems hypocritical . Here I am highlighting the glitches in his speech , when the journalistic courtesy , convention even , is to edit them out . I spend weeks watching Biden more than listening to him , trying to “ catch him in the act ” of stuttering on camera . There ’ s one . There ’ s one . That was a bad one . Also , I start stuttering more . In September , before the third Democratic debate , in Houston , I called Michael Sheehan , a Washington , D.C.–area communications coach whose company website boasts clients ranging from Nike to the Treasury Department . Sheehan worked with President Bill Clinton while he was in office and began consulting on and off for Biden in 2002 , when he was in the Senate . On the day we spoke , he was in Wilmington , Delaware , doing debate prep with Biden . Sheehan and I traded stories of daily indignities—­­he stutters too . “ I remember exactly where the deli was ; it was on 71st and First Avenue , ” he said with an ache in his voice . He lamented the interventionists , the people who volunteer , “ ‘ You know , why don ’ t you speak more slowly ? ’ I always want to say ‘ Holy shit ! Why didn ’ t I think of that ? Thank you ! ’ ”
Sheehan ’ s own stutter improved , but didn ’ t fully go away , when he took up speech and debate in high school . This eventually led him to the theater , which is a common , if surprising , place where some stutterers find that they ’ re able to speak with relative ease . Taking on a character , another voice , the theory goes , relies on a different neural pathway from the one used in conversation . Many successful actors have battled stutters—Samuel L. Jackson , Bruce Willis , Emily Blunt , James Earl Jones . In 2014 , Jones , whose muscular baritone is the bedrock of one of the most quoted lines in film history , told NPR that he doesn ’ t use the word cured to describe his apparent fluency . “ I just work with it , ” he said . At an August town hall , Biden briefly blocked on Obama , before subbing in my boss . The headlines afterward ? “ Biden Forgets Obama ’ s Name. ” Sheehan was extremely careful with the language he used to describe Biden ’ s speech patterns— “ I can ’ t say it ’ s a stutter ” —­though he noted his friend ’ s habit of abruptly changing directions mid-sentence . “ I do hear those little pauses , but I really don ’ t hear the stuff that you would hear from me or I would hear from you , ” he said . A few minutes into our conversation , he choked up while discussing Biden ’ s tender­ness toward young stutterers . “ Sometimes I feel when he goes a little long on a speech , he ’ s just making up for lost time , you know ? ” Sheehan told me about a night when he came home with his wife and saw the answering-­machine light blinking : “ Hey , Michael , it ’ s Joe Biden . I just was watching The King ’ s Speech with my granddaughter , and I just thought I ’ d give you a call , because it made me think of you . Goodbye ! ” He says the message felt like a secret fraternity handshake : “ You and I have both been there , and only people in that society know what that is about . ”
In Biden ’ s office , the first time I bring up his current stuttering , he asks me whether I ’ ve seen The King ’ s Speech . He speaks almost mystically about the award-winning 2010 film . “ When King George VI , when he stood up in 1939 , everyone knew he stuttered , and they knew what courage it took for him to stand up at that stadium and try to speak—and it gave them courage … I could feel that . It was that sinking feeling , like—oh my God , I remember how you felt . You feel like , I don ’ t know … almost like you ’ re being sucked into a black hole. ” Presidential candidates usually don ’ t speak about their bleakest moments , certainly not this viscerally . It resembles the way Biden writes in his memoir about the aftermath of the 1972 car accident that killed his first wife and young daughter and critically injured his two sons , Beau and Hunter : “ I could not speak , only felt this hollow core grow in my chest , like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole. ” Related Stories Joe Biden Is Schrödinger ’ s Candidate
The President ’ s Cognitive Decline A few weeks later , I ask Jill Biden what she remembers about sitting next to her husband during the movie . “ It was one of those moments in a marriage where you just sort of understand without words being spoken , ” she says . As he watched The King ’ s Speech , Biden accurately guessed that the screenwriter , David Seidler , was a stutterer . “ He showed me a copy of a speech they found in an attic that the king had actually used , where he marks his—it ’ s exactly what I do ! ” Biden tells me , his voice lifting . “ My staff , when I have them put something on a prompter—I wish I had something to show you . ”
He pulls out a legal pad and begins drawing diagonal lines a few inches apart , as if diagramming invisible sentences : x words , breath , y words , breath . “ Because it ’ s just the way I have—the , the best way for me to read a , um , a speech . I mean , when I saw The King ’ s Speech , and the speech—I didn ’ t know anybody who did that ! ” Biden is running for president on a simple message : America is not Trump . I ’ m not Trump . I ’ ll lead us out of this . With every new debate , with every new “ gaffe , ” the media continue to ask whether Biden has the stamina for the job . And with every passing month , his competitors—namely Senator Elizabeth Warren and South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg—have gained on him in the polls . A stutter does not get worse as a person ages , but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy . Biden talks all day to audiences both small and large . In addition to periodically stuttering or blocking on certain sounds , he appears to intentionally not stutter by switching to an alternative word—a technique called “ circumlocution ” —­which can yield mangled syntax . I ’ ve been following practically everything he ’ s said for months now , and sometimes what is quickly characterized as a memory lapse is indeed a stutter . As Eric Jackson , the speech pathologist , pointed out to me , during a town hall in August Biden briefly blocked on Obama , before quickly subbing in my boss . The headlines after the event ? “ Biden Forgets Obama ’ s Name. ” Other times when Biden fudges a detail or loses his train of thought , it seems unrelated to stuttering , like he ’ s just making a mistake . The kind of mistake other candidates make too , though less frequently than he does .
During his 2016 address at the American Institute for Stuttering , Biden told the room that he ’ d turned down an invitation to speak at a dinner organized by the group years earlier . “ I was afraid if people knew I stuttered , ” he said , “ they would have thought something was wrong with me. ” Yet even when sharing these old , hard stories , Biden regularly characterizes stuttering as “ the best thing that ever happened ” to him . “ Stuttering gave me an insight I don ’ t think I ever would have had into other people ’ s pain , ” he says . I admire his empathy , even if I disagree with his strict adherence to a tidy redemption narrative . In Biden ’ s office , as my time is about to run out , I bring up the fact that Trump crudely mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the 2016 campaign . “ So far , he ’ s called you ‘ Sleepy Joe. ’ Is ‘ St-St-St-Stuttering Joe ’ next ? ” “ I don ’ t think so , ” Biden says , “ because if you ask the polls ‘ Does Biden stutter ? Has he ever stuttered ? , ’ you ’ d have 80 to 95 percent of people say no. ” If Trump goes there , Biden adds , “ it ’ ll just expose him for what he is. ” I ask Biden something else we ’ ve been circling : whether he worries that people would pity him if they thought he still stuttered . He scratches his chin , his fingers trembling slightly . “ Well , I guess , um , it ’ s kind of hard to pity a vice president . It ’ s kind of hard to pity a senator who ’ s gotten six zillion awards . It ’ s kind of hard to pity someone who has had , you know , a decent family . I-I-I-I don ’ t think if , now , if someone sits and says , ‘ Well , you know , the kid , when he was a stutterer , he must have been really basically stupid , ’ I-I-I don ’ t think it ’ s hard to—I ’ ve never thought of that . I mean , there ’ s nobody in the last , I don ’ t know , 55 years , has ever said anything like that to me . ”","His verbal stumbles have voters worried about his mental fitness. Maybe they’d be more understanding if they knew he’s still fighting a stutter.

His eyes fall to the floor when I ask him to describe it. We’ve been tiptoeing toward it for 45 minutes, and so far, every time he seems close, he backs away, or leads us in a new direction. There are competing theories in the press, but Joe Biden has kept mum on the subject. I want to hear him explain it. I ask him to walk me through the night he appeared to lose control of his words onstage. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. “I—um—I don’t remember,” Biden says. His voice has that familiar shake, the creak and the croak. “I’d have to see it. I-I-I don’t remember.” We’re in Biden’s mostly vacant Washington, D.C., campaign office on an overcast Tuesday at the end of the summer. Since entering the Democratic presidential-primary race in April, Biden has largely avoided in-depth interviews. When I first reached out, in late June, his press person was polite but noncommittal: Was an interview really necessary for the story?

Then came the second debate, at the end of July, in Detroit. The first one, a month earlier, had been a disaster for Biden. He was unprepared when Senator Kamala Harris criticized both his past resistance to federally mandated busing and a recent speech in which he’d waxed fondly about collaborating with segregationist senators. Some of his answers that night had been meander­ing and difficult to parse, feeding into the narrative that he wasn’t just prone to verbal slipups—he’s called himself a “gaffe machine”—but that his age was a problem, that he was confused and out of touch. Detroit was Biden’s chance to regain control of the narrative. And then something else happened. The candidates were talking about health care. At first, Biden sounded strong, confident, presidential: “My plan makes a limit of co-pay to be One. Thousand. Dollars. Because we—” He stopped. He pinched his eyes closed. He lifted his hands and thrust them forward, as if trying to pull the missing sound from his mouth. “We f-f-f-f-further

support—” He opened his eyes. “The uh-uh-uh-uh—” His chin dipped toward his chest. “The-uh, the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan.” Biden also stumbled when trying to say immune system. Fox News edited these moments into a mini montage. Stifling laughter, the host Steve Hilton narrated: “As the right words struggled to make that perilous journey from Joe Biden’s brain to Joe Biden’s mouth, half the time he just seemed to give up with this somewhat tragic and limp admission of defeat.”

Several days later, Biden’s team got back in touch with me. One of his aides gingerly asked whether I’d noticed the former vice president stutter during the debate. Of course I had—I stutter, far worse than Biden. The aide said he was ready to talk about it. Recently, after Biden stumbled multiple times during the Atlanta debate, the topic became even more relevant. “So how are you, man?” Biden is in his usual white button-down and navy suit, a flag pin on the left lapel. Up close, he looks like he’s lost weight since leaving office in 2017. His height is commanding, but, as he approaches his 77th birthday, he doesn’t fill out his suit jacket like he used to. I stutter as I begin to ask my first question. “I’ve only … told a few people I’m … d-doing this piece. Every time I … describe it, I get … caught on the w-word-uh stuh-tuh-tuh-tutter.” “So did I,” Biden replies. “It doesn’t”—he interrupts himself—“can’t define who you are.”

Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. Before addressing the debate specifically, I mention what I’ve just heard. “I want to ask you, as, you know, a … stutterer to, uh, to a … stutterer. When you were … talking a couple minutes ago, it, it seemed to … my ear, my eye … did you have … trouble on s? Or on … m?”

Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. “But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s

hhhhard for me to remember the specific—” He pauses. “What I do remember is the feeling.” I started stuttering at age 4. I still struggle to say my own name. When I called the gas company recently, the automated voice apologized for not being able to understand me. This happens a lot, so I try to say “representative,” but r’s are tough too. When I reach a human, I’m inevitably asked whether we have a poor connection. Busy bartenders will walk away and serve someone else when I take too long to say the name of a beer. Almost every deli guy chuckles as I fail to enunciate my order, despite the fact that I’ve cut it down to just six words: “Turkey club, white toast, easy mayo.” I used to just point at items on the menu. My head will shake on a really bad stutter. People have casually asked whether I have Parkinson’s. I curl my toes inside my shoes or tap my foot as a distraction to help me get out of it, a behavior that I’ve repeated so often, it’s become a tic. Sometimes I shuffle a pen between my hands. When I was little, I used to press my palm against my forehead in an effort to force the missing word out of my brain. Back then, my older brother would imitate this motion and the accompanying sound, a dull whine—something between a cow and a sheep. A kid at baseball camp, Michael, referred to me as “Stutter Boy.” He’d snap his fingers and repeat it as if calling a dog. “Stutter Boy! Stutter Boy!” In college, I applied for a job at a coffee shop. I stuttered horribly through the interview, and the owner told me he couldn’t hire me, because he wanted his café to be “a place where customers feel comfortable.”

Stuttering is a neurological disorder that affects roughly 70 million people, about 3 million of whom live in the United States. It has a strong genetic component: Two-thirds of stutterers have a family member who actively stutters or used to. Biden’s uncle on his mother’s side—“Uncle Boo-Boo,” as he was called—stuttered his whole life. In the most basic sense, a stutter is a repetition, prolongation, or block in producing a sound. It typically presents between the ages of 2 and 4, in up to twice as many boys as girls, who also have a higher recovery rate. During the develop­mental years, some children’s stutter will disappear completely without intervention or with speech therapy. The longer someone stutters, however, the lower the chances of a full recovery—­perhaps due to the decreasing plasticity of the brain. Research suggests that no more than a quarter of people who still stutter at 10 will completely rid themselves of the affliction as adults. “Mr. Buh-Buh-Buh-Biden, what’s that word?,” a nun asked Joe Biden in front of his seventh-grade classmates. The cultural perception of stutterers is that they’re fearful, anxious people, or simply dumb, and that stuttering is the result. But it doesn’t work like that. Let’s say you’re in fourth grade and you have to stand up and recite state capitals. You know that Juneau is the capital of Alaska, but you also know that you almost always block on the j sound. You become intensely anxious not because you don’t know the answer, but because you do know the answer, and you know you’re going to stutter on it.

Stuttering can feel like a series of betrayals. Your body betrays you when it refuses to work in concert with your brain to produce smooth speech. Your brain betrays you when it fails to recall the solutions you practiced after school with a speech therapist, allegedly in private, later learning that your mom was on the other side of a mirror, watching in the dark like a detective. If you’re a lucky stutterer, you have friends and family who build you back up, but sometimes your protectors betray you too. A Catholic nun betrayed Biden when he was in seventh grade. “I think I was No. 5 in alphabetical order,” Biden says. He points over my right shoulder and stares into the middle distance as the movie rolls in his mind. “We’d sit along the radiators by the window.” The office we’re in is awash in framed memories: Biden and his family, Biden and Barack Obama, Biden in a denim shirt posing for InStyle. The shelf behind the desk features, among other books, Jon Meacham’s The Soul of America. It’s a phrase Biden has adopted for his campaign this time around, his third attempt at the presidency. In almost every speech, Biden warns potential voters that 2020 is not merely an election, but a battle “for the soul of America.” Sometimes he swaps in nation.

Joe Biden: ‘We are living through a battle for the soul of this nation’ But now we’re back in middle school. The students are taking turns reading a book, one by one, up and down the rows. “I could count down how many paragraphs, and I’d memorize it, because I found it easier to memorize than look at the page and read the word. I’d pretend to be reading,” Biden says. “You learned early on who the hell the bullies were,” he tells me later. “You could tell by the look, couldn’t you?” For most stutterers, reading out loud summons peak dread. A chunk of text that may take a fluent person roughly a minute to read could take a stutterer five or 10 times as long. Four kids away, three kids away. Your shoulders tighten. Two away. The back of your neck catches fire. One away. Then it happens, and the room fills with secondhand embarrassment. Someone breathes a heavy sigh. Someone else laughs. At least one kid mimics your stutter while you’re actively stuttering. You never talk about it. At night, you stare at the ceiling above your bed, reliving it. “The paragraph I had to read was: ‘Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentleman. He laid his cloak upon the muddy road suh-suh-so the lady wouldn’t soil her shoes when she entered the carriage,’ ” Biden tells me, slightly and unintentionally tripping up on the word so. “And I said, ‘Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentle man who—’ and then the nun said, ‘Mr. Biden, what is that word?’ And it was gentleman that she wanted me to say, not gentle man. And she said, ‘Mr. Buh-Buh-Buh-Biden, what’s that word?’ ”

Biden says he rose from his desk and left the classroom in protest, then walked home. The family story is that his mother, Jean, drove him back to school and confronted the nun with the made-for-TV phrase “You do that again, I’ll knock your bonnet off your head!” I ask Biden what went through his mind as the nun mocked him. “Anger, rage, humiliation,” he says. His speech becomes staccato. “A feeling of, uh—like I’m sure you’ve experienced—it just drops out of your chest, just, like, you feel … a void.” He lifts his hands up to his face like he did on the debate stage in July, to guide the v sound out of his mouth: void. By all accounts, Biden was both popular and a strong athlete in high school. He was class president at Archmere Academy, in Claymont, Delaware. His nickname was “Dash”—not a reference to his speed on the football field, but rather another way to mock his stutter. “It was like Morse code—dot dot dot, dash dash dash dash,” Biden says. “Even though by that time I started to overcome it.” I ask him to expand on the relationship between anger and humiliation, or shame. “Shame is a big piece of it,” he says, then segues into a story about meeting a stutterer while campaigning. I bring it back up a little later, this time more directly: “When have you felt shame?” “Not for a long, long, long time. But especially when I was in grade school and high school. Because that’s the time when everything is, you know, it’s rough. They talk about ‘mean girls’? There’s mean boys, too.”

Bill Bowden had the locker next to Biden’s at Archmere. I called Bowden recently. “It was just kind of a funny thing, you know?” he told me. “Hopefully he wasn’t hurt by it.” Bob Markel, another high-school buddy of Biden’s, went a little further when we spoke: “ ‘H-H-H-H-Hey, J-J-J-J-J-Joe B-B-B-B-Biden’—that’s how he’d be addressed.” Markel said the Archmere guys called him “Stutterhead,” or “Hey, Stut !” for short. He fears that he himself may have made fun of Biden once or twice. “I never remember him being offended. He probably was,” Markel said. “I think one of his coping mechanisms was to not show it.” Bowden and Markel have remained friends with Biden to this day. Before collecting from customers on his paper route, Biden would preplay conversations in his mind, banking lines—a tactic he still sometimes uses on the campaign trail, he says. “I knew the one guy loved the Phillies. And he’d asked me about them all the time. And I knew another person would ask me about my sister, so I would practice an answer.” After trying and failing at speech therapy in kinder­garten, Biden waged a personal war on his stutter in his bedroom as a young teen. He’d hold a flashlight to his face in front of his bedroom mirror and recite Yeats and Emerson with attention to rhythm, searching for that elusive control. He still knows the lines by heart: “Meek young men grow up in libraries, believing it their duty to accept the views, which Cicero, which Locke, which Bacon, have given, forgetful that Cicero, Locke, and Bacon were only young men in libraries, when they wrote these books.”

Biden performs the passage for me with total fluency, knowing where and when to pause, knowing how many words he can say before needing a breath. This is what stutterers learn to do: reclaim control of their airflow; think in full phrases, not individual words. I ask Biden what his moment of dread used to be in that essay. “Well, looking back on it, ‘Meek young men grow up in li-li-libraries,’ ” he begins again. “ ‘Li’—the l.” “That kind of sound, the l sound, is like the … r sound,” I say. “Yes.” “Sometimes I’ve noticed, watching old clips, it looks like you do have a little trouble on the r. It’s your middle initial.” “Yeah.” “Like ‘ruh-ruh-ruh-remember,’ ” I say, intentionally stuttering on the r. “Well, I may. I-I-I-I-I haven’t thought I have. But I-I-I-I don’t doubt there’s probably ways people could pick up that there’s something. But I don’t consciously think of it anymore.” Biden says he hasn’t felt himself caught in a traditional stutter in several decades. “I mean, I can’t remember a time where I’ve ever worried before a crowd of 80,000 people or 800 people or 80 people—I haven’t had that feeling of dread since, I guess, speech class in college,” he says, referring to an under­graduate public-speaking course at the University of Delaware. This is when I ask him what happened that night in Detroit. After saying he doesn’t remember, Biden opines: “I’m everybody’s target; they have to take me down. And so, what I found is—not anymore—I’ve found that it’s difficult to deal with some of the criticism, based on the nature of the person directing the criticism. It’s awful hard to be, to respond the same way in a national debate—especially when you’re, you know, the guy who is characterized as the white-guy-of-­privilege kind of thing—to turn and say to someone who says, ‘I’m not saying you’re a racist, but …’ and know you’re being set up. So I have to admit to you, I found my mind going, What the hell? How do I respond to that? Because I know she’s being completely unfair.”

I eventually realize that he’s describing the moment from the first debate, when Harris criticized his record on race. “These aren’t debates,” he continues. “These are one-minute assertions. And I don’t think there’s anybody who hasn’t been taking shots at me, which is okay. I’m a big boy, don’t get me wrong.” Listening back to that part of the conversation after our interview made me feel dizzy. I can only speculate as to why Biden’s campaign agreed to this interview, but I assume the reasoning went something like this: If Biden disclosed to me, a person who stutters, that he himself still actively stutters, perhaps voters would cut him some slack when it comes to verbal misfires, as well as errors that seem more related to memory and cognition. But whenever I asked Biden about what appeared to be his present-day stuttering, the notably verbose candidate became clipped, or said he didn’t remember, or spun off to somewhere new. I wondered if I reminded Biden of his old self, a ghost from his youth, the stutterer he used to be. He and I are about the same height. We happened to be wearing the exact same outfit that day: navy suit, white shirt, no tie. We both went to all-male prep schools, the sort of place where displaying any weakness is a liability. As I listened to the recording of our interview, I remembered how I used to respond when people asked me about my stutter. I’d shut down. I’d try to change the subject. I’d almost always look away.

In early September, I got in touch with my high-school speech pathologist, Joseph Donaher, who practices at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I hadn’t heard Donaher’s voice for almost 15 years. Immediately, I was transported back to the little window­less room in the hospital where we used to meet. Donaher was the first therapist—­really the first person—­who ever leveled with me. I can still see his face, the neutrality in his eyes on the day he looked at me square and said the sentence my friends and parents had avoided saying my entire life: You have a severe stutter. Donaher and his colleagues try to help their patients open up about the shame and low self-worth that accompany stuttering. Instead of focusing solely on mechanics, or on the ability to communicate, they first build up the desire to communicate at all. They then share techniques such as elongating vowels and lightly approaching hard-consonant clusters, meaning just touching on the first sound in a word like stutter—the st—to keep the mouth and throat from tensing up and interfering with speech. The goal isn’t to be totally fluent but, simply put, to stutter better. This evolution in treatment has been accompanied by a new movement to destigmatize the disorder, similar to the drive to view autism through a lens of “neuro­diversity” rather than as a pathology. The idea is to accept, even embrace, one’s stutter. There are practical reasons for this: Research shows, according to Donaher, that the simple disclosure “I stutter” benefits both the stutterer and the listener—the former gets to explain what’s happening and ease the awkward tension so the latter isn’t stuck wondering what’s “wrong” with this person. Saying those two words is harder than it seems. “I’m working with people who spend their whole lives and are never able to disclose it,” Donaher told me. Biden says his father taught him about “shouldering burdens with grace.” Specifically, he told his son, “Never complain. Never explain.” Eric S. Jackson, an assistant professor of communicative sciences and dis­orders at NYU, told me he believes that Biden’s eye movements—the blinks, the downward glances—are part of his ongoing efforts to manage his stutter. “As kids we figure out: Oh, if I move parts of my body not associated with the speech system, sometimes it helps me get through these blocks faster,” Jackson, a stutterer himself, explained. Jackson credits an intensive program at the American Institute for Stuttering, in Manhattan, with bringing him back from a “rock bottom” period in his mid-20s, when he says his stutter kept him from meeting women or speaking up enough to reach his professional goals. Afterward, Jackson went all in on disclosure: Every day for six months, he stood up during the subway ride to and from work and announced that he was a person who stutters. “I had this new relationship with my stuttering—I was like Hercules,” he told me. At 41, Jackson still stutters, but in conversation he confidently maintains eye contact and appears relaxed. He wishes Biden would be more transparent about his intermittent disfluency. “Running for president is essentially the biggest stage in the world. For him to come out and say ‘I still stutter and it’s fine’ would be an amazing, empowering message.”

Occasionally, Biden has used present-tense verbs when discussing his stutter. “I find myself, when I’m tired, cuh-cuh-­catching myself, like that,” he said during a 2016 American Institute for Stuttering speech. Biden has used the phrase we stutterers at times, but in most public appearances and interviews, Biden talks about how he overcame his speech problem, and how he believes others can too. You can watch videos posted by his campaign in which Biden meets young stutterers and encourages them to follow his lead. They’re sweet clips, even if the underlying message—­beat it or bust—is out of sync with the normalization movement. Emma Alpern is a 32-year-old copy editor who co-leads the Brooklyn chapter of the National Stuttering Association and co-founded NYC Stutters, which puts on a day-long conference for stuttering de­stigmatization. Alpern told me that she’s on a group text with other stutterers who regularly discuss Biden, and that it’s been “frustrating” to watch the media portray Biden’s speech impediment as a sign of mental decline or dishonesty. “Biden allows that to happen by not naming it for what it is,” she said, though she’s not sure that his presidential candidacy would benefit if he were more forthcoming. “I think he’s dug himself into a hole of not saying that he still stutters for so long that it would strike people as a little weird.” Biden has presented the same life story for decades. He’s that familiar face—Uncle Joe. He was born 11 months after Pearl Harbor and grew up in the last era of definitive “good guys” and “bad guys.” He’s the dependable guy, the tenacious guy, the aviators-and-crossed-arms guy. That guy doesn’t stutter; that guy used to stutter.

“My dad taught me the value of constancy, effort, and work, and he taught me about shouldering burdens with grace,” Biden writes in the first chapter of his 2007 memoir, Promises to Keep. “He used to quote Benjamin Disraeli: ‘Never complain. Never explain.’ ” Stephen Colbert launches across the Ed Sullivan Theater stage, as if from a pinball spring. It’s early September, and his Late Show taping is about to begin. To warm up, he takes a few questions from the studio audience. Someone asks what he’d want in a potential new president. “Empathy?” Colbert deadpans. “A soul?” Colbert tapes in Midtown Manhattan on the same stage where the Beatles made their American television debut 55 years ago, when Joe Biden was a mere 22. Biden struts out to a standing ovation and throws up his hands in amazement: For me? A brief “Joe! Joe! Joe!” chant erupts. At first, Colbert lobs softballs, and Biden touches on the key parts of his 2020 stump speech: Why voters must stand up to the existential threat of Trumpism and how the Charlottesville, Virginia, white-supremacist rally crystallized his decision to run. Then Colbert goes for it. “In the last few weeks, you’ve confused New Hampshire for Vermont; said

Bobby Kennedy and MLK were assassinated in the late ’70s; assured us, ‘I am not going nuts.’ Follow-up question: Are you going nuts?”

“Look, the reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show was because—” The audience howls. Biden flashes a flirty smile. Colbert adjusts his glasses, sticks his pen in his mouth, and nods in approval. The joke was probably canned, but Biden landed it. Colbert continues to press him about accuracy issues in his storytelling. The studio audience is silent; I’m watching from the balcony and can hear the theater’s air-conditioning humming overhead. “I-I-I-I-I don’t get wrong things like, uh, ya know, there is a, we, we should lock kids up in cages at the border. I mean, I don’t—” People applaud before Biden can finish. When the interview is over, Biden receives a second standing ovation. He peers up toward the rafters, using his hand as a visor against the bright lights. A white spotlight follows him offstage. Several minutes later, he glides through the stage door and out onto West 53rd Street. People call to him from the sidewalk. “Joe! Joe Biden!” He climbs into the back of an idling black SUV, and the doors

clunk close. Read: Tyranny of the 70-Somethings I follow Biden for a couple of days while he campaigns in New Hampshire. His town halls have a distinctly Norman Rockwell vibe. One takes place in the middle of the day on the third floor of a former textile mill, another on a stretch of grass as the wind whips off the Piscataqua River. His crowds are predominantly older, filled with people who stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and wait patiently to ask questions. After he speaks, Biden typically walks offstage to Bruce Springsteen’s “We Take Care of Our Own,” then saunters down the rope line for handshakes and hugs and selfies. One voter after another tells me they’re unaware of Biden’s stutter. “Knowing that he has had something like that to deal with and overcame it, as well as other really sad things that have happened—­­it just makes me like him more,” says 70-year-old Grace Payne.

Back in New York, I start to wonder if I’m forcing Biden into a box where he doesn’t belong. My box. Could I be jealous that his present stutter is less obvious than mine? That he can go sentences at a time without a single block or repetition? Even the way I’m writing this piece—­keeping Biden’s stammers, his ums and pauses, on the page—seems hypocritical. Here I am highlighting the glitches in his speech, when the journalistic courtesy, convention even, is to edit them out. I spend weeks watching Biden more than listening to him, trying to “catch him in the act” of stuttering on camera. There’s one. There’s one. That was a bad one. Also, I start stuttering more. In September, before the third Democratic debate, in Houston, I called Michael Sheehan, a Washington, D.C.–area communications coach whose company website boasts clients ranging from Nike to the Treasury Department. Sheehan worked with President Bill Clinton while he was in office and began consulting on and off for Biden in 2002, when he was in the Senate. On the day we spoke, he was in Wilmington, Delaware, doing debate prep with Biden. Sheehan and I traded stories of daily indignities—­­he stutters too. “I remember exactly where the deli was; it was on 71st and First Avenue,” he said with an ache in his voice. He lamented the interventionists, the people who volunteer, “ ‘You know, why don’t you speak more slowly?’ I always want to say ‘Holy shit! Why didn’t I think of that? Thank you!’ ”

Sheehan’s own stutter improved, but didn’t fully go away, when he took up speech and debate in high school. This eventually led him to the theater, which is a common, if surprising, place where some stutterers find that they’re able to speak with relative ease. Taking on a character, another voice, the theory goes, relies on a different neural pathway from the one used in conversation. Many successful actors have battled stutters—Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, James Earl Jones. In 2014, Jones, whose muscular baritone is the bedrock of one of the most quoted lines in film history, told NPR that he doesn’t use the word cured to describe his apparent fluency. “I just work with it,” he said. At an August town hall, Biden briefly blocked on Obama, before subbing in my boss. The headlines afterward? “Biden Forgets Obama’s Name.” Sheehan was extremely careful with the language he used to describe Biden’s speech patterns—“I can’t say it’s a stutter”—­though he noted his friend’s habit of abruptly changing directions mid-sentence. “I do hear those little pauses, but I really don’t hear the stuff that you would hear from me or I would hear from you,” he said. A few minutes into our conversation, he choked up while discussing Biden’s tender­ness toward young stutterers. “Sometimes I feel when he goes a little long on a speech, he’s just making up for lost time, you know?” Sheehan told me about a night when he came home with his wife and saw the answering-­machine light blinking: “Hey, Michael, it’s Joe Biden. I just was watching The King’s Speech with my granddaughter, and I just thought I’d give you a call, because it made me think of you. Goodbye!” He says the message felt like a secret fraternity handshake: “You and I have both been there, and only people in that society know what that is about.”

In Biden’s office, the first time I bring up his current stuttering, he asks me whether I’ve seen The King’s Speech. He speaks almost mystically about the award-winning 2010 film. “When King George VI, when he stood up in 1939, everyone knew he stuttered, and they knew what courage it took for him to stand up at that stadium and try to speak—and it gave them courage … I could feel that. It was that sinking feeling, like—oh my God, I remember how you felt. You feel like, I don’t know … almost like you’re being sucked into a black hole.” Presidential candidates usually don’t speak about their bleakest moments, certainly not this viscerally. It resembles the way Biden writes in his memoir about the aftermath of the 1972 car accident that killed his first wife and young daughter and critically injured his two sons, Beau and Hunter: “I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest, like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.” Related Stories Joe Biden Is Schrödinger’s Candidate

Is Joe Biden ‘Too Old’?

The President’s Cognitive Decline A few weeks later, I ask Jill Biden what she remembers about sitting next to her husband during the movie. “It was one of those moments in a marriage where you just sort of understand without words being spoken,” she says. As he watched The King’s Speech, Biden accurately guessed that the screenwriter, David Seidler, was a stutterer. “He showed me a copy of a speech they found in an attic that the king had actually used, where he marks his—it’s exactly what I do!” Biden tells me, his voice lifting. “My staff, when I have them put something on a prompter—I wish I had something to show you.”

He pulls out a legal pad and begins drawing diagonal lines a few inches apart, as if diagramming invisible sentences: x words, breath, y words, breath. “Because it’s just the way I have—the, the best way for me to read a, um, a speech. I mean, when I saw The King’s Speech, and the speech—I didn’t know anybody who did that!” Biden is running for president on a simple message: America is not Trump. I’m not Trump. I’ll lead us out of this. With every new debate, with every new “gaffe,” the media continue to ask whether Biden has the stamina for the job. And with every passing month, his competitors—namely Senator Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg—have gained on him in the polls. A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy. Biden talks all day to audiences both small and large. In addition to periodically stuttering or blocking on certain sounds, he appears to intentionally not stutter by switching to an alternative word—a technique called “circumlocution”—­which can yield mangled syntax. I’ve been following practically everything he’s said for months now, and sometimes what is quickly characterized as a memory lapse is indeed a stutter. As Eric Jackson, the speech pathologist, pointed out to me, during a town hall in August Biden briefly blocked on Obama, before quickly subbing in my boss. The headlines after the event? “Biden Forgets Obama’s Name.” Other times when Biden fudges a detail or loses his train of thought, it seems unrelated to stuttering, like he’s just making a mistake. The kind of mistake other candidates make too, though less frequently than he does.

During his 2016 address at the American Institute for Stuttering, Biden told the room that he’d turned down an invitation to speak at a dinner organized by the group years earlier. “I was afraid if people knew I stuttered,” he said, “they would have thought something was wrong with me.” Yet even when sharing these old, hard stories, Biden regularly characterizes stuttering as “the best thing that ever happened” to him. “Stuttering gave me an insight I don’t think I ever would have had into other people’s pain,” he says. I admire his empathy, even if I disagree with his strict adherence to a tidy redemption narrative. In Biden’s office, as my time is about to run out, I bring up the fact that Trump crudely mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the 2016 campaign. “So far, he’s called you ‘Sleepy Joe.’ Is ‘St-St-St-Stuttering Joe’ next?” “I don’t think so,” Biden says, “because if you ask the polls ‘Does Biden stutter? Has he ever stuttered?,’ you’d have 80 to 95 percent of people say no.” If Trump goes there, Biden adds, “it’ll just expose him for what he is.” I ask Biden something else we’ve been circling: whether he worries that people would pity him if they thought he still stuttered. He scratches his chin, his fingers trembling slightly. “Well, I guess, um, it’s kind of hard to pity a vice president. It’s kind of hard to pity a senator who’s gotten six zillion awards. It’s kind of hard to pity someone who has had, you know, a decent family. I-I-I-I don’t think if, now, if someone sits and says, ‘Well, you know, the kid, when he was a stutterer, he must have been really basically stupid,’ I-I-I don’t think it’s hard to—I’ve never thought of that. I mean, there’s nobody in the last, I don’t know, 55 years, has ever said anything like that to me.”",www.theatlantic.com,left,QWSeq0Uw1w1jw9Bn
democratic_party,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/29/sources-dem-campaign-arm-hack-bears-similarities-to-dnc-breach.html,Sources: Dem campaign arm hack bears similarities to DNC breach,2016-07-29,Matthew Dean,"A newly discovered hack into the House Democrats ' campaign arm bears similarities to the recent breach of Democratic National Committee files , sources told Fox News -- with early indications pointing once again to possible Russian involvement .
Sources said the malware used in the breach of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is similar to that used in the DNC hack reported in June .
That breach led to the embarrassing leak of internal emails by WikiLeaks that appeared to show a pro-Clinton bias in the organization -- and , in turn , led to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepping down ahead of the convention .
Some Democrats believe Russia played a role in order to help Republican Donald Trump , a theory the GOP nominee has downplayed .
Speaking of the DNC hack at the Aspen Security Forum Thursday , Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the intelligence community was not ready to make a call as to who ’ s behind the cyber intrusion , but added “ there are just a few usual suspects . ”
On the motivation behind the attack , Clapper added , “ We don ’ t know enough to ascribe motivation , regardless of who it is . ”
The hack of the DCCC ’ s web server allowed the hackers to create and redirect traffic to a fake donations page , made to look and feel authentic , sources said . From there , hackers were able to capture all data entered on the page . Sources said the objective behind the hack is not clear , though it could be to harvest data on Democratic donors and supporters .
Additionally , Fox News has obtained analysis of the DCCC hack from private sector cybersecurity firm FireEye that suggests the intrusion was carried out by a Russian-government aligned hacking group dubbed `` Tsar Team ( APT28 ) . ''
In its research , FireEye notes it previously confirmed that malware analyzed from the DNC hack was also consistent with `` Tsar Team '' -- suggesting the group was involved in both attacks .
Tsar Team has also been implicated by FireEye in numerous cyberattacks aimed at foreign targets on behalf of the Russian government in the past .
FireEye found that visitors of DCCC 's website were redirected to the compromised donations page from at least June 19 to June 27 -- the firm indicates the exact duration is unknown .
FireEye 's analysis notes , `` The targeting of visitors attempting to donate suggests an attempt to target personnel outside the core Democratic organization . ''
The firm also concluded it is currently unknown if victims who were redirected to the spoof DCCC donations page had their individual systems compromised or if sensitive data was collected from them .","A newly discovered hack into the House Democrats' campaign arm bears similarities to the recent breach of Democratic National Committee files, sources told Fox News -- with early indications pointing once again to possible Russian involvement.

Sources said the malware used in the breach of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is similar to that used in the DNC hack reported in June.

That breach led to the embarrassing leak of internal emails by WikiLeaks that appeared to show a pro-Clinton bias in the organization -- and, in turn, led to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepping down ahead of the convention.

Some Democrats believe Russia played a role in order to help Republican Donald Trump, a theory the GOP nominee has downplayed.

Speaking of the DNC hack at the Aspen Security Forum Thursday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the intelligence community was not ready to make a call as to who’s behind the cyber intrusion, but added “there are just a few usual suspects.”

On the motivation behind the attack, Clapper added, “We don’t know enough to ascribe motivation, regardless of who it is.”

The hack of the DCCC’s web server allowed the hackers to create and redirect traffic to a fake donations page, made to look and feel authentic, sources said. From there, hackers were able to capture all data entered on the page. Sources said the objective behind the hack is not clear, though it could be to harvest data on Democratic donors and supporters.

Additionally, Fox News has obtained analysis of the DCCC hack from private sector cybersecurity firm FireEye that suggests the intrusion was carried out by a Russian-government aligned hacking group dubbed ""Tsar Team (APT28).""

In its research, FireEye notes it previously confirmed that malware analyzed from the DNC hack was also consistent with ""Tsar Team"" -- suggesting the group was involved in both attacks.

Success here is crucial for the party . There 's virtually no way for Democrats to win back a majority in the Senate -- much less the House -- without finding a way to compete more effectively in the South . But the truth is there are no easy answers for a party so deep in the hole .
White voters have abandoned Democrats for decades , and the flight has only hastened under President Barack Obama . The migration has created a troublesome math problem : Democrats across the region now depend on African-American voters and not much else .
It 's a disastrous formula in low-turnout midterms dominated by white voters . In Louisiana on Saturday , deep south Democrats bid farewell to their last remaining Democratic senator , Mary Landrieu , who won the African-American vote but failed to secure enough white support in her race against Republican Bill Cassidy . Landrieu won just 18 percent of white voters on Election Day in November , and she failed to expand that margin in the runoff , resulting in another knife-twisting loss for Democrats hoping to put the devastating 2014 midterms behind them .
With Landrieu 's loss , there are now just three Democrats senators hailing from the Old Confederacy : Mark Warner and Tim Kaine in Virginia , and Bill Nelson in Florida . But both of those states have diverse populations and thriving economies that have pushed them away , culturally and politically , from their southern neighbors .
`` Lyndon Johnson made it very clear when he signed the Civil Rights Act back in 1964 what the impact was going to be on his party , the Democrats , and their relationship with southern white voters , '' said South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn , the House 's highest-ranking African-American and the only Democrat from his state in Congress .
After signing the Civil Rights Act , Johnson is reputed to have said that Democrats have lost the South for a generation . Whether Johnson actually uttered those words is in question — but the Democratic Party 's fading fortunes are not .
In South Carolina , Democrats lost every race for statewide office and won only a single House seat — the reliably-blue , majority-African-American district represented by Clyburn . In Georgia , even with Peach State brand names like Nunn and Carter on the ballot , Democrats only mustered support from a quarter of white voters in the contested Senate and governor 's races . In Arkansas , Republicans gained total control of the governor 's mansion and the state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction .
Sorting through the post-election wreckage , Democratic leaders across the region are pessimistic about the party ever re-claiming its status as the majority party . The challenge of reclaiming state legislatures , race-by-race , is a particularly daunting one .
But Democrats also dismiss the funereal commentary about their party , often pegged to the 10-point loss of Georgia 's resilient , gun-brandishing John Barrow , the last remaining white Democrat from the deep South in the House .
`` I do n't think you can make generalizations , '' said Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor , who was thumped by nearly 20 points despite his two-terms in the Senate , deep roots in the state and the Bible he wielded in a campaign ad . `` Every state is different . ''
In states with changing demographics and thriving urban centers like Virginia , North Carolina and Georgia , Democrats are optimistic the states will grow ever friendlier by the next election cycle . South Carolina and Tennessee are more difficult hills to climb , but both states are seeing urban population growth and a continual influx of out-of-staters seeking warmer climates and friendlier tax rates . The forecast is grimmer in more rural , conservative states — like Mississippi and Alabama — with negligible growth rates .
Wherever they stood , 2014 was a uniquely bad cycle for Southern Democrats .
A stew of toxic factors wreaked havoc on the party 's candidates : narrowly-focused campaign messages that did little to address economic anxieties , historic voter apathy , the cyclical second-term drag of a party in power , and an unpopular President who not only struggled to sell his economic achievements but has proven singularly incapable of connecting with white Southerners .

`` Obama was a huge drag on the party , not just in the South , but across much of the country , '' said William Winter , the former Democratic governor of Mississippi . `` He was not articulating a message that I think people respond to . He was well-meaning in his efforts , but he is not in touch with people in the country , and especially in the South . ''
Winter , a moderate whose 1980 election is still remembered fondly by Mississippi Democrats who were struggling to move past their party 's ugly racial history , said Obama 's skin color is `` unfortunately '' a driver of his unpopularity in the South . But he said the national party 's dismal standing had more to do with a message that focused on small-bore issues like contraception or minimum wage increases rather than a unifying , big-picture theme that focuses on middle-class economics .
Democrats should embrace a pro-business mentality , Winter said , singling out `` the ideas that Bill Clinton was selling . '' He bristled at the Elizabeth Warren-style confrontational populism that 's taken hold among Democrats elsewhere in the country .
`` I do n't think we can win on that , '' Winter said . `` If we are not perceived as too far to the left , we can win . I think the South wants to be a part of mainstream America , politically and in every every other way . I think we play on that and let common sense dictate our positions . And it has to be done in concert with the business community . We have alienated a lot of the business community . The business community has a huge stake in maintaining a stable economic and social and educational environment . ''
The clash between the center and the left mirrors a larger national debate within the Democratic Party — and it also reflects a schism among Democrats in different parts of Dixie .
In the deeper South , it 's impossible for Democrats to win without persuading a respectable slice of moderate or conservative white voters . The challenge there is more existential .
`` We have to find a way to reconnect , '' said Clarke Tucker , a newly-elected Democratic member of the Arkansas House of Representatives . `` A lot of the policies that we are pushing help everyone , including the white population . ''
In his Little Rock district , the 33-year old Tucker said he campaigned on `` the issues that are going to move us forward as Democrats in the South , and those are growing the economy , creating jobs and improving education . ''
His Republican opponent , he said with a hint of relief , did not try to tie him to Obama .

It 's a different story in North Carolina , where Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan was defeated despite running a near-perfect campaign and driving up turnout among non-white voters . Her Republican opponent Thom Tillis relentlessly linked Hagan with Obama , whose job approval in North Carolina exit polls was 43 percent — better than in other Southern states , but still ugly .
Democrats in North Carolina are grumpy about the outcome -- but they are n't writing their obituaries yet .
Both the Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham areas continue to grow at a rapid clip , attracting affluent , educated voters from other parts of the country who are n't beholden to the state 's conservative traditions . In just four years , the Research Triangle hub of Wake County has added almost 100,000 new residents and now has a population of over 1 million people .
That makes for an electorate closely resembling the national Democratic coalition under Obama in 2008 and 2012 , made up of urbanized young professionals , including unmarried women , as well as African-Americans and Hispanics . In higher-turnout presidential years , North Carolina is just as winnable for Democrats as it was when Obama won the state 's 15 electoral votes in 2008 — even as rural whites flee the party .
`` The landscape has shifted dramatically over the last six years for Democrats in the South , '' said Morgan Jackson , a Raleigh-based Democratic strategist . `` Since the 1960s , Democrats ran for cover during presidential election years and used the midterm elections to reclaim seats and expand the majorities . The new math is that Southern Democrats fully embrace the expanded presidential election turnout in order to win races . In the midterms , the goal is survival , period . ''
After the Republican wave of 2010 , the GOP gained a chokehold on state houses that gave them the power to shape state legislative and congressional districts in their favor , drawing advantageous lines for Republican incumbents and jamming Democrats into heavily African-American districts , drastically reducing the number of competitive seats in state and federal races .
Their strength grew in 2014 : The GOP now has total control of both legislative chambers in every state in the South , with the exception of the border state of Kentucky . Republicans also have veto-proof supermajorities in Alabama , Arkansas , Georgia , North Carolina and Tennessee — putting added pressure on Democrats to fight for seats at the local level before the next round of redistricting in 2020 .
`` We have got to have a 2020 plan going forward , and that 2020 plan must start in 2015 , '' Clyburn said . `` This country is moving to the right and it 's going to keep moving to the right unless the voters intervene . ''
Republican dominance at the state level has raised questions about whether Democrats will be able to groom candidates for higher office in the future . While it 's true that their farm team has been drastically reduced over the last four years , a younger generation of Democrats say the worries are overblown .
`` I think candidates can emerge from all sorts of places , '' said Tucker , the Arkansas state legislator . He pointed to Dale Bumpers , the former Arkansas governor and senator who was an unknown lawyer before he came out of nowhere to win the governorship in 1970 . Arkansas , Tucker said , has a populist streak that rewards big personalities no matter where they come from .
In Louisiana , Democratic Party Chairwoman Karen Carter Peterson pointed to a roster of successful mayors in New Orleans , Baton Rouge , Shreveport and other cities as possible future statewide candidates .
`` These are strong Democratic mayors who have been re-elected without problems , '' Peterson said . `` We feel like that is a strong bench for us moving forward to change the tide of the state . ''
Some Democrats are calling on the national party structure to pay more attention to the South — and spend more money on party staffers and developing down-ballot talent .
Several longingly invoked former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean 's `` 50-state strategy , '' a program that placed Democratic staffers in even the reddest of states with the goal of re-building the party after the 2004 election . It paid off in the 2006 midterms , when Democrats in traditionally Republican states including Kansas and Montana rode a national wave into office .
South Carolina state Rep. Bakari Sellers , who faltered in his bid for lieutenant governor this year , pointedly criticized the DNC for leaving candidates in his state adrift this year `` without a raft or a lifeboat , expecting us to swim . '' He said the Republican National Committee has `` done a diligent job with fund-raising , candidate cultivation , helping people with consultants and building a bench for the future . ''
Sellers said he received more help from political groups associated with Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley , two potential presidential candidates , than from the DNC .
`` For many of us who were running statewide and have been plowing the soil of the South , we feel like the national party did n't do much to help us at all , '' Sellers said . `` We oftentimes try to push and promote the policies of the White House and the national Democrats , but there is no reciprocation . There is a still great deal of hope that 's associated with the president of the United States . But people are n't sure what Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC stand for . That was apparent on Nov . 4 . ''
Michael Czin , a spokesman for the DNC , disputed the characterization , saying that state party leaders are `` critical partners . ''
`` For a decade , the DNC has invested in all of our state parties year in , and year out , including those in the South , '' he said . `` Whether it 's working with state parties to build our voter file , investing in our State Party Partnership which funds staff on the ground , or our voter expansion and protection programs , the DNC is there to support state parties across the South . We have a lot of work to do , but we are proud of our investments in southern states over the last decade . ''
And there is the Hillary question . If Clinton runs for the White House , some hopeful Democrats wonder if working-class whites might be more willing to return to the party once Obama is out of the picture .
Winter believes Clinton would help Democrats down the ballot even if she does n't win any Southern states . `` Bill and Hillary Clinton are part of the South , '' he said . `` They understand the South and they understand the use of political strategies that will bring people in . They are moderate people , and most people in the South are moderate . ''
Some Clinton supporters have speculated that she might even put her former home state of Arkansas in play come November 2016 . The possibility was floated earlier this month by Mitch Stewart , a numbers-crunching former Obama strategist who advises the Ready For Hillary super PAC .
Stewart said Clinton could favorably alter the post-Obama presidential map by making Arkansas , Missouri and Indiana competitive in 2016 .
`` Where I think Secretary Clinton has more appeal than any other Democrat looking at running is that with white working-class voters , she does have a connection , '' Stewart told Talking Points Memo . `` I think she 's best positioned to open those states . ''
The idea seems plausible enough in Missouri and Indiana , two states with large urban centers , but less so in Arkansas . The Clintons ' travel schedule in 2014 spoke volumes : Bill campaigned relentlessly in the state this year for Pryor and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike Ross — but the more polarizing Hillary was kept at a safe distance . She never set foot in Arkansas in 2014 , opting instead to raise money for Pryor from a safe distance , at a fundraiser in Manhattan .
What seems more likely is that North Carolina and perhaps Georgia , with their ever-mutating demographics , would be on the early map should Clinton decide to run for the White House .
Clyburn , though , waved off the Clinton-specific theories , saying that southern Democrats will get a built-in turnout boost no matter who is on the White House ticket , given the turnout spike that usually occurs in presidential years .
`` Would be Hillary be helpful ? Yes she would , '' Clyburn said . `` But she is not the only one who would help . There are a lot of Democrats at the top of the ticket who would be helpful . Would Elizabeth Warren be helpful . Yes she would . Would Joe Biden be helpful ? Yes he would . I do n't agree with this whole notion that it has to Hillary Clinton or it wo n't be a positive . I do n't think that 's the case at all . A presidential year is going to be helpful for us . ''
Wilkie , speaking over the phone from his office at Ole Miss , was less charitable than Clyburn .
`` Good luck finding a silver lining in your story , '' he said in his honeyed drawl . `` I 'm not sure you 'll be able to . ''","Story highlights Once the South's dominant party, Democrats suffered devastating losses in 2014

""Obama was a huge drag on the party, not just in the South, but across much of the country,"" said William Winter, the former Democratic governor of Mississippi. ""He was not articulating a message that I think people respond to. He was well-meaning in his efforts, but he is not in touch with people in the country, and especially in the South.""

Winter, a moderate whose 1980 election is still remembered fondly by Mississippi Democrats who were struggling to move past their party's ugly racial history, said Obama's skin color is ""unfortunately"" a driver of his unpopularity in the South. But he said the national party's dismal standing had more to do with a message that focused on small-bore issues like contraception or minimum wage increases rather than a unifying, big-picture theme that focuses on middle-class economics.

Democrats should embrace a pro-business mentality, Winter said, singling out ""the ideas that Bill Clinton was selling."" He bristled at the Elizabeth Warren-style confrontational populism that's taken hold among Democrats elsewhere in the country.

""I don't think we can win on that,"" Winter said. ""If we are not perceived as too far to the left, we can win. I think the South wants to be a part of mainstream America, politically and in every every other way. I think we play on that and let common sense dictate our positions. And it has to be done in concert with the business community. We have alienated a lot of the business community. The business community has a huge stake in maintaining a stable economic and social and educational environment.""

The clash between the center and the left mirrors a larger national debate within the Democratic Party — and it also reflects a schism among Democrats in different parts of Dixie.

In the deeper South, it's impossible for Democrats to win without persuading a respectable slice of moderate or conservative white voters. The challenge there is more existential.

""We have to find a way to reconnect,"" said Clarke Tucker, a newly-elected Democratic member of the Arkansas House of Representatives. ""A lot of the policies that we are pushing help everyone, including the white population.""

In his Little Rock district, the 33-year old Tucker said he campaigned on ""the issues that are going to move us forward as Democrats in the South, and those are growing the economy, creating jobs and improving education.""

His Republican opponent, he said with a hint of relief, did not try to tie him to Obama.

North Carolina

It's a different story in North Carolina, where Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan was defeated despite running a near-perfect campaign and driving up turnout among non-white voters. Her Republican opponent Thom Tillis relentlessly linked Hagan with Obama, whose job approval in North Carolina exit polls was 43 percent — better than in other Southern states, but still ugly.

Democrats in North Carolina are grumpy about the outcome -- but they aren't writing their obituaries yet.

Both the Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham areas continue to grow at a rapid clip, attracting affluent, educated voters from other parts of the country who aren't beholden to the state's conservative traditions. In just four years, the Research Triangle hub of Wake County has added almost 100,000 new residents and now has a population of over 1 million people.

That makes for an electorate closely resembling the national Democratic coalition under Obama in 2008 and 2012, made up of urbanized young professionals, including unmarried women, as well as African-Americans and Hispanics. In higher-turnout presidential years, North Carolina is just as winnable for Democrats as it was when Obama won the state's 15 electoral votes in 2008 — even as rural whites flee the party.

Midterms, though, remain a challenge.

""The landscape has shifted dramatically over the last six years for Democrats in the South,"" said Morgan Jackson, a Raleigh-based Democratic strategist. ""Since the 1960s, Democrats ran for cover during presidential election years and used the midterm elections to reclaim seats and expand the majorities. The new math is that Southern Democrats fully embrace the expanded presidential election turnout in order to win races. In the midterms, the goal is survival, period.""

GOP state house dominance

After the Republican wave of 2010, the GOP gained a chokehold on state houses that gave them the power to shape state legislative and congressional districts in their favor, drawing advantageous lines for Republican incumbents and jamming Democrats into heavily African-American districts, drastically reducing the number of competitive seats in state and federal races.

Their strength grew in 2014: The GOP now has total control of both legislative chambers in every state in the South, with the exception of the border state of Kentucky. Republicans also have veto-proof supermajorities in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee — putting added pressure on Democrats to fight for seats at the local level before the next round of redistricting in 2020.

""We have got to have a 2020 plan going forward, and that 2020 plan must start in 2015,"" Clyburn said. ""This country is moving to the right and it's going to keep moving to the right unless the voters intervene.""

Republican dominance at the state level has raised questions about whether Democrats will be able to groom candidates for higher office in the future. While it's true that their farm team has been drastically reduced over the last four years, a younger generation of Democrats say the worries are overblown.

""I think candidates can emerge from all sorts of places,"" said Tucker, the Arkansas state legislator. He pointed to Dale Bumpers, the former Arkansas governor and senator who was an unknown lawyer before he came out of nowhere to win the governorship in 1970. Arkansas, Tucker said, has a populist streak that rewards big personalities no matter where they come from.

In Louisiana, Democratic Party Chairwoman Karen Carter Peterson pointed to a roster of successful mayors in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport and other cities as possible future statewide candidates.

""These are strong Democratic mayors who have been re-elected without problems,"" Peterson said. ""We feel like that is a strong bench for us moving forward to change the tide of the state.""

Some Democrats are calling on the national party structure to pay more attention to the South — and spend more money on party staffers and developing down-ballot talent.

Several longingly invoked former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean's ""50-state strategy,"" a program that placed Democratic staffers in even the reddest of states with the goal of re-building the party after the 2004 election. It paid off in the 2006 midterms, when Democrats in traditionally Republican states including Kansas and Montana rode a national wave into office.

South Carolina state Rep. Bakari Sellers, who faltered in his bid for lieutenant governor this year, pointedly criticized the DNC for leaving candidates in his state adrift this year ""without a raft or a lifeboat, expecting us to swim."" He said the Republican National Committee has ""done a diligent job with fund-raising, candidate cultivation, helping people with consultants and building a bench for the future.""

Sellers said he received more help from political groups associated with Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley, two potential presidential candidates, than from the DNC.

""For many of us who were running statewide and have been plowing the soil of the South, we feel like the national party didn't do much to help us at all,"" Sellers said. ""We oftentimes try to push and promote the policies of the White House and the national Democrats, but there is no reciprocation. There is a still great deal of hope that's associated with the president of the United States. But people aren't sure what Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC stand for. That was apparent on Nov. 4.""

Michael Czin, a spokesman for the DNC, disputed the characterization, saying that state party leaders are ""critical partners.""

""For a decade, the DNC has invested in all of our state parties year in, and year out, including those in the South,"" he said. ""Whether it's working with state parties to build our voter file, investing in our State Party Partnership which funds staff on the ground, or our voter expansion and protection programs, the DNC is there to support state parties across the South. We have a lot of work to do, but we are proud of our investments in southern states over the last decade.""

The Hillary question

And there is the Hillary question. If Clinton runs for the White House, some hopeful Democrats wonder if working-class whites might be more willing to return to the party once Obama is out of the picture.

Winter believes Clinton would help Democrats down the ballot even if she doesn't win any Southern states. ""Bill and Hillary Clinton are part of the South,"" he said. ""They understand the South and they understand the use of political strategies that will bring people in. They are moderate people, and most people in the South are moderate.""

Some Clinton supporters have speculated that she might even put her former home state of Arkansas in play come November 2016. The possibility was floated earlier this month by Mitch Stewart, a numbers-crunching former Obama strategist who advises the Ready For Hillary super PAC.

Stewart said Clinton could favorably alter the post-Obama presidential map by making Arkansas, Missouri and Indiana competitive in 2016.

""Where I think Secretary Clinton has more appeal than any other Democrat looking at running is that with white working-class voters, she does have a connection,"" Stewart told Talking Points Memo. ""I think she's best positioned to open those states.""

The idea seems plausible enough in Missouri and Indiana, two states with large urban centers, but less so in Arkansas. The Clintons' travel schedule in 2014 spoke volumes: Bill campaigned relentlessly in the state this year for Pryor and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike Ross — but the more polarizing Hillary was kept at a safe distance. She never set foot in Arkansas in 2014, opting instead to raise money for Pryor from a safe distance, at a fundraiser in Manhattan.

What seems more likely is that North Carolina and perhaps Georgia, with their ever-mutating demographics, would be on the early map should Clinton decide to run for the White House.

Clyburn, though, waved off the Clinton-specific theories, saying that southern Democrats will get a built-in turnout boost no matter who is on the White House ticket, given the turnout spike that usually occurs in presidential years.

""Would be Hillary be helpful? Yes she would,"" Clyburn said. ""But she is not the only one who would help. There are a lot of Democrats at the top of the ticket who would be helpful. Would Elizabeth Warren be helpful. Yes she would. Would Joe Biden be helpful? Yes he would. I don't agree with this whole notion that it has to Hillary Clinton or it won't be a positive. I don't think that's the case at all. A presidential year is going to be helpful for us.""

To others, that all seems like happy talk.

Wilkie, speaking over the phone from his office at Ole Miss, was less charitable than Clyburn.

""Good luck finding a silver lining in your story,"" he said in his honeyed drawl. ""I'm not sure you'll be able to.""",www.cnn.com,left,TWZgdqKyEYJeMynv

And the more serious question of the Muslim Brotherhood

Keith Ellison (or Keith E. Hakim, or Keith X. Ellison, or Keith Muhammad, etc.) is campaigning for office. Not for the safe House seat he holds, but for the leadership of the Democratic party, a job until recently held by the hilariously incompetent and boundlessly vapid Debbie Wasserman Schultz (who was forced to resign — “resign” here meaning “transfer formally to the Clinton campaign” — when she was exposed conniving to stack the presidential primary elections against Senator Bernie Sanders (S., Portlandia)), who was temporarily replaced by Donna Brazile, who was exposed leaking debate questions to the Clinton campaign, a violation of trust for which she remains adamantly impenitent.

Republicans should take a minute to simply enjoy all this before getting on to the serious business at hand. If they cannot have Debbie Wasserman Schultz organizing opposition to them, former Farrakhan fanboy Keith Ellison of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party is a great second choice.

Ellison is the first Muslim elected to the House, and he complains that the recent spate of criticism directed at him is rooted in — ridiculous word — Islamophobia. But there is a bit more to it than that.

Ellison has long been a vocal defender of the so-called Nation of Islam, the bow-tie gang founded by Elijah Muhammad whose relationship to orthodox Islam is approximately that of a UFO cult to the Anglican communion.

As Sen. Mary Landrieu soldiered through her re-election race this year with sinking poll numbers and the heavy drag of President Barack Obama , the refrain from her strategists and supporters was always the same : Do n't count her out . She 's a fighter . She will pull it off in the end .
But in the hours before a runoff election on Saturday , when the three-term Louisiana Democrat faces Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy , it is hard to find anyone predicting the kind of eleventh hour victory that Landrieu pulled off in 1996 and 2002 -- turning her into a political legend .
`` Sen. Landrieu has been a fabulous closer , '' said Joshua Stockley , a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Monroe . `` Two of her three races , she was not supposed to win . ''
Landrieu is facing voters more than a month after the midterm elections that virtually wiped out Democrats in the South . She failed to clear a 50 % threshold in November needed to avoid a runoff so Landrieu is heading into what could be the final race of her career battling nearly every trend that toppled Democrats this election cycle .

Her base has shrunk dramatically in a state where Republicans are ascendant and she is one of the last white Democrats in the South holding statewide office .

African-American voters will be key to her success

Landrieu's GOP opponent ties her to Obama

As Sen. Mary Landrieu soldiered through her re-election race this year with sinking poll numbers and the heavy drag of President Barack Obama, the refrain from her strategists and supporters was always the same: Don't count her out. She's a fighter. She will pull it off in the end.

But in the hours before a runoff election on Saturday, when the three-term Louisiana Democrat faces Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy, it is hard to find anyone predicting the kind of eleventh hour victory that Landrieu pulled off in 1996 and 2002 -- turning her into a political legend.

""Sen. Landrieu has been a fabulous closer,"" said Joshua Stockley, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. ""Two of her three races, she was not supposed to win.""

Landrieu is facing voters more than a month after the midterm elections that virtually wiped out Democrats in the South. She failed to clear a 50% threshold in November needed to avoid a runoff so Landrieu is heading into what could be the final race of her career battling nearly every trend that toppled Democrats this election cycle.

Her base has shrunk dramatically in a state where Republicans are ascendant and she is one of the last white Democrats in the South holding statewide office.

democratic_party,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/28/politics/koch-brothers-2016/index.html,Will Democrats keep hammering the Kochs?,2015-05-28,"Mj Lee, Finance Reporter, Video Casey Capachi","( CNN ) As the Senate 's top Democrat , Harry Reid has loved nothing more than attacking the Koch brothers and their influence over politics .
Now Democrats have to decide how to wage that battle without him .
Heading into last year 's elections , the Nevada Democrat delighted in repeatedly slamming Charles and David Koch -- using the Senate floor to call them `` un-American '' and accuse them of `` trying to buy America '' -- as he flaunted the mega-donors ' ties to the GOP . But many of the candidates backed by the Kochs won in 2014 , Democrats lost control of the Senate , and Reid will retire at the end of next year .
Setbacks aside , Reid insists he has no regrets about his strategy and does n't plan to back down during his remaining time on Capitol Hill . In a brief interview recently , he told CNN he will go after the Kochs `` as much as I can '' before retiring .
But once he 's gone , will a new Democratic ringleader take over Reid 's mission of casting the Kochs as modern political villains ?
Sen. Chuck Schumer , in line to take Reid 's job in 2017 , declined to comment when asked about the Koch brothers . Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said his party should n't `` ever back away '' from scrutinizing the Kochs . But pressed on whether he has any interest in assuming Reid 's role of chief antagonist , the senator from Illinois chuckled : `` It is n't as though Harry hands the baton off to anyone . ''
Hillary Clinton , the presumed Democratic presidential front-runner , has yet to mention the Kochs publicly since launching her second White House bid . She has , however , indicated plans to help raise money for a pro-Clinton super PAC that Democrats hope could rival the Kochs ' fundraising prowess .
The billionaire industrialists seem more eager than ever to flex their muscles in 2016 , an election cycle that is certain to cement their status as two of the most powerful Republican donors in an era of virtually unlimited outside political spending .
They 're currently eying their favorite candidates in the crowded Republican field , have pledged to raise an eye-popping $ 900 million for the 2016 cycle , and launched an aggressive public relations campaign to revamp Koch Industries ' reputation .
Republicans have long declared the strategy of bashing the Kochs a failure .
`` I 've heard Democrats say it would have been worse without the Koch strategy , '' said Tim Phillips , president of the Koch brothers-founded Americans for Prosperity .
`` What 's worse than nine seats ? It does n't get much worse than that , '' Phillips says , referring to the number of Senate seats the GOP gained in 2014 .
Koch Industries spokesman Ken Spain said an anti-Koch campaign in 2016 will only be as successful as it was in the 2014 cycle .
`` If politicians or political organizations decide to double down on falsely attacking the reputations of Koch Industries , its shareholders , and 60,000 American employees , it is likely to be as successful as it was in 2014 , '' Spain said in a statement to CNN .
But plenty of Democrats , including top strategists involved in the 2014 election 's anti-Koch messaging , insist that the Kochs are not about to be let off the hook .
While most Americans still do n't even know who the Koch brothers are , some Democrats argue that tying Republicans to the media-shy billionaires has helped identify the GOP as the party of wealthy people and special interests , an image that has badly wounded candidates over time .
`` My view is not that Democrats did too much of it but did too little , '' Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said .
Rather than ending the Koch attacks , Garin said that Reid 's departure after 2016 would simply mean the message will be delivered `` by a chorus , rather than a soloist . ''
Joining that chorus is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , an independent seeking the Democratic nomination for president . Soon after launching his campaign , the populist senator called for a `` political revolution '' to take on the `` billionaire class , '' pointing to the Koch brothers as a part of the problem .
But the 2014 cycle revealed just how difficult it is to convince voters that candidates are unfit for office simply because they 've benefited from donations from the Kochs .
Part of the problem is that the Kochs never became household names . Even as Democrats ratcheted up their attacks on the two men , half of Americans did n't recognize the names Charles and David Koch , according to a WSJ/NBC poll in April 2014 . Despite the expensive campaign to demonize the businessmen , just 21 % of the public had negative feelings toward the Kochs , the poll found .
In West Virginia 's 3rd Congressional District , Democrats unleashed a torrent of ads slamming GOP candidate Evan Jenkins and the financial backing he received from the Kochs . Democrats lost their battle there -- Jenkins , a former state senator , defeated longtime Rep. Nick Rahall , 55 % to 45 % .
Andy Sere , a Republican strategist who advised Jenkins , said the slew of anti-Koch ads in the district ultimately did little to paint Jenkins in a negative light .
`` Instead of using our guy 's record to prosecute a case against him , they put all their eggs in a flimsy guilt-by-association attack that failed miserably , even in this strongly populist district , '' Sere said . `` There were some ads where they spent 26 seconds talking about the Kochs and four seconds on Jenkins , which was fine by me . ''
Democrats acknowledge that the Koch strategy proved to be more potent in some races than others . A major takeaway from 2014 was that attacks against the Kochs resonate more deeply if they accuse the brothers and their business of directly hurting local constituents .
`` If you talk about the Koch brothers as an amorphous , D.C. big money and politics , it 's not a very effective message because people do n't see how it affects them in their daily lives , '' said Eddie Vale , vice president of American Bridge , a Democratic super PAC . `` But when you can connect it to people 's lives , then it makes a lot more sense . ''
One model race Democratic strategists point to is Gary Peters ' successful bid for the Senate in Michigan .
Peters ' campaign and his supporters ran ads that not only criticized the Kochs and their outsize spending in politics but also accused one of their companies of creating pollution in the state . One Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ad slammed the Kochs for hurting `` seniors and children with asthma . ''

''","(CNN) As the Senate's top Democrat, Harry Reid has loved nothing more than attacking the Koch brothers and their influence over politics.

Now Democrats have to decide how to wage that battle without him.

Heading into last year's elections, the Nevada Democrat delighted in repeatedly slamming Charles and David Koch -- using the Senate floor to call them ""un-American"" and accuse them of ""trying to buy America"" -- as he flaunted the mega-donors' ties to the GOP. But many of the candidates backed by the Kochs won in 2014, Democrats lost control of the Senate, and Reid will retire at the end of next year.

Setbacks aside, Reid insists he has no regrets about his strategy and doesn't plan to back down during his remaining time on Capitol Hill. In a brief interview recently, he told CNN he will go after the Kochs ""as much as I can"" before retiring.

But once he's gone, will a new Democratic ringleader take over Reid's mission of casting the Kochs as modern political villains?

Sen. Chuck Schumer, in line to take Reid's job in 2017, declined to comment when asked about the Koch brothers. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said his party shouldn't ""ever back away"" from scrutinizing the Kochs. But pressed on whether he has any interest in assuming Reid's role of chief antagonist, the senator from Illinois chuckled: ""It isn't as though Harry hands the baton off to anyone.""

Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic presidential front-runner, has yet to mention the Kochs publicly since launching her second White House bid. She has, however, indicated plans to help raise money for a pro-Clinton super PAC that Democrats hope could rival the Kochs' fundraising prowess.

Meanwhile, the Kochs are doubling down.

The billionaire industrialists seem more eager than ever to flex their muscles in 2016, an election cycle that is certain to cement their status as two of the most powerful Republican donors in an era of virtually unlimited outside political spending.

They're currently eying their favorite candidates in the crowded Republican field, have pledged to raise an eye-popping $900 million for the 2016 cycle, and launched an aggressive public relations campaign to revamp Koch Industries' reputation.

Republicans have long declared the strategy of bashing the Kochs a failure.

""I've heard Democrats say it would have been worse without the Koch strategy,"" said Tim Phillips, president of the Koch brothers-founded Americans for Prosperity.

""What's worse than nine seats? It doesn't get much worse than that,"" Phillips says, referring to the number of Senate seats the GOP gained in 2014.

Koch Industries spokesman Ken Spain said an anti-Koch campaign in 2016 will only be as successful as it was in the 2014 cycle.

""If politicians or political organizations decide to double down on falsely attacking the reputations of Koch Industries, its shareholders, and 60,000 American employees, it is likely to be as successful as it was in 2014,"" Spain said in a statement to CNN.

But plenty of Democrats, including top strategists involved in the 2014 election's anti-Koch messaging, insist that the Kochs are not about to be let off the hook.

While most Americans still don't even know who the Koch brothers are, some Democrats argue that tying Republicans to the media-shy billionaires has helped identify the GOP as the party of wealthy people and special interests, an image that has badly wounded candidates over time.

""My view is not that Democrats did too much of it but did too little,"" Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said.

Rather than ending the Koch attacks, Garin said that Reid's departure after 2016 would simply mean the message will be delivered ""by a chorus, rather than a soloist.""

Joining that chorus is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Soon after launching his campaign, the populist senator called for a ""political revolution"" to take on the ""billionaire class,"" pointing to the Koch brothers as a part of the problem.

But the 2014 cycle revealed just how difficult it is to convince voters that candidates are unfit for office simply because they've benefited from donations from the Kochs.

Part of the problem is that the Kochs never became household names. Even as Democrats ratcheted up their attacks on the two men, half of Americans didn't recognize the names Charles and David Koch, according to a WSJ/NBC poll in April 2014. Despite the expensive campaign to demonize the businessmen, just 21% of the public had negative feelings toward the Kochs, the poll found.

In West Virginia's 3rd Congressional District, Democrats unleashed a torrent of ads slamming GOP candidate Evan Jenkins and the financial backing he received from the Kochs. Democrats lost their battle there -- Jenkins, a former state senator, defeated longtime Rep. Nick Rahall, 55% to 45%.

Andy Sere, a Republican strategist who advised Jenkins, said the slew of anti-Koch ads in the district ultimately did little to paint Jenkins in a negative light.

""Instead of using our guy's record to prosecute a case against him, they put all their eggs in a flimsy guilt-by-association attack that failed miserably, even in this strongly populist district,"" Sere said. ""There were some ads where they spent 26 seconds talking about the Kochs and four seconds on Jenkins, which was fine by me.""

Democrats acknowledge that the Koch strategy proved to be more potent in some races than others. A major takeaway from 2014 was that attacks against the Kochs resonate more deeply if they accuse the brothers and their business of directly hurting local constituents.

""If you talk about the Koch brothers as an amorphous, D.C. big money and politics, it's not a very effective message because people don't see how it affects them in their daily lives,"" said Eddie Vale, vice president of American Bridge, a Democratic super PAC. ""But when you can connect it to people's lives, then it makes a lot more sense.""

One model race Democratic strategists point to is Gary Peters' successful bid for the Senate in Michigan.

Peters' campaign and his supporters ran ads that not only criticized the Kochs and their outsize spending in politics but also accused one of their companies of creating pollution in the state. One Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ad slammed the Kochs for hurting ""seniors and children with asthma.""

""It's obviously more effective when you have some sort of tangible issue or some sort of tangible action by the Koch brothers that is inconsistent with their political agenda,"" Peters said.

If partisan strategists are torn on the effectiveness of the Koch-bashing tactic, some political observers say the core strategy is worrisome. The deeply personal and vitriolic statements and ads have set a dangerous precedent, critics say, by marking two private citizens as political targets -- even if they happen to be among the most wealthy and influential men in U.S. politics.

""I don't think it's really healthy for American politics to essentially have these proxy fights over these wealthy funders,"" said Bruce Haynes of Purple Strategies, a bipartisan consulting firm. ""Folks like the Koch brothers have the money to defend themselves but ... if they didn't have the money to defend themselves and they're attacked by these large organizations like this, it's a very chilling thought.""",www.cnn.com,left,zU8LfqJZecV6Yvjp

The same thing happened in New Jersey, where attorney Bill Hughes Jr., the son of a popular former congressman, for months resisted pleas by national Democrats to run against longtime GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo. But after watching the budget drama unfold, Hughes says he’s likely to run.

So does Indiana Democrat Joe Bock, a University of Notre Dame official who recently said, after much hesitation, that he will most likely run.

Details of the newly announced four-member board were outlined in a memo drafted by interim chairwoman Donna Brazile , a political analyst from Louisiana who replaced Debbie Wasserman Shultz as DNC chief last month after the publication of stolen emails led to her ousting .
“ To prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNC ’ s cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class , I am creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board composed of distinguished experts in the field , ” Ms. Brazile wrote , according to Politico . “ The Advisory Board will work closely with me and the entire DNC to ensure that the party is prepared for the grave threats it faces—today and in the future . ”
The decision to form the board is a direct response to what the chairwoman described as “ illegal cyber attack by state-sponsored Russian hackers , ” according to the Wall Street Journal .
“ We at the DNC take cybersecurity and privacy seriously , ” Ms. Brazile added . “ I am personally committed to doing everything possible to prevent an incident of this magnitude from happening again . ”
Federal investigators believe the DNC was one of several entities associated with the Democratic Party to be successfully targeted by hackers widely assumed to be agents of the Russian government . Intelligence officials told Reuters this week that members of Congress were warned of the cyber campaign last summer , but details of the DNC being breached were not disclosed publicly until last month after antisecrecy website WikiLeaks published thousands of emails stolen from the committee ’ s servers on the eve of its convention .
In addition to releasing correspondence that resulted in Ms. Wasserman Shultz ’ s stepping-down days later , other emails published by WikiLeaks last month included credit-card data and other sensitive information concerning DNC staffers and their contacts .
“ Those individuals receiving the data breach notice also will receive offers of assistance to help mitigate any threats to their financial security . Details concerning the breach and other pertinent information for victims will soon be available , ” Ms. Brazile wrote in her memo addressed to “ interested parties . ”
“ We understand that this incident is alarming to all who may be affected , and I share your anger at those who committed and abetted this act . Our focus now is preventing future attacks , strengthening our capabilities , and helping protect those whose data was stolen . ”
The new DNC board ’ s inaugural members , according to Politico , include : Rand Beers , former acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security ; Nicole Wong , a former technology lawyer for Google and Twitter ; Aneesh Copra , co-founder of Hunch Analytics ; and Michael Sussmann , a former Justice Department cybercrime prosecutor .
Ms. Wong and Mr. Copra both previously held positions as technology officers with the federal government , Politico said .","The Democratic National Committee has assembled a cybersecurity advisory board in the wake of the hack attack that resulted in thousands of internal party emails being leaked online, Politico reported Thursday.

Details of the newly announced four-member board were outlined in a memo drafted by interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, a political analyst from Louisiana who replaced Debbie Wasserman Shultz as DNC chief last month after the publication of stolen emails led to her ousting.

“To prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNC’s cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class, I am creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board composed of distinguished experts in the field,” Ms. Brazile wrote, according to Politico. “The Advisory Board will work closely with me and the entire DNC to ensure that the party is prepared for the grave threats it faces—today and in the future.”

The decision to form the board is a direct response to what the chairwoman described as “illegal cyber attack by state-sponsored Russian hackers,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

“We at the DNC take cybersecurity and privacy seriously,” Ms. Brazile added. “I am personally committed to doing everything possible to prevent an incident of this magnitude from happening again.”

Federal investigators believe the DNC was one of several entities associated with the Democratic Party to be successfully targeted by hackers widely assumed to be agents of the Russian government. Intelligence officials told Reuters this week that members of Congress were warned of the cyber campaign last summer, but details of the DNC being breached were not disclosed publicly until last month after antisecrecy website WikiLeaks published thousands of emails stolen from the committee’s servers on the eve of its convention.

In addition to releasing correspondence that resulted in Ms. Wasserman Shultz’s stepping-down days later, other emails published by WikiLeaks last month included credit-card data and other sensitive information concerning DNC staffers and their contacts.

“Those individuals receiving the data breach notice also will receive offers of assistance to help mitigate any threats to their financial security. Details concerning the breach and other pertinent information for victims will soon be available,” Ms. Brazile wrote in her memo addressed to “interested parties.”

“We understand that this incident is alarming to all who may be affected, and I share your anger at those who committed and abetted this act. Our focus now is preventing future attacks, strengthening our capabilities, and helping protect those whose data was stolen.”

The new DNC board’s inaugural members, according to Politico, include: Rand Beers, former acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Nicole Wong, a former technology lawyer for Google and Twitter; Aneesh Copra, co-founder of Hunch Analytics; and Michael Sussmann, a former Justice Department cybercrime prosecutor.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren described the drone strike ordered by Trump as a dangerous escalation and promised to end American wars in the Middle East . Joe Biden , the former vice president , and Pete Buttigieg , the former mayor of South Bend , Indiana , offered more muted criticism , suggesting that the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani might have been justified if a more responsible commander-in-chief was in charge . “ We must do more than just stop war with Iran , ” Sanders tweeted on Friday . “ We must firmly commit to ending U.S. military presence in the Middle East in an orderly manner . We must end our involvement in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen . We must bring our troops home from Afghanistan . ”
We must do more than just stop war with Iran .
We must firmly commit to ending U.S. military presence in the Middle East in an orderly manner .
We must end our involvement in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen .
We must bring our troops home from Afghanistan . — Bernie Sanders ( @ BernieSanders ) January 3 , 2020
Warren , who faced criticism from the left for initially prefacing her alarm at the threat of “ another costly war ” with the statement that Suleimani was “ a murderer , responsible for the deaths of thousands , including hundreds of Americans , ” amplified Sanders ’ s anti-war message more clearly on Friday . “ Donald Trump is dangerous and reckless , ” she wrote . “ He ’ s escalated crises and betrayed our partners . He ’ s undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal , political gain . We can not allow him to drag us back into another war . We must speak out. ” Biden also criticized the killing of the general as needlessly provocative , but issued a statement that embraced the Trump administration ’ s argument that Suleimani , who orchestrated deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers during the post-war occupation of Iraq , “ deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops. ” The former vice president — who voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq when he was still in the Senate , and later authored a bizarre plan to partition the country along ethnic and sectarian lines — was critical mainly of what he called Trump ’ s failure to explain his “ strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel ” and Trump ’ s lack of a “ long-term vision ” for the U.S. military ’ s role in the region . ( Trump offered a glimpse of his addled vision on Saturday , threatening to strike 52 targets in Iran , including cultural sites , representing , he tweeted , “ the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago. ” ) Buttigieg ’ s initial statement also endorsed Trump ’ s claim that killing an Iranian general who supported Iraqi militias that oppose the ongoing presence of U.S. troops in their country was in line with the commander-in-chief ’ s responsibility “ to protect Americans and our national security interests. ” “ There is no question that Qassim Suleimani was a threat to that safety and security , and that he masterminded threats and attacks on Americans and our allies , leading to hundreds of deaths , ” Buttigieg wrote . “ But there are serious questions about how this decision was made and whether we are prepared for the consequences. ” Like Biden , and to a lesser extent Warren , Buttigieg seemed to glide past the contradictions inherent in describing the killing of 603 American troops in Iraq by Iraqis as a crime akin to terrorism , but of course those soldiers were only there because of the invasion Sanders has repeatedly called on the campaign trail “ the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of the United States. ” “ ‘ Yeah but what ’ s your strategy ? ' ” is the safest , lamest , most DC criticism possible , ” Sanders foreign policy adviser Matt Duss observed on Twitter . “ Trump ’ s Iran policy is foolish , dangerous , and driven by hardline ideologues who ’ ve been pushing for war for years . Who cares what the strategy is for achieving it . The policy needs to change. ” If the ongoing calamity in Iraq does factor into the decisions of Democratic primary voters , it won ’ t be the first time . Then-Sen. Hillary Clinton ’ s 2002 vote to authorize the invasion played a pivotal role in the 2008 Democratic primary , contrasting sharply with Barack Obama ’ s opposition , as a state senator at the time , to what he called , “ A dumb war . A rash war . A war based not on reason but on passion , not on principle but on politics. ” Four years earlier , the capture of Saddam Hussein just one month before the 2004 Iowa caucuses had seemed to tilt the Democratic contest in the opposite direction . That year , as President George W. Bush ’ s approval rating surged 9 points following Hussein ’ s arrest , Iowa voters turned away from an insurgent , critic of the war , Vermont Gov . Howard Dean , in favor of a more hawkish Senator and decorated veteran , John Kerry , who was seen as more electable in wartime . In the aftermath of Trump ’ s strike on Iran ’ s leading military figure , Biden and Buttigieg , egged on by conservative commentators , appear to be vying for the mantle of John Kerry 2.0 as each man argues that his prior experience with national security makes him the best alternative to Trump in the general election . On the campaign trail and in social media ads , Biden has stressed his foreign policy credentials , and familiarity with the intricacies of Iran ’ s military capabilities . Biden told voters in Iowa on Friday that he doubts that Trump is capable of handling Iran ’ s likely retaliation .
The prospect of direct conflict with Iran is greater than ever . Does Donald Trump have a strategy for what comes next ?

His campaign shared an ad on social networks in which Biden described himself as a prospective commander-in-chief who would be “ ready on day one to pick up the pieces of Donald Trump ’ s broken foreign policy and repair the damage he has caused around the world . ”

Buttigieg also suggested that he would be better equipped to prosecute American wars than Trump , telling voters in New Hampshire that “ taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you are ready for what comes next , so there ’ s a lot of questions that Americans are asking today . ”

In an online ad , Buttigieg stressed his own military service as an intelligence analyst in Afghanistan to argue that he would be more strategic and responsible about the use of military power than Trump .

But what makes the 2020 primary campaign fundamentally different from 2004 is that two leading Democrats have already established themselves as skeptics of American military power in a way that Howard Dean — who later lobbied for regime change in Iran — never did . Speaking in Iowa on Friday , Sanders connected his opposition to a new war with Iran to his vote against the Iraq war in 2003 .

The senator ’ s supporters shared clips from his speech on Friday , in which he observed that “ it is rarely the children of the billionaire class who face the agony of reckless foreign policy , ” and from an interview he did with CBS in June , when he scoffed at the idea that Trump deserved credit for having not yet started a catastrophic war with Iran .

After Warren was hammered on social networks by Sanders supporters for not being outspoken enough in her initial statement , she posted comments on Twitter making her opposition to a war with Iran much more clear . “ We ’ re on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East — one that would be devastating in terms of lives lost and resources wasted , ” Warren wrote . “ We ’ re not here by accident . We ’ re here because a reckless president , his allies , and his administration have spent years pushing us here. ” “ Donald Trump ripped up an Iran nuclear deal that was working , ” she added . “ He ’ s repeatedly escalated tensions . Now he ’ s assassinated a senior foreign military official . He ’ s been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office — but the American people won ’ t stand for it . ”
All three of my brothers served in uniform . I know the sacrifices we ask of them and their families . Trump ’ s actions put every service member and diplomat in the region at risk . This is a moment for vigilance—for Americans to speak up and speak out . No more Middle East wars . — Elizabeth Warren ( @ ewarren ) January 3 , 2020
Warren has previously been outspoken in her commitment to end the war in Afghanistan . Asked at a debate in September if she would withdraw American troops from that country even in the absence of a peace deal with the Taliban , Warren replied , “ Yes . ”
. @ DavidMuir on the war in Afghanistan : `` Would you keep that promise to bring the troops home , starting right now , with no deal with the Taliban ? ''
Elizabeth Warren : `` Yes . '' https : //t.co/INdRXlIwFs # DemDebate pic.twitter.com/ltdwVF83de — ABC News ( @ ABC ) September 13 , 2019
“ And I ’ ll tell you why , ” she added . “ What we ’ re doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States , it is not helping the safety and security of the world , it is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan . We need to bring our troops home and then we need to make a big shift : we can not ask our military to keep solving problems that can not be solved militarily . We ’ re not going to bomb our way to a solution. ” Some Sanders campaign aides and supporters , eager to draw votes from the left , cast Warren as insufficiently anti-war , even claiming that her proposal , last May , for the Pentagon to achieve net zero carbon emissions and her vote in favor of a recent military budgets was evidence that she is a secret warmonger . While Warren appeared eager to focus on other issues on Saturday , with her Twitter feed turning to issues like the rights of disabled workers , the threat of white nationalists emboldened by Trump and prosecuting bankers , Sanders stressed his plan to work with Rep. Ro Khanna on a bill that would cut off funding for any offensive action against Iran or Iranian officials . Speaking on Saturday in Iowa , Sanders was met with cheers from supporters when he said that the first course of action when lawmakers return to Washington next week should be “ for the Congress to take immediate steps to restrain President Trump from plunging our nation into yet another endless war . ”

“ This country needs a whole lot of things , but one thing that we do not need is another war , ” Sanders added . “ We ’ ve got enough of those. ” Warren , unlike Sanders , routinely takes questions from reporters after her campaign appearances , pausing for a “ gaggle ” before taking selfies with supporters . On Saturday in Iowa , she said that , by killing Suleimani , “ Donald Trump has taken us to the brink of war . We don ’ t need more war in the Middle East , we need to stop endless war in the Middle East . ”
“ We have been at war in this region for 20 years now and it has meant thousands of American lives lost and huge costs imposed on our country , ” Warren added . “ It also means millions of people in the Middle East who have lost their lives , been injured or displaced . We need to stop this endless war. ” Asked by Daniella Díaz of CNN if she would have given the order to assassinate the Iranian general . Warren said no , and added that she would never have precipitated the current crisis , as Trump did , by withdrawing from the multinational nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by Obama ’ s secretary of state , John Kerry .
To @ DaniellaMicaela ’ s Q whether she would ‘ ve ordered the strike , @ ewarren continued : “ Even though the Iranians had been certified as adhering to the terms of the deal , even though our allies all stayed in the deal and wanted us to stay in the deal ...

Here 's what you need to know as you start your day ...
Super Tuesday could leave race even more unsettled , as Biden aims to check Sanders ’ momentum
On the eve of Super Tuesday , a confident Joe Biden glanced back to his landslide victory in South Carolina over the weekend and looked ahead to what he thinks will be a very good night . The former vice president told supporters in Houston that `` we won in South Carolina , and we ’ ll win in Texas tomorrow . ”
Texas is the second biggest prize on Super Tuesday – when a third of all Democratic presidential nomination delegates are up for grabs . Fourteen states from coast to coast hold primaries on a single day .
Biden – who nearly pulled even with front-runner Sen.

Super Tuesday could leave race even more unsettled, as Biden aims to check Sanders’ momentum

On the eve of Super Tuesday, a confident Joe Biden glanced back to his landslide victory in South Carolina over the weekend and looked ahead to what he thinks will be a very good night. The former vice president told supporters in Houston that ""we won in South Carolina, and we’ll win in Texas tomorrow.”



Texas is the second biggest prize on Super Tuesday – when a third of all Democratic presidential nomination delegates are up for grabs. Fourteen states from coast to coast hold primaries on a single day.

Biden – who nearly pulled even with front-runner Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the delegate hunt thanks to a larger than expected victory in South Carolina – is aiming to prevent Sanders from capturing a large lead in the crucial battle for convention delegates. Biden’s goal is to firmly cement his status as the moderate alternative to Sanders – the populist lawmaker who describes himself as a democratic socialist.



Just a week ago, that seemed like a daunting task. Sanders was poised to carry his big victories in the early states into Super Tuesday and become virtually uncatchable in the delegate game. But as Biden’s South Carolina win prompted rivals to drop out and close ranks behind him, the former vice president is now a viable threat to Sanders. And Super Tuesday, in turn, may not settle things as much as previously thought. Click here for more on our top story.

Faced with a treacherous political environment, many Democrats are trotting out campaign ads that call for balanced budgets, tax cuts and other more traditionally GOP positions. Some of them are running in congressional districts that just two years ago broke sharply for President Barack Obama.

The Republican-flavored ads provide an early glimpse of how Democrats will wage their 2014 campaign.

Now that the Democratic Party’s program of ever-more-stringent candidate requirements has winnowed the presidential debate field from two full stages worth of people to one full stage to a less-than-full single stage, the Democratic National Committee has announced the rules are changing. For the January debates, in addition to meeting the polling thresholds, candidates needed to have at least 225,000 individual donors, reflecting the party’s focus on grassroots support. For February debate, DNC chairman Tom Perez has lower that requirement to zero. This is very exciting news for candidates named Michael Bloomberg.

The new requirements, according to Politico:

Bernie Sanders on Saturday said he supports Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz 's Democratic opponent in her August 30 primary , adding that if he is elected president , he would effectively terminate her chairmanship of the DNC .
Sanders , whose campaign has engaged in an increasingly bitter feud with the DNC chairwoman during his presidential bid , said in an interview set to air on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' that he favors Tim Canova in Florida 's 23rd congressional district . Canova is supporting Sanders .
`` Well , clearly , I favor her opponent , '' Sanders told Tapper . `` His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultz 's . ''
On Sunday afternoon , Canova accused Wasserman Schultz of ignoring her home district 's economic issues .
`` In her own votes in the House of Representatives , I think she 's making the problems worse , '' Canova told CNN 's Fredricka Whitfield .
He also expressed doubt that his political rival could heal intra-party rifts created during the primary .
`` If the Democrats come out of their convention united , it might not be because of Debbie Wasserman Schultz , but in spite of her efforts , '' he said .
Sanders sent out a fundraising email on behalf of Canova on earlier in the day .
`` The political revolution is not just about electing a president , sisters and brothers . We need a Congress with members who believe , like Bernie , that we can not change a corrupt system by taking its money , '' the email said .
Sanders also told Tapper that if he 's elected president , he would n't reappoint Wasserman Schultz to head the DNC .
In a response to Sanders on Saturday afternoon , Wasserman Schultz insisted she would remain neutral in the Democratic presidential race despite the Vermont senator 's endorsement of her primary opponent .
`` I am so proud to serve the people of Florida 's 23rd district and I am confident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in Congress , '' Wasserman Schultz said . `` Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent , I remain , as I have been from the beginning , neutral in the presidential Democratic primary . I look forward to working together with him for Democratic victories in the fall . ''
Sanders ' campaign has long been critical of Wasserman Shultz 's performance as head of the committee , claiming that the DNC has favored his presidential primary challenger , Hillary Clinton . Sanders and his supporters have complained about the nomination process and ways they believe it has helped Clinton , including debates held on Saturday nights , closed primaries in major states such as New York , and the use of superdelegates -- essentially free-agent party and union stalwarts who are overwhelmingly backing Clinton .
Canova , who teaches at Nova Southeastern University Shepard Broad College of Law in Fort Lauderdale , was asked in 2011 to serve on Sanders ' Wall Street reform advisory panel .
`` I 'm so proud to know that Bernie Sanders favors our campaign for progress for all . Like Sen. Sanders , I 'm running a campaign that 's truly backed by the people , not big corporations -- one that stands up to Wall Street interests instead of cozying up to them , '' Canova told CNN in a statement Saturday . `` Together , I feel confident that our campaign of nurses , teachers , students , seniors and working-class Floridians can work together to demand accountability from our leaders , and offer a more positive path forward to the people of Florida 's 23rd district . ''
Canova has called for greater regulation of Wall Street , writing on his campaign website that `` we are now in a new Gilded Age . '' Like Sanders , he also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal .
`` Time and time again , ( Wasserman Schultz ) has voted to protect the pools of dark money in politics , '' Canova recently told the New Times newspaper of Broward-Palm Beach .
While Sanders has a strong ability to raise money and thus could impact the race , he did not fare well in Wasserman Schultz 's congressional district during the March Florida presidential primary , scoring 30.1 % of the vote compared with Clinton 's 68 % .
On Wednesday , Jeff Weaver , Sanders ' campaign manager , slammed Wasserman Schultz after she told CNN the Vermont senator did not do enough to condemn his supporters ' behavior at the party 's raucous Nevada convention last week .
`` We can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz just about how she 's been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning , '' Weaver told CNN 's Chris Cuomo on `` New Day . ''
`` It 's not the DNC , '' Weaver added . `` By and large , people in the DNC have been good to us . Debbie Wasserman Schultz really is the exception . ''
Wasserman Schultz has pushed back against Sanders ' accusation that the party had rigged the system against him .
`` We 've had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama . These rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014 , '' she said earlier this week .
Asked about the `` throwing shade '' line on Wednesday , Wasserman Schultz told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , `` My response to that is hashtag SMH ( shake my head ) . ''
Sanders also said it is `` absurd '' that superdelegates began supporting Clinton even before she had a competitor .
`` There 's something absurd that I get 46 % of the delegates that come from real contests , real elections , and 7 % of the superdelegates , '' he told Tapper . `` Some 400 of Hillary Clinton 's superdelegates came on board her campaign before anybody else announced . It was anointment . And that is bad for the process . ''
Sanders , who has frequently cited polls saying he does better than Clinton in a matchup against Trump , also said there 's `` a good chance '' the former secretary of state can beat the presumptive Republican nominee .
`` I 'm not saying she can not beat Donald Trump . I think she can . I think there 's a good chance she can , '' the Vermont senator said . `` ( But ) I am the stronger candidate because we appeal to independents -- people who are not in love with either the Democratic or the Republican Party , often for very good reasons . ''","Washington (CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday said he supports Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Democratic opponent in her August 30 primary, adding that if he is elected president, he would effectively terminate her chairmanship of the DNC.

Sanders, whose campaign has engaged in an increasingly bitter feud with the DNC chairwoman during his presidential bid, said in an interview set to air on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he favors Tim Canova in Florida's 23rd congressional district. Canova is supporting Sanders.

""Well, clearly, I favor her opponent,"" Sanders told Tapper. ""His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultz's.""

On Sunday afternoon, Canova accused Wasserman Schultz of ignoring her home district's economic issues.

""In her own votes in the House of Representatives, I think she's making the problems worse,"" Canova told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield.

He also expressed doubt that his political rival could heal intra-party rifts created during the primary.

""If the Democrats come out of their convention united, it might not be because of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, but in spite of her efforts,"" he said.

Sanders sent out a fundraising email on behalf of Canova on earlier in the day.

""The political revolution is not just about electing a president, sisters and brothers. We need a Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we cannot change a corrupt system by taking its money,"" the email said.

Sanders also told Tapper that if he's elected president, he wouldn't reappoint Wasserman Schultz to head the DNC.

'Neutral'

In a response to Sanders on Saturday afternoon, Wasserman Schultz insisted she would remain neutral in the Democratic presidential race despite the Vermont senator's endorsement of her primary opponent.

""I am so proud to serve the people of Florida's 23rd district and I am confident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in Congress,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent, I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary. I look forward to working together with him for Democratic victories in the fall.""

Sanders' campaign has long been critical of Wasserman Shultz's performance as head of the committee, claiming that the DNC has favored his presidential primary challenger, Hillary Clinton. Sanders and his supporters have complained about the nomination process and ways they believe it has helped Clinton, including debates held on Saturday nights, closed primaries in major states such as New York, and the use of superdelegates -- essentially free-agent party and union stalwarts who are overwhelmingly backing Clinton.

Canova, who teaches at Nova Southeastern University Shepard Broad College of Law in Fort Lauderdale, was asked in 2011 to serve on Sanders' Wall Street reform advisory panel.

""I'm so proud to know that Bernie Sanders favors our campaign for progress for all. Like Sen. Sanders, I'm running a campaign that's truly backed by the people, not big corporations -- one that stands up to Wall Street interests instead of cozying up to them,"" Canova told CNN in a statement Saturday. ""Together, I feel confident that our campaign of nurses, teachers, students, seniors and working-class Floridians can work together to demand accountability from our leaders, and offer a more positive path forward to the people of Florida's 23rd district.""

Canova has called for greater regulation of Wall Street, writing on his campaign website that ""we are now in a new Gilded Age."" Like Sanders, he also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

""Time and time again, (Wasserman Schultz) has voted to protect the pools of dark money in politics,"" Canova recently told the New Times newspaper of Broward-Palm Beach.

While Sanders has a strong ability to raise money and thus could impact the race, he did not fare well in Wasserman Schultz's congressional district during the March Florida presidential primary, scoring 30.1% of the vote compared with Clinton's 68%.

'Throwing shade'

On Wednesday, Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, slammed Wasserman Schultz after she told CNN the Vermont senator did not do enough to condemn his supporters' behavior at the party's raucous Nevada convention last week.

""We can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz just about how she's been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning,"" Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day.""

""It's not the DNC,"" Weaver added. ""By and large, people in the DNC have been good to us. Debbie Wasserman Schultz really is the exception.""

Wasserman Schultz has pushed back against Sanders' accusation that the party had rigged the system against him.

""We've had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama. These rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014,"" she said earlier this week.

Asked about the ""throwing shade"" line on Wednesday, Wasserman Schultz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""My response to that is hashtag SMH (shake my head).""

'Absurd' process

Sanders also said it is ""absurd"" that superdelegates began supporting Clinton even before she had a competitor.

""There's something absurd that I get 46% of the delegates that come from real contests, real elections, and 7% of the superdelegates,"" he told Tapper. ""Some 400 of Hillary Clinton's superdelegates came on board her campaign before anybody else announced. It was anointment. And that is bad for the process.""

Sanders, who has frequently cited polls saying he does better than Clinton in a matchup against Trump, also said there's ""a good chance"" the former secretary of state can beat the presumptive Republican nominee.

""I'm not saying she cannot beat Donald Trump. I think she can. I think there's a good chance she can,"" the Vermont senator said. ""(But) I am the stronger candidate because we appeal to independents -- people who are not in love with either the Democratic or the Republican Party, often for very good reasons.""",www.cnn.com,left,9GkfM410aAQGqVKc

This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I ’ m an asset of Russia . Completely despicable . ”
Gabbard said that Trump “ has the blood of the Kurds on his hands ” but explained that she holds both parties responsible for supporting what she described as a “ regime-change war . ”
“ So do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011 , along with many in the mainstream media , who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war , ” she said .

“ I 've ruled that out , ” she told CNN in August . “ I ’ m going to continue to focus on moving our campaign forward , continuing this grassroots campaign , continuing to deliver our message to the American people . ”
Glenn Greenwald , the founder of The Intercept and frequent Gabbard defender , alleged that the unease Democrats feel about Gabbard is based on her accusations that the Democratic Party rigged the 2016 primary against Sanders and her opposition to “ Washington orthodoxy ” on foreign policy .
`` What 's really going on is twofold : One is that in 2016 she resigned from the Democratic National Committee because she accused Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC of cheating on behalf of Hillary , and then supported Bernie Sanders , so Democrats hate her for that , ” Greenwald said in an appearance on Fox News .
`` They also hate her because she 's been questioning a lot of Washington orthodoxy that both political parties support , including why it is that we continue to try to change the regimes of countries far away like in Syria , and why we continue to prop up regimes that make the world hate us , like in Saudi Arabia .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Joe Biden bought himself time . It ’ s unclear how much .

Some of Biden ’ s supporters are clear-eyed about the difficulties ahead .
“ I think he will have to do better , no question about that , ” Rep. James Clyburn , the prominent South Carolina Democrat who gave Biden a boost with a crucial endorsement days before the primary , said on CNN . “ We need to do some retooling in the campaign , no question about that . ”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden bought himself time. It’s unclear how much.

Biden’s victory in South Carolina on Saturday was emphatic enough to let him make the claim that it had reordered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

democratic_party,Newsmax,2,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/clinton-convention-sanders-dnc/2016/07/24/id/740184/,Clinton Faces New Email Scandal Heading into Convention ,2016-07-24,Stephen Braun,"Hacked emails threatened to overshadow the Democratic Party 's upcoming celebration in Philadelphia as progressives expressed disappointment Sunday over the presidential nomination process and Bernie Sanders stepped up demands that the party 's chairwoman step down .
Bitterness and frustration among the more progressive wing came after some 19,000 emails were published on the website Wikileaks that suggested the Democratic National Committee played favorites during the primary , when Sanders fell short against Hillary Clinton .
In one leaked email , a DNC official wondered whether Sanders ' religious beliefs could be used against him , questioning whether the candidate may be an atheist .
In televised interviews Sunday , the Vermont senator said the emails proved what he knew was true : The DNC planned to support former Secretary of State Clinton from the start .
`` I 'm not shocked , but I 'm disappointed '' by the exchanges in the emails , Sanders told ABC 's `` This Week . ''
Sanders pressed for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , D-Fla. , to quit as chairwoman immediately . He also suggested that Clinton 's choice of running mate , Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine , was a disappointment and that he would have preferred Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a favorite of liberals .
`` His political views are not my political views . He is more conservative than I am . Would I have preferred to see somebody like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton ? Yes , I would have , '' Sanders told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''
The Clinton team worked to portray their party 's convention in a different light from the just concluded Republican gathering in Cleveland , where Donald Trump accepted the GOP nomination but party divisions flared when his chief rival , Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , refused to endorse the billionaire businessman .
Trump cast himself as the law-and-order candidate in a nation suffering under crime and hobbled by immigration , as the GOP convention stuck to a gloom-and-doom theme . Democrats said they wanted to convey a message of optimism and improving the lives of all Americans .
But party disunity also seems to be a factor in Philadelphia , given Sanders ' demands for a new leader and general unhappiness among his many supporters about how the nomination process unfolded .
It was unclear whether Wasserman Schultz would have a speaking role at the convention . And at least one Sanders ' delegate said there was talk of protests during Kaine 's acceptance speech .
Norman Solomon , a delegate who supports Bernie Sanders , says there is talk among Sanders ' delegates of walking out during Kaine 's acceptance speech or turning their backs as a show of protest .
Solomon said he believes a `` vast majority '' of Sanders delegates support these kinds of protests to express their dismay . Sanders ' supporters say they are concerned that Kaine is not progressive enough .
Dan O'Neal , 68 , is a retired school teacher and delegate from Arizona , said Wasserman Schultz has to be censured .
`` We knew they were stacking the deck against Bernie from the get-go , but this type of stuff coming out is outrageous , '' he said . `` It proves our point that they 've tried to marginalize him and make it as difficult as possible . ''
Trump 's campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , agreed , saying Sanders ' supporters `` have a lot to complain about . ''
`` The emails have proven the system was rigged from the start , '' Manafort told `` Fox News Sunday . ''
Clinton 's campaign manager , Robby Mook , tried to shift blame away from DNC officials to `` Russian state actors '' who , he said , may have hacked into DNC computers `` for the purpose of helping Donald Trump , '' the Republican presidential nominee .
`` It was concerning last week that Donald Trump changed the Republican platform to become what some experts would regard as pro-Russian , '' Mook said .
Clinton is within just days of her long-held ambition to become the party 's official presidential nominee .
After the DNC released a slightly trimmed list of superdelegates — those are the party officials who can back any candidate — it now takes 2,382 delegates to formally clinch the nomination . Clinton has 2,814 when including superdelegates , according to an Associated Press count . Sanders has 1,893 .
Sanders has endorsed Clinton , but his delegates are pushing for a state-by-state tally . The state-by-state roll call is scheduled for Tuesday .
Also Sunday , Kaine and his wife , Anne Holton , were back at their longtime church in Richmond , Virginia , a day after he made his campaign debut with Clinton .
Kaine , a former choir member at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church , sang a solo during Communion . He later told reporters outside the church : `` We needed some prayers today and we got some prayers , and we got some support and it really feels good . ''","Hacked emails threatened to overshadow the Democratic Party's upcoming celebration in Philadelphia as progressives expressed disappointment Sunday over the presidential nomination process and Bernie Sanders stepped up demands that the party's chairwoman step down.

Bitterness and frustration among the more progressive wing came after some 19,000 emails were published on the website Wikileaks that suggested the Democratic National Committee played favorites during the primary, when Sanders fell short against Hillary Clinton.

In one leaked email, a DNC official wondered whether Sanders' religious beliefs could be used against him, questioning whether the candidate may be an atheist.

In televised interviews Sunday, the Vermont senator said the emails proved what he knew was true: The DNC planned to support former Secretary of State Clinton from the start.

""I'm not shocked, but I'm disappointed"" by the exchanges in the emails, Sanders told ABC's ""This Week.""

Sanders pressed for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., to quit as chairwoman immediately. He also suggested that Clinton's choice of running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, was a disappointment and that he would have preferred Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of liberals.

""His political views are not my political views. He is more conservative than I am. Would I have preferred to see somebody like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton? Yes, I would have,"" Sanders told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

The Clinton team worked to portray their party's convention in a different light from the just concluded Republican gathering in Cleveland, where Donald Trump accepted the GOP nomination but party divisions flared when his chief rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, refused to endorse the billionaire businessman.

Trump cast himself as the law-and-order candidate in a nation suffering under crime and hobbled by immigration, as the GOP convention stuck to a gloom-and-doom theme. Democrats said they wanted to convey a message of optimism and improving the lives of all Americans.

But party disunity also seems to be a factor in Philadelphia, given Sanders' demands for a new leader and general unhappiness among his many supporters about how the nomination process unfolded.

It was unclear whether Wasserman Schultz would have a speaking role at the convention. And at least one Sanders' delegate said there was talk of protests during Kaine's acceptance speech.

Norman Solomon, a delegate who supports Bernie Sanders, says there is talk among Sanders' delegates of walking out during Kaine's acceptance speech or turning their backs as a show of protest.

Solomon said he believes a ""vast majority"" of Sanders delegates support these kinds of protests to express their dismay. Sanders' supporters say they are concerned that Kaine is not progressive enough.

Dan O'Neal, 68, is a retired school teacher and delegate from Arizona, said Wasserman Schultz has to be censured.

""We knew they were stacking the deck against Bernie from the get-go, but this type of stuff coming out is outrageous,"" he said. ""It proves our point that they've tried to marginalize him and make it as difficult as possible.""

Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, agreed, saying Sanders' supporters ""have a lot to complain about.""

""The emails have proven the system was rigged from the start,"" Manafort told ""Fox News Sunday.""

Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, tried to shift blame away from DNC officials to ""Russian state actors"" who, he said, may have hacked into DNC computers ""for the purpose of helping Donald Trump,"" the Republican presidential nominee.

How the emails were stolen hasn't been confirmed.

""It was concerning last week that Donald Trump changed the Republican platform to become what some experts would regard as pro-Russian,"" Mook said.

Clinton is within just days of her long-held ambition to become the party's official presidential nominee.

After the DNC released a slightly trimmed list of superdelegates — those are the party officials who can back any candidate — it now takes 2,382 delegates to formally clinch the nomination. Clinton has 2,814 when including superdelegates, according to an Associated Press count. Sanders has 1,893.

Sanders has endorsed Clinton, but his delegates are pushing for a state-by-state tally. The state-by-state roll call is scheduled for Tuesday.

Also Sunday, Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, were back at their longtime church in Richmond, Virginia, a day after he made his campaign debut with Clinton.

Kaine, a former choir member at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church, sang a solo during Communion. He later told reporters outside the church: ""We needed some prayers today and we got some prayers, and we got some support and it really feels good.""",www.newsmax.com,right,Lsx9hy1lZ7EgrLV2

Keith Ellison found themselves suddenly parrying an attack they thought they ’ d already defeated : that Ellison had a troubling record of opposing Israel and American Jews .
On Friday , a group called the American Jewish Congress told members of the Democratic National Committee that Ellison — the first Muslim member of Congress — would `` threaten the relationship '' between America and Israel . Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz published an op-ed saying an Ellison victory would force him out of the Democratic Party , citing Ellison ’ s allegedly “ sordid association with anti-Semitism. ” A letter sent to DNC members said Ellison had a history of “ unfairly demonizing ” Israel ’ s treatment of the Palestinians , according to emails shared with ███ and first reported by the Young Turks ' Nomiki Konst .
Ellison ’ s team rushed to counter with email blasts from its most prominent Jewish supporters — one from American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten , another that night from Minnesota Rep. Frank Hornstein , and then a third the next morning from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer :

On Saturday , former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez won the DNC chair race by a narrow 235-200 margin . There ’ s zero evidence Perez did anything to encourage the last-minute attacks against Ellison ’ s record . But in about a dozen interviews , Ellison supporters both inside and outside the DNC said they believed the “ anti-Israel ” charge helped derail Ellison ’ s bid — either directly by scaring DNC voting members away from Ellison or by indirectly by knocking his team off their message and pitch .
“ In the final 36 hours , the Ellison campaign spent significant resources combating an 11th-hour smear campaign that was sending targeted emails to Jewish DNC members , ” texted an official on the Ellison campaign , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal campaign matters .
Added Melahat Rafiei , a DNC voting member from California who supported Ellison : “ Probably the most heartbreaking part of this process was seeing the fruition of Islamophobia in our own party . It was Islamophobia , to the fullest extent possible , and it was disappointing [ that Democrats ] were influenced by it . ”
DNC members who voted for Perez — as well as some who backed Ellison — vehemently reject this characterization of their thinking . They say their candidate won fair and square — by being a better candidate who had more experience and offered a bolder vision for the party , and not because the DNC voting members were persuaded by a spurious attack .
Perez supporters : we didn ’ t win because of the Ellison smear campaign
Missouri Democrat Brian Wahby sounds taken aback by even the suggestion that DNC members went with Perez because they disapproved of Ellison ’ s record on either American Jews or Israel .
“ That has nothing to do with it . Nobody said anything to me about that , ” said Wahby , who voted for Perez , adding that he is himself Lebanese . “ Honestly : Nobody said anything to me in any of the deliberations one way or another regarding Israel . ”
The refrain was echoed by every DNC delegate who voted for Perez and spoke with ███ . Those delegates said that neither they nor anybody they knew let attacks on Ellison ’ s record on Israel sway their vote .
“ That never entered into my thinking in any way , shape , or form , ” said Nancy Monacelli , a Washington state DNC voting member . “ I got emails from Jewish organizations that were concerned , but I thought Keith addressed it fine . Certainly no one I spoke to had any hangups about that . ”
Added Iris Martinez , a DNC voter from Illinois who backed Perez : “ No , no , no — there ’ s a lot of stuff people put out there [ on the internet ] . But I didn ’ t see it . ”
A few Ellison supporters , including Rafiei , alleged that Perez did not do enough to publicly condemn the swirling charge of anti-Semitism — an accusation that drew fierce denunciations from Perez supporters . Some argued that even the suggestion represented a divisive line that amounted to little more than sour grapes about losing .
“ That ’ s bullshit . And you can quote me on that , ” said Wahby . “ Emotions run high , and they ’ re running very high now — not just in the DNC but in the country . We say a lot of things we don ’ t really mean in an election . ”
Even the pro-Perez candidates who admitted that the controversy over Ellison ’ s positions on Israel and past ties to the Nation of Islam gave them some pause initially said it was a non-factor . “ I do not think that was an issue after Keith responded . Earlier on , before he responded , it was , ” said Jim Roosevelt , a DNC voting member from Massachusetts . “ I did not hear it on people ’ s minds today . ”
“ People were voting for a person who is going to go back and rebuild the party and do grassroots organizing and take on Donald Trump , ” said Rick Wade , a DNC member from South Carolina who supported Perez . Wade added he hadn ’ t received any emails about Ellison and Israel : “ I haven ’ t heard of that . ”
And it ’ s worth noting that even some pro-Ellison DNC members were also dismissive of the idea that the accusations of anti-Semitism flung at Ellison actually led anyone to vote for Perez instead . “ Obviously , the vote was very close ... but whether it affected any Jewish members of the DNC ? To me , I don ’ t think it did , ” said Cliff Mooney , a North Carolina Democrat and voting member who supported Ellison . “ The only things I heard today had nothing to do with that . ”
On their way out of the Atlanta hotel , after more than five hours of debates and votes and arguing , two nurses wearing bright red scrubs and Ellison pins stopped in front of a reporter and lamented that a “ smear ” campaign helped hand Perez the victory .
“ Oh , absolutely it hurt him — it ’ s what they used against him , ” said Jean Ross , of National Nurses United , when asked about the accusations that Ellison was anti-Israel or anti-Semitic . “ Certainly , many states ’ [ DNC ] voters heard rumors about him being anti-Semitic , even though he was solidly endorsed by the Jewish community . ”
Standing to her right was Martese Chism , a nurse from Chicago who was in Atlanta to back Ellison . She added of the Democrats : “ They claim they 're an inclusive party , but then they drop a Muslim and everyone backs off . ”
Ross and Chism singled out CNN ’ s coverage for blame . In early December 2016 , CNN ’ s Andrew Kaczynski published a story examining Ellison ’ s youthful support for black radical leaders like Kwame Ture and Louis Farrakhan . Members of the Nation of Islam , Ture and Farrakhan have expressed anti-Semitic views . But in 2006 , Ellison apologized for not doing more to directly call out their anti-Semitic views — and there ’ s no evidence he ever praised any anti-Semitic comments .
During the campaign , another complaint emerged against Ellison stemming from comments he made at a private meeting about American foreign policy toward Israel . J.J. Goldberg , of the Jewish newspaper the Forward , argued that they had been ripped out of context . It ’ d be hard to call Ellison “ anti-Israel ” without also branding the left flank of the Democratic Party , several Jewish advocacy groups , and a faction of Israel ’ s domestic politicians with the same label . ( Here ’ s a more detailed look at the charges from December 2016 . )
Nonetheless , both stories got wide traction in the mainstream and right-wing media — and among some in the Democratic Party . Haim Saban , who donated $ 8 million to Hillary Clinton ’ s Super PAC and is one of the party ’ s largest donors , ripped Ellison as both “ anti-Israel ” and anti-Semitic , according to the Intercept . And the story became a major plot in the race for the DNC , brought up at primetime debates as vulnerabilities for Ellison .
Why Ellison supporters feel burned by accusations of anti-Israel sentiment
This criticism of Ellison ’ s record on Israel and with the Nation of Islam culminated in concern beyond the media and donor circles , extending to Jewish Democratic voters — who in turn lobbied their representatives in the party .
Eric Bauman is the vice chair of the California Democratic Party , and was a pro-Ellison advocate . A self-described “ observant , pro-Israel Jew , ” Bauman said he spent much of his time over the past six weeks responding to questions from constituents worried about Ellison ’ s history on Israel .
“ I 've received emails ranging from people simply asking me , 'How can you support Ellison when he 's anti-Israel ? ' to people sending me hateful emails like , 'How could you support an anti-Semite who believes in the destruction of Israel ? ” Bauman says , adding that the charges are preposterous .
`` I can tell you for sure there were people in the party who oppose him because they believe Jewish supporters or Jewish donors would be so repelled that they 'd walk away from the party . But it 's a small number — it 's not a large number . ''
Several DNC members backing Ellison said they had conversations with undecided voting members who were tied up over his history on Israel . ( No DNC member interviewed for this story would confirm the charge . ) “ I know people who were on the fence only because of this specific reason , ” said Mike Kapp , a voting member of the DNC from California .
It ’ s possible , Kapp said , that all the people wavering because of this issue supported Ellison anyway . ( We don ’ t know which DNC members supported which chair candidate , since the ballots from the race haven ’ t been released . ) But even if that were the case , Kapp said that having to rebut the charges zapped Ellison ’ s team of time and resources for other vital campaigning .
“ If it wasn ’ t for that , we would ’ ve had at least a couple more votes on our side that we wouldn ’ t have had to spend time and resources trying to convince , ” Kapp says .
Andrew Lachman , a DNC member from California , also conceded that the pro-Perez faction may not have consciously voted a certain way because of the Ellison/Israel controversy . But he noted that the attacks may have still hurt Ellison by fueling the perception that he was a risky , far-left choice .
“ Some people expressed a concern that Ellison was coming from the more progressive wing of the party and would make it difficult to expand the tent — those statements [ on Israel and Jews ] were brought up as examples , ” Lachman said . “ If any politician has made statements that have raised controversy in the past , there ’ s always a concern they can be brought up again as a distraction . ”
Sandra Lowe , a DNC member from California who supported Ellison , emphasized that the “ smears ” forced the Ellison campaign to address “ someone else ’ s talking point ” — rather than talking up his campaign plans .
“ When you lose a race , it ’ s usually because there ’ s something out there . And anything that holds people back slightly is something you have to consider , ” Lowe said . “ When you ’ re getting emails from constituents saying , ‘ I ’ m never going to vote for you again , ’ it ’ s real .

democratic_party,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/who-won-democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-217935,Dem insiders: Sanders failed to dent Clinton,2016-01-18,Steven Shepard,"Bernie Sanders is riding a wave of momentum in Iowa and New Hampshire , but his performance in Sunday night ’ s debate failed to dislodge Hillary Clinton from her perch as national front-runner for the Democratic nomination .
That ’ s according to Democratic members of The ███ Caucus — a panel of leading strategists , operatives and activists in Iowa , New Hampshire and the two states that will follow with nominating contests next month : Nevada and South Carolina , where Sunday ’ s debate was held .
“ She wins anytime her opponents do n't draw blood , ” said a New Hampshire Democrat who , like all the insiders , completed the survey anonymously .
The debate , which also included former Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley , was the final clash before Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire cast the first ballots this year , and insiders split along partisan lines as to which candidate emerged stronger . More than three-quarters of Democratic insiders surveyed immediately following the prime-time forum said Clinton won the debate , compared with just over 20 percent who picked Sanders as the winner . But among Republicans , Sanders was the runaway victor : Two-thirds said Sanders won , to 20 percent for Clinton .
Most Democratic insiders felt Clinton effectively dinged Sanders with her aggressive approach to Sanders ’ opposition to some stricter gun laws and his statements supporting a single-payer health care system .
“ She gave as good as she got , ” said an Iowa Democrat . “ Sanders at times seemed unable to control his emotions . ”
“ The conjuring up of Bernie Sanders ' voting record on several issues took a nick out of his vaunted , saintly consistency , ” added a Nevada Democrat .
Republicans vigorously disagreed , arguing that Clinton did little to reverse Sanders ’ surge , which has propelled him into an apparent tie in the Iowa caucuses and a significant advantage in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire . ( Clinton is still running substantially ahead nationally , including a 25-point lead in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday morning . )
“ Hillary probably did well enough , but she just ca n't shake Bernie , ” said an Iowa Republican . “ His anger with Wall Street and campaign finance coupled with his unabashed support for a panacea of liberal ideas is just what the base wants to hear . Just as [ Donald ] Trump fills the vacuum for strident leadership Republicans thirst for , Bernie appeals to those on the left that have a distinct version of the way things ‘ should be. ’ Tonight , Bernie stuck to those ideals while repeatedly reminding Democratic voters why Hillary is a flawed candidate . ”
Not all Democrats credited Clinton with the win — some argued that Sanders did well in a format where his opponent had thrived in three previous debates .
“ It was a draw , ” said one New Hampshire Democrat , “ and in that case Bernie won because this is Hillary 's strength , and tonight he went toe for toe with her . ”
“ All three were the best they 've been , ” added another New Hampshire Democrat . “ Bernie owned it though . ”
To bring the debate dynamics into sharper relief , insiders were asked about three specific exchanges between the two leading Democratic candidates : gun policy , health care and Clinton ’ s ties to Wall Street .
Vast majorities of insiders in both parties thought Clinton drew blood against Sanders on the Vermont senator ’ s past opposition to some stricter gun laws . Clinton cited Sanders ’ past opposition to the Brady Bill and measures that held gun-makers liable for deaths using their product .
“ Either Bernie has a blind spot on this issue , ” said one Iowa Democrat , “ or he 's keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror for reelection back home . ”
Even Republicans , who are typically critical in their assessments of Clinton performances , awarded this round to the former secretary of state .
“ When you 're explaining , you 're losing , ” said an Iowa Republican . “ And Bernie is still explaining on guns . ”
On health care , Democratic insiders felt Clinton ’ s attacks were effective , while Republicans were split — with some arguing that Sanders projected a more positive vision for health care policy .
“ By justly questioning Sanders ' commitment to the Affordable Care Act , Hillary implicitly questioned his loyalty to President Obama , ” a New Hampshire Democrat said .
“ On health care , Hillary is process , and Sanders is passion , ” a South Carolina Republican countered .
Perhaps the sharpest clash of the night was on Wall Street . Sanders implicitly criticized Clinton for accepting campaign donations and speaking fees from financial services firms — and insiders in both parties credited Sanders with bruising Clinton while also reinforcing his strongest issues .
A number of Democrats who otherwise credited Clinton with having a strong night pointed out that she did not respond to Sanders ’ implication that she received hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs .
“ Bernie won by pummeling Clinton on her coziness ” with Wall Street , said a Nevada Democrat . “ She did n't do herself any favors by failing to respond to the Goldman speaking fee criticism . ”
“ Clinton did n't even respond to the Goldman speaking fee jabs that Sanders [ threw ] at her , ” said another Nevada Democrat . “ Seems like he might 've caught her off-guard , and she stumbled . ”
“ Bernie quickly ramped up into a frenzy , ” an Iowa Democrat said . “ He stepped over the line from passionately debating to ranting . ”
Republicans overwhelmingly thought Sanders got the better of this exchange .
“ Sanders is going to win this one every time , ” said a New Hampshire Republican . “ Clinton ( and O'Malley ) need to understand they are playing on foreign turf and work to shorten these exchanges and move on to the next question . ”
Broadly speaking , some Democrats thought the debate ’ s focus on Sanders — he spoke for longer than Clinton , according to ███ ’ s calculations — may have backfired .
“ This turned out to be a referendum on his candidacy , and not in a good way , ” said a New Hampshire Democrat . “ He spent most of the night on defense , which in turn made him look nervous . Finally , South Carolina is not New Hampshire . A number of times the applause lines he looked like he was expecting mid-speech simply never came . ”

That’s according to Democratic members of The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of leading strategists, operatives and activists in Iowa, New Hampshire and the two states that will follow with nominating contests next month: Nevada and South Carolina, where Sunday’s debate was held.

“She wins anytime her opponents don't draw blood,” said a New Hampshire Democrat who, like all the insiders, completed the survey anonymously.

The debate, which also included former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, was the final clash before Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire cast the first ballots this year, and insiders split along partisan lines as to which candidate emerged stronger. More than three-quarters of Democratic insiders surveyed immediately following the prime-time forum said Clinton won the debate, compared with just over 20 percent who picked Sanders as the winner. But among Republicans, Sanders was the runaway victor: Two-thirds said Sanders won, to 20 percent for Clinton.

Most Democratic insiders felt Clinton effectively dinged Sanders with her aggressive approach to Sanders’ opposition to some stricter gun laws and his statements supporting a single-payer health care system.

“She gave as good as she got,” said an Iowa Democrat. “Sanders at times seemed unable to control his emotions.”

“The conjuring up of Bernie Sanders' voting record on several issues took a nick out of his vaunted, saintly consistency,” added a Nevada Democrat.

Republicans vigorously disagreed, arguing that Clinton did little to reverse Sanders’ surge, which has propelled him into an apparent tie in the Iowa caucuses and a significant advantage in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. (Clinton is still running substantially ahead nationally, including a 25-point lead in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday morning.)

“Hillary probably did well enough, but she just can't shake Bernie,” said an Iowa Republican. “His anger with Wall Street and campaign finance coupled with his unabashed support for a panacea of liberal ideas is just what the base wants to hear. Just as [Donald] Trump fills the vacuum for strident leadership Republicans thirst for, Bernie appeals to those on the left that have a distinct version of the way things ‘should be.’ Tonight, Bernie stuck to those ideals while repeatedly reminding Democratic voters why Hillary is a flawed candidate.”

Not all Democrats credited Clinton with the win — some argued that Sanders did well in a format where his opponent had thrived in three previous debates.

“It was a draw,” said one New Hampshire Democrat, “and in that case Bernie won because this is Hillary's strength, and tonight he went toe for toe with her.”

“All three were the best they've been,” added another New Hampshire Democrat. “Bernie owned it though.”

To bring the debate dynamics into sharper relief, insiders were asked about three specific exchanges between the two leading Democratic candidates: gun policy, health care and Clinton’s ties to Wall Street.

Vast majorities of insiders in both parties thought Clinton drew blood against Sanders on the Vermont senator’s past opposition to some stricter gun laws. Clinton cited Sanders’ past opposition to the Brady Bill and measures that held gun-makers liable for deaths using their product.

“Either Bernie has a blind spot on this issue,” said one Iowa Democrat, “or he's keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror for reelection back home.”

Even Republicans, who are typically critical in their assessments of Clinton performances, awarded this round to the former secretary of state.

“When you're explaining, you're losing,” said an Iowa Republican. “And Bernie is still explaining on guns.”

On health care, Democratic insiders felt Clinton’s attacks were effective, while Republicans were split — with some arguing that Sanders projected a more positive vision for health care policy.

“By justly questioning Sanders' commitment to the Affordable Care Act, Hillary implicitly questioned his loyalty to President Obama,” a New Hampshire Democrat said.

“On health care, Hillary is process, and Sanders is passion,” a South Carolina Republican countered.

Perhaps the sharpest clash of the night was on Wall Street. Sanders implicitly criticized Clinton for accepting campaign donations and speaking fees from financial services firms — and insiders in both parties credited Sanders with bruising Clinton while also reinforcing his strongest issues.

A number of Democrats who otherwise credited Clinton with having a strong night pointed out that she did not respond to Sanders’ implication that she received hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.

“Bernie won by pummeling Clinton on her coziness” with Wall Street, said a Nevada Democrat. “She didn't do herself any favors by failing to respond to the Goldman speaking fee criticism.”

“Clinton didn't even respond to the Goldman speaking fee jabs that Sanders [threw] at her,” said another Nevada Democrat. “Seems like he might've caught her off-guard, and she stumbled.”

Some Democrats felt Sanders botched the attack, however.

“Bernie quickly ramped up into a frenzy,” an Iowa Democrat said. “He stepped over the line from passionately debating to ranting.”

Republicans overwhelmingly thought Sanders got the better of this exchange.

“Sanders is going to win this one every time,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “Clinton (and O'Malley) need to understand they are playing on foreign turf and work to shorten these exchanges and move on to the next question.”

Broadly speaking, some Democrats thought the debate’s focus on Sanders — he spoke for longer than Clinton, according to POLITICO’s calculations — may have backfired.

“This turned out to be a referendum on his candidacy, and not in a good way,” said a New Hampshire Democrat. “He spent most of the night on defense, which in turn made him look nervous. Finally, South Carolina is not New Hampshire. A number of times the applause lines he looked like he was expecting mid-speech simply never came.”

Democrats fell far short of winning the House in 2012 , an otherwise banner year for the party , and many are privately glum about taking back the chamber in 2014 .
But that grim immediate outlook raises a far more troubling longer-term prospect for Democrats : that the newly drawn congressional lines have tilted the electoral playing field so decisively in the GOP ’ s favor that the party could control the House through 2020 .
That this , in other words , could be the Democrats ’ Lost Decade .
Three of the past four elections have produced partisan upheaval , so political forecasting must be approached with caution . Democrats say projecting beyond next year , let alone next month , is a fool ’ s errand .
But strategists in both parties say they are still reckoning with the long-term implications of Democrats ’ disastrous performance in 2010 . Not only did they lose the House that year , but setbacks in state capitals meant that Republicans controlled the once-a-decade process of line drawing in 213 districts — nearly five times the number of districts Democrats had oversight over . And Republicans used that power with a vengeance .
The GOP effectiveness in erecting a gerrymandered fortress has created a paradox : Even in a fast-changing electorate , with many demographic trends favoring Democrats , the part of the national government that the Founders imagined would be most responsive to shifts in public opinion and voter behavior may actually be the least responsive .
The possibility of a decade or more of GOP House dominance is something Democrats – and even some Republicans , who still need to hit up donors – are loathe to talk about publicly . But make no mistake : Even as they struggle in presidential and Senate races , Republicans have a structural advantage in the House that could last through the next four elections .
Karl Rove , George W. Bush ’ s political architect , stopped short of predicting that the speaker ’ s gavel will remain in GOP hands through 2020 . But he said the dual factors of sharp Republican line drawing and population shifts provided a solid foundation for the party .
“ The impact , ” he said , “ is certainly favorable to Republicans at the congressional level . ”
Of the 435 districts that constitute the chamber , 242 tilt toward Republicans while 185 favor Democrats ( another eight are evenly divided ) . In November , Mitt Romney - despite getting shellacked nationally – won 21 more congressional districts than President Barack Obama .
It ’ s for that reason that Democrats , who are 17 seats shy of the majority , start out the midterm season at risk of losing ground . While there are 15 Democrats residing in GOP-tilting districts , only four Republicans are in Democratic-friendly ones . And the Cook Political Report lists 37 Democratic-held seats as being competitive , compared to just 28 Republican ones .
Redistricting is the single biggest factor driving the GOP ’ s congressional power . When the process came to an end last year , 109 Republican seats were made safer as opposed to 67 Democratic seats . And 109 Democrat seats became more competitive , compared to just 96 Republicans .
Demographics also play a role . While Democrats are benefiting from a booming Latino population – a dynamic that ’ s helping them in presidential and statewide races — the party ’ s supporters have clustered in densely-packed , ethnically diverse urban population centers . The result is that wide swaths of suburban , exurban , and rural districts have been left to Republicans .
If Democrats are discouraged , they ’ re putting on a brave public face . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee frequently out-performs its GOP counterpart in monthly fundraising , and the party ’ s leaders maintain a sunny outlook about their prospects . In the final days leading up to the 2012 election , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told aides she was convinced her party could win control .
But for all the blood , sweat , and tears the party pours into the battle for the House , there is also a sense that larger forces are at work .
“ I can ’ t worry about what ’ s out of our control . I can worry about what ’ s in our control , ” said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel ( D-N.Y. ) . “ If we play strong offense and strong defense [ in 2014 ] , there is a path – not an exceedingly wide path – but there is a path . ”
Israel argued that there are 52 Republican seats in play and 20 Democrats ones – in other words , a sufficiently wide enough field for his party to win the House .
For all the problems confronting Democrats , predicting flat-out that the party can ’ t return to power in the years is risky business . No matter how locked in the House may seem , there are always unforeseen events , scandals , and policy issues that have the potential to reshape the political environment .
In the last two decades , there have been three wave elections in the House – some of them helped along them by relatively sudden political disruptions .
“ There are all these things out there that make it impossible to predict that one party can ’ t win an election between now and 2022 , ” said Mark Gersh , a top national Democratic strategist who has advised numerous Democratic groups , including the DCCC . “ Events can overtake what ’ s going on . ”
In 2006 , for example , with anger rising over President Bush ’ s handling of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , Democrats picked up 31 seats , enough to overcome the GOP ’ s 15-seat majority .
Still , the electoral map is much changed since then — and not in a way that ’ s cause for Democratic encouragement . According to David Wasserman , who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report , Republicans went into the 2006 election with nearly five times more the number of seats on Democratic-friendly turf than they have in 2014 .
Also that year , Democrats had the advantage of running against an increasingly unpopular Republican president . In 2014 , Democrats have to contend with an occupant in the White House whose unpopularity among the right could help drive Republicans to the polls . It ’ s a dynamic that makes recruiting strong candidates in Republican-friendly areas and breaking the national map wide open – something then-DCCC Chairman Rahm Emanuel succeeded in doing in 2006 — that much more difficult .
“ Rahm did an excellent job at recruitment , ” Rove said . “ If you ’ re a moderate-to-conservative Democrat , you ’ re not enthused about running on the Obama-Pelosi agenda . ”
Republicans agree that the unknown makes it impossible to predict that they ’ ll hold the House for the decade , but they also argue that redistricting gave them a buffer .
“ Politics is so dynamic right now that I wouldn ’ t ever project that far ahead because we ’ ve seen waves come and go , parties be pronounced dead and then revived , ” said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden ( R-Ore. ) “ But I think the underpinnings for the House are pretty strong given the districts that have been drawn and locked in . ”
Some Democrats envision a scenario in which demographic changes in states like North Carolina , Florida , and Texas would allow them to pick up seats and chip away at the GOP majority . Those changes might not come soon enough for the 2014 election , they say , but could swing races approaching the end of the decade .
Then there ’ s the argument heard most frequently from Democrats : That redistricting , while beneficial to the GOP in the short term , will only push Republicans farther to the right – prospectively damaging the party ’ s already shaky brand .
Israel said he couldn ’ t wait to label Republicans as out of the mainstream .
“ Republicans are putting Republicans seats in play . They ’ re moving so far to the right they ’ re alienating swing voters , ” he said . “ We ’ re going to put bipartisanship on the ballot in 2014 .

• Congress not waiting on Obama

• President tries to pacify unions on ObamaCare

• What a bunch of clowns

SYRIA CASTS SHADOWS ON 2016 DEMS - As Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton crisscross the nation and the globe raising their public profiles (and padding their donor lists) ahead of potential 2016 presidential bids, the Obama administration’s stumbles on Syria are posing serious problems. The Democratic base is in an uproar over the proposed strikes, but neither Biden nor Clinton can politely distance themselves from the president’s policies. They own them. But they can begin a long, slow march away from their president.

Biden could face grilling at steak fry - Vice President Joe Biden heads to Iowa Sunday for Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin’s annual steak fry. The Des Moines Register reports that President Obama’s friction with Harkin and other liberal lawmakers about Obama’s now-shelved request for congressional backing for strikes against Syria could complicate what is usually a casting call for presidential contenders in the home state for the first-in-the-nation nominating caucus.

Job chat in South Carolina - The White House announced Vice President Joe Biden will discuss jobs and infrastructure at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina Monday. South Carolina traditionally hosts the second presidential primary.

At least he warned us! - Vice President Joe Biden called House Republicans “Neanderthals” for resisting Democrats’ ultimately successful effort this year to add men in same-sex couples to the Violence against Women Act. Biden, speaking at a celebration of the act’s 19th anniversary at his official residence, prefaced his “Neanderthal” claim thusly: “I'm going to say something outrageous.” He also touted his legislative expertise: “I think I understand the Senate better than any man or women who’s ever served in there.”

WILL HILLARY ADDRESS SYRIA ON WORLD STAGE? - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in Scotland today to speak to the graduating class at St. Andrew’s University. With Britain already backed out of a U.S. coalition for Syria strikes and strong public sentiment there against joining the conflict, what will America’s former top diplomat say? In speeches earlier this week, Clinton voiced general support for President Obama’s Syria policy, but steered clear of his call for airstrikes, preferring to speak of “a strong response” led by the U.N.

Kerry crunch - With her successor stranded in Geneva trying to win weapons talks with his Russian counterpart, a little help from Clinton would surely be appreciated. But will Clinton be willing to sidle up to the unpopular war plan?

Huma rushes back to Hillary - Following her husband Anthony Weiner’s crushing defeat in the New York mayoral election on Tuesday, Huma Abedin, the longtime right-hand woman to Hillary Clinton, is back. Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines, told TPM on Thursday that Abedin has returned to her position as director of the former secretary of State’s team.

Hillary staffs up - The departure of President Obama’s top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, first reported by Fox Business, provides some more manpower for Hillary Clinton’s policy team. From the NYT: “If Hillary Rodham Clinton runs for president in 2016, Mr. Sperling, 54, is expected to join her team, a quarter-century after he played a prominent role in her husband’s first presidential campaign.” Sperling will be replaced by Obama’s former budget boss, Jeffrey Zients.

Corruption probe touches Hillary - WaPo reports federal investigators are probing a senior campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, Minyon Moore, as they seek to build a case against D.C. businessman Jeffrey Thompson for his role in launching a shadow campaign to elect D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray.

Trickles down to Virginia governor race - WaPo also reports Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, the longtime top fundraiser for the Clintons, will not return a donation to his 2009 governor campaign from Thompson.

Some expected a straight-up snoozer . But never fear , Bernie Sanders and his lawsuit are here .
By effectively declaring war on the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton on Friday , Sanders cranked up the anticipation exponentially , ensuring that the debate stage will be as tense as it ’ s ever been on the Democratic side of 2016 while accusations fly about stolen data and Clinton ’ s relationship with the Democratic National Committee .

Sanders will come out swinging . Clinton will punch back , maybe harder . That much is clear .
The underdog ’ s aides are open about the fact that Sanders sees his brawl — and lawsuit in federal court — with the DNC as an opportunity to fire up his loyal backers and to persuade any liberals who are still uncertain about Clinton . The front-runner has the DNC ’ s leadership — including chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz — in her pocket , Sanders will say , and their relationship endangers the integrity of the party .
Clinton , meanwhile , won ’ t shy from the fight : her allies are saying that the data stolen by Sanders staffers was worth millions of dollars , and members of her political team were genuinely shaken by the revelation on Friday . Look for the former secretary of state — backed by almost the entire Democratic establishment — to lay into Sanders and what her staff sees as his dishonesty , and his campaign ’ s theft .

As a result , an especially aggressive Clinton will likely try to catch Sanders stumbling in protracted policy discussions , particularly on those domestic policy issues that the New Yorker ’ s team sees as his weak spots based on polling . Saturday could provide her with a prime opportunity to expose his policy soft spots , figure her allies , since he has spent days with briefing books ahead of previous debates .
3 . ISIS ISIS ISIS ISIS . And some other foreign policy stuff .
Clinton has turned her foreign-policy experience into an ‘ adult in the room ’ strategy through a series of speeches and campaign communications , including a Friday op-ed in the local Union Leader newspaper and a Minneapolis terrorism speech on Wednesday . She will argue that Sanders is both uninformed and unrealistic : his out-of-hand rejection of the Paris climate agreement , for example , will be a prime point of contrast , as the former top diplomat frequently talks about her own role in climate negotiations .
“ Bernie does his best , obviously , when he can talk about economic issues and income inequality , so if the debate does center on national security , it will be an advantage for her , ” said Clinton ally Ed Rendell , former Pennsylvania governor .
But , eager to prove he can talk about more than economic fairness after his press secretary scolded reporters for asking about ISIS last week , Sanders is likely to bring new talking points to the table . He ’ s eager to paint Clinton ’ s State Department as partially responsible for the rise of the terrorist group .
Democrats aligned with Sanders and Martin O ’ Malley have long been angry at the DNC and the networks about the debate schedule , which they say is designed to protect Clinton through low viewership . And this third debate , coming the Saturday night before Christmas , is a prime example , they ’ ve said .

It ’ s nearing the point in the campaign , they figure , where she will start making clear how important it is for a Democrat to win the White House rather than a Republican . So she ’ s likely to spend more of her time on stage responding to the Wednesday debate night musings of Ted Cruz , Donald Trump , Marco Rubio , and Chris Christie rather than Sanders and O ’ Malley .
“ She ’ ll slam the Republicans for their militaristic policies of wanting American ground troops where there doesn ’ t seem to be any sentiment for it , either in the U.S. or in Europe , ” said Rendell , previewing her message .

Story Continued Below

As Sanders plans to turn the evening – and the election – into a referendum on the party establishment, here’s what POLITICO will be watching for during the forum in New Hampshire:

1. Real. Life. Excitement.

Sanders will come out swinging. Clinton will punch back, maybe harder. That much is clear.

The underdog’s aides are open about the fact that Sanders sees his brawl — and lawsuit in federal court — with the DNC as an opportunity to fire up his loyal backers and to persuade any liberals who are still uncertain about Clinton. The front-runner has the DNC’s leadership — including chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz — in her pocket, Sanders will say, and their relationship endangers the integrity of the party.

Clinton, meanwhile, won’t shy from the fight: her allies are saying that the data stolen by Sanders staffers was worth millions of dollars, and members of her political team were genuinely shaken by the revelation on Friday. Look for the former secretary of state — backed by almost the entire Democratic establishment — to lay into Sanders and what her staff sees as his dishonesty, and his campaign’s theft. His team went way too far, she will likely say, and now the senator is trying to distract from that.

In other words, expect more real anger than we’ve seen so far on the left of the 2016 contest.

2. Is Bernie Sanders’ Senate schedule going to mess with his game?

One reason Sanders might lean into his DNC attack? He hasn’t done any debate prep.

Clinton spent Friday preparing for the event — particularly expecting to fend off attacks on her ties to Wall Street, and honing her barbs on Sanders' gun record. But Sanders has been attending to Senate duty in Washington, his chief strategist Tad Devine told POLITICO.

As a result, an especially aggressive Clinton will likely try to catch Sanders stumbling in protracted policy discussions, particularly on those domestic policy issues that the New Yorker’s team sees as his weak spots based on polling. Saturday could provide her with a prime opportunity to expose his policy soft spots, figure her allies, since he has spent days with briefing books ahead of previous debates.

3. ISIS ISIS ISIS ISIS. And some other foreign policy stuff.

Clinton has turned her foreign-policy experience into an ‘adult in the room’ strategy through a series of speeches and campaign communications, including a Friday op-ed in the local Union Leader newspaper and a Minneapolis terrorism speech on Wednesday. She will argue that Sanders is both uninformed and unrealistic: his out-of-hand rejection of the Paris climate agreement, for example, will be a prime point of contrast, as the former top diplomat frequently talks about her own role in climate negotiations.

“Bernie does his best, obviously, when he can talk about economic issues and income inequality, so if the debate does center on national security, it will be an advantage for her,” said Clinton ally Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor.

But, eager to prove he can talk about more than economic fairness after his press secretary scolded reporters for asking about ISIS last week, Sanders is likely to bring new talking points to the table. He’s eager to paint Clinton’s State Department as partially responsible for the rise of the terrorist group.

4. Will anyone watch?

Democrats aligned with Sanders and Martin O’Malley have long been angry at the DNC and the networks about the debate schedule, which they say is designed to protect Clinton through low viewership. And this third debate, coming the Saturday night before Christmas, is a prime example, they’ve said.

While Sanders’ attempt to ignite a fire under his base on Friday could goose the numbers, most party leaders are still skeptical that the event will move the ball demonstrably unless any one candidate makes a howling error.

“There’s only one [New Hampshire] debate and that one is happening on probably the biggest shopping weekend of the year,” complained O’Malley’s state director John Bivona. “The most common phrase we hear from our supporters when we tell them to tune in is, ‘Why is the debate on a Saturday night?’""

Plus, people around the candidates are wondering how they’re supposed to respond to the arrows slung at them by Republicans on Wednesday during their own prime-time debate that drew 18 million viewers.

“The Democrats should have been more skillful. They should have had more debates, they should have started debates earlier, and, yeah, no one’s going to watch this debate,” said former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, who supports Clinton. “Republicans are garnering too much attention.""

5. Clinton’s general-election pivot

While the data breach story will dominate a large chunk of the debate, Clinton’s eager to move forward. Indeed, people close to Clinton say we can expect her to make her contrasts more explicit than ever before — her contrasts with Republicans, that is.

It’s nearing the point in the campaign, they figure, where she will start making clear how important it is for a Democrat to win the White House rather than a Republican. So she’s likely to spend more of her time on stage responding to the Wednesday debate night musings of Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, and Chris Christie rather than Sanders and O’Malley.

“She’ll slam the Republicans for their militaristic policies of wanting American ground troops where there doesn’t seem to be any sentiment for it, either in the U.S. or in Europe,” said Rendell, previewing her message.

The broad strokes of that position aren’t any different from Sanders’, despite their serious disagreements on the details of international engagement. But when it comes to drawing the broadest contrasts, Clinton is spoiling for an ideological fight with the GOP.",www.politico.com,left,joVpkK7Saw0V0YyX

If there's one thing that's sustained liberals through the trials of the 2016 election and its aftermath, it's faith that demography will come to their rescue to ensure that they eventually prevail against the right-wing, racist populism of the Trump-era Republican Party.

That assumption, which originated with the ""emerging Democratic majority"" thesis of the early 2000s, has animated a thousand tweets and undergirded an untold number of think pieces over the past year and a half. The most recent is Ezra Klein's erudite reckoning with just how much President Trump's toxic racism and xenophobia diverges from the American norm. Klein's conclusion from a perusal of American history is: not much. The United States has never been especially liberal or democratic for non-whites, and Trump represents the last gasp of those in American life who would like to keep it that way.

It's likely to be their last gasp because, as Klein writes, ""if current demographic projections hold, we will be a majority-minority nation in less than 30 years."" Once that happens, the country's formerly white majority will have no choice but to reconcile itself to a changed demographic reality. And that will hopefully allow historians of the future to look back at our moment to conclude that what seemed like a potentially dire threat to liberal democracy in America during the Trump administration was merely ""the turbulence that has always accompanied racial progress in this country.""

It sounds reassuring. But is it true?

Don't bet on it.

Yes, the U.S. is on track to become at some point around 2045 a ""minority white"" nation — in the sense that if we lump every person who isn't white into a single demographic category of ""non-white,"" whites will be outnumbered. The problem is that no such politically homogeneous category of citizen exists in the real world. It's the creation of demographers and liberal data journalists eager to mollify their anxieties.

Such people convince themselves of its reality by making a habit of talking about how ""people of color"" are uniformly oppressed by hegemonic ""whiteness"" in the United States. But the truth is that people of Hispanic, African, West Indian, East Asian, South Asian, and Arab descent don't perceive themselves as (or vote as if they are) members of a unified bloc. They are discrete groups. Most of them do lean Democratic, but not uniformly, and they do so for disparate reasons rooted in the cultures they brought with them to this country and in their distinct histories since arriving. (That's true of white voters, too, of course.)

Now, as critics have pointed out, it's most likely misleading even to suggest that these ethnic categories will remain stable over the coming decades, given rising rates of intermarriage among the members of each group. But even if we assume for the sake of analysis that the categories remain intact, it's important to recognize that ""white"" is going to remain the plurality group for a very long time to come. In 2045, when the shift to ""minority white"" country is supposed to happen, whites will be 49.8 percent of the population, with Hispanics, at 24.6 percent, the next largest group at roughly half the size.

That's not the portrait of a country in which demographics are going to deliver liberals an automatic and permanent victory. It's the portrait of a country in which politics will continue as it always has, with different parties and politicians jostling for the support of a range of different groups.

Unless, that is, liberals can convince the non-white members of their current electoral coalition to begin thinking of themselves, first and foremost, as ""people of color"" united by their antipathy to, and in their oppression by, white America. If racism is defined, in part, by the tendency of whites to view everyone but themselves as ""not white,"" then this would be a form of counter-racism in which non-whites positively affirm as a politically potent identity what was once treated as a form of stigma.

The doubling down on identity politics among liberals since Donald Trump's election follows from something like this ambition to unify non-whites against the Republican Party and in favor of the Democrats.

That would be inadvisable in civic terms even if demographic trends over the next half century favored non-whites more convincingly than they do. As it is, liberals risk actively antagonizing (and hence galvanizing against them) what will remain for some significant time to come the single-largest demographic group in the United States.

Mr. Perez , a favorite with the more centrist wing of the party allied with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , won 235 votes to the 200 captured by Rep. Keith Ellison ( D ) of Minnesota , a favorite with progressives who was leading slightly in polls coming into Saturday , according to CNN . The son of Dominican immigrants , Perez will become the first Latino to hold the post .
The chair takes the lead role in the party ’ s organizing , messaging , and fundraising operations , and thus has substantial clout in redefining the Democrats ' identity and pitch to voters , following their shock loss in the presidential election .
The DNC chair election comes at a time when the Democrats enjoy as little political control as they have in nearly a century , having lost 20 percent of their Senate seats , 25 percent of their House seats , 45 percent of their governors , and over half of state legislatures since 2009 , according to the Associated Press . Several candidates , including Perez , campaigned on a promise to concentrate more on down-ballot races , as well as ramp up small-donor fundraising .
But one of the most crucial questions for Perez may be how to interpret national demographic trends and translate them into Democratic strategy – itself a test of Democrats ’ long-held notion that their future is assured by a natural-born coalition of minority and Millennial voters .
Some Democrats see more progressive white voters – ie the `` Bernie voters , '' who viewed Hillary Clinton ’ s candidacy with skepticism – as the part of the electorate that the next DNC chair needs to target . Demographic trends , they argue , tilt electoral dynamics in their favor , and away from the white working-class voters who came out in unexpected force for President Trump .
`` As Mrs. Clinton ’ s popular vote margin showed , there is still a new American majority made up of a meaningful minority of whites and an overwhelming majority of minorities , ” wrote Steve Phillips , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who has written about demographic shifts and US politics .
`` Not only is there little evidence that Democrats can do significantly better with those white working-class voters who are susceptible to messages laced with racism and sexism , but that sector of the electorate will continue to shrink in the coming years . Nearly half of all Democratic votes ( 46 percent ) were not white in 2016 , and over the next four years , 10 million more people of color will be added to the population , as compared with just 1.5 million whites , ” he wrote in a New York Times op-ed this month .
But others think these numbers obscure movement happening below the surface .
The problem with the notion that Democrats will be able to fall back on demographic changes , say Lanae Erickson Hatalsky and Jim Kessler of the centrist think tank Third Way , is threefold : the changes are concentrated largely in urban Democratic strongholds , voters cast ballots across parties more often than believed , and the rising proportion of voters who identify as liberal is offset by other factors , including a corresponding rise in conservative-identifying voters .
“ It is likely that this new path back to a majority will require winning more white voters , ” they wrote in a recent report . `` But more fundamentally , a new path to the majority will require targeting communications , policy ideas , and appeals based on values , beliefs , and experiences — not simply age or race . ''
Perez ’ s election to the post may come as a surprise to some who expected Mr. Ellison to prevail , partly as a concession to the progressive wing . Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I ) of Vermont , a backer of Ellison , had posed the choice as one between the “ failed status quo ” and a “ fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party , ” notes the Washington Post .

`` I ’ m worried , ” said Jerry Shriner , a DNC member from Idaho , in a pre-vote interview with the Hill . `` There are risks with every candidate , but [ with Ellison and Perez ] in particular … I think there will be people who pull back , '' he said .
`` But the way I look at it , we have four years to work on that , '' he added . `` Whatever problems either candidate might create in terms of divisiveness , we have four years to pull that together .

Nearly half of all Democratic votes (46 percent) were not white in 2016, and over the next four years, 10 million more people of color will be added to the population, as compared with just 1.5 million whites,” he wrote in a New York Times op-ed this month.

But others think these numbers obscure movement happening below the surface.

The problem with the notion that Democrats will be able to fall back on demographic changes, say Lanae Erickson Hatalsky and Jim Kessler of the centrist think tank Third Way, is threefold: the changes are concentrated largely in urban Democratic strongholds, voters cast ballots across parties more often than believed, and the rising proportion of voters who identify as liberal is offset by other factors, including a corresponding rise in conservative-identifying voters.

“It is likely that this new path back to a majority will require winning more white voters,” they wrote in a recent report. ""But more fundamentally, a new path to the majority will require targeting communications, policy ideas, and appeals based on values, beliefs, and experiences — not simply age or race.""

Perez’s election to the post may come as a surprise to some who expected Mr. Ellison to prevail, partly as a concession to the progressive wing. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont, a backer of Ellison, had posed the choice as one between the “failed status quo” and a “fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party,” notes the Washington Post.

""I’m worried,” said Jerry Shriner, a DNC member from Idaho, in a pre-vote interview with the Hill. ""There are risks with every candidate, but [with Ellison and Perez] in particular … I think there will be people who pull back,"" he said.

""But the way I look at it, we have four years to work on that,"" he added. ""Whatever problems either candidate might create in terms of divisiveness, we have four years to pull that together.""",www.csmonitor.com,center,RhRKSOpwihYAUVTf

Democrats in the House have quietly grumbled about Pelosi since suffering devastating losses on Election Day , but there is a growing number of members willing to go public on their party leaders .
The list of grievances — from the election losses , to routine procedures erupting into nasty fights — has shaken the confidence many Democrats hold in their leader . So while Pelosi was reelected unanimously by voice vote to the top House Democratic post on Tuesday during a closed-door party meeting — with no audible disagreement , according to a source in the room — the incoming minority leader is about to be in the worst position with her caucus since the end of their short-lived majority in 2010 .
“ They wiped the floor with us , so no , we ’ re not feeling good , ” said Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge , chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus . “ We think clearly there was a lack of a coherent and compelling message . We believe that certainly our leadership worked hard , but there obviously was something lacking because we lost so many seats . I want to see members who have a better handle on the caucus brought in , whether they be young or old . I want people who have a good pulse of what is going on in our caucus … people who are more inclusive . ”
Rank-and-file Democrats are complaining loudly that the party ’ s message operation failed during the election cycle . Members of the CBC are angry over the defeat of Nevada Rep. Steven Horsford . And nasty fights over ranking member spots have broken out all over the place — including another tug of war between Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer over the top Democratic post on the Energy and Commerce Committee .
A routine internal debate over proxy voting for the ranking member posts — it hasn ’ t been allowed in decades — turned into national news because Illinois Rep. Tammy Duckworth , a disabled war veteran expecting her first child soon , won ’ t be allowed to cast her vote since she can ’ t travel back to Capitol Hill . The vote has led to some bitter feelings on both sides of the dispute . And Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel is being pressed over whether he was totally honest with his colleagues over the electoral peril they faced .
The 74-year-old Pelosi ’ s hold on power seems secure , but buy-in from her conference is shaken .
“ When any party suffers two comprehensive midterm defeats , as we did , you ’ re going to have soul-searching and you ’ re going to have finger-pointing and I think that ’ s natural , ” added Rep. Gerry Connolly ( D-Va. ) “ I would hope that we will create a mechanism for rational analysis of what went wrong and why and what we can do to take correct measures to be successful in 2016 and beyond . ”
Connolly and other lawmakers had suggested that the next DCCC chairman be elected by rank-and-file members , instead of being handpicked by Pelosi and then approved by the full caucus . Pelosi picked Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico for the job on Monday . “ I definitely think that has some merit and should be looked at . I always believe there is benefit to be had about broadening the number of stakeholders , elected stakeholders , ” Connolly said .
When unveiling her pick on Monday , Pelosi emphasized Luján ’ s “ fresh energy and ideas . ”
“ [ Luján is ] a dynamic and forward-looking leader with fresh energy and ideas that House Democrats need for victory in 2016 , ” Pelosi said . “ He has [ a ] bold vision and determined leadership to deliver wins in difficult districts . ”
Most of the Democratic fingers are pointed at President Barack Obama and the White House , with lawmakers saying there was no way around the “ six-year itch ” that Obama faced midway through his second term .
A few Democrats — including some new members-elect such as Gwen Graham of Florida — are expected to vote against Pelosi on Tuesday , although the number of defections is still expected to be small . Pelosi has bristled at suggestions that it may be time for her to move on after a dozen years running the Democratic Caucus , dismissing questions about her age and ability .
Pelosi even told ███ that she might have thought about retiring if Democrats had won the House , but she needs to stay all the more because the party lost seats . That comment caused some eyes to roll in Democratic circles .
“ If we had lost 30 or 40 seats , rather than the dozen we lost , then [ Pelosi ] would have said she ’ s never leaving , ” joked one Democrat , speaking on condition of anonymity . “ If we keep losing seats , she ’ ll be here until she ’ s 90 . ”
There is clearly concern throughout the Democratic Caucus that the party ’ s agenda and message are not resonating with voters in order for Democrats to get back into power . Some members want to break loose from blindly following Obama ’ s lead on big policy fights and speak out more forcefully on core Democratic priorities . Others want more of a hand in shaping the agenda . While Pelosi and her allies appear to believe that Democrats need to just tinker with the leadership team and do a better job of turning out their base , that won ’ t cut it with many of their colleagues .
“ The president is the president ; we can ’ t control him . Good , bad or indifferent .

When was the last time the Democratic Caucus as a caucus — not individually — really talked about jobs ? For me , we don ’ t do that enough . ”
Other Democrats , though , believe it ’ s a mistake to adopt a more centrist message or to try to run away from Obama .

The disagreement over messaging and agenda is playing out at all levels of the House Democratic Caucus and will continue to do so for months to come .
Other than Pelosi , perhaps no one has felt more backlash from his colleagues than Israel , the outgoing DCCC chairman . Although some of the complaints about him may simply be veiled attempts to criticize Pelosi — Israel is very close to Pelosi , and she essentially ran the committee through him — Israel is having to defend himself in public and private .
The CBC has been highly critical over whether Horsford , a freshman , could have been saved by more DCCC cash or electoral help . Horsford was not on the DCCC ’ s “ Frontline ” program for its most vulnerable members , and there have been questions raised over whether he should have been . Democratic sources said Horsford turned down an offer to join the program .
You can ’ t be going out there and telling people that the sky is falling . ''
Israel — who met privately with Horsford last week — suggested there was nothing that could have been done to save him in a bad year for Democrats .
“ I will accept full responsibility for not doing all we should have , or for doing things we shouldn ’ t have , [ but ] this criticism is misplaced , ” Israel said . “ We had been talking to Steve [ Horsford ] for a very long time , knowing how tough that district was . I am not going to get into private conversations , but there was a consensus with his team and our team that he should not have Frontline status . ”
Israel added : “ When the Republicans signaled they were spending $ 1.1 million against him , we deployed massively for him , spent $ 700,000 for him , pulled staff out of other races for him . I met with him just this morning where he said , and reiterated , that the support the DCCC provided to him was invaluable and he had no criticism of it . For others who may not have been in the room during those conversations , they can say what they want to say . ”

Several Democratic lobbyists , who cut large contributions to the party committee and to candidates and lawmakers , said Pelosi and the DCCC in the 2016 cycle will have to make the case that they have a credible plan in place before they open their checkbooks again .
Some Democrats privately complained that Israel told rank-and-file lawmakers last week that he couldn ’ t tell them how bad things were across the country before the election , although Israel vehemently denied that accusation .
“ One of the functions of DCCC chair and leader is to be cheerleaders . You can ’ t be going out there and telling people that the sky is falling . It tends to hurt recruiting and fundraising . That ’ s what I said , ” Israel said .
But there is a clear feeling inside leadership that the DCCC is going to have to be more “ hands on ” with candidates if Democrats are going to be able to win tough districts in battleground states .
“ Now there is the case , and some might ask , could we have prepared candidates better ? ” Clyburn asked . “ We ’ re going to have to take a look at how we recruit , who we recruit , how we prepare candidates .

The New York Democrat held a conference call last Thursday to talk about the midterm results. Not everybody’s concerns have been quelled. Several Democratic lobbyists, who cut large contributions to the party committee and to candidates and lawmakers, said Pelosi and the DCCC in the 2016 cycle will have to make the case that they have a credible plan in place before they open their checkbooks again.

Some Democrats privately complained that Israel told rank-and-file lawmakers last week that he couldn’t tell them how bad things were across the country before the election, although Israel vehemently denied that accusation.

“One of the functions of DCCC chair and leader is to be cheerleaders. You can’t be going out there and telling people that the sky is falling. It tends to hurt recruiting and fundraising. That’s what I said,” Israel said.

But there is a clear feeling inside leadership that the DCCC is going to have to be more “hands on” with candidates if Democrats are going to be able to win tough districts in battleground states.

“Now there is the case, and some might ask, could we have prepared candidates better?” Clyburn asked. “We’re going to have to take a look at how we recruit, who we recruit, how we prepare candidates. I just think there’s a lot on that is crying out for us to do something about.”

Democratic National Committee officials on Saturday turned down Bernie Sanders' formal request for the ouster of “aggressive attack surrogates” for Hillary Clinton from key national convention committees.

The campaign announced earlier that it wanted to remove Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy as a co-chairman of the Platform Committee and former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank as head of the Rules Committee. Frank has sharply criticized Sanders’ positions on breaking up big banks and Malloy has criticized Sanders on guns.

“Governor Malloy and Mr. Frank have both been aggressive attack surrogates for the Clinton campaign,” Sanders campaign counsel Brad Deutsch wrote in a letter to the party’s Rules and Bylaws Committee. “Their criticisms of Sen. Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign.""

But committee co-chairs Jim Roosevelt and Lorraine Miller responded that his challenge ""fails to meet the criteria"" for their dismissal. It did not allege any violations in the conduct of their elections to their posts by the DNC executive committee in January, they wrote.

The Sanders campaign’s Friday letter to Democratic National Committee rules officials marks the latest turn in Sanders’ feud with party officials. It comes a week after Sanders said he would make sure Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida isn’t reappointed to her role as head of the DNC if he becomes president and he began fundraising for her primary opponent, Tim Canova.

Most members of the convention standing committees — rules, platform and credentials — are awarded to candidates based on the results of those primaries and caucuses. But under party rules, Wasserman Schultz recommended co-chairs and a slate of 25 at-large appointments per committee for approval by the party’s executive committee.

Herndon","jessica cheung Hello . austin mitchell Hello ! astead herndon Hey , how are you ? austin mitchell Buddy . astead herndon Yikes . What a day already . Um — austin mitchell Yeah , what do you mean when you say , “ What a day already “ ? astead herndon Well , we just reported that Elizabeth Warren is dropping out of the presidential race . We ’ re here in Boston outside of her house . Not in Boston , actually . Cambridge . Waiting for her to speak to a horde of media , both local and national . speaker 1 We have — speaker 2 I understand that , but I was here before you guys all jumped in front of me . speaker 1 Because we just found out we have to move .
From The New York Times , this is “ The Field. ” I ’ m Astead Herndon in Massachusetts .
[ cheering ] Around 12:30 on Thursday , Senator Elizabeth Warren came out of a side door of her house with her husband and her golden retriever and addressed the media . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) All right . So I announced this morning that I am suspending my campaign for president . I say this with a deep sense of gratitude .
It ’ s been two days since Super Tuesday , where Elizabeth Warren ’ s best finish was in third place , including in her home state of Massachusetts . That put her behind her campaign ’ s already lowered expectations and made a gathering like today feel almost inevitable .
She thanks her supporters and her staff and takes questions .
archived recording ( reporter ) Senator , will you be making an endorsement today ? We know that you spoke with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders yesterday . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Not today . Not today . I need some space around this .
And when it comes to why she has to drop out ?
archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) You know , I was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that there are two lanes , a progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the incumbent for , and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent for . And there ’ s no room for anyone else in this . I thought that wasn ’ t right , but evidently I was wrong . archived recording ( reporters ) Senator , why do you think —
archived recording ( reporter ) And I wonder what the message would be to the women and girls who feel like we ’ re left with two white men to decide between ? archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I know . One of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years . That ’ s going to be hard . archived recording ( reporters ) Senator , why do you think —
She gets emotional , but there are clearly things that she ’ s left unsaid . But when you ask her supporters who have come to the house to watch this speech , they go there .
warren supporter 1 Oh , I ’ m so sad . Yesterday , I so sad I couldn ’ t — I couldn ’ t move . warren supporter 2 I ’ m frustrated , I ’ m disappointed , and sad . warren supporter 3 I ’ m heartbroken that very clearly most qualified candidate is out of the race . warren supporter 4 Sadly , too many people in this country aren ’ t ready for a woman president , which is an unfortunate thing . warren supporter 5 Very disappointed , but I guess there ’ s never going to be a time for a woman . She ’ s my generation , and we ’ re not going to see it now . This was our — it ’ s not going to happen . toddler ( CRYING ) Grandma , Grandma , I wan na go home ! warren supporter 5 Maybe her generation . All right , we got ta go . Look at this little girl looking at the doggie . She likes the doggie .
Today , millions of voters across six states will cast their ballot for the two viable Democratic candidates left : Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders . What began as a contest with historic diversity , along racial and gender lines , has now come down to two men , 70 plus , both white . And as someone who covered senator Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren , and with Warren especially , who once led in national polling , I ’ m left to wonder how did we get here ? How did it end up this way ?
[ doorbell ringing ] astead herndon Wow . Oh , those are one of the fancy doorbells , where you can look at it with your phone . Hello , how are you ? lyn licciardello Hello , a party . astead herndon Hi , my name ’ s Astead . I ’ m a politics reporter at The Times . lyn licciardello Hi , nice to meet you . astead herndon It ’ s nice to meet you . lyn licciardello I ’ m Lyn . What did you say your name is ? astead herndon Astead . lyn licciardello Astead ? astead herndon Yes . jessica cheung I ’ m Jessica —
So the next day , me and producers Austin Mitchell and Jessica Cheung go to North Andover , Massachusetts .
austin mitchell Should we take our shoes off ? lyn licciardello Oh , you don ’ t have to . jessica cheung You sure ?
To meet with a pretty typical Warren supporter , Lyn Licciardello .
astead herndon I only have one sock on . lyn licciardello It ’ s fine . [ LAUGHTER ] jessica cheung You have what ? astead herndon I only have one sock on . [ laughter ] austin mitchell How does that happen ?
lyn licciardello Tommy , will you pour water , please ? tom licciardello Yes , I knew there was a role for me somewhere .
astead herndon What do you do ? lyn licciardello I am a nurse , but I teach exercise now . astead herndon Oh , very nice . Give me — what exercise ? lyn licciardello Oh , well , I teach a class that ’ s about the first half is aerobic , and then there ’ s some stretching and strength training . It ’ s about an hour class at the senior center in Lawrence . astead herndon Awesome . How long have you been in North Andover ? lyn licciardello Since 1949. astead herndon Hm . And when did you first notice Senator Warren ? lyn licciardello I noticed Senator Warren years ago . I think it was around 2012 . I happened to be reading the paper one morning . And I noticed that a congressman named Todd Akin had said a horrible thing about women and pregnancy , saying that if a woman were to get pregnant as a result of rape , then her body has a way of getting rid of that . archived recording ( todd akin ) It seems to me , first of all , from what I understand from doctors , that ’ s really rare . If it ’ s a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down . lyn licciardello And my eyes just flew open , and I said , oh my god , this man is in our Congress . I was flabbergasted , and I said to my husband , who is that woman ? There was a — at the same time , I was not happy with Scott Brown , who was our senator at the time . archived recording He doesn ’ t stand up for women ’ s reproductive rights and economic security . He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms . He had two opportunities — lyn licciardello And I said , who ’ s that woman that ’ s going to run against Scott Brown ? I heard that a woman is going to run against Scott Brown . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I ’ m Elizabeth Warren . I ’ m running for the United States Senate . And before you hear a bunch of ridiculous attack ads , I want to tell you who I am . Like a lot of you , I came up the hard way . lyn licciardello And I said , I have to do something to help her get elected . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) But Washington is still rigged for the big guys , and that ’ s got ta change . I ’ m Elizabeth Warren , and I approve this message , because I want Massachusetts families to have a level playing field .
And so Lyn becomes a volunteer for the Warren Senate campaign .
lyn licciardello I was always on board with Elizabeth right after that . astead herndon Why do you think you felt so drawn to Elizabeth Warren ? lyn licciardello Because in many ways , she ’ s me . She ’ s me . She has the same feelings that I have . She ’ s actually very close to my age . She has a wonderful way of kind of looking into your heart and mind . She ’ s interested in you . She ’ s interested in the people . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Hi , I ’ m Elizabeth Warren . It ’ s very nice to see you . speaker I ’ m going to vote for you . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Wonderful , say that again . Fabulous . We ’ re here for the chicken . [ LAUGHTER ] Good to see you . I like your shirt . Very handsome . lyn licciardello Elizabeth has that heart . And , she ’ s brilliant . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) And despite the odds , you elected the first woman senator to the state of Massachusetts . [ CHEERING ] astead herndon How did it feel ? I mean , she wins the race , obviously . How did that feel ? lyn licciardello Oh , my god . It was so exciting . I still can ’ t say that without crying . It was so exciting .
lyn licciardello Well , I was for Hillary . Hillary , I was very invested in having Hillary be president . She had all the qualifications . She was more qualified than anybody who ’ s ever been president , in my opinion . But because she was a woman , I knew it would be difficult . But I still thought she could win . astead herndon Did you know people or did you hear people say , I won ’ t vote for Clinton because she ’ s a woman ? lyn licciardello Not like that . But here ’ s what I did hear . I was talking to a woman who was kind of a stranger , but we were chatting . And we were talking about politics and about how we feel about certain things . So I guess it was like immigration , climate change and things like that . And this woman was on board with all of the Democratic ideals . And then I mentioned Hillary Clinton , and she said , “ Oh , I hate her. ” And I said , “ Really ? Because she ’ s the one who stands for all of these things that we ’ re talking about. ” “ No , no . I can ’ t stand her. ” I said , “ Well , why don ’ t you like her ? ” “ Oh , I have no idea. ” I said , “ Is it because she ’ s an aggressive woman ? Is she too aggressive ? Is she too loud ? Does she express herself too much ? ” And her reply was , “ No . I don ’ t know why. ” So like a minute later , I mentioned Elizabeth Warren . She said , “ Oh , I can ’ t stand her either. ” So I was like , “ She agrees with you about everything ! All the things that you ’ re saying you believe in , she is promoting. ” “ No , well , I can ’ t stand her. ” So , I know . I mean , I ’ ve been a woman my whole life . So I know very well that that is the reason . Even women will vote against women , because they ’ re women . archived recording ( joy behar ) There are people out there who have this idea that you ’ re not trustworthy , that they don ’ t like you for some reason . What is that about , in your opinion ? archived recording ( hillary clinton ) You know , Joy , obviously I ’ ve thought a lot about it , because I don ’ t like to hear it . archived recording ( joy behar ) Yeah . archived recording ( hillary clinton ) So I need to figure out what ’ s behind it . You know , I am perhaps a more serious person , a more reserved person than is in the public arena these days . So I think people then say , “ Well , she ’ s serious . She ’ s reserved . Can I really like her ? ” archived recording ( joy behar ) But what is inauthentic ? What ’ s inauthentic mean ? archived recording ( hillary clinton ) I don ’ t understand that . I don ’ t understand that . Because I ’ ve been pretty much the same person my entire life , for better or worse , right ? archived recording ( joy behar ) Mm-hm . lyn licciardello Clinton losing made a difference . Clinton losing did make it harder for me to think that a woman could win .
So this year , when Elizabeth Warren announces that she ’ s running , Lyn has mixed feelings .
lyn licciardello I love that people were getting to know her all across the country . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Hi . archived recording ( raelyn ) Hi , my name ’ s Raelyn . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Hi , Raelyn . archived recording ( raelyn ) I was wondering if there was ever a time in your life where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn ’ t accept you as much and how you dealt with that ? archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Yeah . My mother and I had very different views of how to build a future . She wanted me to marry well . And I really tried , and it just didn ’ t work out . But I also know it was the right thing to do . And sometimes , you just got ta do what ’ s right inside . You got ta take care of yourself first and do this . Give me a hug . [ APPLAUSE ] lyn licciardello And it was a pleasure for me to see that , although I was a little bit worried . archived recording 1 In the wake of her third place finish in Iowa and fourth place finish in New Hampshire , Warren said , “ My job is to persist. ” But persisting and winning are two very different things . archived recording 2 Senator Elizabeth Warren , she came in fifth place in South Carolina . archived recording 3 Elizabeth Warren trailing in fourth place in Nevada . archived recording 4 I think the biggest question that Elizabeth Warren has to answer is , where does she win ?
Lyn voted early in Massachusetts for Senator Warren . But in the days leading up to Super Tuesday , she ’ s questioning her vote and wondering if she did the right thing .
lyn licciardello But I didn ’ t feel — I didn ’ t feel bad that I had already voted for her at all , because like she said , vote with your heart . And she was my heart . jessica cheung Did you know anyone personally in your life who were for Warren and then jumped ship ? lyn licciardello Yes , my cousin Kathleen . astead herndon Raising her hand . kathleen lambert Yes , actually as soon as Buttigieg and Klobuchar backed Biden — and I was kind of waiting to see how it all shook out a little bit — I voted for Biden because we have to stop Sanders , in my opinion . But I would have voted for Warren , because I voted for Hillary .
As Kathleen is talking , Tom nods and raises his hand .
austin mitchell Yeah , did you raise your hand , too ? tom licciardello Me too . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , actually as the sole old white guy in the room , I , too , did vote for Biden , though I love Elizabeth Warren , and she would have made an extraordinarily wonderful president . astead herndon By the time Massachusetts was voting , if she looked more electable , if she was a front-runner , you all would have stuck with her ? tom licciardello Yeah , you bet . kathleen lambert Absolutely , yeah . astead herndon Did you see when she — obviously when she comes out and talks at her house , did you see that ? lyn licciardello Oh , yes . I was here in the living room . I was in my own living room listening to it , watching . And yeah , I cried through the whole thing . It ’ s heartbreaking . astead herndon Do you remember something she said that day that stuck with you or maybe caused you to feel that emotion ? lyn licciardello Well , one of the things was that , you know how she talked about the pinkie swear that she does with the little kids ? The first time I met her , which was way back when , before she was elected senator for the first time , she was doing that with little girls that were there . jessica cheung What is the pinkie swear ? What is she promising girls ? lyn licciardello She says that girls can be president . She gets right down to their level . She gets right down to their eye level and talks to the girls like that . astead herndon The race is now down to two guys , after starting with such a diverse field , gender ratio , all of that . How does it feel for it to be down to two men , when you had four women senators at the start , all of whom you liked ? lyn licciardello I know . It ’ s sick , isn ’ t it ? [ CHUCKLES ] You know , it was almost inevitable . I think people pan — not panicked , but I think that people are very , very concerned that we have to beat Trump . astead herndon But why does the feeling of “ need to beat Trump ” then translate to men ? So you ’ re saying , I think a lot of people are scared , I think a lot of people just want to beat Trump , and that ’ s why it came down to two men . What is necessarily male about those qualities ? lyn licciardello Because there are so many people in the country that just would not vote for a woman , like that woman that I was talking about before . And we really feel the need to prevail this time , especially . astead herndon So the idea that a woman candidate is a risk because of other people ’ s or the country ’ s sexism ? lyn licciardello Yes , that ’ s how I feel . It ’ s a terrible thing to have to feel , but I do feel that way . Right now . I don ’ t think it ’ s always going to be like that , but I think it ’ s the way it is right now .
jessica cheung All right . austin mitchell Thank you . You can go skiing now . lyn licciardello Oh , good . I ’ m sorry you can ’ t come with us . That was too bad . jessica cheung Tell us where you ’ re going . lyn licciardello Warren , Vermont . [ LAUGHS ] It ’ s very funny , because we have our ski place right next to our daughter and son-in-law in Warren , Vermont . And our son-in-law ’ s parents live in Warren , Rhode Island . laughter astead herndon A Warren household to the end . lyn licciardello Yes .
It ’ s one voter ’ s view that sexism is what consumed the Elizabeth Warren campaign . And certainly that ’ s one that ’ s popular among her most die-hard supporters . But I ’ m wondering , is this the view inside her own campaign ? Do they think that the barriers that gender placed on them were too big to overcome ? The same day we met with Lyn , we headed to the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston , to Elizabeth Warren ’ s campaign headquarters .
astead herndon It ’ s kind of like a warehousey building , nondescript , very on brand . There is a Dunkin ’ Donuts right across the street .
To meet with someone who ’ s worked for the Warren campaign from the start .
kristen orthman I ’ m Kristen Orthman , the communications director for Elizabeth Warren .
As communications director , Kristen ’ s in charge of trying to best translate the candidate to the rest of the country , particularly through the media . And over the course of this campaign , we got to know each other pretty well . Now that the campaign has ended , I ’ m wondering whether Kristen will speak more candidly about what went wrong and about what role gender specifically played in the campaign ’ s demise .
astead herndon Is there something different about planning communications and media for women politicians ? kristen orthman Yes . astead herndon [ LAUGHS ] Yeah , in what way ? kristen orthman I think that there can be more caution when you ’ re working for a woman , because you ’ re viewing things through the lens of much more of “ how will this be perceived ? ” And I think I ’ ve an appreciation for the challenges of the Clinton presidential campaign probably now than I did when I first started . astead herndon In what way ? kristen orthman I think that the fact that there were stories when Elizabeth first ran — there was an infamous one like the day she announced .
This is December 31 , 2018 , when Warren first announced her intentions to seek the presidency .
kristen orthman Talking about like , I think it was the likability factor , her versus Hillary . Because they were two women who ran for president , two white women who ran for president that had blond hair . I mean , I guess I ’ m not quite sure what else warranted necessarily that . astead herndon So when it becomes clear she ’ s running for president , how forefront of mind was gender and the need to define her on her own , outside of Clinton or whatever terms ? kristen orthman I think when you ’ re running for president , male , female , you have to be yourself . So what I was always , and what our team and her always wanted to make sure is , you are showing what you would hope is the truest version of yourself .
One of the critiques of the Clinton campaign , fair or not , was that many voters felt like they never really knew her authentic self , that there was a barrier between candidate and voter built up over all those years in the public eye . So Kristen and her team tried to go in the opposite direction . To distinguish Warren , both from Clinton but also from everyone else .
kristen orthman You know , she runs out on stage . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Hello , Indianola ! kristen orthman She dances . archived recording [ CHEERING ] kristen orthman She stays for hours for photos . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) So we just finished our event here in New York City , and I got a lot of notes and a [ INAUDIBLE ] . kristen orthman She is just like the compassionate and joyful person that I know behind the scenes , was the person that was on a town hall stage . Or the fighter that I ’ ve also seen behind the scenes , and that many people saw , whether in the hearing room or otherwise , was the person on the debate stage . There is a vulnerability that comes with that , being a female candidate versus being a male candidate . I always was thinking through the risks in that , because I just knew that the “ mistakes ” that — I ’ m using quotes , because I don ’ t always they were , but they were perceived as mistakes — that female candidates make . It ’ s like a higher bar .
But to her , these risks were necessary components of running an authentic campaign .
kristen orthman Let ’ s do the things that have now become like signatures , were signatures of the campaign . It ’ s like , well , OK , she ’ s running for president to say something and do something . So let ’ s start doing that . archived recording 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is leading the pack when it comes to policy proposals . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) So I ’ ve got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America . I ’ ve got a plan to put $ 800 billion new federal into our public schools . Student loan debt , I ’ ve got a plan for that . And corruption .
She became known as the “ I have a plan for that ” candidate .
kristen orthman The “ I have a plan for that ” just happened organically . Time Magazine put it on the cover , and that ’ s when it became more of a thing . I think it happened grassroots level before that . People start talking about it , because we were doing it . astead herndon There was like a whole meme section of like , Warren plan . kristen orthman Exactly , that ’ s what I mean . Yeah , exactly , exactly .
And by the end of last fall , Warren has crossed into front-runner status . She ’ s leading in some national polls . But this is also about the time that I noticed a shift in the race .
astead herndon The primary change from a contest to ideas , to one of just as obsession about who can win . Do you think that ’ s true ? kristen orthman I think the primary campaign has always been about who can win . astead herndon How does that impact the women , specifically , who are running ? kristen orthman I do think I need distance in order to fully formulate , but I don ’ t think there ’ s any question that electability was viewed through a lens that probably hurt the women candidates . Because there was a perception that , after 2016 , even though the female candidate got 3 million more votes , is a woman not electable ? And she has said before publicly that she would hear that from people in the early states . Like , “ I ’ m worried about who can beat Trump. ” But I don ’ t think all of a sudden in October it was like , “ Oh , let ’ s make this primary about who ’ s going to beat Donald Trump. ” That ’ s what it ’ s been .
I would largely agree . Certainly , electability has never been far from mind for most Democratic voters . But as more and more people tuned into the race , particularly around this time in the late fall , it shifted its tone . Policy ideas took a back seat to that electability question . And the candidates who had most clearly articulated their path to victory started to rise , while Elizabeth Warren started to fall . This coincided with rival candidates like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar increasingly casting Warren ’ s campaign as out of touch with the mainstream Democratic Party and a real general election risk . And so to respond to that scrutiny , the Warren campaign tries to reposition itself as a unity candidate , someone who can actually bring all sides together .
astead herndon There ’ s sometime during the unity candidate phase , where I did feel like it was different from the fight that we had heard before . kristen orthman Mm-hm . astead herndon How do you square those two versions that we did see just this year ? kristen orthman I mean , I think you can both — unity doesn ’ t mean not fighting . I never didn ’ t think she was herself . astead herndon Take us into debate prep , for instance . Like , are you sitting there thinking , “ We have to package a candidate , and there are concerns about how she ’ ll be perceived if she attacks too much or attacks too little. ” Like , how much is gender a concern as you are thinking about the big national combative moments ? kristen orthman Mm-hm . You know , I don ’ t want to make a big statement saying it ’ s easier for men to attack than women . I do think that there are probably greater consequences to a failed attack by a female than a failed attack by a male . Because obviously she had a debate performance a couple — two debates ago — where she doing some level of contrasts with Mayor Bloomgberg . laughter astead herndon Understatement of human history . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I ’ d like to talk about who we ’ re running against — a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians . And , no , I ’ m not talking about Donald Trump . I ’ m talking about Mayor Bloomberg . Democrats are not going to — kristen orthman She was really strong . She was tough , and she was dynamic . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another . This country has worked — kristen orthman They were contrasting with each other , and I think overall , it was agreed upon that she did well in that exchange .
But this came in Nevada , after two straight disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire .
astead herndon I mean , if we ’ re just going to take Nevada , I feel like that is a reason to ask why then and not previously ? Were you all in rooms saying , “ Well , we can ’ t attack yet “ ? One of things I remember from the second this campaign started was the way that supporters were so eager to see her cut down the Bidens and the Bernies and everyone else . It really didn ’ t get that payoff until Nevada . kristen orthman Mm-hm . astead herndon Why ? kristen orthman So I like reject the premise of your question , because I think that you can be both advocating for yourself and creating contrast in ways that are not — that don ’ t always need to be how it happened in Nevada . archived recording ( moderator ) Senator Warren , what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election ? archived recording [ LAUGHTER ] archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I disagreed . Bernie is my friend , and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie . But look — kristen orthman Now , some would say about — and this is what I heard frequently from reporters — “ Oh , you guys are doing subtle contrasts . People don ’ t get that . People don ’ t know that. ” I don ’ t necessarily agree with that . I think that you ’ re always looking at the bar of how do we balance advocating for yourself and your ideas versus contrasting with other people . jessica cheung You characterize Warren as contrasting with Bloomberg . kristen orthman Yes . jessica cheung Others might characterize that as she was attacking Bloomberg or going after Bloomberg . kristen orthman Yeah . jessica cheung And I wonder — yeah , I wonder if in your role , you ’ re choosing your words carefully , because you know that male politicians are treated differently or characterized differently than female politicians . kristen orthman I very specifically used the word “ contrast. ” So you are correct that I was specifically choosing those words . That was your question , right ? Yeah . astead herndon There is a prevailing view from Warren supporters that gender was the foremost reason that she wasn ’ t successful in this race . Do you share that feeling ? kristen orthman You think that ’ s a prevailing view ? astead herndon Yeah , definitely . kristen orthman I just think I probably need more time to think about it . And I ’ m not trying to not answer your question . I think that there were — what she said yesterday around , like , there were basically two ideological , I think she called them poles . We could call them lanes . That ’ s not necessarily genderized . That is an ideological reason . And then I think electability , the idea of electability , was the other reason . Now , the idea of electability through the eyes of , “ can a woman win “ ? Certainly , that ’ s gender . And I would add that it wasn ’ t just “ can a woman win ? ” It was , can a non-white or non-male candidate win ? astead herndon For that last point , it seems as if , then , this kind of place that we ’ ve ended , with two people on the ideological poles , both of them being white males , was that inevitable ? kristen orthman I mean , maybe . I don ’ t know .
astead herndon Yeah , we ’ ll see you later . jessica cheung Bye , we ’ ll see you later . astead herndon It ’ s so hard to get people — I think this is true . I mean , particularly being a male reporter asking women about sexism , you need people to — like , oh , were you thinking about this , then ? But that ’ s not really how biases work , right ? Like , does she say “ contrast ” and not “ attack ” because of sexism ? Maybe . But it ’ s so deeply pervasive that it ’ s not something you actively think about as you ’ re doing it . And I feel like that makes sometimes the reporting challenge difficult , because you ’ re asking these candidates , like , wasn ’ t that sexist ? Wasn ’ t that racist ? Wasn ’ t that blah , blah , blah . And it ’ s like , maybe ? I think there were a lot of challenges in the race , and ideology was one , name recognition is one , fund-raising is one , and sexism and gender pervades all of those things . And does it define all of those things ? Maybe it informs all of those things is a better way to put it , but you know , how do you now ? archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Gender in this race , you know that is the trap question for every woman . If you say , yeah , there was sexism in this race , everyone says “ whiner. ” And if you say , no , there was no sexism , about a bazillion women think , what planet do you live on ? I promise you this . I will have a lot more to say on that subject later on . archived recording Senator , advice to your supporters right now looking for a candidate . What is your advice to them ?","jessica cheung Hello. austin mitchell Hello! astead herndon Hey, how are you? austin mitchell Buddy. astead herndon Yikes. What a day already. Um — austin mitchell Yeah, what do you mean when you say, “What a day already“? astead herndon Well, we just reported that Elizabeth Warren is dropping out of the presidential race. We’re here in Boston outside of her house. Not in Boston, actually. Cambridge. Waiting for her to speak to a horde of media, both local and national. speaker 1 We have — speaker 2 I understand that, but I was here before you guys all jumped in front of me. speaker 1 Because we just found out we have to move.

astead herndon

From The New York Times, this is “The Field.” I’m Astead Herndon in Massachusetts.

[cheering] Around 12:30 on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren came out of a side door of her house with her husband and her golden retriever and addressed the media. archived recording (elizabeth warren) All right. So I announced this morning that I am suspending my campaign for president. I say this with a deep sense of gratitude.

astead herndon

It’s been two days since Super Tuesday, where Elizabeth Warren’s best finish was in third place, including in her home state of Massachusetts. That put her behind her campaign’s already lowered expectations and made a gathering like today feel almost inevitable.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) For every single person —

astead herndon

She thanks her supporters and her staff and takes questions.

archived recording (reporter) Senator, will you be making an endorsement today? We know that you spoke with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders yesterday. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Not today. Not today. I need some space around this.

astead herndon

And when it comes to why she has to drop out?

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, I was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that there are two lanes, a progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the incumbent for, and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent for. And there’s no room for anyone else in this. I thought that wasn’t right, but evidently I was wrong. archived recording (reporters) Senator, why do you think —

astead herndon

And on the question of gender?

archived recording (reporter) And I wonder what the message would be to the women and girls who feel like we’re left with two white men to decide between? archived recording (elizabeth warren) I know. One of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. That’s going to be hard. archived recording (reporters) Senator, why do you think —

astead herndon

She gets emotional, but there are clearly things that she’s left unsaid. But when you ask her supporters who have come to the house to watch this speech, they go there.

warren supporter 1 Oh, I’m so sad. Yesterday, I so sad I couldn’t — I couldn’t move. warren supporter 2 I’m frustrated, I’m disappointed, and sad. warren supporter 3 I’m heartbroken that very clearly most qualified candidate is out of the race. warren supporter 4 Sadly, too many people in this country aren’t ready for a woman president, which is an unfortunate thing. warren supporter 5 Very disappointed, but I guess there’s never going to be a time for a woman. She’s my generation, and we’re not going to see it now. This was our — it’s not going to happen. toddler (CRYING) Grandma, Grandma, I wanna go home! warren supporter 5 Maybe her generation. All right, we gotta go. Look at this little girl looking at the doggie. She likes the doggie.

astead herndon

Today, millions of voters across six states will cast their ballot for the two viable Democratic candidates left: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. What began as a contest with historic diversity, along racial and gender lines, has now come down to two men, 70 plus, both white. And as someone who covered senator Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, and with Warren especially, who once led in national polling, I’m left to wonder how did we get here? How did it end up this way?

[doorbell ringing] astead herndon Wow. Oh, those are one of the fancy doorbells, where you can look at it with your phone. Hello, how are you? lyn licciardello Hello, a party. astead herndon Hi, my name’s Astead. I’m a politics reporter at The Times. lyn licciardello Hi, nice to meet you. astead herndon It’s nice to meet you. lyn licciardello I’m Lyn. What did you say your name is? astead herndon Astead. lyn licciardello Astead? astead herndon Yes. jessica cheung I’m Jessica —

astead herndon

So the next day, me and producers Austin Mitchell and Jessica Cheung go to North Andover, Massachusetts.

austin mitchell Should we take our shoes off? lyn licciardello Oh, you don’t have to. jessica cheung You sure?

astead herndon

To meet with a pretty typical Warren supporter, Lyn Licciardello.

astead herndon I only have one sock on. lyn licciardello It’s fine. [LAUGHTER] jessica cheung You have what? astead herndon I only have one sock on. [laughter] austin mitchell How does that happen?

astead herndon

Her husband Tom is there, too.

lyn licciardello Tommy, will you pour water, please? tom licciardello Yes, I knew there was a role for me somewhere.

astead herndon

And her cousin Kathleen.

kathleen lambert Let me take your coats.

astead herndon

And we all sit down in their living room.

astead herndon What do you do? lyn licciardello I am a nurse, but I teach exercise now. astead herndon Oh, very nice. Give me — what exercise? lyn licciardello Oh, well, I teach a class that’s about the first half is aerobic, and then there’s some stretching and strength training. It’s about an hour class at the senior center in Lawrence. astead herndon Awesome. How long have you been in North Andover? lyn licciardello Since 1949. astead herndon Hm. And when did you first notice Senator Warren? lyn licciardello I noticed Senator Warren years ago. I think it was around 2012. I happened to be reading the paper one morning. And I noticed that a congressman named Todd Akin had said a horrible thing about women and pregnancy, saying that if a woman were to get pregnant as a result of rape, then her body has a way of getting rid of that. archived recording (todd akin) It seems to me, first of all, from what I understand from doctors, that’s really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. lyn licciardello And my eyes just flew open, and I said, oh my god, this man is in our Congress. I was flabbergasted, and I said to my husband, who is that woman? There was a — at the same time, I was not happy with Scott Brown, who was our senator at the time. archived recording He doesn’t stand up for women’s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms. He had two opportunities — lyn licciardello And I said, who’s that woman that’s going to run against Scott Brown? I heard that a woman is going to run against Scott Brown. archived recording (elizabeth warren) I’m Elizabeth Warren. I’m running for the United States Senate. And before you hear a bunch of ridiculous attack ads, I want to tell you who I am. Like a lot of you, I came up the hard way. lyn licciardello And I said, I have to do something to help her get elected. archived recording (elizabeth warren) But Washington is still rigged for the big guys, and that’s gotta change. I’m Elizabeth Warren, and I approve this message, because I want Massachusetts families to have a level playing field.

astead herndon

And so Lyn becomes a volunteer for the Warren Senate campaign.

lyn licciardello I was always on board with Elizabeth right after that. astead herndon Why do you think you felt so drawn to Elizabeth Warren? lyn licciardello Because in many ways, she’s me. She’s me. She has the same feelings that I have. She’s actually very close to my age. She has a wonderful way of kind of looking into your heart and mind. She’s interested in you. She’s interested in the people. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Hi, I’m Elizabeth Warren. It’s very nice to see you. speaker I’m going to vote for you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Wonderful, say that again. Fabulous. We’re here for the chicken. [LAUGHTER] Good to see you. I like your shirt. Very handsome. lyn licciardello Elizabeth has that heart. And, she’s brilliant. archived recording (elizabeth warren) And despite the odds, you elected the first woman senator to the state of Massachusetts. [CHEERING] astead herndon How did it feel? I mean, she wins the race, obviously. How did that feel? lyn licciardello Oh, my god. It was so exciting. I still can’t say that without crying. It was so exciting.

astead herndon

So then, in 2016.

lyn licciardello Well, I was for Hillary. Hillary, I was very invested in having Hillary be president. She had all the qualifications. She was more qualified than anybody who’s ever been president, in my opinion. But because she was a woman, I knew it would be difficult. But I still thought she could win. astead herndon Did you know people or did you hear people say, I won’t vote for Clinton because she’s a woman? lyn licciardello Not like that. But here’s what I did hear. I was talking to a woman who was kind of a stranger, but we were chatting. And we were talking about politics and about how we feel about certain things. So I guess it was like immigration, climate change and things like that. And this woman was on board with all of the Democratic ideals. And then I mentioned Hillary Clinton, and she said, “Oh, I hate her.” And I said, “Really? Because she’s the one who stands for all of these things that we’re talking about.” “No, no. I can’t stand her.” I said, “Well, why don’t you like her?” “Oh, I have no idea.” I said, “Is it because she’s an aggressive woman? Is she too aggressive? Is she too loud? Does she express herself too much?” And her reply was, “No. I don’t know why.” So like a minute later, I mentioned Elizabeth Warren. She said, “Oh, I can’t stand her either.” So I was like, “She agrees with you about everything! All the things that you’re saying you believe in, she is promoting.” “No, well, I can’t stand her.” So, I know. I mean, I’ve been a woman my whole life. So I know very well that that is the reason. Even women will vote against women, because they’re women. archived recording (joy behar) There are people out there who have this idea that you’re not trustworthy, that they don’t like you for some reason. What is that about, in your opinion? archived recording (hillary clinton) You know, Joy, obviously I’ve thought a lot about it, because I don’t like to hear it. archived recording (joy behar) Yeah. archived recording (hillary clinton) So I need to figure out what’s behind it. You know, I am perhaps a more serious person, a more reserved person than is in the public arena these days. So I think people then say, “Well, she’s serious. She’s reserved. Can I really like her?” archived recording (joy behar) But what is inauthentic? What’s inauthentic mean? archived recording (hillary clinton) I don’t understand that. I don’t understand that. Because I’ve been pretty much the same person my entire life, for better or worse, right? archived recording (joy behar) Mm-hm. lyn licciardello Clinton losing made a difference. Clinton losing did make it harder for me to think that a woman could win.

astead herndon

So this year, when Elizabeth Warren announces that she’s running, Lyn has mixed feelings.

lyn licciardello I love that people were getting to know her all across the country. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Hi. archived recording (raelyn) Hi, my name’s Raelyn. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Hi, Raelyn. archived recording (raelyn) I was wondering if there was ever a time in your life where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn’t accept you as much and how you dealt with that? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Yeah. My mother and I had very different views of how to build a future. She wanted me to marry well. And I really tried, and it just didn’t work out. But I also know it was the right thing to do. And sometimes, you just gotta do what’s right inside. You gotta take care of yourself first and do this. Give me a hug. [APPLAUSE] lyn licciardello And it was a pleasure for me to see that, although I was a little bit worried. archived recording 1 In the wake of her third place finish in Iowa and fourth place finish in New Hampshire, Warren said, “My job is to persist.” But persisting and winning are two very different things. archived recording 2 Senator Elizabeth Warren, she came in fifth place in South Carolina. archived recording 3 Elizabeth Warren trailing in fourth place in Nevada. archived recording 4 I think the biggest question that Elizabeth Warren has to answer is, where does she win?

astead herndon

Lyn voted early in Massachusetts for Senator Warren. But in the days leading up to Super Tuesday, she’s questioning her vote and wondering if she did the right thing.

lyn licciardello But I didn’t feel — I didn’t feel bad that I had already voted for her at all, because like she said, vote with your heart. And she was my heart. jessica cheung Did you know anyone personally in your life who were for Warren and then jumped ship? lyn licciardello Yes, my cousin Kathleen. astead herndon Raising her hand. kathleen lambert Yes, actually as soon as Buttigieg and Klobuchar backed Biden — and I was kind of waiting to see how it all shook out a little bit — I voted for Biden because we have to stop Sanders, in my opinion. But I would have voted for Warren, because I voted for Hillary.

astead herndon

As Kathleen is talking, Tom nods and raises his hand.

austin mitchell Yeah, did you raise your hand, too? tom licciardello Me too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually as the sole old white guy in the room, I, too, did vote for Biden, though I love Elizabeth Warren, and she would have made an extraordinarily wonderful president. astead herndon By the time Massachusetts was voting, if she looked more electable, if she was a front-runner, you all would have stuck with her? tom licciardello Yeah, you bet. kathleen lambert Absolutely, yeah. astead herndon Did you see when she — obviously when she comes out and talks at her house, did you see that? lyn licciardello Oh, yes. I was here in the living room. I was in my own living room listening to it, watching. And yeah, I cried through the whole thing. It’s heartbreaking. astead herndon Do you remember something she said that day that stuck with you or maybe caused you to feel that emotion? lyn licciardello Well, one of the things was that, you know how she talked about the pinkie swear that she does with the little kids? The first time I met her, which was way back when, before she was elected senator for the first time, she was doing that with little girls that were there. jessica cheung What is the pinkie swear? What is she promising girls? lyn licciardello She says that girls can be president. She gets right down to their level. She gets right down to their eye level and talks to the girls like that. astead herndon The race is now down to two guys, after starting with such a diverse field, gender ratio, all of that. How does it feel for it to be down to two men, when you had four women senators at the start, all of whom you liked? lyn licciardello I know. It’s sick, isn’t it? [CHUCKLES] You know, it was almost inevitable. I think people pan — not panicked, but I think that people are very, very concerned that we have to beat Trump. astead herndon But why does the feeling of “need to beat Trump” then translate to men? So you’re saying, I think a lot of people are scared, I think a lot of people just want to beat Trump, and that’s why it came down to two men. What is necessarily male about those qualities? lyn licciardello Because there are so many people in the country that just would not vote for a woman, like that woman that I was talking about before. And we really feel the need to prevail this time, especially. astead herndon So the idea that a woman candidate is a risk because of other people’s or the country’s sexism? lyn licciardello Yes, that’s how I feel. It’s a terrible thing to have to feel, but I do feel that way. Right now. I don’t think it’s always going to be like that, but I think it’s the way it is right now.

[music]

jessica cheung All right. austin mitchell Thank you. You can go skiing now. lyn licciardello Oh, good. I’m sorry you can’t come with us. That was too bad. jessica cheung Tell us where you’re going. lyn licciardello Warren, Vermont. [LAUGHS] It’s very funny, because we have our ski place right next to our daughter and son-in-law in Warren, Vermont. And our son-in-law’s parents live in Warren, Rhode Island. laughter astead herndon A Warren household to the end. lyn licciardello Yes.

astead herndon

It’s one voter’s view that sexism is what consumed the Elizabeth Warren campaign. And certainly that’s one that’s popular among her most die-hard supporters. But I’m wondering, is this the view inside her own campaign? Do they think that the barriers that gender placed on them were too big to overcome? The same day we met with Lyn, we headed to the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, to Elizabeth Warren’s campaign headquarters.

astead herndon It’s kind of like a warehousey building, nondescript, very on brand. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts right across the street.

astead herndon

To meet with someone who’s worked for the Warren campaign from the start.

kristen orthman I’m Kristen Orthman, the communications director for Elizabeth Warren.

astead herndon

As communications director, Kristen’s in charge of trying to best translate the candidate to the rest of the country, particularly through the media. And over the course of this campaign, we got to know each other pretty well. Now that the campaign has ended, I’m wondering whether Kristen will speak more candidly about what went wrong and about what role gender specifically played in the campaign’s demise.

astead herndon Is there something different about planning communications and media for women politicians? kristen orthman Yes. astead herndon [LAUGHS] Yeah, in what way? kristen orthman I think that there can be more caution when you’re working for a woman, because you’re viewing things through the lens of much more of “how will this be perceived?” And I think I’ve an appreciation for the challenges of the Clinton presidential campaign probably now than I did when I first started. astead herndon In what way? kristen orthman I think that the fact that there were stories when Elizabeth first ran — there was an infamous one like the day she announced.

astead herndon

This is December 31, 2018, when Warren first announced her intentions to seek the presidency.

kristen orthman Talking about like, I think it was the likability factor, her versus Hillary. Because they were two women who ran for president, two white women who ran for president that had blond hair. I mean, I guess I’m not quite sure what else warranted necessarily that. astead herndon So when it becomes clear she’s running for president, how forefront of mind was gender and the need to define her on her own, outside of Clinton or whatever terms? kristen orthman I think when you’re running for president, male, female, you have to be yourself. So what I was always, and what our team and her always wanted to make sure is, you are showing what you would hope is the truest version of yourself.

astead herndon

One of the critiques of the Clinton campaign, fair or not, was that many voters felt like they never really knew her authentic self, that there was a barrier between candidate and voter built up over all those years in the public eye. So Kristen and her team tried to go in the opposite direction. To distinguish Warren, both from Clinton but also from everyone else.

kristen orthman You know, she runs out on stage. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Hello, Indianola! kristen orthman She dances. archived recording [CHEERING] kristen orthman She stays for hours for photos. archived recording (elizabeth warren) So we just finished our event here in New York City, and I got a lot of notes and a [INAUDIBLE]. kristen orthman She is just like the compassionate and joyful person that I know behind the scenes, was the person that was on a town hall stage. Or the fighter that I’ve also seen behind the scenes, and that many people saw, whether in the hearing room or otherwise, was the person on the debate stage. There is a vulnerability that comes with that, being a female candidate versus being a male candidate. I always was thinking through the risks in that, because I just knew that the “mistakes” that — I’m using quotes, because I don’t always they were, but they were perceived as mistakes — that female candidates make. It’s like a higher bar.

astead herndon

But to her, these risks were necessary components of running an authentic campaign.

kristen orthman Let’s do the things that have now become like signatures, were signatures of the campaign. It’s like, well, OK, she’s running for president to say something and do something. So let’s start doing that. archived recording 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is leading the pack when it comes to policy proposals. archived recording (elizabeth warren) So I’ve got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America. I’ve got a plan to put $800 billion new federal into our public schools. Student loan debt, I’ve got a plan for that. And corruption.

astead herndon

She became known as the “I have a plan for that” candidate.

kristen orthman The “I have a plan for that” just happened organically. Time Magazine put it on the cover, and that’s when it became more of a thing. I think it happened grassroots level before that. People start talking about it, because we were doing it. astead herndon There was like a whole meme section of like, Warren plan. kristen orthman Exactly, that’s what I mean. Yeah, exactly, exactly.

astead herndon

And by the end of last fall, Warren has crossed into front-runner status. She’s leading in some national polls. But this is also about the time that I noticed a shift in the race.

astead herndon The primary change from a contest to ideas, to one of just as obsession about who can win. Do you think that’s true? kristen orthman I think the primary campaign has always been about who can win. astead herndon How does that impact the women, specifically, who are running? kristen orthman I do think I need distance in order to fully formulate, but I don’t think there’s any question that electability was viewed through a lens that probably hurt the women candidates. Because there was a perception that, after 2016, even though the female candidate got 3 million more votes, is a woman not electable? And she has said before publicly that she would hear that from people in the early states. Like, “I’m worried about who can beat Trump.” But I don’t think all of a sudden in October it was like, “Oh, let’s make this primary about who’s going to beat Donald Trump.” That’s what it’s been.

astead herndon

I would largely agree. Certainly, electability has never been far from mind for most Democratic voters. But as more and more people tuned into the race, particularly around this time in the late fall, it shifted its tone. Policy ideas took a back seat to that electability question. And the candidates who had most clearly articulated their path to victory started to rise, while Elizabeth Warren started to fall. This coincided with rival candidates like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar increasingly casting Warren’s campaign as out of touch with the mainstream Democratic Party and a real general election risk. And so to respond to that scrutiny, the Warren campaign tries to reposition itself as a unity candidate, someone who can actually bring all sides together.

astead herndon There’s sometime during the unity candidate phase, where I did feel like it was different from the fight that we had heard before. kristen orthman Mm-hm. astead herndon How do you square those two versions that we did see just this year? kristen orthman I mean, I think you can both — unity doesn’t mean not fighting. I never didn’t think she was herself. astead herndon Take us into debate prep, for instance. Like, are you sitting there thinking, “We have to package a candidate, and there are concerns about how she’ll be perceived if she attacks too much or attacks too little.” Like, how much is gender a concern as you are thinking about the big national combative moments? kristen orthman Mm-hm. You know, I don’t want to make a big statement saying it’s easier for men to attack than women. I do think that there are probably greater consequences to a failed attack by a female than a failed attack by a male. Because obviously she had a debate performance a couple — two debates ago — where she doing some level of contrasts with Mayor Bloomgberg. laughter astead herndon Understatement of human history. archived recording (elizabeth warren) I’d like to talk about who we’re running against — a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And, no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump. I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to — kristen orthman She was really strong. She was tough, and she was dynamic. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. This country has worked — kristen orthman They were contrasting with each other, and I think overall, it was agreed upon that she did well in that exchange.

astead herndon

But this came in Nevada, after two straight disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire.

astead herndon I mean, if we’re just going to take Nevada, I feel like that is a reason to ask why then and not previously? Were you all in rooms saying, “Well, we can’t attack yet“? One of things I remember from the second this campaign started was the way that supporters were so eager to see her cut down the Bidens and the Bernies and everyone else. It really didn’t get that payoff until Nevada. kristen orthman Mm-hm. astead herndon Why? kristen orthman So I like reject the premise of your question, because I think that you can be both advocating for yourself and creating contrast in ways that are not — that don’t always need to be how it happened in Nevada. archived recording (moderator) Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election? archived recording [LAUGHTER] archived recording (elizabeth warren) I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look — kristen orthman Now, some would say about — and this is what I heard frequently from reporters — “Oh, you guys are doing subtle contrasts. People don’t get that. People don’t know that.” I don’t necessarily agree with that. I think that you’re always looking at the bar of how do we balance advocating for yourself and your ideas versus contrasting with other people. jessica cheung You characterize Warren as contrasting with Bloomberg. kristen orthman Yes. jessica cheung Others might characterize that as she was attacking Bloomberg or going after Bloomberg. kristen orthman Yeah. jessica cheung And I wonder — yeah, I wonder if in your role, you’re choosing your words carefully, because you know that male politicians are treated differently or characterized differently than female politicians. kristen orthman I very specifically used the word “contrast.” So you are correct that I was specifically choosing those words. That was your question, right? Yeah. astead herndon There is a prevailing view from Warren supporters that gender was the foremost reason that she wasn’t successful in this race. Do you share that feeling? kristen orthman You think that’s a prevailing view? astead herndon Yeah, definitely. kristen orthman I just think I probably need more time to think about it. And I’m not trying to not answer your question. I think that there were — what she said yesterday around, like, there were basically two ideological, I think she called them poles. We could call them lanes. That’s not necessarily genderized. That is an ideological reason. And then I think electability, the idea of electability, was the other reason. Now, the idea of electability through the eyes of, “can a woman win“? Certainly, that’s gender. And I would add that it wasn’t just “can a woman win?” It was, can a non-white or non-male candidate win? astead herndon For that last point, it seems as if, then, this kind of place that we’ve ended, with two people on the ideological poles, both of them being white males, was that inevitable? kristen orthman I mean, maybe. I don’t know.

[music]

astead herndon Yeah, we’ll see you later. jessica cheung Bye, we’ll see you later. astead herndon It’s so hard to get people — I think this is true. I mean, particularly being a male reporter asking women about sexism, you need people to — like, oh, were you thinking about this, then? But that’s not really how biases work, right? Like, does she say “contrast” and not “attack” because of sexism? Maybe. But it’s so deeply pervasive that it’s not something you actively think about as you’re doing it. And I feel like that makes sometimes the reporting challenge difficult, because you’re asking these candidates, like, wasn’t that sexist? Wasn’t that racist? Wasn’t that blah, blah, blah. And it’s like, maybe? I think there were a lot of challenges in the race, and ideology was one, name recognition is one, fund-raising is one, and sexism and gender pervades all of those things. And does it define all of those things? Maybe it informs all of those things is a better way to put it, but you know, how do you now? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Gender in this race, you know that is the trap question for every woman. If you say, yeah, there was sexism in this race, everyone says “whiner.” And if you say, no, there was no sexism, about a bazillion women think, what planet do you live on? I promise you this. I will have a lot more to say on that subject later on. archived recording Senator, advice to your supporters right now looking for a candidate. What is your advice to them?

It won’t have a format, but it’s going to have music. It will have texture. It will have threads through it that are writing. There will be prose.’ He added, ‘It will have a patina style and wit to it. It will be nice.’”

Story Continued Below

Though several Democratic senators told POLITICO they were offended by the missive authored by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), none of them said it would cause them to drop their support for bills to impose new sanctions on Iran or give Congress review power over a nuclear deal.

That presents another complication for the administration ahead of a rough deadline of March 24 to reach a nuclear agreement with the country.

“The letter’s incredibly unfortunate and inappropriate,” said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a centrist Democrat who voted for the sanctions bill in committee and is a sponsor of the congressional approval legislation. “That doesn’t diminish my support for the legislation that we introduced.”

The president’s challenge in Congress on the issue isn’t limited to the 47 Republican senators who signed last week’s missive arguing that a nuclear agreement could be revoked by the next U.S. president. In a letter released Saturday, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough implored Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) not to push for a vote on his bill that would give Congress 60 days to reject or approve of any deal.

McDonough argued that Corker’s measure, which has nearly a dozen Democratic supporters, “goes well beyond ensuring that Congress has a role to play in any deal with Iran.” And he asked Corker, who’s sought to maintain a cordial relationship with the White House, to let the administration finish its negotiations with Iran, indicating it may take until the end of June. A framework is expected by the end of this month.

Corker shrugged off the request in response. And in an interview late last week, he said he hasn’t lost the support of any Democrats despite the turbulent atmosphere surrounding Iran politics.

“Let a couple days go by. We think there’s going to be really ignited momentum,” Corker, who did not sign the Cotton letter, said on Thursday. “Nobody’s dropping out. We’ve had reaffirmed commitment” from Democrats.

Indeed, a day after the controversy over Cotton’s letter erupted, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado co-sponsored Corker’s congressional review bill, the 11th Democrat to signal support.

Though the White House has seized on the GOP’s “open letter to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran” in an effort to shift the politics of the nuclear negotiations in its favor on Capitol Hill, there’s no evidence it’s working so far. Nearly all of the 54 Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats in the Senate remain at odds with the president on the issue.

And as it did , they started to move then they started to move to the Republican party , making Louisiana much more like the rest of the South. ” Pearson Cross : “ So now you are starting to see a Democratic Party in Louisiana that is majority black and is starting to be majority black and is starting to be very , very less conservative than the Republican party , which is now almost entirely white and is very , very conservative .

I know that a lot of the Republicans are very conservative , and they believe that we need less government involvement . But you also need to make sure that you have jobs and opportunity . You want to have a safe place to live , which means creating real opportunities for the people that live in areas that may be impoverished . Which means delivering on economic development opportunities that are going to provide real jobs . And Mary has done that .

And I think for folks in that community, folks in New Orleans, she became part of that larger legacy.” Voter Interview NOLA C: “We know what Mary Landrieu can do. She has proven herself. She has been there for us. She has been there with us. She walks hand in hand with us. She cried with us. ‘Cause, you know, we done been through some serious times in New Orleans.” Mary Landrieu, press availability after voting: “I have now worked with three presidents, four majority leaders and six governors. I have worked with presidents that are Republicans and Democrats.” Voter Interview NOLA A: “I think of her as being a very moderate Democrat. She isn’t as progressive as I’d like her to be. On issues of the environment. So find it very baffling that there is so much opposition to her, given that she has been so friendly to the oil industry.” Act II: Bill Cassidy, and Louisiana’s Changing Politics NAT//Crowd shouting: “Bill, Bill, Bill... Bill Cassidy, on election night: “Woah!” MOS 1: “I decided to vote for Dr. Cassidy, because he is a Republican. I felt like Cassidy was in Congress. He was a representative. Move him over for a term or two in the Senate. Maybe we will get some change.” MOS 2: “Hard work. Character. You know, all those kind of things. Traditional values.” MOS 3: “Although I am an independent, I find his fiscal policies in line with mine. I am not too crazy about his social policies, but I am willing to work with him.” Pearson Cross: “As a Congressman Bill Cassidy hasn’t been around that long. His record has not been as conservative as it might be.” TK: Cassidy Campaigning, soundbite: TK Pearson Cross: “People have said about his past that he gave money to Senator Landrieu’s campaign in the past, which of course he did. That he authored his own version of the affordable care act, which could be argued. But in this election climate he has run as a solidly conservative Southern state Republican and made it very clear that he plans to govern that way if elected.” TK: Cassidy campaigning, soundbite: TK Jeremy Alford: “The Republicans did a very good job of crafting a race that is a referendum on Barack Obama. That left Bill Cassidy to tie Mary Landrieu to Barack Obama through things like the Affordable Care Act.” Bill Cassidy, during media-availability prior to voting: “I think we will have more than enough time to ask Senator Landrieu why she supports President Obama 97 percent of the time, would vote for Obamacare again tomorrow, even though it is raising rates most recently by 20 percent on top of many other 20 percents prior to that.” Pearson Cross, teaching class: “Does she have a chance, you think? Anybody think she have a chance?” Pearson Cross: “Louisiana politics has changed a great deal. If you go back 10 years, and you look around the state you would see a state with a democratic controlled house, a democratic controlled senate, most statewide elected officials were Democrats. Pearson Cross: “I am sure that’s what they are thinking up there, ‘How can we change this?‘.” Pearson Cross: “If you move up to the election of Barack Obama and beyond, you see a state that is very quickly moving away from the Democratic party and towards the Republican party. Pearson Cross: “One of the biggest issues has been the migration of French Arcadian Catholic voters to the Republican party. Gradually Catholics started to listen to the abortion message, and that issue started to become a preeminent issue. And as it did, they started to move then they started to move to the Republican party, making Louisiana much more like the rest of the South.” Pearson Cross: “So now you are starting to see a Democratic Party in Louisiana that is majority black and is starting to be majority black and is starting to be very, very less conservative than the Republican party, which is now almost entirely white and is very, very conservative. Jason Williams: “At a time when we have her as our only statewide elected Democrat, it’s very important that we can keep her in place so that she can help us. I know that a lot of the Republicans are very conservative, and they believe that we need less government involvement. But you also need to make sure that you have jobs and opportunity. You want to have a safe place to live, which means creating real opportunities for the people that live in areas that may be impoverished. Which means delivering on economic development opportunities that are going to provide real jobs. And Mary has done that. I think it’s frustrating that someone who has delivered so much is even in a race right now.” Act III: Landrieu’s Hail Mary Jeremy Alford: “Some of the biggest revenue generating measures coming down from the federal government have Mary Landrieu’s fingerprints all over it, from federal recovery money for Hurricane Katrina and Rita to offshore energy royalty sharing programs that we share with other oil producing states. Mary Landrieu, at Pellegrin Energy event: “It is my great joy to represent this industry, to represent the people of this state, and to fight for them in a place where they are not very well understood.” Jonathan Martin: IN MID NOVEMBER, JUST WEEKS BEFORE THE RUNOFF, DEMOCRATS TRIED A HAIL MARY PASS TO SAVE THEIR FELLOW SENATOR, BY PUSHING A VOTE ON THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE, EVEN THOUGH IT’S NEVER BEEN VERY POPULAR WITH THE PARTY. THE GOAL WAS TO EMPOWER SENATOR LANDRIEU, BECAUSE THE PIPELINE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PASSION OF HERS, AND IT’S OBVIOUSLY WILDLY POPULAR IN THE OIL AND GAS ECONOMY OF LOUISIANA. MY COLLEAGUES REPORTED ABOUT HOW SHE HELD MEETING AFTER MEETING. SOMETIMES EVEN ON THE VERGE OF TEARS, HOPING TO GARNER ENOUGH SUPPORT. THE SENATE VOTE WAS HELD ON NOVEMBER 18. Elizabeth Warren: “... the sixty vote threshold having not been achieved, the bill is not passed.” IT WAS A MAJOR SETBACK. BUT, SENATOR LANDRIEU REMAINS DEFIANT. Mary Landrieu, post Keystone press conference: “My experience is still available. My chairmanship of this committee until the end of this Congress is still very valuable to the people of Louisiana. [Insert text box or fade to black for text while continuing audio:]* Voters in Louisiana will elect their next Senator on Saturday, December 6.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Several Democratic presidential candidates have lined up to call for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of a new, uninvestigated allegation of sexual impropriety when he was in college.

Kavanaugh was confirmed last October after emotional hearings in the Senate over a sexual assault allegation from his high school years. The New York Times now reports that Kavanaugh faced a separate allegation from his time at Yale University and that the FBI did not investigate the claim.

The latest claim mirrors one offered during Kavanaugh’s confirmation process by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party.

Later Sunday, Sen. Cory Booker tweeted: “This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.”

As the minority party, the Democrats can’t call official hearings or pump out subpoenas. Still, they are primed to birddog Trump’s administration if it’s caught doing government business that’s seen as lining the president’s own pockets.

Oversight, of course, is a sensitive topic when one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. It’s not uncommon for something of a détente to be established when the administration and lawmakers carry the same partisan label. But there are political risks to any alliances, or even perceptions of one.

After all, Democrats in 2006 campaigned against the Republicans’ “culture of corruption” under one-party rule with President George W. Bush, and they won control of both the House and Senate that cycle. Republicans then used the rise of the tea party to reclaim the House in the 2010 mid-terms amid charges that Democrats had given the Obama administration a pass on oversight.

Now, it’s the incoming Trump administration that’s positioned to reap the benefits – or perhaps suffer – from total Republican dominance in Washington. The president-elect’s transition aides didn’t respond to requests for comment about how Trump would navigate congressional oversight of any ethical issues. Trump’s main business venture, the Trump Organization, recently issued a statement saying it intended to soon move all of his financial assets over to his three oldest adult children and a “team of highly skilled executives.”

As for questions about how such an arrangement would address conflicts of interest, the organization said it was working on a plan that would “comply with all applicable rules and regulations.”

Democrats, however, don’t like what they’re seeing, and they’re nudging Republicans to join them in examining potential conflicts. Last Monday, Cummings went public with a letter to Chaffetz requesting a formal investigation into the president-elect’s financial set-up, and the Maryland Democrat in a follow-up interview said he’ll keep pressing the GOP chairman to adhere to his promise to pursue Trump in the same manner he’s dug into both the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton.

“I think they’ve set a pretty high standard for looking at our presidential candidates and the presidents,” Cummings said.

Democrats have other avenues to probe Trump, too. Several senators said they’d be prodding the Republican’s Cabinet nominees and even his lower-tier picks, including posing ethical queries during their confirmation hearings.

“I’m very happy that I’m on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I’m going to be asking very penetrating questions of whoever the secretary of State nominee is,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee, told reporters earlier this week.

Democrats are trying to make points through legislation, too. A bill introduced Thursday by Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, for example, would require both the president and vice president to put all their assets in a certified blind trust or disclose to the Office of Government Ethics and the public whenever they make a decision affecting their personal finances.

On the oversight front, several lawmakers and senior Democratic aides told POLITICO they expect to hear from government employees interested in blowing the whistle if Trump’s appointees cross any ethical lines. They’ll also be making record requests and leaning on the findings from investigations conducted by outside interest groups, agency IGs, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office and the media.

“Don’t short change the minority. You can ask questions. You can call attention. And that’s equally as important,” said Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro.

Among the groups allied with Democrats planning to press Trump on his business dealings is the super PAC American Bridge 21st Century. Last Monday, it filed Freedom of Information Act requests for records involving Trump’s campaign and his transition team and its interactions with the General Services Administration, Office of Government Ethics and the Office of Personnel Management. More inquiries are coming, said Jessica Mackler, the group’s president, as it looks to build on its existing “base of knowledge on his sprawling financial interests” that includes Trump’s legal depositions and dossiers on his close associates.

For Republicans, that so many questions are hovering over Trump’s business dealings means the GOP could suffer from long-term political consequences if party leaders ignore them, said Richard Painter, a former George W. Bush White House ethics lawyer.

“I think the Republicans on the Hill would want to protect Trump’s presidency from a complete disaster or they’re going to get creamed in 2018 and 2020,” he said.

North Carolina GOP Rep. Walter Jones said he welcomed Democrats for asking questions about the potential conflicts of interest, saying that the debate can benefit the Trump administration. “They need to understand this is a serious business.

Hard times for the Sanctimonious White Lady Party

A very nice liberal broadcaster asked me earlier this week whether I am worried about the future of the Republican party.

Funny question.

There are 25 states in which the state legislatures and governorships are controlled by Republicans, and two states with executive/legislative divides in which there are Republican legislative majorities large enough to override a veto from the Democratic governor. Sixty-eight of the country’s 98 partisan state legislative chambers are Republican-run. There are only four states with Democratic governors and legislatures; it is true that these include one of our most populous states (California), but the majority of Americans live in states in which there are Republican trifectas or veto-proof legislative majorities. Two-thirds of the nation’s governors are Republicans; more than two-thirds of our state legislative houses are under Republican control. Republicans control both houses of Congress and have just won the presidency.

Democrats control the dean of students’ office at Oberlin.

And Democrats have responded to their recent electoral defeat with riots, arson, and Alex Jones–level conspiracy theories. Progressives have just raised $5 million to press for a recount in several states. Clinton sycophant Paul Krugman, sounding exactly like every well-mannered conspiracy nut you’ve ever known, says the election “probably wasn’t hacked,” but “conspiracies do happen” and “now that it’s out there” — (who put it out there?) — “an independent investigation is called for.”

Maybe it isn’t the Republican party whose future needs worrying about.

In one sense, what is happening in American politics is a convergence of partisan styles.

Beginning with the nomination of Barry Goldwater, and thanks in no small part to the efforts of many men associated with this magazine, the Republican party spent half a century as a highly ideological enterprise. But highly ideological political parties are not the norm in the English-speaking world, especially not in the United States, and the conservative fusion of American libertarianism, social traditionalism, and national-security assertiveness probably is not stable enough to cohere, having now long outlived the Cold War, in which it was forged. Trump’s lack of conservative principle is unwelcome, but it points to an ideological looseness that is arguably more normal, a return to the model of party as loose coalition of interest groups.

As in the Republican party, the Democrats have a restive base that is more radical than its leadership, more aggressive, and in search of signs of tribal affiliation.

The Democrats, on the other hand, are becoming more ideological, or at least more openly and self-consciously ideological, as the party’s progressivism becomes more and more a catechism. This has the effect of making the Democratic party less democratic. American progressives have a long and genuine commitment to mass democracy, having supported not only various expansions of the franchise but also many instruments of direct democracy such as the ballot initiative, but they also have a long and genuine commitment to frustrating democracy when it gets in the way of the progressive agenda, which is why they have spent the better part of a century working to politicize the courts, the bureaucracies, and the non-governmental institutions they control in order to ensure they get their way even when they lose at the ballot box. Democrats did not pay much attention when they started suffering losses at the state level, because they were working against federalism and toward a unitary national government controlled from Washington. And they did not fight as hard as they might to recover from their losses in Congress while Barack Obama sat in the White House, obstructing Republican legislative initiatives and attempting to govern through executive fiat — an innovation that the Democrats surely are about to regret in the direst way.

For the moment, the stylistic convergence — the Republicans becoming a little more like the selfish-coalition Democratic party, and the Democrats becoming a little more like the ideological Republican party — works to the Republicans’ advantage, though there is no reason to believe that always will be the case. The GOP had a very good run of it as a highly ideological enterprise.

The longer-term problem for the Democrats is that they are finding out that they have to play by their own rules, which are the rules of identity politics.

Democratic presidential candidates have given their reaction to a warning by former President Barack Obama against moving too far left in politics.

Mr Obama's rare intervention into the Democratic race was a talking point at campaign events on Saturday.

Some Democrats called for unity, while others defended their policy agenda.

Nearly 20 candidates remain in the running and there is much debate over the best approach to taking on President Trump next year.

Speaking at a fundraising forum in Washington, the former president - considered a moderate - cautioned candidates against pursuing polices that were not ""rooted in reality"".

Mr Obama, who was in office from 2009 to 2017, said ""ordinary Americans"" didn't want to ""completely tear down the system"".

""This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Mr Obama said to an audience of wealthy donors on Friday.

The remarks represented Mr Obama's most pointed intervention yet in a crowded race featuring 18 candidates.

Former vice-president Joe Biden and senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are leading the pack, but Mr Obama is yet to publicly back a candidate.

How did candidates respond to Mr Obama?

Although none of the Democratic candidates explicitly rebuked Mr Obama's comments, Mr Sanders mounted the strongest defence of his policy platform.

Answering questions on a forum aired by Univision, a Spanish-language TV network, he was asked whether Mr Obama was ""right"" to say voters didn't want systemic change.

Mr Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist and progressive, laughed and said: ""Well, it depends on what you mean by tear down the system.""

Unlike Mr Obama, Julián Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, said he was confident any Democratic candidate would beat President Trump, regardless of their political persuasion.

Obama tips his hand

Obama has studiously avoided weighing in on the large field of Democratic candidates vying for the party's 2020 presidential nomination. Behind closed doors on Friday, however, he tipped his hand a bit.

Sanders is preaching political revolution. Warren is urging ""big systemic change"". The former president clearly had those two frontrunners in mind when he suggested such aggressive talk risks alienating the kind of middle-of-the-road voters necessary to defeat Donald Trump next year.

This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Obama, despite being labelled a radical socialist by his conservative critics, governed as a pragmatic moderate. That created a fair amount of consternation of among progressives in his party, who thought he was one of their own when elected. Some view his presidency as a missed opportunity to enact fundamental structural reforms in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis.

This time around, they're throwing their support behind Warren and Sanders and won't appreciate being indirectly lectured by the former president.

The moderate-progressive division within the Democratic Party is very real, and it has the potential for combustion. Obama may not be picking a favourite candidate, but it looks like he's picking sides.

Others not involved in the race for the nomination were more blunt.

In a tweet, Peter Daou, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, wrote: ""Saying 'Americans are moderate than these wild leftists' is basically conceding that the far-right propaganda machine has prevailed.""

More than a year before the 2000 election , Clinton sat in farmhouses and in community centers , listening to voters ' needs and concerns and their problems with government .
Many liberal and progressive activists do n't trust Clinton because they think she sides with big banks and big money instead of the middle class and they 're wary of her on national security . With a Clinton presidential campaign a possibility , they want the same treatment New York voters got .
`` If there was an actual , authentic ' I am going to listen to you about your issues ' from Clinton , instead of kind of pounding the drum of inevitability and stampeding over the left on her way to assumed victory , that would be effective , '' said Sally Kohn , a progressive activist , CNN contributor and Clinton critic .

Until then , the trust deficit between Clinton and the left of her party will grow , Kohn and other liberals predict .
Activists point to Clinton 's voting record in the Senate , where she voted to authorize the Iraq war and increase domestic surveillance . They say that and decisions her husband made while president , like the Defense of Marriage Act and the authorization of the North American Free Trade Agreement , give her little street cred among liberals and populists .
Possibly the biggest concern among liberals is Clinton 's coziness with Wall Street , their big bogeyman . Since leaving the State Department in 2013 , she has spoken at events sponsored by Wall Street giants like Fidelity , Goldman Sachs and Ameriprise Financial , and during her Senate runs and 2008 presidential run , Clinton defended lobbyists .
`` I do n't think she has been aggressive on the banks , '' said Nelini Stamp , a progressive political organizer from New York . `` When I think of Hillary Clinton , I actually think she is in bed with some of the banks and Wall Street is her ally . ''
There is also an overarching suspicion among liberals that Clinton is saying what she needs to get elected , but would govern differently .
`` You wonder if it is a pivot or whether she is saying what the moment demands , '' Kohn said .
Starting in May , before Clinton crisscrossed the country selling her book `` Hard Choices , '' the former secretary of state started to talk about populist and liberal issues like college affordability and income inequality .
Clinton told an audience at the liberal New American Foundation in May that `` the dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach '' and because of that , `` many Americans understandably feel frustrated , even angry . ''
Clinton has also recently labeled college affordability `` one of the biggest problems we have in the country , '' and says if she were elected president she would `` tackle growth , which is the handmaiden of inequality . '' People close to her have started to trumpet her record on pay equity and the minimum wage

`` She has come with a more populist tone because she knows what people want to hear , '' Stamp said . Asked if she trusts Clinton when she talks about income inequality , Stamp said bluntly , `` Right now , not that much . ''
Clinton 's changing message has been overshadowed by gaffes during her book tour , like countering questions about her wealth by saying her family was `` dead broke '' when it left the White House .
At the same time , possible opponents from the left -- like Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley and Vice President Joe Biden -- have generated more buzz among liberals as alternatives to Clinton .
Other than changing her tune , Clinton has n't been quick to address liberals who have questions for her . Instead of sitting down with them -- something that a candidate would certainly do , especially one battling distrust -- she has continued to hold events around her book and her family 's foundation .
Polls might explain why she has n't reached out yet : Right now , liberals do n't matter that much to whether Clinton would win the Democratic nomination in 2016 .
CNN/ORC International Poll from June found that only 11 % of Democrats want a more liberal option to Clinton . Twenty percent want someone more conservative and 63 % want Clinton .
What 's more , a Washington Post/ABC News poll from the same time showed that 72 % of self-described liberals supported Clinton , a number that was larger than moderate and conservative Democrats .
But liberals do make a lot of noise . Some of that has already boosted possible opponents from the left .
Earlier this month both Biden and Warren ignited the crowd of liberal bloggers and activists at the annual Netroots Nation conference in Detroit . Warren 's speech was interrupted by chants of `` Run , Liz , Run '' from eager supporters who want to see her challenge Clinton for the presidency .

Clinton was n't there , instead continuing with her `` Hard Choices '' memoir tour in St. Paul , Minnesota , and Madison , Connecticut .
While Stamp , who attended Netroots Nation , said there was n't an overarching feeling of being snubbed by Clinton , she acknowledged , `` It would have been interesting to hear her in a progressive setting . ''
`` People want to hear from a potential candidate and have those candidates hear about the work they are doing on the ground , '' she added .
After the conference , left-leaning Democrats said they felt more energized and organized than ever -- and they hope that will lead to more influence on who their party nominates in 2016 .
`` She should n't be the inevitable candidate , '' said Erica Sagrans , the campaign manager for Ready for Warren , an effort to enlist Warren to run for president in 2016 . `` Our take is that no one should feel like they ca n't support a candidate that they like or are excited about just because there is a lot of support for Hillary . ''
Ready for Warren is a direct response to what many liberal organizers say is an assumption of inevitability among the cadre of groups and political operatives organizing for a possible Clinton campaign . The name itself is a play on Ready for Hillary , an organized group of Clinton loyalists who have raised over $ 8 million to help Clinton if she chooses to run in 2016 .
Sagrans , whose group received a great deal of attention at Netroots this month , said it hopes to `` channel the excitement about Warren into tangible results and a tangible organization . ''
But just as much as the group 's goal is to `` elevate Warren , '' as Sagrans said , progressives also want to direct the 2016 conversation .
On this goal , progressives seem to be winning . Clinton has talked more about populist issues since embarking on the book tour and will likely be forced to continue this rhetoric if she runs for president .
`` There is this sort of inherent question , is Hillary ready for us ? '' Kohn said about 2016 . `` It is not enough to just be the next in line . The question is : Are you really , truly listening ? ''","Story highlights Progressives see Clinton as closer to the banks than to the middle class

""I don't think she has been aggressive on the banks,"" said Nelini Stamp, a progressive political organizer from New York. ""When I think of Hillary Clinton, I actually think she is in bed with some of the banks and Wall Street is her ally.""

There is also an overarching suspicion among liberals that Clinton is saying what she needs to get elected, but would govern differently.

""You wonder if it is a pivot or whether she is saying what the moment demands,"" Kohn said.

Starting in May, before Clinton crisscrossed the country selling her book ""Hard Choices,"" the former secretary of state started to talk about populist and liberal issues like college affordability and income inequality.

Clinton told an audience at the liberal New American Foundation in May that ""the dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach"" and because of that, ""many Americans understandably feel frustrated, even angry.""

Clinton has also recently labeled college affordability ""one of the biggest problems we have in the country,"" and says if she were elected president she would ""tackle growth, which is the handmaiden of inequality."" People close to her have started to trumpet her record on pay equity and the minimum wage

""She has come with a more populist tone because she knows what people want to hear,"" Stamp said. Asked if she trusts Clinton when she talks about income inequality, Stamp said bluntly, ""Right now, not that much.""

Clinton's changing message has been overshadowed by gaffes during her book tour, like countering questions about her wealth by saying her family was ""dead broke"" when it left the White House.

At the same time, possible opponents from the left -- like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Vice President Joe Biden -- have generated more buzz among liberals as alternatives to Clinton.

Other than changing her tune, Clinton hasn't been quick to address liberals who have questions for her. Instead of sitting down with them -- something that a candidate would certainly do, especially one battling distrust -- she has continued to hold events around her book and her family's foundation.

Polls might explain why she hasn't reached out yet: Right now, liberals don't matter that much to whether Clinton would win the Democratic nomination in 2016.

CNN/ORC International Poll from June found that only 11% of Democrats want a more liberal option to Clinton. Twenty percent want someone more conservative and 63% want Clinton.

What's more, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from the same time showed that 72% of self-described liberals supported Clinton, a number that was larger than moderate and conservative Democrats.

But liberals do make a lot of noise. Some of that has already boosted possible opponents from the left.

Earlier this month both Biden and Warren ignited the crowd of liberal bloggers and activists at the annual Netroots Nation conference in Detroit. Warren's speech was interrupted by chants of ""Run, Liz, Run"" from eager supporters who want to see her challenge Clinton for the presidency.

Clinton wasn't there, instead continuing with her ""Hard Choices"" memoir tour in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Madison, Connecticut.

While Stamp, who attended Netroots Nation, said there wasn't an overarching feeling of being snubbed by Clinton, she acknowledged, ""It would have been interesting to hear her in a progressive setting.""

""People want to hear from a potential candidate and have those candidates hear about the work they are doing on the ground,"" she added.

After the conference, left-leaning Democrats said they felt more energized and organized than ever -- and they hope that will lead to more influence on who their party nominates in 2016.

""She shouldn't be the inevitable candidate,"" said Erica Sagrans, the campaign manager for Ready for Warren, an effort to enlist Warren to run for president in 2016. ""Our take is that no one should feel like they can't support a candidate that they like or are excited about just because there is a lot of support for Hillary.""

Ready for Warren is a direct response to what many liberal organizers say is an assumption of inevitability among the cadre of groups and political operatives organizing for a possible Clinton campaign. The name itself is a play on Ready for Hillary, an organized group of Clinton loyalists who have raised over $8 million to help Clinton if she chooses to run in 2016.

Sagrans, whose group received a great deal of attention at Netroots this month, said it hopes to ""channel the excitement about Warren into tangible results and a tangible organization.""

But just as much as the group's goal is to ""elevate Warren,"" as Sagrans said, progressives also want to direct the 2016 conversation.

On this goal, progressives seem to be winning. Clinton has talked more about populist issues since embarking on the book tour and will likely be forced to continue this rhetoric if she runs for president.

And liberals hope their influence will grow with time.

""There is this sort of inherent question, is Hillary ready for us?"" Kohn said about 2016. ""It is not enough to just be the next in line. The question is: Are you really, truly listening?""",www.cnn.com,left,9kP2ZCYPa9E2DgpU

They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important,” Obama said.

The former president also criticized those who take their cues from “left-leaning Twitter feeds,” calling on candidates to pay attention to what goes on in the real world. “Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” he said.

Obama’s message wasn’t just filled with warnings. He also made a point of trying to calm nervous donors who may think that a competitive primary only benefits President Donald Trump’s bid for reelection. “For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,” Obama said. “Not only did I win ultimately a remarkably tough and lengthy primary process with Hillary Clinton, but people forget that even before that we had a big field of really serious, accomplished people.”

Things Change!,2014-11-28,John Linder,"President Barack Obama ’ s executive decision to stop enforcing certain deportation laws was a crass insult to the principle of the separation of powers embodied in the constitution . While he can make a political argument for his position on immigration he can not defend his lawlessness .
Oh , I know about the so-called academic legal scholars who signed a letter defending his action . You can hire Democrat academics to endorse just about anything . ( See Gruber , Jonathan . MIT )
It might be different if the action were taken out of a noble concern for the welfare of the victim class he sought to serve , but it was not . It was raw politics .
The Democrats are convinced that they just created 5 million new Democrat voters . They may be sorry .
I am old enough to remember when African-Americans were reliable Republican voters . Those who lived through those years knew first-hand that Jim Crow laws , and even the Ku Klux Klan , were formal policies of Democrat politicians . In many southern states the Democrat Party refused to register African-Americans and they joined the Republican party without any questions asked .
Today they are told every election how bad Republicans will be for their community while they can see with their own eyes the double tragedy of the loss of jobs and hope . The campaign commercials are a lie and they are getting tired of being insulted and taken for granted .
Throughout the 1950s President Dwight Eisenhower resisted statehood for Alaska . It was a reliably Democrat territory and he was concerned that they may impede his desire to build military installations there . He was interested in statehood for Hawaii first .

While he can make a political argument for his position on immigration he cannot defend his lawlessness.

Oh, I know about the so-called academic legal scholars who signed a letter defending his action. You can hire Democrat academics to endorse just about anything. (See Gruber, Jonathan. MIT)

It might be different if the action were taken out of a noble concern for the welfare of the victim class he sought to serve, but it was not. It was raw politics.

The Democrats are convinced that they just created 5 million new Democrat voters. They may be sorry.

Things change.

I am old enough to remember when African-Americans were reliable Republican voters. Those who lived through those years knew first-hand that Jim Crow laws, and even the Ku Klux Klan, were formal policies of Democrat politicians. In many southern states the Democrat Party refused to register African-Americans and they joined the Republican party without any questions asked.

Today they are told every election how bad Republicans will be for their community while they can see with their own eyes the double tragedy of the loss of jobs and hope. The campaign commercials are a lie and they are getting tired of being insulted and taken for granted.

Things change

Throughout the 1950s President Dwight Eisenhower resisted statehood for Alaska. It was a reliably Democrat territory and he was concerned that they may impede his desire to build military installations there. He was interested in statehood for Hawaii first.

Hawaii was reliably Republican, but the political leadership became fearful of the increasing numbers of babies being born of Asian heritage. They saw their electoral advantage being threatened and appealed for statehood.

It was the grand compromise. Alaska became a state in January of 1959 promising not to interfere with the militarization of parts of the state. Hawaii followed seven months later. Within a generation Alaska became a Republican state and Hawaii is dependably Democrat.

Hillary Clinton has spent much of the summer fending off questions about her private email account during her time as secretary of state . Bernie Sanders is gaining on her in the polls . And there 's a looming possible challenge from sitting Vice President Joe Biden .
That 's a far cry from the beginning of this campaign when she was seen as an almost inevitable Democratic nominee .
Now , she 's trying to regroup and make the case before the very people who will choose that nominee — not voters , but her base : the party establishment .
`` I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life , and I 'm not going to stop now , '' Clinton said at the summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee in Minneapolis Friday . `` In fact , I 'm just getting warmed up . ''
She vowed that she is `` not taking a single primary voter or caucusgoer for granted . ''
But party leaders are growing concerned that Clinton has not wrested control of the storyline of those emails . It 's made many bite their nails , and it 's given the other four candidates currently in the race some hope that there 's an opening for someone else .
Sanders , an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate , got a boost Saturday night from an Iowa poll showing him gaining on Clinton , just 7 points behind the front-runner .
He underlined — in a not-so-veiled shot at Clinton — that `` politics as usual '' and `` same old , same old '' is not going to work in firing up Democratic voters to get out to the polls .
Making a parallel argument to the one conservatives make on the Republican side , Sanders blamed the party , in part , for major losses in the 2014 midterm elections , because liberal base voters did n't have something to vote for .
`` We lost because voter turnout was abysmally , embarrassingly low , and millions of working people , young people , and people of color gave up on politics as usual and they stayed home , '' Sanders said .
He added , `` With all due respect — and I do not mean to insult anyone here — that turnout , that enthusiasm will not happen with politics as usual . The same old , same old will not work . ''
Former Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley also took aim at the party 's establishment , repeating his criticism of the Democratic debate schedule , which begins in October . He described it as a `` rigged process '' and `` a cynical move to delay and limit our own party debates . ''
`` Four debates , and four debates only , we are told — not asked — before voters in our earliest states make their decision , '' O'Malley said , making for a rather awkward moment with DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz as he left the stage .
Biden did not attend the meeting in Minneapolis . But in a conference call last week , the vice president told DNC members that he has been talking with his family about whether or not to enter the race . He said if he runs , he wants to give the campaign his whole heart and soul .
`` And right now , both are pretty well banged up , '' Biden said . His son Beau , a rising star in the Democratic Party , died of brain cancer in May .
Ahead of her speech , Clinton released a series of memos highlighting her organizational strength in the four early voting states . She campaigned in Iowa last week with Tom Vilsack , the agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor . Vilsack was asked if his endorsement of Clinton , while Biden is considering a run , will make for awkward Cabinet meetings .
`` I love Joe Biden — just like we all do . He 's a wonderful man , '' Vilsack said . But he said campaigns require difficult choices , and he and his wife are supporting Clinton .
It may already be too late for Biden in the minds of many DNC members , who have backed Clinton by now . Take , for example , Florida committeeman Jon M. Ausman , who said this to Politico in Minneapolis :
`` [ Biden ] does n't reach out to me for seven f * * * ing years and then he wants me to help him out ? I do n't think so . I do n't really give a s * * * . I do n't care if he gets into the race or not . ''
By rolling out early endorsements , Clinton is wise to try to make a show of strength now to ward off a Biden run , says Mo Elleithee , executive director of Georgetown University 's Institute of Politics and Public Service . Elleithee is also the immediate past DNC communications director and worked for Clinton 's 2008 campaign .
`` [ Biden ] will not have oxygen in the room if she has locked people down , '' Elleithee said . `` I think he is probably looking at the field and saying , 'OK , at this late date in the process , can I build the organization ? Can I raise the money ? And can my message break through ? ' ``
Asked about Biden , Clinton said she believes the vice president is facing a tough decision , and she wants to give him the space and time to make it . She told reporters in Minneapolis that she 's also learned some lessons from her primary loss to President Obama in 2008 .

Hillary Clinton has spent much of the summer fending off questions about her private email account during her time as secretary of state. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her in the polls. And there's a looming possible challenge from sitting Vice President Joe Biden.

That's a far cry from the beginning of this campaign when she was seen as an almost inevitable Democratic nominee.

Now, she's trying to regroup and make the case before the very people who will choose that nominee — not voters, but her base: the party establishment.

""I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not going to stop now,"" Clinton said at the summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee in Minneapolis Friday. ""In fact, I'm just getting warmed up.""

She vowed that she is ""not taking a single primary voter or caucusgoer for granted.""

But party leaders are growing concerned that Clinton has not wrested control of the storyline of those emails. It's made many bite their nails, and it's given the other four candidates currently in the race some hope that there's an opening for someone else.

Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, got a boost Saturday night from an Iowa poll showing him gaining on Clinton, just 7 points behind the front-runner.

He underlined — in a not-so-veiled shot at Clinton — that ""politics as usual"" and ""same old, same old"" is not going to work in firing up Democratic voters to get out to the polls.

Making a parallel argument to the one conservatives make on the Republican side, Sanders blamed the party, in part, for major losses in the 2014 midterm elections, because liberal base voters didn't have something to vote for.

""We lost because voter turnout was abysmally, embarrassingly low, and millions of working people, young people, and people of color gave up on politics as usual and they stayed home,"" Sanders said.

He added, ""With all due respect — and I do not mean to insult anyone here — that turnout, that enthusiasm will not happen with politics as usual. The same old, same old will not work.""

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also took aim at the party's establishment, repeating his criticism of the Democratic debate schedule, which begins in October. He described it as a ""rigged process"" and ""a cynical move to delay and limit our own party debates.""

O'Malley, who trails in the polls, wants more debates.

""Four debates, and four debates only, we are told — not asked — before voters in our earliest states make their decision,"" O'Malley said, making for a rather awkward moment with DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz as he left the stage.

Biden did not attend the meeting in Minneapolis. But in a conference call last week, the vice president told DNC members that he has been talking with his family about whether or not to enter the race. He said if he runs, he wants to give the campaign his whole heart and soul.

""And right now, both are pretty well banged up,"" Biden said. His son Beau, a rising star in the Democratic Party, died of brain cancer in May.

Ahead of her speech, Clinton released a series of memos highlighting her organizational strength in the four early voting states. She campaigned in Iowa last week with Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor. Vilsack was asked if his endorsement of Clinton, while Biden is considering a run, will make for awkward Cabinet meetings.

""I love Joe Biden — just like we all do. He's a wonderful man,"" Vilsack said. But he said campaigns require difficult choices, and he and his wife are supporting Clinton.

It may already be too late for Biden in the minds of many DNC members, who have backed Clinton by now. Take, for example, Florida committeeman Jon M. Ausman, who said this to Politico in Minneapolis:

""[Biden] doesn't reach out to me for seven f***ing years and then he wants me to help him out? I don't think so. I don't really give a s***. I don't care if he gets into the race or not.""

By rolling out early endorsements, Clinton is wise to try to make a show of strength now to ward off a Biden run, says Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. Elleithee is also the immediate past DNC communications director and worked for Clinton's 2008 campaign.

""[Biden] will not have oxygen in the room if she has locked people down,"" Elleithee said. ""I think he is probably looking at the field and saying, 'OK, at this late date in the process, can I build the organization? Can I raise the money? And can my message break through?' ""

Asked about Biden, Clinton said she believes the vice president is facing a tough decision, and she wants to give him the space and time to make it. She told reporters in Minneapolis that she's also learned some lessons from her primary loss to President Obama in 2008.

""I got a lot of votes,"" she said, ""but I didn't — I didn't get enough delegates. And, so, I think it's understandable that my focus is going to be on delegates as well as votes this time.""",www.npr.org,center,piuCWyvnQoTp1Wjp

President Obama on Wednesday denounced what he called “ phony scandals ” and “ an endless parade of distractions ” blocking progress on the economy and other issues , but critics say the controversies underscore the missed opportunities for the president and his party to live up to pledges to clean up politics and break traditional patterns of money , influence and privilege in government .
The scandals have spanned the spectrum from a Democratic mayor in San Diego accused of being unable to keep his hands off his female aides to charges that the administration put the Internal Revenue Service on the trail of its political enemies .
One of Congress ‘ most famous Democratic names , the scion of Jesse Jackson in Mr. Obama ’ s home city of Chicago , was just sent to prison for converting campaign funds to personal use . In Detroit , the ex-mayor and the wife of longtime House Judiciary Committee member John Conyers Jr. have fallen to corruption scandals , while the son of former Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown admitted last month to bribery charges as a city councilman in the nation ’ s capital .
Longtime political analyst John Pitney Jr. said the Democrats ’ woes can be viewed as examples of history repeating itself and how the enticements of Washington ’ s political culture can trip up the party in power .
“ This culture of corruption has more to do with the culture of Washington , ” said Mr. Pitney , a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont , Calif. “ It ’ s a matter of people being in power , and power plus money equals temptation . ”
It was eight years ago that Nancy Pelosi , then the leader of the House Democratic minority , made headlines with her attack on what she called the Republican Party ’ s “ culture of corruption , ” but now that moniker is coming back to haunt Democrats .
It ’ s reminiscent of the outcry over the influence-peddling scandal that dogged the Republican Party in 2005 , helping put the GOP on the defensive heading into the November 2006 midterm elections .
In 2005 , the poster boy for power run amok was Jack Abramoff , the Republican lobbyist and influence-broker who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and tax evasion . Mrs. Pelosi coined the term “ Republican culture of corruption ” and wielded it to attack the GOP on issues such as the Medicare prescription drug bill and the Iraq War .
The result : Democrats recaptured the House and Senate in the 2006 midterm elections , and two years later , Mr. Obama was elected president .
With the 2014 midterm elections looming , however , it ’ s now Democrats who are fighting off charges of corruption and misconduct as the party endures its own summer of scandal .

Mr. Weiner , who resigned in 2011 after admitting to sending explicit photos of himself to several women , is under pressure to drop out of the race for the Democratic nomination for New York mayor after reports surfaced Tuesday of raunchy exchanges under the pseudonym “ Carlos Danger . ”
Mr. Filner , who was a 10-term congressman , became mired in accusations of sexual harassment by former employees . On Tuesday , a former campaign consultant said he patted her on the bottom , and his former communications director recently filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him .
Mrs. Pelosi has refused to comment on the Filner matter . She and Mr. Filner were co-founders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , but last week she snapped at reporters who mentioned that , saying , “ Don ’ t identify him as my former colleague .
“ What goes on in San Diego is up to the people of San Diego , ” Mrs. Pelosi said . “ I ’ m not here to make any judgments — or even be fully versed on what happened . ”
Rep. Charles B. Rangel , the veteran New York Democrat who was censured by the full House for a series of tax and ethics violations in 2010 , brushed aside Mr. Weiner ’ s latest sexual scandal and its impact on the New York mayoral race .
“ Knowing New York as I do — and I do know New York — this is not going to be a story by the time we get to September the 10th , ” Mr. Rangel told MSNBC in an interview Wednesday .
Mrs. Pelosi also has refused to demand that Mr. Weiner exit the mayor ’ s race , saying that the decision should be left to the voters , according to a report by The Associated Press .
In 2006 , however , Mrs. Pelosi called for a criminal investigation into former Rep. Mark Foley , Florida Republican , after he admitted to sending sexually explicit messages to an underage male congressional page .
In a statement , she said the investigation was warranted because members of Congress operate under a “ special trust ” with the pages . Even so , critics have accused Mrs. Pelosi of employing a double standard for Democratic sexual misbehavior .
While gleefully pointing up Republican sexual and influence-peddling failings before Mr. Obama came to power , Democrats have proved to be vulnerable to the same temptations under Mr. Obama . Good-government groups have tracked the rising number of former Obama aides who have found lucrative lobbying posts , and the number of top Democratic fundraisers rewarded with plum diplomatic posts .
Mr. Rangel ’ s ethical problems effectively cost him the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee in 2010 , just months before Democrats lost their majority in the chamber . Jesse Jackson Jr. , an Illinois Democrat once considered — like Mr. Weiner — a rising force in his party ’ s House caucus — pleaded guilty in February to wire and mail fraud after he resigned his seat in November .
Democratic one-party rule in city halls across the country also has led to overreach and scandal . Detroit ’ s recent bankruptcy filing has trained another spotlight the corruption that plagued the administration of former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick , a Democrat who went to jail after being convicted of charges ranging from mail fraud to racketeering over his six-year term that ended in 2008 .
In the District of Columbia , former D.C. Council member Michael A . Brown last month pleaded guilty to a public corruption charge for accepting tens of thousands of dollars in cash stuffed in duffel bags and coffee cups while in office . He pleaded guilty after the chairman of the D.C. Council , Kwame R. Brown , resigned and pleaded guilty to bank fraud in June 2012 . Former council member Harry Thomas Jr. resigned from the D.C. Council and pleaded guilty in January 2012 to stealing $ 350,000 in public funds intended for youth sports programs .
Critics say the Democrats ’ sharp rhetoric when out of power has made it more difficult for figures such as Mrs. Pelosi to distance themselves from party members like Mr. Filner when they find themselves in trouble .
“ Whether she ’ s carrying a gavel or just carrying water , Pelosi has served as a loyal apologist and abettor of the Democratic Bad Boys Club , ” conservative columnist Michelle Malkin said in a Wednesday article . “ What exactly will it take before voters finally turn this perv protector into a ‘ former colleague ’ ? ”
Although the sexual scandals may be embarrassing for Democrats , Republicans have endured cringe-worthy moments from their own former lawmakers , notably former South Carolina Gov . Mark Sanford , who was elected to Congress in May despite revelations about an extramarital affair .

Frank","‘ Republicans are from Mars , Democrats are from Venus ” goes an adage much beloved by pundits always looking for a convenient platitude to rest their elbows on . ( Or chins . ) Caricatured another way , Republicans are cast as the Daddy Party ( jaw-jutting , decisive , disciplinarian , financially prudent , militarily assertive : meat ) , Democrats are the Mommy Party ( huggy , permissive , socially concerned , globally cooperative : veggies ) . Such gender stereotypes may have outlived whatever hinky usefulness they ever had , as stereotypes are wont to do , but beneath the sexual cosplay of Republican executive blue suits versus Democratic mom jeans ( which President Obama was accused of fancying by no less a fashion arbiter than Sarah Palin ) is a forked dynamic deeper than any policy differences or identity politics . Republicans are driven by anger ; Democrats , riven by anxiety . Anger stokes Republicans to lash out , their grievances , real and imaginary , kept at a raging boil by Fox News , Matt Drudge , radio talk-show hosts , and similar mayhem artists . Anxiety pincushions Democrats into a defensive crouch waiting for the ceiling to cave , their blood pressure spiking with every alarming headline in The New York Times , of which there is never a shortage .
The party apparatus exploits and exacerbates these fraidy- ’ crat jitters . Whenever something major looms—an election , a State of the Union address , a major Senate vote , a gravitational ripple—my e-mail box turns into a Wailing Wall of Democratic fund-raising messages bearing subject lines such as “ Worried , ” “ Be Afraid , ” “ Why Haven ’ t We Heard from You ? , ” “ All Hope Is Lost , ” and “ DOOMED , ” which isn ’ t how General Patton would have fired up the troops . The heebie-jeebie-ing is even worse on social media during the election cycle ; social media make everything worse if you open up the sluices , turning even stoics into headless chickens . A few years ago such Aunt Pittypat palpitations inspired a viral poster that showed President Obama making a bold gesture with the message EVERYONE CHILL THE FUCK OUT , I GOT THIS ! And yet , after nearly two terms of Obama ’ s unruffled , unrattled mastery of the long game , his confidence doesn ’ t seem to have energized Democrats en masse with a “ Forward march ! ” spirit . When Democrats contemplate their navel , they still see a panic button .
Not all Democrats , naturally , otherwise the party would have gone the way of the Pony Express , political architect Karl Rove ’ s vision of a permanent Republican majority having come to pass . Yet there does seem to be an intestinal queasiness in the institutional identity that ’ s chronic and unworthy of its ancestors . When I was a stripling in the never dull 60s , Democrats didn ’ t quaver as if a wagon-train attack lurked around every bend . Activated by adversity , they appeared outgoing , future-striding , and firm-resolved : dashing John F. Kennedy , happy warrior Hubert H. Humphrey , steer-wrangling Lyndon Baines Johnson , and , radiating in the background , the chromo image of Franklin Delano Roosevelt—the greatest president , and perhaps the greatest figure , of the 20th century . The Republican adults in charge came across as somberly dour ( Richard Nixon ) or apocalyptically dire ( Barry Goldwater ) . The bloody morass of Vietnam , the urban riots and campus upheavals , the assassinations of J.F.K. , his brother Robert , and Martin Luther King Jr. , and the druggy saturnalia of the decade eroded the faith in liberal progress and took the bright shine off social engineering . When Nixon swept the board in his re-election victory of 1972 over George McGovern , winning 49 states , it was as if a dark visor had been lowered over the future for liberal Democrats , nothing ahead but charred landscape . Undone by hubris and thirsty vengeance , Nixon did the country a favor by befouling himself over Watergate , opening a respite of hope for Democrats ( the improbable success of Jimmy Carter in time for the bicentennial ) , only to have it smushed beneath the golden hammer of Ronald Reagan , with whose two-term presidency the Democrats are still reckoning .
It wasn ’ t only that Reagan was popular , racking up a second-term victory that equaled Nixon ’ s 49-state total and scored the highest electoral-college vote in history ( 525 out of a possible 538 ) , leaving liberals thunderstruck . It wasn ’ t only that he was the first pontiff of the unfettered free-market capitalism that has become the economic dogma of our time ( even if the actual record of his administration wouldn ’ t pass Ayn Rand ’ s inspection ) . Reagan ’ s dandiest trick was inverting the personae of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans , turning the character roles inside out . Optimistic , affable , rhetorically broad-gestured and bold-colored , a mega-dose of vitamin D , the former movie star opened a picture window on the majestic vista of “ Morning in America , ” where the skies were big and blue and the hills alive with the sound of jingle-jangle spurs . In political , media , and public awareness , perceptions turned topsy-turvy , placing Republicans high in the saddle and challenging the horizon while nit-picking , nay-saying Democrats clung to the status quo as if it were the schoolmarm ’ s apron strings .

(Or chins.) Caricatured another way, Republicans are cast as the Daddy Party (jaw-jutting, decisive, disciplinarian, financially prudent, militarily assertive: meat), Democrats are the Mommy Party (huggy, permissive, socially concerned, globally cooperative: veggies). Such gender stereotypes may have outlived whatever hinky usefulness they ever had, as stereotypes are wont to do, but beneath the sexual cosplay of Republican executive blue suits versus Democratic mom jeans (which President Obama was accused of fancying by no less a fashion arbiter than Sarah Palin) is a forked dynamic deeper than any policy differences or identity politics. Republicans are driven by anger; Democrats, riven by anxiety. Anger stokes Republicans to lash out, their grievances, real and imaginary, kept at a raging boil by Fox News, Matt Drudge, radio talk-show hosts, and similar mayhem artists. Anxiety pincushions Democrats into a defensive crouch waiting for the ceiling to cave, their blood pressure spiking with every alarming headline in The New York Times, of which there is never a shortage.

The party apparatus exploits and exacerbates these fraidy-’crat jitters. Whenever something major looms—an election, a State of the Union address, a major Senate vote, a gravitational ripple—my e-mail box turns into a Wailing Wall of Democratic fund-raising messages bearing subject lines such as “Worried,” “Be Afraid,” “Why Haven’t We Heard from You?,” “All Hope Is Lost,” and “DOOMED,” which isn’t how General Patton would have fired up the troops. The heebie-jeebie-ing is even worse on social media during the election cycle; social media make everything worse if you open up the sluices, turning even stoics into headless chickens. A few years ago such Aunt Pittypat palpitations inspired a viral poster that showed President Obama making a bold gesture with the message EVERYONE CHILL THE FUCK OUT, I GOT THIS! And yet, after nearly two terms of Obama’s unruffled, unrattled mastery of the long game, his confidence doesn’t seem to have energized Democrats en masse with a “Forward march!” spirit. When Democrats contemplate their navel, they still see a panic button.

Not all Democrats, naturally, otherwise the party would have gone the way of the Pony Express, political architect Karl Rove’s vision of a permanent Republican majority having come to pass. Yet there does seem to be an intestinal queasiness in the institutional identity that’s chronic and unworthy of its ancestors. When I was a stripling in the never dull 60s, Democrats didn’t quaver as if a wagon-train attack lurked around every bend. Activated by adversity, they appeared outgoing, future-striding, and firm-resolved: dashing John F. Kennedy, happy warrior Hubert H. Humphrey, steer-wrangling Lyndon Baines Johnson, and, radiating in the background, the chromo image of Franklin Delano Roosevelt—the greatest president, and perhaps the greatest figure, of the 20th century. The Republican adults in charge came across as somberly dour (Richard Nixon) or apocalyptically dire (Barry Goldwater). The bloody morass of Vietnam, the urban riots and campus upheavals, the assassinations of J.F.K., his brother Robert, and Martin Luther King Jr., and the druggy saturnalia of the decade eroded the faith in liberal progress and took the bright shine off social engineering. When Nixon swept the board in his re-election victory of 1972 over George McGovern, winning 49 states, it was as if a dark visor had been lowered over the future for liberal Democrats, nothing ahead but charred landscape. Undone by hubris and thirsty vengeance, Nixon did the country a favor by befouling himself over Watergate, opening a respite of hope for Democrats (the improbable success of Jimmy Carter in time for the bicentennial), only to have it smushed beneath the golden hammer of Ronald Reagan, with whose two-term presidency the Democrats are still reckoning.

It wasn’t only that Reagan was popular, racking up a second-term victory that equaled Nixon’s 49-state total and scored the highest electoral-college vote in history (525 out of a possible 538), leaving liberals thunderstruck. It wasn’t only that he was the first pontiff of the unfettered free-market capitalism that has become the economic dogma of our time (even if the actual record of his administration wouldn’t pass Ayn Rand’s inspection). Reagan’s dandiest trick was inverting the personae of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, turning the character roles inside out. Optimistic, affable, rhetorically broad-gestured and bold-colored, a mega-dose of vitamin D, the former movie star opened a picture window on the majestic vista of “Morning in America,” where the skies were big and blue and the hills alive with the sound of jingle-jangle spurs. In political, media, and public awareness, perceptions turned topsy-turvy, placing Republicans high in the saddle and challenging the horizon while nit-picking, nay-saying Democrats clung to the status quo as if it were the schoolmarm’s apron strings. A gross caricature, but gross caricatures are what the Beltway press eats for brunch, and, apart from a leonine few, Democrats became gun-shy of proposing any F.D.R./L.B.J.-scaled domestic programs or making anything resembling dovish cries. The party lost labor muscle—Reagan’s crackdown on the air-traffic controllers’ union in 1981, when his threat to fire more than 11,000 striking controllers carried the day, was a crippling defeat from which unions never recovered—and shifted attention to knowledge workers, who didn’t have the same organizational strength and loyalty in the non-unionized, neoliberal economy. “Though [Michael Dukakis] lost the [1988] election after being defamed in the infamous Willie Horton ad … , his platform won him a following among white-collar professionals in the metropolitan areas of the Sunbelt, West, and Northeast,” historian and political analyst Lily Geismer wrote in the winter 2016 issue of Jacobin magazine. “Four years later, the [Democratic Leadership Council]’s golden boy, Bill Clinton, placed high-tech growth and suburban professionals at the forefront of his policy vision in his own presidential bid.” The “triangulation” strategy and small-ball initiatives (school uniforms, etc.) practiced and proposed by Clinton once he was in office weren’t just wily poker tricks but a recognition of the political realities of the post-Reagan era. Expansive, ebullient, and popular, Clinton was finely tuned to the public’s mood, sensed just how far to push. Fat lot of good it did him.

democratic_party,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/09/politics/democrats-15-an-hour-minimum-wage-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton/index.html,"In platform fight, Sanders loses on trade but wins on minimum wage",2016-07-09,Eric Bradner,"Orlando , Florida ( CNN ) Bernie Sanders ' campaign is declaring victory after striking deals with Hillary Clinton 's allies over climate change , health care and a $ 15-an-hour minimum wage as Democrats finalized the party 's 2016 platform .
The primary rivals ' negotiators never found common ground on trade -- with Clinton 's supporters voting down the Sanders backers ' language to specifically reject the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership . Sanders supporters were also frustrated to see their proposals denouncing Israeli settlements and banning fracking rejected .
Overall , though , they celebrated , touting the party 's platform -- finalized in the wee Sunday morning hours -- as one that reflects the causes that animated the Vermont senator 's campaign .
`` We got 80 % of what we wanted in this platform , '' top Sanders foreign policy adviser Warren Gunnels told CNN .
Those successes could keep in place plans for Sanders to appear in person with Clinton on Tuesday in New Hampshire , finally endorsing his Democratic primary rival .
Clinton 's campaign also touted the platform . `` We are proud of the work that Democrats did in Orlando and for coming together to further strengthen the most progressive platform in the history of our party , '' said Clinton senior policy adviser Maya Harris .
The weekend was the culmination of Sanders ' month-long push , since the Democratic primary contest ended , to move the party 's platform leftward .
`` Now let 's put in place a president that can actually deliver on this and let 's make sure that she does , '' Sanders supporter Ben Jealous , the former NAACP head , said in a nod to Clinton after the climate deal was announced .
Sanders supporters ' top priority had been trade , and it was the biggest point of contention between the two camps .
When their proposal to oppose the Pacific Rim deal was rejected , Sanders supporters shouted `` shame ! '' and `` fake progressive ! '' at Clinton backers on the Democratic National Committee 's platform panel here , as the party met to finalize its official positions on issues ahead of its convention later this month in Philadelphia .
Some vowed to force a vote on the convention floor on whether to oppose the trade pact in the party 's platform .
`` If it were not for the Sanders campaign , we would n't even be having this conversation , '' said pro-Sanders delegate Cornel West , the civil rights activist and philosopher . `` We do n't want window dressing in talking about working people . ''
By keeping specific opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership out of the platform , Democrats avoided embarrassing President Barack Obama , whose administration has spent most of his two terms negotiating the massive 12-nation trade deal .
However , the decision also opens up Clinton and other Democrats to questions about whether their opposition to the Pacific Rim pact is sincere .
It 's a politically precarious position as presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump turns decades of Republican pro-trade orthodoxy on its head , regularly railing against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other free trade deals on the campaign trail .
Democrats approved an amendment to the platform proposed by American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees union president Lee Saunders , which laid out priorities trade deals should address , including labor policy , the environment and currency manipulation .
`` These are standards all Democrats believe should be applied to all trade agreements , including the Trans-Pacific Partnership , '' the amendment said .
But when Jealous sought a tweak to Saunders ' proposal that would have explicitly stated that those reasons are why Democrats oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership , he ran into opposition , as Clinton 's camp -- supporting the White House , and led on the floor by Saunders -- called it unnecessary .
Jealous pointed to Trump 's stance , saying Democrats face something `` we have never seen before -- which is a Republican opponent who intends to run clearly against the TPP . ''
`` We must empower every representative of the Democratic Party to speak clearly against the TPP , '' he said .
Jealous added : `` Hillary is against the TPP . Bernie is against the TPP . Let 's not be bureaucrats -- let 's be leaders . ''
None of the pro-Clinton Democrats spoke in favor of the trade deal .
Instead , Saunders sought to cast the party as already unified on trade -- even as he opposed the Jealous language .
`` We have to open opposition to TPP from both of our candidates running for president of the United States . For once -- for once -- all Democratic candidates and labor are of one view : No on TPP , '' Saunders said .
Minutes later , another pro-Sanders delegate , Jim Hightower , proposed an amendment that specifically denounces the Trans-Pacific Partnership and says Democrats will oppose giving it a vote -- even in a lame-duck session of Congress before the next president is sworn in . That , too , was rejected .
It led more than a dozen furious Sanders supporters to walk out of the meeting .
The trade fight likely is n't over . Sanders supporter Jonathan Tasini said `` there 's absolutely no doubt '' that his side will file a `` minority report '' calling for a vote against the Trans-Pacific Partnership on the floor of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia .
That mechanism , which Sanders has enough votes to use , will force another trade debate , with all of the convention 's delegates able to vote .
The trade battle was one major loss in a weekend that has included several victories for Sanders .
Democrats amended their platform late Friday to call for a $ 15-an-hour federal minimum wage -- a Sanders priority from the outset of his 2016 campaign .
The amendment calls for the change `` over time '' -- less specific language than Sanders had wanted , making it a concession for Clinton .
But it is much more specific than the previous draft of the platform , which said Americans `` should earn more than $ 15 an hour '' but did n't mention the federal minimum wage specifically .
The amendment calling for the $ 15-an-hour federal minimum wage was introduced by former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner , a Sanders supporter .
Mary Kay Henry , the international president of the Service Employees International Union , proposed adding language that included the phrase `` over time . ''
Both were adopted without a fight -- the product of hours of negotiations between the Clinton and Sanders camps at an Orlando hotel on the first day of the two-day meeting .
The minimum wage language pushes Clinton left of the position she 's taken on the campaign trail . She has supported a $ 12-an-hour federal minimum wage , as well as local efforts to set higher minimum wages in places like New York and California .
The Clinton and Sanders camps struck a bargain on climate change . While Sanders did n't get the carbon tax he wanted , the compromise says that `` greenhouse gases should be priced to reflect their negative externalities , and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and help meet our climate goals . ''
It calls for the same standard Obama used to reject the Keystone XL pipeline -- saying it would `` significantly exacerbate '' global warming -- to apply to all pipeline projects .
It also calls for investment in new infrastructure projects such as renewable power and advanced vehicle manufacturing .
The Sanders camp had pushed for a national moratorium but knew , as part of the broader climate deal , that they 'd lose that fight .
`` Gasland '' director Josh Fox pushed the proposed ban , calling fracking `` an abomination and a horror '' and saying , `` There is a political revolution going on in this country and fracking has no place in it . ''
Sanders ' supporters were on their feet as he spoke , chanting , `` No fracking way ! ''
But Clinton 's backers replaced the language of Fox 's proposal with a much more nuanced version , calling for a restriction on fracking `` where states and local communities oppose it . ''
That change got boos from Sanders supporters , but minutes later they cheered the broader climate compromise .
Clinton on Saturday also expressed support for expanding taxpayer-funded health insurance , in a nod to the desires of Sanders ' supporters . She affirmed support for the so-called `` public option , '' which would expand health insurance coverage beyond the current provisions in Obamacare .
Clinton has supported the public option for decades . But she ran in the Democratic primary as a candidate who wanted to expand Obamacare and used Sanders ' support for a public option against him , saying it would be too costly and run into interference from Republican governors .
`` We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal , quality , affordable health care to everyone in America , '' Clinton said in a statement released by her campaign . `` Already , the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans . As president , I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy . ''
Clinton also called for allowing people 55 years and older to be able to enroll in Medicare . Currently , the typical age for enrollment is 65 .
On a conference call , Sanders called it `` an important step forward in expanding health care in America and expanding health insurance and health care access to tens of millions of Americans . I congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative . It will save lives . It will ease suffering . ''
Clinton supporters rejected an effort Saturday to add a call for `` an end to occupations and illegal settlements '' in Palestinian territories into the Democratic platform .
Clinton 's backers argued that the current language in the party 's platform , calling for negotiations for a two-state solution in Israel to give Palestinians a homeland , are enough and that going further would inflame tensions and undercut U.S. diplomats ' ability to lead future negotiations .
But Sanders ' supporters -- as well as dozens of young people in the crowd -- said the language they 'd proposed simply repeated a position Clinton herself has taken in the past .
`` This is a moral issue . This is an issue of our time . It has spiritual and moral implications , '' said Cornel West , the pro-Sanders civil rights activist and philosopher . `` Democratic Party , you 've been in denial for too long . Palestinians ought to be free . ''
The amendment was voted down , 73-95 . Its rejection led to the loudest boos of the day , with one man being escorted out after he stood up and declared that Democrats had `` sold out to ( American Israel Public Affairs Committee ) . ''
The biggest cheers of the day came when the platform committee voted 81-80 for platform language calling for a `` reasonable pathway to future legalization '' of marijuana .
The panel also approved criminal justice language endorsed by both campaigns -- with Jealous making the pitch for Sanders and Ben Crump , the lawyer for Trayvon Martin 's family , for Clinton 's side .
It calls for the mandatory use of police body cameras , and says Democrats will `` stop the use of weapons of war that have no place in our communities . '' The platform does n't detail what it classifies as `` weapons of war . ''
It also calls for the Justice Department to investigate all `` questionable or suspicious '' police shootings .
Still up at the Democratic platform meeting in Orlando are potentially contentious fights over issues like fracking and a carbon tax .
Asked whether his planned meeting with Clinton would happen , and whether there are plans for further joint events , Sanders said : `` We look forward to continue working with the Clinton campaign and we 'll have more to say as to where we go forward in the near future .

“I was determined to weave this perspective into the fabric of American foreign policy,” Clinton said of her time as secretary of state, adding later that she intended to continue that commitment outside government.

For the past five months , those of us old enough to have lived through the 1990s have been enduring a deeply unpleasant bout of déjà vu-inspired dread . First the news breaks , inspiring the unavoidable thought , `` How could [ insert member of the Clinton family here ] possibly have failed to realize that this would be a problem ? '' Then the barrage of counter-attacks from the Clinton machine against the story , poking holes , impugning motives , kicking up just enough dust to convince fair-minded observers that maybe , just maybe , there 's less to the story than it originally seemed . And finally , because journalists make mistakes and actually care about being able to stand behind the truth of what they publish , even those who ran the original story begin to backtrack , express uncertainties , and air self-doubts .
And then : Ka-Blam ! The story is back and bigger than ever . Oh , that server we would n't give to you ? You can have it now , cleaned up all nice and tidy . There certainly were n't any classified documents on there . Oh , there were ? Oops , well , only those two — oh , I mean four — and do n't worry about how that 's just a `` limited sample '' of 40 emails out of tens of thousands ; the inspector general of the Justice Department just got lucky . And hey , we deleted them , so who cares ? ( Freedom of information is for suckers . ) Yes , of course , my `` shadow '' had access to that server and those classified emails , too . Why is that a problem ? What , are you a member of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy ?
Maybe you think this is just one of those inside-the-Beltway scandals that only engages journalists and pundits and so will leave the candidate unscathed . But what about the multimillion-dollar slush fund run by her husband , with some of the world 's richest people and most corrupt governments potentially trading massive monetary donations for access to and influence with a former president and sitting secretary of state ? Did it happen ? To what extent ? Keeping all of those emails off of government servers and then deleting them has made answering those questions much more difficult than it otherwise would have been . But mark my word , an enterprising reporter somewhere is going to find out . Once again , it 's just a matter of when .
Moving further down the ladder of corruption into pure sleaze , we have , as always , Bill Clinton 's insatiable sexual appetite . We have n't heard much about this in the mainstream press since the days of `` bimbo eruptions '' and Monica Lewinsky . And that 's fair , right ? Bill is out of office , his days of public service behind him . Why is it anyone 's business what the ex-president does in his free time ?
The only problem is that his wife is running for president , and if the effort is successful , Bill and his libido will be back in the White House . Should that be a problem ? Maybe not — though it sure could be a humiliating embarrassment and distraction for the first female commander-in-chief .
But what concerns me far more is a specific story — one about Jeffrey Epstein , the billionaire investor with a taste for sex with underage prostitutes . Lots of them . Perhaps as many as `` 34 confirmed minors . '' ( Epstein pled guilty to state charges in 2008 . He was sentenced to 18 months and released after serving 13 . )
Flight logs from Epstein 's private jet — nicknamed the `` Lolita Express '' — show at least 10 trips by Bill Clinton , including several on which he flew ( according to Gawker ) with `` a woman who federal prosecutors believe procured underage girls to sexually service Epstein and his friends and acted as a 'potential co-conspirator ' in his crimes .

The only question is when one of these time bombs explode : before the primaries or after the primaries , before the convention or after the convention , before the debates or after the debates , before Election Day or after Election Day .","ADVERTISEMENT

So Bernie Sanders is leading in New Hampshire. That cheers me — though not because he's my ideal candidate, and certainly not because I think he could win in the general election. I'm convinced he would almost certainly lose against all but the loopiest or scariest Republican opponent.

First the news breaks, inspiring the unavoidable thought, ""How could [insert member of the Clinton family here] possibly have failed to realize that this would be a problem?"" Then the barrage of counter-attacks from the Clinton machine against the story, poking holes, impugning motives, kicking up just enough dust to convince fair-minded observers that maybe, just maybe, there's less to the story than it originally seemed. And finally, because journalists make mistakes and actually care about being able to stand behind the truth of what they publish, even those who ran the original story begin to backtrack, express uncertainties, and air self-doubts.

And then: Ka-Blam! The story is back and bigger than ever. Oh, that server we wouldn't give to you? You can have it now, cleaned up all nice and tidy. There certainly weren't any classified documents on there. Oh, there were? Oops, well, only those two — oh, I mean four — and don't worry about how that's just a ""limited sample"" of 40 emails out of tens of thousands; the inspector general of the Justice Department just got lucky. And hey, we deleted them, so who cares? (Freedom of information is for suckers.) Yes, of course, my ""shadow"" had access to that server and those classified emails, too. Why is that a problem? What, are you a member of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy?

Tick, tick, boom.

Maybe you think this is just one of those inside-the-Beltway scandals that only engages journalists and pundits and so will leave the candidate unscathed. But what about the multimillion-dollar slush fund run by her husband, with some of the world's richest people and most corrupt governments potentially trading massive monetary donations for access to and influence with a former president and sitting secretary of state? Did it happen? To what extent? Keeping all of those emails off of government servers and then deleting them has made answering those questions much more difficult than it otherwise would have been. But mark my word, an enterprising reporter somewhere is going to find out. Once again, it's just a matter of when.

Tick, tick, boom.

Moving further down the ladder of corruption into pure sleaze, we have, as always, Bill Clinton's insatiable sexual appetite. We haven't heard much about this in the mainstream press since the days of ""bimbo eruptions"" and Monica Lewinsky. And that's fair, right? Bill is out of office, his days of public service behind him. Why is it anyone's business what the ex-president does in his free time?

The only problem is that his wife is running for president, and if the effort is successful, Bill and his libido will be back in the White House. Should that be a problem? Maybe not — though it sure could be a humiliating embarrassment and distraction for the first female commander-in-chief.

But what concerns me far more is a specific story — one about Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire investor with a taste for sex with underage prostitutes. Lots of them. Perhaps as many as ""34 confirmed minors."" (Epstein pled guilty to state charges in 2008. He was sentenced to 18 months and released after serving 13.)

Flight logs from Epstein's private jet — nicknamed the ""Lolita Express"" — show at least 10 trips by Bill Clinton, including several on which he flew (according to Gawker) with ""a woman who federal prosecutors believe procured underage girls to sexually service Epstein and his friends and acted as a 'potential co-conspirator' in his crimes.""

Tick, boom.

The only question is when one of these time bombs explode: before the primaries or after the primaries, before the convention or after the convention, before the debates or after the debates, before Election Day or after Election Day.

What’s happening

A poll released earlier this week showed Pete Buttigieg leading the Democratic presidential primary pack in Iowa for the first time. A new poll released on Saturday showed him as the clear front-runner. The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was a virtual unknown when he announced his campaign in April, but he has recently surged in states that will be among the first to vote in the primary.

Buttigieg, an openly gay military veteran, was the top choice of 25 percent of likely Iowa caucus-goers, outpacing long-standing frontrunners Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The poll shows major growth in his support in the past three months. A poll taken in August had him at just 8 percent.

Why there’s debate

Though it’s only two polls, some political experts see it as evidence that Buttigieg may have a chance at winning the Democratic nomination — and even the presidency. Buttigieg has staked a position where he can be seen as a reasonable alternative for voters who have doubts about the three leading candidates.

Buttigieg’s policy platform is progressive, but not as far left as Sanders’s and Warren’s. A key example is his Medicare for All Who Want It plan, which would be a major shift in how the U.S. health care system works, but not as transformative as the Medicare for All plans promoted by Warren and Sanders. Buttigieg is also an alternative choice for moderate voters who may be dissatisfied with Biden.

Still, there are several reasons to question whether Buttigieg can compete for the nomination. His biggest shortcoming is low support among black voters. He may perform well in the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire that open the primary, but could fall off significantly as voting moves to South Carolina and other demographically diverse states.

Buttigieg’s lack of experience relative to his competition, which includes senators, former governors and a former vice president, could dampen his appeal, some analysts argue. There are also questions about whether his sexuality might limit support from religious voters.

What’s next

Buttigieg will have a chance to continue his upward momentum with a strong showing in the next primary debate, on Wednesday. The first votes in the Democratic primary will be cast in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.

Perspectives

He can win

Buttigieg has entrenched himself as a strong alternative to the three leading candidates

“As voters have developed Goldilocks syndrome about the leading Democratic candidates — too old, too liberal, too ... female? — Buttigieg has benefitted from the strong vanilla flavor of his political porridge.” — Clare Malone, FiveThirtyEight

He has been a successful fundraiser

“Buttigieg is alone among the alternatives to Warren, Biden and Sanders in having the money and organization to actually compete going forward.” — Andrew Romano, Yahoo News

He has moved into the top tier of competitors

“What I think we’re seeing in the early states and nationally is that Buttigieg has sort of joined that top four across the board. ... This is a race right now between Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg, and they are sort of a tier unto themselves.” — David Chalian, CNN

His frequent discussion of religion could make him appealing to voters Dems sometimes struggle to reach

“He’s not an evangelical; he’s a mainline Protestant who, unlike other Democratic candidates, isn’t shy about acknowledging his faith publicly or using the word ‘sin.’ The mayor appears to be reaching out beyond his party’s relatively secular base to more conservative, religiously minded Americans in part by underlining his embrace of the stewardship thread of American environmental thought.” — Asher Price, Los Angeles Times

He benefits from a favorable relationship with the media

“The Indiana mayor’s availability to the media — a strategy initially born out of necessity for the largely unknown politician — is one reason he has vaulted over more established candidates in the Democratic field.” — Maureen Groppe, USA Today

Even if he comes up short in 2020, Buttigieg has a bright political future

democratic_party,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/17/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-establishment-battle-boils-over/index.html,"Bernie Sanders, Democratic establishment battle boils over",2016-05-17,Chris Moody,"With the Democratic presidential primary in its twilight , frustration within the ranks over the party 's handling of the primary process spilled out this week as Bernie Sanders supporters lashed out at party leaders , arguing that their candidate has been treated unfairly .
The public outpouring of anger began last weekend at the Nevada Democratic Party convention , where Sanders supporters who said Hillary Clinton 's backers had subverted party rules shouted down pro-Clinton speakers and sent threatening messages to state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange after posting her phone number and address on social media .
That led Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and other top party leaders to demand an apology and publicly ruminate on the possibility of violence at the Democratic National Convention in July as they prepare for a general election battle with Donald Trump .
Obama administration officials on Wednesday played down concerns about escalating tensions , likening the race to the 2008 primary fight between Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama .
But Sanders is n't backing down . A campaign spokesman said Wednesday that the campaign was `` looking into '' whether to ask for a recount in Kentucky , where Sanders narrowly lost on Tuesday night , and he fired up his crowd in Southern California Tuesday night by calling out the Democratic establishment .
The Sanders campaign on Tuesday did condemn unruly behavior from supporters and those who made threats to party leaders , but made clear it is sticking with its stance that the party is subverting the process in a way that benefits Clinton .
`` These claims that our campaign is sort of fomenting violence in some way are absolute nonsense , '' Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night , adding that the campaign `` absolutely , categorically '' condemns any threatening behavior .
The breakdown in civility comes after what has otherwise been a comparatively polite campaign season for Democrats , but the frustration exposes a rift in the party and undercuts the notion that Clinton will be able to march into the Democratic convention this summer with a party unified behind her .
Throughout the year , Sanders and his supporters have complained about the nomination process and ways they believe it has helped Clinton , including debates held on Saturday nights , closed primaries in major states such as New York , and the use of superdelegates -- essentially free-agent party and union stalwarts who are overwhelmingly backing Clinton .
`` The problem is that there are long-simmering concerns about unfair treatment out in the Nevada Democratic Party , '' Weaver added . `` We are not going to allow the millions of people who supported Bernie Sanders to be sort of rolled over in places like Nevada by the way they handled that convention . ''

Earlier on Tuesday , Sanders released a statement suggesting that his supporters were justified in feeling like the party has given them a raw deal .
`` If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November , it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned , '' Sanders ' statement read . `` Unfortunately , that was not the case at the Nevada convention . At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place . ''
In an interview with CNN , Wasserman Schultz said that statement was n't enough .
`` I was deeply disturbed , '' she said . `` The senator 's response was anything but acceptable . It certainly did not condemn his supporters for acting violently or engaging in intimidation tactics and instead added more fuel the fire . ''
The DNC chairwoman , however , said she has not spoken directly with Sanders , but that her staff has been in touch with the Vermont senator 's campaign . She also pushed back against Sanders ' accusation that the party had rigged the system against him .
`` We 've had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama . These rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014 , '' she said . `` They were followed and even if the Sanders supporters were frustrated , there is never , under any circumstances , a place for violence and intimidation to be resorted to in response . ''

On CNN 's `` New Day '' Wednesday morning , Weaver accused the DNC chairwoman of `` throwing shade . ''
`` We can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz and how she 's been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign , '' Weaver said .
`` I got ta say it 's not the DNC , '' he added . `` By and large the DNC has been very good to us , but not Debbie Wasserman Schultz . ''
Wasserman Schultz brushed off Weaver 's comments later in the day .
`` My response to that is hashtag SMH ( shake my head ) , '' Wasserman Schultz told Blitzer on `` Wolf . '' `` We need to focus on one thing : get through this primary and work to prepare for the general election and make sure that we can continue to draw the contrasts between either one of our really fine candidates who are focused on helping people reach the middle class and make sure that we get equal pay for equal work and create jobs and not let the Republicans take health care away from 20 million Americans . ''
Speaking to reporters in Columbus , Ohio , on Wednesday afternoon , Vice President Joe Biden said if such disruption happens again , `` He 's going to have to be more aggressive in speaking out about it . ''
`` But here we are in May , as was pointed out , '' Biden continued . `` Hillary was still in this in May , in June . I 'm confident that Bernie will be supportive if Hillary wins , which the numbers indicate will happen . So I 'm not worried . There 's no fundamental split in the Democratic Party . ''
Leading congressional Democrats also pushed Sanders to rein in his supporters . Reid called Sanders ' response `` a test of leadership '' for Sanders , and a source in his office told CNN that the Nevada senator is waiting to hear from the senator himself on the matter .
`` The convention was Saturday . It 's now Wednesday afternoon . And he has n't spoken about it , '' the source said .
California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer , who spoke on behalf of Clinton at the Nevada convention , condemned the behavior .
`` He should get things under control , '' Boxer said . `` We 're in a race that is very critical . We have to be united . ''
`` This is a character moment for Bernie Sanders . He 's got to figure out how he 's true to his values and his ideals fully , '' said CNN political commentator Van Jones .
`` I think Hillary and Bernie both misunderstand this movement . I think Hillary just sees it as just a bunch of rowdy kids that at some point will just calm down and fall into line , '' he said , later adding , `` I think Bernie actually only sees the good in his followers . I think Bernie really misunderstands there is a nasty edge to his following that he 's not taking seriously enough . ''
Sen. Tim Kaine criticized Sanders ' responses in the wake of reports that Democrats felt threatened at and following the convention .
`` What he did yesterday was sort of say it 's the party 's fault , '' Kaine told CNN . `` That deflection of responsibility is not leadership . ''
Kaine added that the angry protests could be `` dirty tricksters in the crowd '' and not just Sanders ' supporters .
`` I do n't think we should assume that all of the people raising hell are Bernie people , '' Kaine said .
Speaking in Southern California Tuesday night , Sanders fired up the crowd by calling out the Democratic leadership .
`` The Democratic Party is going to have to make a very , very , profound and important decision . It can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change . That is the Democratic Party I want to see . '' Sanders said .
`` I say to the leadership of the Democratic Party : Open the doors , let the people in ! Or the other option for the Democratic Party , which I see as a very sad and tragic option is to choose and maintain its status quo structure , remain dependent on big money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy , '' he said .
The crowd responded by chanting , `` Bernie or Bust ! '' the equivalent of the Republican # NeverTrump slogan for the Democratic race .
His speech barreled through his list of Clinton contrasts , comparing his stances with her ( and criticizing those stances ) on minimum wage , fracking , breaking up the big banks , and her use of super PACs .
In response to the chaos in Nevada , Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook simultaneously praised the passion and participation of Sanders ' supporters while adding that Clinton believes that `` no one should be intimidated , harassed or threatened in this process . '' He called on them to focus that energy on unifying the party , a task that could be difficult given the raw feelings many Sanders supporters have for Clinton after the primary .
`` Supporters of both Clinton and Sanders deserve respect for the work they have put into their campaigns , '' Mook said . Ultimately , we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose -- to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trump 's hands . ''
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Wednesday downplayed any tensions between the two campaigns .
He recalled a similar `` tenor '' to the 2008 contest between Clinton and Obama , saying those tensions were `` no less intense '' and did n't lead to a negative result in the general election .
`` I think one of the lessons of 2008 is not to confuse passion in primary for disinterest in the general election , '' he said , adding that `` highly motivated '' supporters were good for democracy .

While the spotlight this year was on the Republican primary and prospect for a contested convention and protests at the national convention in Cleveland , some Democrats now worry about that happening at their convention in Philadelphia .
Wasserman Schultz said the incidents in Nevada would result in the DNC reviewing its procedures for Philadelphia .
`` As a result of this happening this weekend , we will have conversations both at the staff level as well as my having conversations with the candidates so that we can make sure that both campaigns are focused on making sure that we can allow this process for the duration of the primary to play out in a civil and orderly way , '' she said .
But the DNC chairwoman said she was n't worried about violence happening at the convention .
`` This was absolutely a serious concern , which is why I said what needed to be said yesterday and others have said that there was real concern , '' Wasserman Schultz told Blitzer Wednesday afternoon . `` But it is important and I am confident that the candidates take the messages to heart about making sure that we respond and conduct ourselves in a civil and orderly way . ''
California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein , however , warned that Sanders ' intention to take his candidacy to the Democratic convention could spark unrest similar to the chaotic 1968 convention in Chicago and the riots surrounding it .
`` It worries me a great deal , '' Feinstein told CNN 's Manu Raju . `` You know , I do n't want to go back to the '68 convention , because I worry about what it does to the electorate as a whole -- and he should , too . ''
And Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois also said he 's concerned about violence in Philadelphia .
`` We saw what happened at the Trump rallies , which broke into violence , people punching one another . I do n't want to see that happen at the Democratic Party , '' Durbin told CNN . `` I call on Bernie to say to his supporters : be fervent , be committed but be sensible . Do n't engage in any violence . ''
Weaver pledged Tuesday night that the convention will be peaceful .
`` There 's not going to be any violence in Philadelphia , Wolf , I guarantee you that , '' he said on CNN . `` We hope for a fair and orderly convention .

""It worries me a great deal,"" Feinstein told CNN's Manu Raju. ""You know, I don't want to go back to the '68 convention, because I worry about what it does to the electorate as a whole -- and he should, too.""

And Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois also said he's concerned about violence in Philadelphia.

""We saw what happened at the Trump rallies, which broke into violence, people punching one another. I don't want to see that happen at the Democratic Party,"" Durbin told CNN. ""I call on Bernie to say to his supporters: be fervent, be committed but be sensible. Don't engage in any violence.""

Weaver pledged Tuesday night that the convention will be peaceful.

""There's not going to be any violence in Philadelphia, Wolf, I guarantee you that,"" he said on CNN. ""We hope for a fair and orderly convention.""",www.cnn.com,left,JoehZPAXUpxzj0aR

The crown jewel, of course, is the ongoing disaster of ObamaCare. From its embarrassing rollout and non-functional web site to the broken promises about being able to keep your current plans that turned into the “Lie of the Year,” ObamaCare has been the utter catastrophe that Republicans accurately predicted years ago.

Its impact on our health care system is undeniably bad. All across this country, people are losing their current plans and doctors. Competition and choice are going down; cost of care and premiums are going up.

What’s the answer from tone deaf politicians in Washington? People might have to get used to paying more for their plans.

That’s wrong.

Further, ObamaCare is wreaking havoc on the country’s economic health as well. A report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) this week predicted ObamaCare would kill more than two million jobs.

The CBO, a trusted and credible voice amid the partisan rancor of Washington, projected that many workers, particularly those in the middle and lower classes, would limit their work hours in order to meet the ObamaCare eligibility requirements.

In this still sputtering economy, government should be providing incentives for people to work more, not less. That basic fact seems like obvious common sense to you, me and most every other American, but then again, upside down is often right side up in President Obama’s broken Washington, D.C.

The president is quick to blame others for his failures and shortcomings, often trying to shift the focus to President George W. Bush (who’s been living in Texas for the last five years) or Republicans in Congress. And while there is plenty of blame to go around in both parties for our current dysfunctional status, ultimately there’s only one president at a time, and it’s up to him or her to lead.

A more appropriate target for the current sorry state of affairs would be Democrats in Congress who have been loyally marching behind this president as he leads this country into the abyss. Democrats from red and purple states like to tout themselves at home as “moderates” or “independents” in line with the interests and values of their voters.

Neither the failed stimulus that spent close to a trillion dollars nor ObamaCare would be here without Senate Democrats. No amount of glossy campaign literature or polished TV ads can change these simple facts.

From his falling poll numbers to the paltry interest in his State of the Union, it’s clear the American people have tuned out President Obama and his vision for the future of the country.

Before we get a chance to change direction in the White House in 2016, we get to replace the members of Congress in 2014 that have been enabling the president’s unpopular agenda.

Let's break it down by issues and compare the current field to figures in history and leading politicians from the UK.

When there's a Democratic nominee, we will reprise the format, adding Trump and world leaders.

Taxes

Taxes will always be a hot-button political issue in the US.

Back in 1992, Bill Clinton came into office with a fairly ambitious plan to reverse many of the Ronald Reagan-era tax cuts, but he still enacted a middle-class tax cut as part of his package. Democrats today are more aggressive.

Amy Klobuchar typifies the ""moderate"" position of wanting to raise corporate taxes, but not back to pre-Trump levels, and ensure that all billionaires pay at least 30% of their income in taxes. Michael Bloomberg has called for a 5% surtax on income above $5m - part of a plan he says will raise $5tn.

The real action comes with those seeking funding for their more ambitious plans, however. Elizabeth Warren has proposed a tax on all wealth above $50m - property, stock, everything - that would bankroll her education and healthcare programmes.

Across the pond, Margaret Thatcher set the baseline with her conservative, tax-and-regulation-slashing agenda.

Healthcare

Healthcare, the top issue for many Democratic voters, has been the source of spirited debate for all the 2020 candidates.

The biggest differences are between candidates like Pete Buttigieg, who endorses a government-run health insurance option to compete with private companies, and Sanders, who wants a government-run system to replace all private insurance. Warren originally endorsed the Sanders plan, but she's recently called for a more incremental path to getting there.

Obama considered a ""public option"" (now endorsed by Buttigieg) when pushing his Affordable Care Act through Congress in 2010, but it was considered a political bridge too far. Now, all the Democrats are on the other side of that particular river - although none are advocating an entirely government-run healthcare system like the UK's NHS, which even Conservative Prime Minster Boris Johnson wholeheartedly defends.

Immigration

Former President Barack Obama strongly backed immigration reform, including giving many undocumented US residents a pathway to citizenship, but he also increased enforcement of US immigration laws and increased deportation of new entrants and those with criminal records. His Vice-President, Joe Biden, has defended the Obama record and promises to restore his policies after Donald Trump's hard-line changes.

Former candidate Julian Castro was the first to propose repealing a law that made entering the US without proper documentation a criminal offence. Castro has since endorsed Warren, and she has adopted his proposal, as well as backing the elimination of private immigration detention centres and the movement by ""sanctuary cities"" to refuse to co-operate with federal immigration officials.

On the other side of the spectrum sits Nigel Farage, the godfather of Brexit and an ardent foe of the EU's immigration policies.

Foreign policy

One of the more spirited exchanges during the January Democratic debate in Iowa was between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders over how engaged the US should be in the Middle East and the necessity of maintaining US military forces overseas.

The divide between Biden, the former chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, and Sanders, a long-time peace activist, stretches back decades - and was on stark display during Biden's support and Sanders' opposition to the 2002 Iraq War authorising resolution.

Tulsi Gabbard was not on that debate stage, but she is without a doubt the most outspoken non-interventionist in the Democratic field, as the Iraq War veteran regularly rails against what she says are never-ending US ""regime change"" wars.

Gabbard is still arguably to the right of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, however.

Meanwhile, the position of President Lyndon Baines Johnson - the architect of the Vietnam War - on this chart is a reminder that Democrats could be considerably more hawkish than they are now.

Trade

There have always been anti-free-trade currents in the Democratic party, but in 1993 Bill Clinton effectively overcame their opposition to push through the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).

The party has moved rather decisively to the left on trade in recent years, however, with Elizabeth Warren opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, among other recent trade deals. Bernie Sanders has gone one step further, opposing Trump's Nafta renegotiation, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.

Michael Bloomberg is the free-trade outlier in the field, having called on the US to rejoin a renegotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership and vocally denounced Trump's trade war with China. He's still a far cry from British free-trader Tony Blair, who backed the UK's EU membership, wanted to offer membership to Turkey and advocated replacing the British pound with the euro.

Environment

Former Vice-President and Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore was once the face of the Democratic Party's environmentalist movement. When he ran for president in 2000, he backed a plan that included using tax credits, market incentives and government technological investments to address climate change and other threats to the globe.

While ambitious at the time, it pales in comparison to the Green New Deal, which all the Democratic candidates have agreed to, at least as a framework to build on. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, in particular, have made addressing climate change a top issue. While Biden hasn't spent as much time touting his environmental plan, it is - on paper - at least as extensive.

Mccarthy, Bill Corsair","Protesters at a rally against Trump administration immigration policies in Washington , D.C. , June 28 , 2018 . ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )
Key Trump administration officials have been confronted at restaurants . Representative Maxine Waters ( D. , Calif. ) urged protesters to hound Trump officials at restaurants , gas stations , or department stores .
Progressive pundits and the liberal media almost daily think up new ways of characterizing President Trump as a Nazi , fascist , tyrant , or buffoon . Celebrities openly fantasize about doing harm to Trump .
Just as Barack Obama was not a centrist , neither is Trump . Obama promised to fundamentally transform the United States . Trump pledged to do the same and more — but in the exact opposite direction .
The Trump agenda enrages the Left in much the same manner that Obamacare , the Obama tax hikes , Obama ’ s liberal Supreme Court picks , and the Iran nuclear deal goaded the Right .
Yet the current progressive meltdown is about more than just political differences . The outrage is mostly about power — or rather , the utter and unexpected loss of it .
In 2009 , Obama seemed to usher in a progressive revolution for a generation .
Democrats controlled the House . They had a supermajority in the Senate . Obama had a chance to ensure a liberal majority on the Supreme Court for years .
Democrats had gained on Republicans at the state and local levels . The media , universities , professional sports , Hollywood , and popular culture were all solidly left-wing .
A Republican had not won 51 percent of the popular vote in a presidential election since George H.W . Bush ’ s 1988 defeat of Democrat Michael Dukakis . Before 2016 , Republicans had lost the popular vote in five of the previous six presidential elections .
And then visions of a generation of progressive grandeur abruptly vanished .
Obama left behind a polarized nation . Democrats lost both the House and the Senate . During Obama ’ s tenure , Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the state level .
Foolishly , Clinton tried to ensure a landslide victory by wasting precious campaign time in unwinnable red states such as Arizona and Georgia . Meanwhile , she too often neglected winnable purple states such as Florida , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin , all of which Obama had won in 2008 and 2012 . Clinton apparently forgot that the Electoral College , not the popular vote , elects a president .
After his election , President Trump did not implode as predicted . By following the Obama precedent of relying on executive orders , Trump began recalibrating everything from immigration enforcement to energy development .
To progressives , Trump became not an opponent to be beaten with a better agenda , but an evil to be destroyed . Moderate Democrats were written off as dense ; left-wing fringe elements were praised as clever .
Abroad , Trump did what no other Republican president would have dared , bombing ISIS into submission , canceling the Iran deal , seeking to denuclearize North Korea , pulling out of the Paris climate accord , and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem .
The U.S. economy took off with new tax cuts and deregulation . Radical improvement in unemployment , economic growth , and oil and natural-gas production created new consumer and business confidence .
Despite his frequent crudeness , Trump is inching toward a 50 percent approval rating in a few polls . That has only made an impotent opposition grow even more furious — both at the other half of the country for supporting Trump , and at a buoyant Trump himself for baiting and ridiculing progressives in the fashion of no prior president .
Worse still , much of the loss of progressive power was at least partly self-inflicted .
Former Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid foolishly dropped the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster for executive appointments and most judicial nominations in 2013 . That blunder ensured Republicans the chance to remake the Supreme Court when they took over the Senate in 2014 .
Obama chose not to try to win over his opposition , but to alienate it by veering hard left in his second term . Hillary Clinton foolishly got herself into a number of personal scandals that embarrassed her party and helped lead to her defeat .
In reaction to the sudden loss of political power , Democrats would have been wise to run to the center , as did Bill Clinton , who all but ended the era of the Reagan Republicans .
They could have dropped their obsession with identity politics and instead attempted to win over blue-collar voters with more inclusive class appeals rather than racial appeals .
Instead , Democrats have endlessly replayed the 2016 election . In Groundhog Day fashion , Hillary Clinton repeatedly offered tired excuses for her loss .
To progressives , Trump became not an opponent to be beaten with a better agenda , but an evil to be destroyed . Moderate Democrats were written off as dense ; left-wing fringe elements were praised as clever .
Voters in 2016 bristled at redistribution , open borders , bigger government , and higher taxes , but progressives are now promising those voters even more of what they didn ’ t want .

There’s no better explanation for the current progressive meltdown.

Key Trump administration officials have been confronted at restaurants. Representative Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) urged protesters to hound Trump officials at restaurants, gas stations, or department stores.

Progressive pundits and the liberal media almost daily think up new ways of characterizing President Trump as a Nazi, fascist, tyrant, or buffoon. Celebrities openly fantasize about doing harm to Trump.

What is behind the unprecedented furor?

Just as Barack Obama was not a centrist, neither is Trump. Obama promised to fundamentally transform the United States. Trump pledged to do the same and more — but in the exact opposite direction.

The Trump agenda enrages the Left in much the same manner that Obamacare, the Obama tax hikes, Obama’s liberal Supreme Court picks, and the Iran nuclear deal goaded the Right.

Yet the current progressive meltdown is about more than just political differences. The outrage is mostly about power — or rather, the utter and unexpected loss of it.

In 2009, Obama seemed to usher in a progressive revolution for a generation.

Democrats controlled the House. They had a supermajority in the Senate. Obama had a chance to ensure a liberal majority on the Supreme Court for years.

Democrats had gained on Republicans at the state and local levels. The media, universities, professional sports, Hollywood, and popular culture were all solidly left-wing.

A Republican had not won 51 percent of the popular vote in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush’s 1988 defeat of Democrat Michael Dukakis. Before 2016, Republicans had lost the popular vote in five of the previous six presidential elections.

And then visions of a generation of progressive grandeur abruptly vanished.

Obama left behind a polarized nation. Democrats lost both the House and the Senate. During Obama’s tenure, Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the state level.

Presumptive winner Hillary Clinton blew the 2016 presidential election.

Foolishly, Clinton tried to ensure a landslide victory by wasting precious campaign time in unwinnable red states such as Arizona and Georgia. Meanwhile, she too often neglected winnable purple states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all of which Obama had won in 2008 and 2012. Clinton apparently forgot that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, elects a president.

After his election, President Trump did not implode as predicted. By following the Obama precedent of relying on executive orders, Trump began recalibrating everything from immigration enforcement to energy development.

To progressives, Trump became not an opponent to be beaten with a better agenda, but an evil to be destroyed. Moderate Democrats were written off as dense; left-wing fringe elements were praised as clever.

Abroad, Trump did what no other Republican president would have dared, bombing ISIS into submission, canceling the Iran deal, seeking to denuclearize North Korea, pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

The U.S. economy took off with new tax cuts and deregulation. Radical improvement in unemployment, economic growth, and oil and natural-gas production created new consumer and business confidence.

Despite his frequent crudeness, Trump is inching toward a 50 percent approval rating in a few polls. That has only made an impotent opposition grow even more furious — both at the other half of the country for supporting Trump, and at a buoyant Trump himself for baiting and ridiculing progressives in the fashion of no prior president.

Worse still, much of the loss of progressive power was at least partly self-inflicted.

Former Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid foolishly dropped the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster for executive appointments and most judicial nominations in 2013. That blunder ensured Republicans the chance to remake the Supreme Court when they took over the Senate in 2014.

Obama chose not to try to win over his opposition, but to alienate it by veering hard left in his second term. Hillary Clinton foolishly got herself into a number of personal scandals that embarrassed her party and helped lead to her defeat.

In reaction to the sudden loss of political power, Democrats would have been wise to run to the center, as did Bill Clinton, who all but ended the era of the Reagan Republicans.

They could have dropped their obsession with identity politics and instead attempted to win over blue-collar voters with more inclusive class appeals rather than racial appeals.

Instead, Democrats have endlessly replayed the 2016 election. In Groundhog Day fashion, Hillary Clinton repeatedly offered tired excuses for her loss.

To progressives, Trump became not an opponent to be beaten with a better agenda, but an evil to be destroyed. Moderate Democrats were written off as dense; left-wing fringe elements were praised as clever.

Voters in 2016 bristled at redistribution, open borders, bigger government, and higher taxes, but progressives are now promising those voters even more of what they didn’t want.

Furious over the sudden and unexpected loss of power, enraged progressives have so far done almost everything to lose even more of it.

And that paradox only leads to more furor.

Lee, Carol.Lee Wsj.Com","WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama is encountering an increasingly resistant Democratic caucus on Capitol Hill , as lawmakers in his party break with him on a series of issues in the run-up to the November elections .
On issues such as judicial nominees , the Keystone XL pipeline , taxes and trade , the fraying party unity is a sign that individual Democrats have reached a point where their own re-election needs take precedence over Mr. Obama 's goals .
It is a common election-year posture for lawmakers from the same party as the sitting president , especially one whose popularity has waned , as Mr. Obama 's has . But Democrats ' recent moves to demonstrate their independence are forcing Mr. Obama to compromise on an agenda already largely opposed by Republicans . And it comes at a point in his presidency when time is running short to accomplish his goals .
In the past week , Democrats have diverged from the White House over its insistence that the cost of extending certain tax breaks due to expire should be offset with tax increases and other measures , so as not to add to the deficit .
Related Videos Will the Democrats keep the Senate ? WSJ 's Janet Hook and Reid Epstein say that 's getting harder to answer as the election draws near . Some Democrats who looked hopeless now have a chance . At the same time , Republicans are putting up stronger candidates , and no incumbents have lost primaries so far . Ben Sasse , the `` establishment '' Republican candidate in Nebraska , edged out the more conservative candidates for the Republican primary in Nebraska . WSJ 's Reid Epstein explains its significance .
Other Democrats , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , expressed opposition to one of Mr. Obama 's judicial nominees . Mr. Reid and more than 40 Democratic senators also signed a letter to the administration voicing concern about its preliminary decision to exempt South Korea from a trade-policing mechanism .
`` This is part of the Catch-22 about second terms : Members want to get re-elected , and the president wants to have his agenda . Those do n't always sync , '' said Chris Kofinis , a Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Sen. Joe Manchin ( D. , W.Va. ) .
There are some ways in which divisions with the White House could be useful to Democrats in the midterm election . Mr. Obama opted to delay , likely until after the elections , a decision on construction of the Keystone XL pipeline , which Republicans and some Democrats on the November ballot support . Vulnerable Democratic senators in swing states who back the pipeline and want Mr. Obama to support it used his decision to show their independence from the White House , Democratic officials say .
The White House also had to contend with Senate Democrats who want to vote on the pipeline despite Mr. Obama 's position .
The White House , including Mr. Obama , held a series of meetings with congressional Democrats earlier this year to try to minimize party splits leading up to the midterms . The president 's team crafted an agenda under the theme of providing Americans with increased economic opportunities , after getting support from key Democrats . The aim was to rally Democrats around policies such as raising the minimum wage , providing equal pay for women and making college more affordable .
The White House has taken other pre-emptive steps to minimize opposition , such as close coordination with Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D. , Mass . ) on a student-loans bill . Mr. Obama had disagreed with congressional Democrats over the interest rate proposed in a previous bill .
`` On all of the core items of our agenda , there is near 100 % Democratic unity—minimum wage , equal pay , infrastructure , Affordable Care Act , '' said Dan Pfeiffer , a senior White House adviser . Mr. Pfeiffer also believes there is more unity in the president 's party in 2014 than in 2010 , or among Republicans in 2006 under President George W. Bush .
That may be true , said Dana Perino , who was White House press secretary during Mr. Bush 's second term . But , she said , the divisions within the GOP under Mr. Bush and among Democrats in Mr. Obama 's first term were due in part to the ambitious size of their agendas . In 2010 , Mr. Obama was defending an overhaul of the health-care system . Mr. Bush , Ms. Perino noted , attempted a Social Security overhaul in his second term , which sent nervous Republicans running away from the White House .
It may be easier for the White House to keep Democrats on board now than in previous cycles , she said , because Mr. Obama 's second-term proposals are `` not very bold . ''
White House officials say Democratic opposition to Mr. Obama 's judicial nominees is small : Of more than 250 judges confirmed in more than five years , seven drew resistance from some Democrats , according White House spokesman Eric Schultz .
But the pushback among Democrats on some nominees has raised questions about the White House 's outreach to Congress . Mr. Obama 's nominee for U.S. District Court judge in Georgia , Michael Boggs , drew opposition this past week from Mr. Reid , who has been a key White House ally . Mr. Boggs 's nomination was part of a deal the White House made with Republicans to muscle through the president 's other picks , but Democrats have balked over his support as a Democratic legislator for antiabortion measures , his opposition to same-sex marriage and a vote against removing the Confederate flag from the Georgia state flag .
Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D. , Vt. ) said he did n't feel bound by any deal made between the administration and Republican senators .
`` This is a deal the White House made . They did n't discuss it with me , '' Mr. Leahy said of Mr. Boggs 's nomination . `` And nobody at the White House serves in the Senate . ''
The White House is now facing a new battle that has prompted some Democrats to voice concerns about the administration . Mr. Obama has moved in recent days to try to contain a potential scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs over wait times at its health facilities , with calls for some administration officials to resign .
`` I believe strongly that there is a need for a new management team , '' Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D. , Conn. ) , said earlier this week .
The goals of Mr. Obama and Democrats in Congress are likely to increasingly diverge as the election gets closer and the president looks to secure his legacy , said Jim Manley , a Democratic strategist who was a longtime adviser to Mr. Reid .
`` It 's not going to be a hard line and all of the sudden cooperation is done , but folks are going to be looking for ways to try to take a different path from the administration , '' Mr. Manley said . `` That 's the way it 's always been , and that 's the way it will always be . This is a time when Democrats begin to consider more whether they can cross the administration and get away with it . ''","WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama is encountering an increasingly resistant Democratic caucus on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers in his party break with him on a series of issues in the run-up to the November elections.

On issues such as judicial nominees, the Keystone XL pipeline, taxes and trade, the fraying party unity is a sign that individual Democrats have reached a point where their own re-election needs take precedence over Mr. Obama's goals.

It is a common election-year posture for lawmakers from the same party as the sitting president, especially one whose popularity has waned, as Mr. Obama's has. But Democrats' recent moves to demonstrate their independence are forcing Mr. Obama to compromise on an agenda already largely opposed by Republicans. And it comes at a point in his presidency when time is running short to accomplish his goals.

In the past week, Democrats have diverged from the White House over its insistence that the cost of extending certain tax breaks due to expire should be offset with tax increases and other measures, so as not to add to the deficit.

Related Videos Will the Democrats keep the Senate? WSJ's Janet Hook and Reid Epstein say that's getting harder to answer as the election draws near. Some Democrats who looked hopeless now have a chance. At the same time, Republicans are putting up stronger candidates, and no incumbents have lost primaries so far. Ben Sasse, the ""establishment"" Republican candidate in Nebraska, edged out the more conservative candidates for the Republican primary in Nebraska. WSJ's Reid Epstein explains its significance.

Other Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, expressed opposition to one of Mr. Obama's judicial nominees. Mr. Reid and more than 40 Democratic senators also signed a letter to the administration voicing concern about its preliminary decision to exempt South Korea from a trade-policing mechanism.

""This is part of the Catch-22 about second terms: Members want to get re-elected, and the president wants to have his agenda. Those don't always sync,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.).

There are some ways in which divisions with the White House could be useful to Democrats in the midterm election. Mr. Obama opted to delay, likely until after the elections, a decision on construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Republicans and some Democrats on the November ballot support. Vulnerable Democratic senators in swing states who back the pipeline and want Mr. Obama to support it used his decision to show their independence from the White House, Democratic officials say.

The White House also had to contend with Senate Democrats who want to vote on the pipeline despite Mr. Obama's position.

The White House, including Mr. Obama, held a series of meetings with congressional Democrats earlier this year to try to minimize party splits leading up to the midterms.

It may be easier for the White House to keep Democrats on board now than in previous cycles, she said, because Mr. Obama's second-term proposals are ""not very bold.""

""He doesn't have a robust agenda, anyway,"" she said.

But where do they stand on the issues ? While the candidates often agree on substance if not style , here 's a look at five areas where they differ - not just from each other , but from their presidential predecessors , as well .
Bernie Sanders promises he will reduce income inequality through changes to US through tax policy . He has called for a 10 % tax surcharge on billionaires , raising the top three tax brackets and creating a new top rate , boosting capital gains and estate taxes , extending Social Security taxes , going after income made abroad by US corporations , and creating a new 0.2 % tax on all earners to fund a paid family leave programme .
Hillary Clinton 's tax plan is basically Sanders-lite . She wants a 4 % surtax on income over $ 5 million , an increase in capital gains taxes , the closing of `` tax loopholes '' for the wealthy , taxing hedge fund managers ' `` carried interest '' income at higher rates and increasing the estate tax rate .
Bill Clinton also raised taxes on the wealthy - and caught considerable criticism from conservatives for doing so . He instituted two new high-level tax brackets , raised corporate taxes , and increased income subject to Medicare and Social Security levies . After Republicans took control of Congress two years into his administration , he signed legislation lowering the capital gains taxes . He also increased a tax credit for poorer workers .
John F Kennedy was the original Democratic tax-cutter . He reduced the top rate in the US from 95 % to 65 % and the corporate tax rate from 52 % to 47 % . Today 's conservatives love to quote his claim that a high tax rate `` siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power '' .
Bernie Sanders has set the bar when it comes to higher education policy in the modern Democratic Party , with his call for free college for all Americans funded by taxing Wall Street financial transactions . He points to the runaway costs of higher education as one of the driving forces behind growing income inequality in the US .
Hillary Clinton supports a plan to make two-year community college free , but her higher education policies are more modest . She has called for lowering student loan interest rates , providing $ 17.5 billion to improve the quality of higher education and encouraging colleges to set affordable tuition rates that do n't require student loans .
Barack Obama signed legislation streamlining the student loan system , including provisions that allow the government to directly loan money to students rather than rely on for-profit middle-men . He has also proposed making the first two years of college free , with a programme modelled on a Tennessee system devised by the state 's Republican governor .
Lyndon Baines Johnson is the godfather of the modern Democratic Party 's education policies . As president he spearheaded passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965 , which increased federal funding for universities and provided low-interest student loans and grants for needy students . It was landmark legislation in its day - but now seems relatively modest .

For Bernie Sanders , however , that particular half-loaf is far from enough . He wants to institute a single-payer government-run health insurance system fashioned on Medicare . He has also called for allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies in order to lower prices and permitting Americans to import medication from Canada , where it is less expensive .
Hillary Clinton has said Mr Sanders is advancing an unrealistic proposal that threatens hard-won healthcare reforms made during Mr Obama 's tenure .

In 1993 she was the driving force behind Bill Clinton 's proposed legislation , which created a federal minimum-benefits healthcare package with limits on out-of-pocket expenses , all provided by regional healthcare alliances . That effort went down in flames before it even came to a vote in Congress .
The one place where Clinton comes at Sanders from the left
Hillary Clinton is the first prominent Democratic presidential candidate to openly run on a gun-control platform since Al Gore 's losing campaign in 2000 . She supports holding gun manufacturers liable for deaths caused by their products , expanding background checks and prohibiting those on no-fly list from purchasing firearms . She has also supported reinstating the ban on semi-automatic `` assault '' rifles .
Bernie Sanders , a senator from the rural state of Vermont , has a more moderate position on guns - although he has moved to the left over the course of the campaign . He supports expanded background checks on gun purchases and an assault weapons ban , but opposes holding gun manufacturers liable for deaths . He voted against a gun purchase waiting period multiple times in the early 1990s and for allowing guns in national parks .
Barack Obama shied away from campaigning on gun control in his two presidential campaigns , but the murder of schoolchildren in Newtown , Connecticut , in December 2012 convinced him to act . He has since called for an assault weapons ban and expanded background checks . He has taken unilateral executive action to increase enforcement of laws against gun trafficking and broadening the scope of federal regulation of firearm transactions .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the first serious effort at gun control by a Democratic president to date and his call in 1934 to create a national firearm registry and institute a federal tax on all gun purchases . No major Democratic officeholder would even consider broaching such a proposal today . It would n't just be dead on arrival in Congress , for many politicians it would be political suicide .

But where do they stand on the issues? While the candidates often agree on substance if not style, here's a look at five areas where they differ - not just from each other, but from their presidential predecessors, as well.

Taxes

They will go up - but for whom?

Bernie Sanders promises he will reduce income inequality through changes to US through tax policy. He has called for a 10% tax surcharge on billionaires, raising the top three tax brackets and creating a new top rate, boosting capital gains and estate taxes, extending Social Security taxes, going after income made abroad by US corporations, and creating a new 0.2% tax on all earners to fund a paid family leave programme.

John F Kennedy was the original Democratic tax-cutter. He reduced the top rate in the US from 95% to 65% and the corporate tax rate from 52% to 47%. Today's conservatives love to quote his claim that a high tax rate ""siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power"".

Higher education

Pitching college education that's free or just affordable

Bernie Sanders has set the bar when it comes to higher education policy in the modern Democratic Party, with his call for free college for all Americans funded by taxing Wall Street financial transactions. He points to the runaway costs of higher education as one of the driving forces behind growing income inequality in the US.

Hillary Clinton supports a plan to make two-year community college free, but her higher education policies are more modest. She has called for lowering student loan interest rates, providing $17.5 billion to improve the quality of higher education and encouraging colleges to set affordable tuition rates that don't require student loans.

Barack Obama signed legislation streamlining the student loan system, including provisions that allow the government to directly loan money to students rather than rely on for-profit middle-men. He has also proposed making the first two years of college free, with a programme modelled on a Tennessee system devised by the state's Republican governor.

Lyndon Baines Johnson is the godfather of the modern Democratic Party's education policies. As president he spearheaded passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which increased federal funding for universities and provided low-interest student loans and grants for needy students. It was landmark legislation in its day - but now seems relatively modest.

Healthcare

Mend it or end it - and start over from scratch.

Barack Obama supported and signed legislation increasing government regulation of the health insurance industry and creating private insurance markets for individuals not covered by employer-provided insurance. The programme was based, in part, on Republican proposals from the 1990s and the system instituted in Massachusetts by then-Governor Mitt Romney.

For Bernie Sanders, however, that particular half-loaf is far from enough. He wants to institute a single-payer government-run health insurance system fashioned on Medicare. He has also called for allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies in order to lower prices and permitting Americans to import medication from Canada, where it is less expensive.

Hillary Clinton has said Mr Sanders is advancing an unrealistic proposal that threatens hard-won healthcare reforms made during Mr Obama's tenure.

No major Democratic officeholder would even consider broaching such a proposal today. It wouldn't just be dead on arrival in Congress, for many politicians it would be political suicide.

Foreign policy

Remember the Iraq War? Bernie Sanders does.

Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, was one of the more hawkish members of Mr Obama's cabinet. It's no surprise then that as a presidential candidate she is well to the right of Mr Sanders and even Mr Obama. She has called for greater US involvement in the Syrian civil war, including enforcing a no-fly zone, and supports a continued US military presence in Afghanistan.

Bernie Sanders generally agrees with Barack Obama's foreign policies - limited involvement in Syria and an emphasis on working with US allies. He contrasts himself with Mrs Clinton by noting the past US military action that she supported and he opposed - in Libya and Iraq. He supports a full US withdrawal from Afghanistan and no US training of rebels in the Syrian civil war.

Is it really possible that Democrats have learned so little from the success of McConnell ’ s “ just say nothing ” approach ?
The reality , however , is that while McConnell certainly did break precedent and certainly did have this kind of strategy , GOP opposition was less across-the-board than it ’ s remembered in liberal folk history . Obama passed a number of significant bills with Republican support in his first two years in office , and Democrats have , thus far , been drastically less cooperative with Trump ’ s Cabinet nominees than Republicans were with Obama ’ s .

Obama was inaugurated on January 20 , standing in front of a record crowd despite the freezing cold weather . The very next day the Senate confirmed six of his Cabinet secretaries — Hillary Clinton , Ken Salazar , Tom Vilsack , Steven Chu , Arne Duncan , and Janet Napolitano .

The very next day , the Senate unanimously confirmed Obama ’ s nominees for HUD , Transportation , Environmental Protection Agency , United Nations ambassador , Securities and Exchange Commission chair , and the Council on Environmental Qualities .

Ron Kirk got 38 . Tim Geithner got 10 . Kathleen Sebelius ended up being the most contentious nomination , since anti-abortion groups decided to go hard at her , but she still got nine Republican votes .
At the time , there were only 40 Republican senators , so that meant about a quarter of the GOP caucus was voting for even the most controversial nominees .
Trump ’ s nominees have received much less support than Obama ’ s . Even his least controversial nominees like Defense Secretary James Mattis and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have drawn token opposition from someone looking to make a point .
Obama ’ s legislative agenda , of course , met with considerably more resistance . But though his signature creation of a new health care program — paired with a consequential overhaul of student loans — was famously passed on a strict party line vote , basically nothing else he did was .

But there was also a whole raft of less controversial — but still consequential — bills that passed with bipartisan majorities :
Beyond those seven measures , the 111th Congress also passed a series of lower-profile economic stimulus measures — an employment benefits extension , a payroll tax holiday , the “ cash for clunkers ” program — outside of the main stimulus bill , all of which garnered at least a handful of Republican votes .
To be clear , Democrats who say that Obama faced an unprecedented level of partisan opposition are not misremembering .
George W. Bush came into office with a much weaker electoral mandate than Obama , but nonetheless ended up getting a dozen Senate Democrats to vote for his tax cut plan . After the GOP gained seats in the 2002 midterms , Democrats simply chose to allow the GOP to pass a Medicare reform plan without filibustering it , even though the Republicans didn ’ t have 60 votes to pass the bill .
Democrats were surprised to see that they received no comparable deference on anything . They were also surprised by the GOP leadership ’ s determination to simply throw as much sand in the gears as possible of many of these bills — using extensive delaying tactics even when they didn ’ t have the votes to block legislation — in order to chew up floor time and limit the amount Democrats could accomplish . Republicans also used their filibustering prerogatives to delay or block the confirmation of many sub-Cabinet appointees , often for trivial reasons .
Most of all , McConnell ensured that the dominant narrative of Obama ’ s first year in office was one of highly partisan conflict . The stimulus passed with some GOP votes and was honestly not that substantively different from the Republican alternative . But as the economy continued to deteriorate , Republicans excoriated it as a blunder and a failure . They lured Democrats into a trap on health care , where Chuck Grassley and others maintained a protracted facade of bipartisan negotiations even while party leaders endlessly slagged the reform process . It ’ s not that nothing else got done so much as nobody heard about anything else .
And — with a not-so-trivial helping hand from objectively bleak background economic conditions — it paid off in the 2010 midterms .
Republicans would counter , of course , that this was all merely retaliation for unprecedented Democratic obstruction during the Bush administration . Democrats counter-charge that Bill Clinton faced unprecedented obstruction . Republicans say the real problem was the tactics Democrats used to block Robert Bork ’ s Supreme Court confirmation back in the 1980s .
The truth is that this is a ratchet that has been shifting for a long time .
In the middle of the 20th century , the two political parties did not offer clearly contrasting ideologies . That meant members of Congress generally felt cross-pressured between partisan and ideological imperatives , and it fostered a broadly cooperative atmosphere . For decades now that has been changing , as both parties have become more ideological and thus members of Congress from both parties face more pressure from their respective activist bases to “ stand up to ” the other side . This means each new president is greeted by a level of uncooperativeness from the opposition party that is genuinely unprecedented .
The “ Reagan Revolution ” of 1981- ’ 82 was undertaken even though Democrats held a majority in the House of Representatives because Speaker Tip O ’ Neil was willing to repeatedly bring Republican bills to the floor that would then pass with the support of a small number of conservative Democrats — a scenario that is totally unthinkable under today ’ s legislative norms .

Obama signed lots of bills that got GOP votes

Republican obstruction really was unprecedented

After the GOP gained seats in the 2002 midterms, Democrats simply chose to allow the GOP to pass a Medicare reform plan without filibustering it, even though the Republicans didn’t have 60 votes to pass the bill.

Legislating keeps getting more partisan, activists keep wanting more

Republicans would counter, of course, that this was all merely retaliation for unprecedented Democratic obstruction during the Bush administration.

In other words, are they opposed to bombing only when the missions are ordered by Republicans?

There is anecdotal evidence, at least, that some on the left have lost their antiwar passion now that George W. Bush has decamped to Texas. Which means they’re more about partisanship than principle.

Democrats have something else to fear after the November midterms besides just an all Republican-controlled Congress: President Barack Obama.

With Obama’s political career winding down and poll numbers continuing to languish, his party brethren fret that their own president — forced to work with GOP majorities — would give away the store on key policy issues ranging from the budget to energy and trade. It’s a concern congressional Democrats have voiced every time Obama and Vice President Joe Biden tried to cut big fiscal deals with Republicans — and the panic is now more palpable with the growing prospect of a Senate GOP majority.

Story Continued Below

Washington’s current gridlock may seem destined to last forever, but divided government has produced strange bedfellows before. President George W. Bush switched teams on some key issues in his final two years after Democrats took the House and Senate, becoming a cap-and-trade convert who bailed out Wall Street. President Bill Clinton partnered with the same Republicans who impeached him to overhaul welfare and balance the budget. And President Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Tip O’Neill found common ground reforming the Tax Code and Social Security.

While tackling anything comprehensive with legislation sounds far-fetched before the next president is sworn in, that doesn’t mean there won’t be moments starting after November when Obama would be tempted to negotiate with Republicans following four years of stalemate. After all, the GOP would have greater leverage. And with the White House on the line in 2016, Republicans will also want to prove they aren’t just against Obama but actually capable of governing again.

“Clearly it’s a concern. It keeps me awake at night,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “From his standpoint, better to advance the ball and maybe give away some stuff than leave nothing at all. From our standpoint, better to fight another day than give away core principles of contents and conviction.”

Democrats on both ends of the Capitol were openly skeptical when asked about Republicans running the legislative agenda, particularly since any Senate GOP majority would still be well short of the 60-vote thresholds needed to overcome filibusters, much less the two-thirds majority to override Obama vetoes. For starters, House Republicans wouldn’t be flying solo anymore with oversight, meaning subpoena power and testy hearings on the IRS, EPA and Benghazi would be run by the likes of Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa on Judiciary, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma on Environment and Public Works and John McCain of Arizona on Armed Services.

But it’s the prospect of what Obama might bargain on with Republicans that has Democrats really riled up.

“I’m not going to create nightmares where none exist right now. But certainly for the paranoid there’s plenty to fear, and maybe even just for the fearful there’s plenty to fear,” Blumenthal said, while adding that he still had a “basic trust in [Obama’s] commitments and his instincts.”

But It Might Change the Democratic Party.,2019-10-19,"Alexandra Glorioso, Bill Scher","Susan Walsh/AP Photo 2020 AOC ’ s Sanders Endorsement Won ’ t Change 2020 . But It Might Change the Democratic Party . Here ’ s what it signals : Even if Bernie won ’ t be with us forever , his socialist movement will be .
Bill Scher is a contributing editor to ███ Magazine , and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show “ The DMZ . ”
The anticipated endorsement of Bernie Sanders as her preferred candidate for president by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday will not determine the winner of the Democratic presidential primary . Endorsements almost never matter . But this one does—for the future of the Democratic Party , not the future of its 2020 presidential campaign .
The timing of Ocasio-Cortez ’ s endorsement sends a sharp message to the party establishment and the progressive movement : We socialists are not here for Elizabeth Warren ’ s reformed capitalism . We socialists want socialism , and we ’ re not keeping quiet until we get it . Ocasio-Cortez seems to be telling us that Sanders and his movement will still be with us when he ’ s gone—and that she aims to be the one who leads it .
Ocasio-Cortez is making her move at a pivotal point in the race . Warren has eclipsed Sanders as not just the left-wing frontrunner , but the race ’ s frontrunner , leading or tied for the lead in most national and early state polls . Two weeks ago , Sanders suffered a heart attack , raising serious questions about whether his campaign could even continue . If Ocasio-Cortez didn ’ t see a significant difference between Warren and Sanders , or if she wanted to cozy up to Warren and be seen as part of her team , she would have great incentive to endorse Warren , urge her fellow socialists to join her , and help squelch any ideological skirmishing on the left .
Some progressive commentators worry that friction between Warren and Sanders—or more accurately , between Warren and Sanders supporters—is hurting the chances of progressives to sideline the party ’ s moderates and the donor class . “ All you people squabbling at your desks about whether Warren or Sanders is scarier to big money are missing the damn point , ” scolded Time editor-at-large Anand Giridharadas on Twitter . “ Together they make up a two-headed populist uprising against plutocracy. ” Late last month , The Nation ’ s editor , D.D . Guttenplan , advised progressive voters not to choose between Warren and Sanders until absolutely necessary . Instead , “ hope the two candidates maintain their truce , competing to outdo each other in the boldness of their ideas and the breadth and passion of their support , ” he wrote .
Yet Ocasio-Cortez is choosing , provocatively so . To make the endorsement at this moment is to say : Not so fast , Elizabeth .
Both Warren and Sanders want big tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations , single-payer health insurance , free public college , easier union organizing and tougher trade deals . Both have eschewed hitting the large donor circuit , stress that their agendas are designed to empower the poor and working class , and threaten the power of consolidated wealth . Both have scoffed at bipartisan incrementalism .

But It Might Change the Democratic Party. Here’s what it signals: Even if Bernie won’t be with us forever, his socialist movement will be.

Bill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show “The DMZ.”

The anticipated endorsement of Bernie Sanders as her preferred candidate for president by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday will not determine the winner of the Democratic presidential primary. Endorsements almost never matter. But this one does—for the future of the Democratic Party, not the future of its 2020 presidential campaign.

The timing of Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement sends a sharp message to the party establishment and the progressive movement: We socialists are not here for Elizabeth Warren’s reformed capitalism. We socialists want socialism, and we’re not keeping quiet until we get it. Ocasio-Cortez seems to be telling us that Sanders and his movement will still be with us when he’s gone—and that she aims to be the one who leads it.

Story Continued Below

Ocasio-Cortez is making her move at a pivotal point in the race. Warren has eclipsed Sanders as not just the left-wing frontrunner, but the race’s frontrunner, leading or tied for the lead in most national and early state polls. Two weeks ago, Sanders suffered a heart attack, raising serious questions about whether his campaign could even continue. If Ocasio-Cortez didn’t see a significant difference between Warren and Sanders, or if she wanted to cozy up to Warren and be seen as part of her team, she would have great incentive to endorse Warren, urge her fellow socialists to join her, and help squelch any ideological skirmishing on the left.

Some progressive commentators worry that friction between Warren and Sanders—or more accurately, between Warren and Sanders supporters—is hurting the chances of progressives to sideline the party’s moderates and the donor class. “All you people squabbling at your desks about whether Warren or Sanders is scarier to big money are missing the damn point,” scolded Time editor-at-large Anand Giridharadas on Twitter. “Together they make up a two-headed populist uprising against plutocracy.” Late last month, The Nation’s editor, D.D. Guttenplan, advised progressive voters not to choose between Warren and Sanders until absolutely necessary. Instead, “hope the two candidates maintain their truce, competing to outdo each other in the boldness of their ideas and the breadth and passion of their support,” he wrote.

Yet Ocasio-Cortez is choosing, provocatively so. To make the endorsement at this moment is to say: Not so fast, Elizabeth.

Both Warren and Sanders want big tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations, single-payer health insurance, free public college, easier union organizing and tougher trade deals. Both have eschewed hitting the large donor circuit, stress that their agendas are designed to empower the poor and working class, and threaten the power of consolidated wealth. Both have scoffed at bipartisan incrementalism.

However, if you are a committed socialist, the differences between Sanders and Warren are crucial. Nathan Robinson of the influential socialist magazine Current Affairs last month detailed his problems with Warren. Some were rooted in tactical concerns that she wouldn’t build a political operation to overwhelm the ruling class, as she’s a “law professor” and not a “movement-builder.” But at bottom, Robinson wrote, “I don’t like to say that I can’t trust Elizabeth Warren, but I can’t.” He pointed to this year’s State of the Union address: “Donald Trump promised that America would ‘never be a socialist country.’ Warren stood up and applauded, as Bernie sat and fumed. This was a very clear ‘Which side are you on?’ moment.”

At a similar moment, Ocasio-Cortez has chosen to remind everyone of which side she’s on.

The differences are not strictly symbolic or theoretical. Take climate. Sanders envisions a truly massive federal government intervention to avert the climate crisis: a $16.3 trillion investment over 15 years, including the establishment of public ownership of electric utilities. Warren not only puts far less money on the table, but she also believes the profit motive can help protect the climate. Asked during the CNN climate forum whether she agreed with Sanders on public ownership, Warren stuck to her capitalistic guns. “Gosh, you know, I'm not sure that that's what gets you to the solution,” she said, and added, “If somebody wants to make a profit from building better solar panels and generating better battery storage, I'm not opposed to that.”

Warren has echoed Sanders on single-payer health insurance, even weathering question after question about how much she would raise taxes to pay for it. But the fact that she hasn’t always held that position, and still hasn’t released her own detailed plan, leads some to challenge the depth of her commitment. The socialist hosts of the Chapo Trap House podcast torched Warren in June for having a plan for everything but health care. Said one, “All of sudden all the specificity and granular policy … goes out the window when it comes to one issue that directly challenges a key constituency of the Democratic elite.”

Sure, they both propose taxing wealth, not just annual income. But Sanders is more aggressive, with higher rates levied on a broader class of multimillionaires, bringing $1.75 trillion more in revenue over 10 years.

Sanders even said in August: “The private sector is the sector of society which creates most of the wealth in America. And I want them to continue to do that” albeit checked and balanced by a “vibrant public sector.”

Still, by expressing a desire for government to own at least some of the means of production, and to place a ceiling on how much wealth individuals can accumulate, Sanders forces us to take his socialistic language seriously. Certainly, Ocasio-Cortez does.

Fox News’ Laura Ingraham views Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement through the lens of crass political self-interest. “I keep thinking it’s really about a future presidential run for AOC,” Ingraham said.

Democrats are in worse shape than when President Barack Obama came into office — the number of seats they have in Congress , the number of governors , a party approval rating that ’ s fallen behind Republicans for the first time in recent history , enthusiasm , energy . The White House , Brazile said when she came to meet with Simas , has got to focus for the next two years on getting the party into better shape , and Obama ’ s the best and most effective person to get out the message .
As much Hillary Clinton anticipation as there is , two weeks later , Democrats are still reeling and anxious . Obama may have built his political career without the party — and created anti-establishment alternatives — but he ’ s a lame duck with a new Congress that ’ s been elected to oppose him . He needs Democrats . And they need him .
“ The base craves his leadership , ” Brazile said in an interview later that week , following a meeting of the DNC committee that ’ s beginning to set the rules for the next presidential nomination . “ They want him in the mix , talking about what Democrats accomplished , what Democrats are fighting for , and what the president has done to make lives better . ”
Nancy Pelosi was reelected minority leader . So was Harry Reid . Debbie Wasserman Schultz ’ s term at the DNC isn ’ t up until 2017 . Obama said repeatedly before and after the votes were counted that he wasn ’ t going to fire anyone because of election results . But if no one ’ s going to take the blame for 2014 , Democrats are hoping he ’ ll take responsibility for getting things better for 2016 .

At least until the next presidential campaign begins in earnest , Democrats say , it ’ ll be up to Obama to centralize the Democratic message around something other than simply trying to paint the Republicans as extreme .
Interviews with leading party strategists turn to three main suggestions : Obama should be a much more frequent and strong voice on Democratic priorities , he should transform his West Wing political office from a midterm clearinghouse to an instrument for true party outreach , and he should reinvest his energy in the Democratic National Committee — including seeking a full-time chair who can begin the major clean-up and overhaul they need ahead of 2016 .
And if doing it for the party isn ’ t enough for Obama , Democrats say , do it out of self-interest .
“ A strong party is the key to a lasting legacy , ” said a senior Democratic strategist . “ Whether it ’ s for our ideals as Democrats or it ’ s for his personal legacy — if we lose the White House and continue to get gutted down ballot , they will repeal the ACA and everything else we ’ ve fought so hard for , and all of this will be for naught . ”
That should be a short-term worry for Obama too , Brazile said .
“ The Republicans have not retreated from the battlefield , so why should President Obama surrender ? ” she said . “ He can ’ t give up , he can ’ t waver . All of that looks to Democrats like he doesn ’ t stand for much , and it ’ s not the truth . ”
In the West Wing , they ’ ve been projecting optimism since the midterms . The trip to Asia was a success , they say : Obama showed with the China carbon emissions deal how big and how bold he could go without Congress .

There was progress , even , on the trade deals that might make up a big chunk of the limited agenda on which the White House is hoping to find workable compromises with Republicans .
Look for more of that kind of leveraging of the president ’ s existing power and bully pulpit to tackle base priorities , aides say . White House chief of staff Denis McDonough initiated a process about a month before Election Day of internal conversations and outside advice , and they ’ re already in the initial stages of formulating a State of the Union they promise will be heavy on new proposals — which aides insist has so far not been reshaped by the Republican wins or loss of the Senate .
“ People are licking their wounds… trying to figure out where they go from here : ‘ Can we be the phoenix rising from the ashes ? ’ Where are these issues where he ’ s going to dig in his heels and fight ?

Through the election cycle , people in the White House would often say they felt frustrated and Obama to get out more and talk more about his message . Now , aides see two years of opportunities for a president who won ’ t be constrained anymore , who ’ ll be able to say what he wants without worrying about how it could scramble anyone else ’ s political considerations .
Great , Democrats say . Now make something of it . Talk about the economic progress that ’ s happened . Talk about how to achieve job growth to build on it .
“ The best thing he can do is focus on income inequality , and talk about and propose things , and just be a fierce advocate for addressing the economic divide , ” said another Democratic strategist with ties to the White House . “ That will leave people after two years saying the Democratic Party really stands for something . ”
“ What Bush failed to do , and to some extent Bill Clinton failed to do , is to make the final two years of their presidency something big , and advocate for it and make it a defining characteristic of the party , ” the strategist said . “ You have to come something that defines who your party is — even if you don ’ t make law and you ’ re not successful in the effort . ”
The White House declined comment on its own political plans , but over at the DNC , they say they ’ re already feeling good about the level of Obama involvement that many people in and around the party headquarters have complained about for years .
“ This president has been incredibly engaged and helpful to everything we ’ ve done , ” said DNC communications director Mo Elleithee , citing Obama ’ s help on measures including retiring the DNC debt and beefing up the party data infrastructure . “ He ’ s helped grow the party infrastructure nationally ever since his 2008 campaign , and he ’ s all in with us moving forward . ”
In Congress , where most Democrats feel bruised and battered from what most say has been a consistently standoffish and inattentive president , even among those who speak most warmly about him , there ’ s a warning that he can ’ t count on the caucus ’ s unwavering support over the next two years .
“ When it comes to climate , and when it comes to immigration , we ’ re in sort of alignment . In trade and other areas , it ’ s not so clear , ” said Sen. Brian Schatz ( D-Hawaii ) . “ It ’ s going to depend on the issue , the kind of coalition . ”
But fixing the political problems is going to be even tougher given the history over the last six years , said Rep. Bill Pascrell ( D-N.J. ) .
“ We have lost our way . It ’ s a stormy ocean and we ’ re trying to find out way back to land to see where the hell we are , ” Pascrell said . “ But you can ’ t get back to land until you have a deep discussion , not just a philosophical , but a tangible , discussion about where we are as a party . It ’ s kind of difficult in the last two years of the presidency to do that because we have not had that kind of relationship . ”
Obama , said a White House aide speaking the day before the election , is very interested in the question of his political legacy himself .
“ He brought a bunch of people in the process in ’ 08 . They sat out in ’ 10 . Then it was a real question . Then they came out again in really good numbers in ’ 12 . Are these people going to become Democratic voters ? Are we going to be able to turn the Obama voter into a Democratic voter the way Reagan was able to turn the Reagan Democrat into a Republican ? ” the aide said . “ If you can do that , we will not just be a presidential party , we will also have success in congressional elections , but also the priorities that we care about will be the ones that shape the discussion going forward . ”
Asked how that process was going so far , the aide deferred .","Enough, Donna Brazile told White House political director David Simas the day after the midterms.

Democrats are in worse shape than when President Barack Obama came into office — the number of seats they have in Congress, the number of governors, a party approval rating that’s fallen behind Republicans for the first time in recent history, enthusiasm, energy. The White House, Brazile said when she came to meet with Simas, has got to focus for the next two years on getting the party into better shape, and Obama’s the best and most effective person to get out the message.

As much Hillary Clinton anticipation as there is, two weeks later, Democrats are still reeling and anxious. Obama may have built his political career without the party — and created anti-establishment alternatives — but he’s a lame duck with a new Congress that’s been elected to oppose him. He needs Democrats. And they need him.

“The base craves his leadership,” Brazile said in an interview later that week, following a meeting of the DNC committee that’s beginning to set the rules for the next presidential nomination. “They want him in the mix, talking about what Democrats accomplished, what Democrats are fighting for, and what the president has done to make lives better.”

Nancy Pelosi was reelected minority leader. So was Harry Reid. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s term at the DNC isn’t up until 2017. Obama said repeatedly before and after the votes were counted that he wasn’t going to fire anyone because of election results. But if no one’s going to take the blame for 2014, Democrats are hoping he’ll take responsibility for getting things better for 2016.

“He may or may not be the best messenger,” said Vic Fazio, the former California congressman who was the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair for the 1994 rout. “But at this point, he is still our messenger. And the first year is very important.”

At least until the next presidential campaign begins in earnest, Democrats say, it’ll be up to Obama to centralize the Democratic message around something other than simply trying to paint the Republicans as extreme.

Interviews with leading party strategists turn to three main suggestions: Obama should be a much more frequent and strong voice on Democratic priorities, he should transform his West Wing political office from a midterm clearinghouse to an instrument for true party outreach, and he should reinvest his energy in the Democratic National Committee — including seeking a full-time chair who can begin the major clean-up and overhaul they need ahead of 2016.

And if doing it for the party isn’t enough for Obama, Democrats say, do it out of self-interest.

“A strong party is the key to a lasting legacy,” said a senior Democratic strategist. “Whether it’s for our ideals as Democrats or it’s for his personal legacy — if we lose the White House and continue to get gutted down ballot, they will repeal the ACA and everything else we’ve fought so hard for, and all of this will be for naught.”

“The Republicans have not retreated from the battlefield, so why should President Obama surrender?” she said. “He can’t give up, he can’t waver. All of that looks to Democrats like he doesn’t stand for much, and it’s not the truth.”

Look for more of that kind of leveraging of the president’s existing power and bully pulpit to tackle base priorities, aides say. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough initiated a process about a month before Election Day of internal conversations and outside advice, and they’re already in the initial stages of formulating a State of the Union they promise will be heavy on new proposals — which aides insist has so far not been reshaped by the Republican wins or loss of the Senate.

Behind closed doors, they’re a little more shaken.

“People are licking their wounds… trying to figure out where they go from here: ‘Can we be the phoenix rising from the ashes?’ Where are these issues where he’s going to dig in his heels and fight? Where does he compromise with Republicans, and how does he manage the politics of that?” said a Democratic strategist familiar with the White House.

Despite all the Democrats ' special election wins , high voter turnout in primaries and polls showing strong party enthusiasm heading into the midterms , the fact remains that Democrats are still stuck at their lowest level of power in nearly a century .
Even though President Trump 's poll numbers have stabilized , party leaders see 2018 as a chance to seize back one key lever of government : the House of Representatives . But Democrats and their core voters ca n't seem to agree on the best direction to take .
Rep. Tim Ryan , D-Ohio , who unsuccessfully challenged Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , to be minority leader in 2017 , said the party is stuck in a feedback loop : `` Democrats do n't have the power , '' he said . `` We 've got to start learning how to win elections , and until you learn how to win elections , you ca n't get the power . And I think we 're in the process of figuring that out . ''
Party leaders had settled on a moderate message of outreach and competent governing as the best way to net the 23 seats needed to win the House in November . But that pragmatic and cautious game plan was scrambled last week in a shocking upset .
A Democratic Socialist newcomer , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , defeated Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary in the New York Democratic stronghold of Queens and the Bronx . Crowley is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House and was widely viewed as a potential speaker of the House .
Ocasio-Cortez 's victory is the latest example of the energy and enthusiasm of a growing activist arm of the party . However , in interviews with more than a dozen Democrats running in Pennsylvania , Illinois , Texas , California , Nebraska and Washington state , as well as with party strategists , campaign managers and elected Democrats , NPR found that pragmatism is winning out over progressivism in the key races that will decide control of Congress .
Pelosi made that point clear last week when she was asked whether Democratic Socialists like Ocasio-Cortez were ascendant in the party in general . `` It is ascendant in that district perhaps , '' Pelosi told reporters . `` Our districts are very different , one from another . ''
Pelosi and her deputies say they want a `` big tent '' party that welcomes the far left and center-left , united by goals like universal health care and access to a free or affordable college education .
Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives disagree . They say the left is energized and turning out to vote .
`` That movement is going to happen from the bottom up , '' Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview on CNN . `` That movement is going to come from voters . ''
But winning power in Washington is the only way to achieve policy goals , and national Democrats insist that progressive activism alone wo n't get them there .
Party leaders like Pelosi have data to back them up .
Democrats need to win at least 23 seats to regain a majority in the House and moderate Democrats beat progressives in primaries in all but two of the most competitive GOP-held districts in the country . Progressives are primarily winning in districts that are already controlled by Democrats — or in GOP districts where national Democrats do n't expect to compete .
Still , progressive pickups in the liberal bastions of the country like New York and California could have a significant impact if Democrats succeed in winning control of the House . Those candidates are promising to push for sweeping change — like Medicare for all , free public college tuition and the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — that would be hard to achieve with full control in Washington and nearly impossible with a Republican in the White House .
But for all the very real ways the Democratic Party is drifting left , the fact is that victories like Ocasio-Cortez 's have been rare this year . Crowley was the first Democratic incumbent to lose .
In many cases , particularly in the Senate , primary challengers never emerged .
That outcome would have been hard to believe in January 2017 , when Democratic senators were drawing heckles and protests for not doing enough to challenge the Trump administration .
When the entire Senate Democratic Caucus stood outside the Supreme Court to protest Trump 's first travel ban , they were n't greeted with cheers , but rather heckles of `` do your job '' and `` walk the walk , '' because they were n't voting en masse to oppose every single Trump Cabinet nominee .
At one point , protesters swarmed the Brooklyn home of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , chanting , `` What the f * * * , Chuck ? ''
With several moderate — even conservative — Democrats up for re-election this year , the prospect of primary challenges from the left seemed high . And yet , no incumbent Senate Democrat faced a serious primary test this year .
Not Joe Donnelly , Joe Manchin or Heidi Heitkamp , who all voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court ; not Claire McCaskill , who has repeatedly criticized the Medicare-for-all approach so many Democrats are endorsing ; and not Bob Casey , who sometimes opposes abortion rights .
Democrats credit a rare outbreak of grass-roots pragmatism for the lack of Senate-side infighting . `` These are people with proven track records . They have been fighting for the people in their states , '' said Sen. Chris Van Hollen , D-Md. , who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . `` I think it 's very clear to Democratic primary voters that it did not make sense to have a challenge in those races . ''
`` There 's just a lot of work to do , and so I think you 're seeing a progressive movement that is being extremely smart in where it chooses to put its resources and where it 's choosing to direct its power , '' said Stephanie Taylor , co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee . `` We have a chance to flip the House and do it with great progressive candidates who are on the field , who need our support and resources . ''
Progressives have notched key wins in several high-profile House primaries . In addition to last week 's New York upset , Kara Eastman won a surprise victory in an Omaha-area Nebraska district .
But in most House primaries , pragmatism has ruled the day — including in the northern suburbs of Los Angeles , where a young moderate named Katie Hill beat progressive Bryan Caforio . Hill is the former head of California 's largest anti-homelessness organization and the daughter of a local nurse and a local police officer . She is a lifelong gun owner who backs some gun control measures and has a plan to protect the Affordable Care Act as a transition to a single-payer health care system .
Party leaders rejoiced when she won , in part because the nonpartisan Cook Political Report predicted before the primary that a victory for Hill would give Democrats their best shot at beating incumbent Rep. Steve Knight , R-Calif. , in November .
That was good news for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , which , for the most part , has viewed more moderate — or at a minimum , less confrontational — candidates as the best chance to flip the Republican-held districts needed to win back the House majority .
Looking back at the party 's key electoral victories over the past year , many Democratic leaders see a theme : Virginia Gov . Ralph Northam , Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb are all low-key centrists who campaigned on local issues and an overall message of competence and outreach .
Joe Trippi , a top strategist on the Jones campaign , sees that approach as the best way for Democrats to take back the House . `` When you get that confrontational tone , what you do is drive people to their corners , '' he said .
`` These districts are gerrymandered , or they 're red states like Alabama . If you drive people to their [ partisan ] corners , then you 're going to lose . People are looking at the chaos and division and bitterness in Washington and they 're looking at these two candidates from either party and they 're asking [ are they ] going to add to that chaos and division ? ''
But while moderates are advancing in this year 's most critical House districts and Senate races , there is no question that Democratic energy overall is shifting to the left .
`` We have had real success in moving the ideology of the Democratic Party to be a pro-worker party to stand up to the billionaire class , '' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said . Surveying the political landscape , the independent senator , who caucuses with the Democrats , and his political advisers see a much different party than the one whose nomination Sanders ran for in 2016 .
`` The ideas that he was talking about — Medicare for all , a $ 15 minimum wage , free tuition at public colleges and universities , radical criminal justice reform , immigration reform — many of these issues were considered fringe issues , and now they are mainstream issues that we take for granted that , of course , there are legions of Democratic candidates running on these platforms , '' said Sanders ' 2016 campaign manager , Jeff Weaver .
When Sanders rolled out his latest Medicare-for-all legislation in 2017 , the list of co-sponsors was a who 's who of likely 2020 Democratic presidential contenders : California Sen. Kamala Harris , New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker , among others .
Weaver credited an `` alphabet soup of progressive organizations '' for boosting 2018 primary candidates campaigning on these policies . The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has run candidate boot camps , conducted fundraising and run ads for progressive candidates .
`` The way for Democrats to win is not to be tepid and conservative , '' said Taylor . `` The best way to win is to be out there campaigning boldly on economic issues like Medicare for all . ''
But when progressives have lost primaries this cycle , they 've by and large endorsed the establishment victors .
Take one of the higher-profile establishment-vs.-grass-roots proxy wars of the 2018 primary season : Texas 's 7th Congressional District in the Houston suburbs . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made candidate Laura Moser the poster woman of squeezed-out activists when it publicly dropped a broadside of damaging opposition research about her background and writing career .
Moser ultimately lost to party-backed Lizzie Fletcher in the suburban Houston seat — an archetype of the high-income , high-education district that Democrats are targeting as their most direct path to a House majority . But unlike many insurgent candidates during the peak of the Tea Party era , Moser was quick to join ranks with Fletcher after the primary ended .
`` Huge congratulations to [ Fletcher ] , '' she tweeted in the hours after the race was called . `` You ran a great race and I look forward to helping you flip # TX07 in November . ''
Whether or not Democrats take control of the House , it may not be as easy to govern the country — or simply their own caucus — as it is to coalesce around a general election candidate .
The number of progressives in Congress is expected to grow over time as liberal enclaves shift further to the left . That could pose a serious problem for Democratic leaders who are already being criticized by candidates on both sides of the political spectrum for being out of touch with the direction of the party .
Candidates across the country have been hounded with questions about whether they will support Pelosi as leader . A growing number , including Ocasio-Cortez and Lamb , have been unwilling to commit . They say they 'll wait to see who actually runs for those top leadership spots , but there is already a tension brewing over what kind of policies the party should pursue next year .
Progressives want leaders who are younger and more in touch with the activist class . Ocasio-Cortez started a nationwide push among activists to abolish ICE , while others are demanding a move to single-payer health care .
Rep. Tim Ryan and many of his supporters say future party leaders need to heed those demands carefully .
`` It 's a balance between saying what your values are and what your ambitions are , and the reality of governing , '' Ryan said . `` You do that in a campaign , and then hopefully you get enough people help you to get [ to Washington ] so you can get as close to those goals as you possibly can . ''
But even some members of Pelosi 's core leadership team say there could be benefits to holding votes on progressive policies that Trump and Senate Republicans would inevitably block . Rep. David Cicilline , D-R.I. , one of three top messaging gurus elected by House Democrats , said that strategy could motivate voters to elect a Democrat to replace Trump in 2020 .
`` They 're going to see , if we 're not successful , what stood in the way , '' Cicilline said in an interview . `` They are going to have an opportunity to change that in the election . ''","For Democrats, Pragmatists Are Still Trumping Progressives Where It Counts

""We have had real success in moving the ideology of the Democratic Party to be a pro-worker party to stand up to the billionaire class,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said. Surveying the political landscape, the independent senator, who caucuses with the Democrats, and his political advisers see a much different party than the one whose nomination Sanders ran for in 2016.

""The ideas that he was talking about — Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, free tuition at public colleges and universities, radical criminal justice reform, immigration reform — many of these issues were considered fringe issues, and now they are mainstream issues that we take for granted that, of course, there are legions of Democratic candidates running on these platforms,"" said Sanders' 2016 campaign manager, Jeff Weaver.

When Sanders rolled out his latest Medicare-for-all legislation in 2017, the list of co-sponsors was a who's who of likely 2020 Democratic presidential contenders: California Sen. Kamala Harris, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, among others.

Weaver credited an ""alphabet soup of progressive organizations"" for boosting 2018 primary candidates campaigning on these policies. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has run candidate boot camps, conducted fundraising and run ads for progressive candidates.

""The way for Democrats to win is not to be tepid and conservative,"" said Taylor. ""The best way to win is to be out there campaigning boldly on economic issues like Medicare for all.""

But when progressives have lost primaries this cycle, they've by and large endorsed the establishment victors.

Take one of the higher-profile establishment-vs.-grass-roots proxy wars of the 2018 primary season: Texas's 7th Congressional District in the Houston suburbs. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made candidate Laura Moser the poster woman of squeezed-out activists when it publicly dropped a broadside of damaging opposition research about her background and writing career.

Moser ultimately lost to party-backed Lizzie Fletcher in the suburban Houston seat — an archetype of the high-income, high-education district that Democrats are targeting as their most direct path to a House majority. But unlike many insurgent candidates during the peak of the Tea Party era, Moser was quick to join ranks with Fletcher after the primary ended.

""Huge congratulations to [Fletcher],"" she tweeted in the hours after the race was called. ""You ran a great race and I look forward to helping you flip #TX07 in November.""

Can Democrats come together after November?

Whether or not Democrats take control of the House, it may not be as easy to govern the country — or simply their own caucus — as it is to coalesce around a general election candidate.

The number of progressives in Congress is expected to grow over time as liberal enclaves shift further to the left. That could pose a serious problem for Democratic leaders who are already being criticized by candidates on both sides of the political spectrum for being out of touch with the direction of the party.

Candidates across the country have been hounded with questions about whether they will support Pelosi as leader. A growing number, including Ocasio-Cortez and Lamb, have been unwilling to commit. They say they'll wait to see who actually runs for those top leadership spots, but there is already a tension brewing over what kind of policies the party should pursue next year.

Progressives want leaders who are younger and more in touch with the activist class. Ocasio-Cortez started a nationwide push among activists to abolish ICE, while others are demanding a move to single-payer health care.

Rep. Tim Ryan and many of his supporters say future party leaders need to heed those demands carefully.

""It's a balance between saying what your values are and what your ambitions are, and the reality of governing,"" Ryan said. ""You do that in a campaign, and then hopefully you get enough people help you to get [to Washington] so you can get as close to those goals as you possibly can.""

But even some members of Pelosi's core leadership team say there could be benefits to holding votes on progressive policies that Trump and Senate Republicans would inevitably block. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., one of three top messaging gurus elected by House Democrats, said that strategy could motivate voters to elect a Democrat to replace Trump in 2020.

""They're going to see, if we're not successful, what stood in the way,"" Cicilline said in an interview. ""They are going to have an opportunity to change that in the election.""",www.npr.org,center,jiVbBDDvPFNxBexQ

democratic_party,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/keith-ellison-dnc-chair-howard-dean-232154,Dean's drop-out reshapes DNC chair fight,2016-12-02,"Heather Caygle, John Bresnahan, Ben White, Michael Crowley, Gabriel Debenedetti","DENVER — Keith Ellison came to Colorado seeking to cement his position as the front-runner for Democratic National Committee chairman . But the Minnesota congressman ended the week in worse shape than when it started .
Just hours after Ellison ’ s role as the favorite was thrown into question by a stinging condemnation of his past statements about Israel by the Anti-Defamation League — a move Ellison and his allies vigorously rebutted — former Chairman Howard Dean dropped his comeback bid and bowed out of the race , scrambling an already complicated contest .
The three remaining announced candidates for the chairmanship — Ellison , New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley , and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison — spoke to state party officials from across the country for nearly two-and-a-half hours here at the Association of State Democratic Chairs meeting , exhaustively laying out their hopes for a rejuvenated party in displays that appeared to leave the DNC membership just as unsure of its next leader 's identity as when it entered the room .
The result is a race that ’ s even more of a muddle , with the likelihood of additional candidates jumping in prior to February ’ s vote . Ellison himself appeared to recognize his tenuous position , and pledged in his strongest terms yet to consider giving up his House seat if he gets the chair ’ s role . He pleaded with attendees to keep an open mind as he insisted the DNC would be his top priority , while the other candidates — and Dean , in his pre-recorded video — insisted over and over that the decimated party needs a full-time chair .
Democrats are still on the lookout for the obvious next leader in the Donald Trump era , an increasingly urgent imperative as they seek to minimize the recriminations and deep tactical divides that are starting to surface across the party in the wake of Hillary Clinton ’ s loss .
The party leaders need to “ pick ourselves up , ” said interim chairwoman Donna Brazile in a private session earlier in the day . “ But we should not pick each other apart . ''
The hubbub over Ellison ’ s past remarks on Israel didn ’ t surface once , despite their clear resonance among many Democrats — at a separate event Friday , influential party megadonor Haim Saban called Ellison an `` anti-Semitic and anti-Israel person . ''
The candidates instead dove into a series of promises about funding state and local operations , empowering specific constituency groups , and challenging President-elect Trump — topics that qualify as red meat for the party officials gathered in the hotel ballroom .
Each of the candidates pledged to avoid any continuation of the Clinton-Bernie Sanders brawl at the forum moderated by Colorado Democratic Party Chairman Rick Palacio , and each promised to significantly increase attention paid to the state parties themselves .
“ The Democratic Party has to transform , we have to transform from simply being a political organization looking for votes every two and four years to becoming a community organization , ” said Harrison , adding later that the committee can not afford to be wholly taken over by the presidential campaign every four years . “ The foundation of this party , the state parties , are drying up like grapes on the vine in the California sun . ''
“ Every small unit of the Democratic Party across the nation needs to be in close , tight partnership with the DNC , ” said Ellison , pointing to blue states as models for the rest of the country rather than simply as ATMs , as he pledged to place party staff across the country .
And Buckley , a vice-chairman of the DNC who led one of the most successful state parties in a 2016 election cycle that was mostly dark for Democrats , ensured the room knew his record while at the same time getting some distance from the unpopular current committee leadership .
“ The DNC has got a lot of work to do . We ’ ve got to restore some public trust , ” he said , pledging to take power away from the chair and hand it to party officers and executive committee members — such as giving the latter a say in the presidential debate schedule .
Even after the forum and Dean news , however , it was clear that the DNC members believed there ’ s still room for more entrants in the race — the assembled Democrats said they ’ d be surprised if this field is final .
`` I suspect the field is not set and other candidates may emerge , and one of the things we learned in 2016 is that having choices and competition is important , ” said Democratic strategist Dave Hamrick .
And in a new landscape with no Democratic White House or centralized rapid response operation , party leaders acknowledged the urgency in establishing the sharp end for the party spear during the opening days of Trump ’ s presidency — even though the vote for DNC chair itself won ’ t come until late February .
Weaving through the halls of the Denver Hyatt Regency earlier in the afternoon — a space otherwise occupied by a brigade representing the Colorado State Thespians group — the state party chairs and operatives were still whispering about other names jumping in , with the biggest question mark still surrounding the intentions of Labor Secretary Tom Perez , who is weighing a bid but also considering a run for Maryland governor .
The cabinet secretary is known to be a favorite of some people in the White House — and he even asked AFL-CIO chief Richard Trumka to hold off on endorsing anyone until he made a decision — but his intentions remain a mystery even to his fans .
And if not Perez , Democrats continue to wonder if another party grandee will step in to serve as a unifier .
“ A lot of the voting members are waiting for [ someone new to enter the race ] , ” said former DNC chairman and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell , recommending the re-institution of a dual- or multi-chairman system similar to the one implemented under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s , given the lack of a unanimously popular candidate .
`` Everybody likes — and I put myself in this category — Keith Ellison . We like his personality , his passion , his energy . We like that he represents the part of the party that ’ s where the energy is coming from . But everybody has doubts , with all the challenges we face , that one could do the job in a part-time capacity . ''
Both Harrison and Buckley expressed openness to such a co-chair arrangement on Friday , with the South Carolinian specifying that the roles should be split between a man and a woman .
No such deal has been struck this far ahead of the 2017 vote , however , and other Democrats who ’ ve expressed openness to a run of their own , or been talked about as possibilities , have either declined to make obvious moves forward — like NARAL president Ilyse Hogue and Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander — or bowed out altogether — like Vice President Joe Biden and former Maryland Gov . Martin O ’ Malley .
The state of play is obscured by the fact that the party ’ s core constituency and voting groups have not lined up behind individual candidates , even though Ellison remains the most heavily-endorsed of the group , especially by labor leaders . The state party chairs , for example , had informally agreed to vote as a bloc during a post-election conference call in November . But with two of their ranks now in the race , the status of that pact is unclear .
Dean ’ s exit complicates the issue even further : while he had not even consolidated support from his fellow Vermonters , a number of long-time members , like Kansas Chairman Lee Kinch , had assumed they would support him .
“ It ’ s been only three weeks since the election and it ’ s still months before the DNC will select a new chair , so there is no need to rush the process , ” said Hamrick , who managed O ’ Malley ’ s presidential campaign . `` This is the time to have a full and honest debate about the future direction of our party and who we need to lead it . ''
In the meantime , the process has been far from orderly behind the scenes .
People surrounding Ellison have been working to determine the White House ’ s intentions in the wake of speculation about a Perez endorsement while Democrats aligned with Sanders have been frustrated that the Minnesota congressman ’ s team hasn ’ t relied more on them .
All the while in the states , rank-and-file members of the DNC — the actual voters — have expressed frustration with the swift closing of ranks around Ellison within parts of Washington . That annoyance was reflected in a scathing letter circulated this week by International Association of Firefighters president Harold Schaitberger , who was furious that the AFL-CIO had circulated a ballot with only Ellison ’ s name on it .
While campaigning has yet to begin in earnest , scattershot pieces of it have been popping up on DNC members ’ cell phones and inboxes in recent weeks , even before the Hyatt ’ s halls filled with Harrison stickers and Ellison buttons .

But the Minnesota congressman ended the week in worse shape than when it started.

Just hours after Ellison’s role as the favorite was thrown into question by a stinging condemnation of his past statements about Israel by the Anti-Defamation League — a move Ellison and his allies vigorously rebutted — former Chairman Howard Dean dropped his comeback bid and bowed out of the race, scrambling an already complicated contest.

Story Continued Below

The three remaining announced candidates for the chairmanship — Ellison, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley, and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison — spoke to state party officials from across the country for nearly two-and-a-half hours here at the Association of State Democratic Chairs meeting, exhaustively laying out their hopes for a rejuvenated party in displays that appeared to leave the DNC membership just as unsure of its next leader's identity as when it entered the room.

The result is a race that’s even more of a muddle, with the likelihood of additional candidates jumping in prior to February’s vote. Ellison himself appeared to recognize his tenuous position, and pledged in his strongest terms yet to consider giving up his House seat if he gets the chair’s role. He pleaded with attendees to keep an open mind as he insisted the DNC would be his top priority, while the other candidates — and Dean, in his pre-recorded video — insisted over and over that the decimated party needs a full-time chair.

Democrats are still on the lookout for the obvious next leader in the Donald Trump era, an increasingly urgent imperative as they seek to minimize the recriminations and deep tactical divides that are starting to surface across the party in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s loss.

The party leaders need to “pick ourselves up,” said interim chairwoman Donna Brazile in a private session earlier in the day. “But we should not pick each other apart.""

The hubbub over Ellison’s past remarks on Israel didn’t surface once, despite their clear resonance among many Democrats — at a separate event Friday, influential party megadonor Haim Saban called Ellison an ""anti-Semitic and anti-Israel person.""

The candidates instead dove into a series of promises about funding state and local operations, empowering specific constituency groups, and challenging President-elect Trump — topics that qualify as red meat for the party officials gathered in the hotel ballroom.

Each of the candidates pledged to avoid any continuation of the Clinton-Bernie Sanders brawl at the forum moderated by Colorado Democratic Party Chairman Rick Palacio, and each promised to significantly increase attention paid to the state parties themselves.

“The Democratic Party has to transform, we have to transform from simply being a political organization looking for votes every two and four years to becoming a community organization,” said Harrison, adding later that the committee cannot afford to be wholly taken over by the presidential campaign every four years. “The foundation of this party, the state parties, are drying up like grapes on the vine in the California sun.""

“Every small unit of the Democratic Party across the nation needs to be in close, tight partnership with the DNC,” said Ellison, pointing to blue states as models for the rest of the country rather than simply as ATMs, as he pledged to place party staff across the country.

And Buckley, a vice-chairman of the DNC who led one of the most successful state parties in a 2016 election cycle that was mostly dark for Democrats, ensured the room knew his record while at the same time getting some distance from the unpopular current committee leadership.

“The DNC has got a lot of work to do. We’ve got to restore some public trust,” he said, pledging to take power away from the chair and hand it to party officers and executive committee members — such as giving the latter a say in the presidential debate schedule.

Even after the forum and Dean news, however, it was clear that the DNC members believed there’s still room for more entrants in the race — the assembled Democrats said they’d be surprised if this field is final.

""I suspect the field is not set and other candidates may emerge, and one of the things we learned in 2016 is that having choices and competition is important,” said Democratic strategist Dave Hamrick.

And in a new landscape with no Democratic White House or centralized rapid response operation, party leaders acknowledged the urgency in establishing the sharp end for the party spear during the opening days of Trump’s presidency — even though the vote for DNC chair itself won’t come until late February.

Weaving through the halls of the Denver Hyatt Regency earlier in the afternoon — a space otherwise occupied by a brigade representing the Colorado State Thespians group — the state party chairs and operatives were still whispering about other names jumping in, with the biggest question mark still surrounding the intentions of Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who is weighing a bid but also considering a run for Maryland governor.

The cabinet secretary is known to be a favorite of some people in the White House — and he even asked AFL-CIO chief Richard Trumka to hold off on endorsing anyone until he made a decision — but his intentions remain a mystery even to his fans.

And if not Perez, Democrats continue to wonder if another party grandee will step in to serve as a unifier.

“A lot of the voting members are waiting for [someone new to enter the race],” said former DNC chairman and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, recommending the re-institution of a dual- or multi-chairman system similar to the one implemented under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, given the lack of a unanimously popular candidate.

""Everybody likes — and I put myself in this category — Keith Ellison. We like his personality, his passion, his energy. We like that he represents the part of the party that’s where the energy is coming from. But everybody has doubts, with all the challenges we face, that one could do the job in a part-time capacity.""

Both Harrison and Buckley expressed openness to such a co-chair arrangement on Friday, with the South Carolinian specifying that the roles should be split between a man and a woman.

No such deal has been struck this far ahead of the 2017 vote, however, and other Democrats who’ve expressed openness to a run of their own, or been talked about as possibilities, have either declined to make obvious moves forward — like NARAL president Ilyse Hogue and Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander — or bowed out altogether — like Vice President Joe Biden and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.

The state of play is obscured by the fact that the party’s core constituency and voting groups have not lined up behind individual candidates, even though Ellison remains the most heavily-endorsed of the group, especially by labor leaders. The state party chairs, for example, had informally agreed to vote as a bloc during a post-election conference call in November. But with two of their ranks now in the race, the status of that pact is unclear.

Dean’s exit complicates the issue even further: while he had not even consolidated support from his fellow Vermonters, a number of long-time members, like Kansas Chairman Lee Kinch, had assumed they would support him.

“It’s been only three weeks since the election and it’s still months before the DNC will select a new chair, so there is no need to rush the process,” said Hamrick, who managed O’Malley’s presidential campaign. ""This is the time to have a full and honest debate about the future direction of our party and who we need to lead it.""

In the meantime, the process has been far from orderly behind the scenes.

People surrounding Ellison have been working to determine the White House’s intentions in the wake of speculation about a Perez endorsement while Democrats aligned with Sanders have been frustrated that the Minnesota congressman’s team hasn’t relied more on them.

All the while in the states, rank-and-file members of the DNC — the actual voters — have expressed frustration with the swift closing of ranks around Ellison within parts of Washington. That annoyance was reflected in a scathing letter circulated this week by International Association of Firefighters president Harold Schaitberger, who was furious that the AFL-CIO had circulated a ballot with only Ellison’s name on it.

While campaigning has yet to begin in earnest, scattershot pieces of it have been popping up on DNC members’ cell phones and inboxes in recent weeks, even before the Hyatt’s halls filled with Harrison stickers and Ellison buttons. Ellison, Harrison, and Buckley have been speaking with voters personally for weeks, Harrison was boosted by a letter to DNC members from influential South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn this week, and Ellison published his platform on Thursday. Harrison and Buckley each met with the state party executive directors as a group as the ADL’s condemnation of Ellison dropped Thursday.

And even though Friday’s events took place on Buckley’s home turf due to his role as the head of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, both Ellison and Harrison made sure to carve out their own space: each rented private rooms for receptions with voters elsewhere in the hotel to cap off the night.",www.politico.com,left,gILBtQHQBTc0Erob

Bernie Sanders to end his campaign without alienating his legions of supporters , as party leaders grow eager to unite the party behind Hillary Clinton and provide a more robust defense for her candidacy .
In private conversations on Capitol Hill , senior Democrats are weighing how to persuade Sanders to step aside without appearing as if they are trying to strong-arm him out of the race . In a phone call last month , Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid made the case to Sanders why it would make sense for him to leave the race after New Jersey and California vote on June 7 , according to sources familiar with the conversation .
The widespread view , according to interviews with senators , House members and senior party officials , is that Sanders needs to see the writing on the wall himself : That he has no mathematical possibility to win the race and would be better-served to see his agenda enacted if he urged his backers to support Clinton .
`` We will walk out of our convention with a nominee , '' Rep. Xavier Becerra , a California Democrat and active Clinton surrogate , told CNN . `` We should be able to walk into the convention in a consolidating mode . ''
Some top Democrats privately say Clinton should consider the ultimate way to bring the progressive firebrand 's supporters into the fold : Choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as her vice presidential pick .
Senators and aides say they 've felt reassured after recent discussions with Sanders and his advisers that he wo n't be a destructive force once voting concludes in mid-June . But Sanders has publicly vowed to take his fight to Philadelphia , something that could deprive the party of a critical month of healing and has spawned fears of unrest at the July nominating convention .
If he does n't drop out , the options on how to persuade him to quit boil down to this : Propose potential process reforms , including gutting the role of superdelegates in choosing the next nominee , give him a prime speaking slot at the Democratic Convention and even dump the head of the Democratic National Committee , Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , a controversial figure among Sanders ' supporters .
So far , Sanders has not suggested publicly that his fight could be over after California , a state he has barnstormed in recent days as he tries to pull off an upset against Clinton .
`` Our campaign has been dismissed and written off more times than I can count , '' Sanders said Wednesday in Palo Alto , California . `` We 're going to leave California with enormous momentum going into the convention . And I believe we 've got a real shot to come out of that convention with the Democratic nomination for president of the United States . ''
Behind the scenes , discussions between the Warren and Clinton camps have been markedly increasing , especially as the freshman senator has begun to a play a more prominent role attacking Donald Trump , according to a source close to Warren .
And that has only spawned increased chatter that Clinton could pick Warren , who has not endorsed either candidate and is the only female Senate Democrat not to back Clinton .
Reid has spoken out publicly against Clinton choosing a senator as a running mate whose state has a Republican governor -- like Massachusetts -- fearing the vacancy would allow a Republican to be appointed and pad the GOP 's majority .
But sources familiar with the situation tell CNN that Reid is open to the possibility of Warren as Clinton 's running mate , in no small part because it would help unite the party after a long primary season .
`` She can take away ( Bernie 's ) power by showing there 's no division within the party , '' said one Democratic source who is advocating Warren 's selection .
It 's uncertain when Warren would endorse Clinton , but the senator 's allies believe she does n't want to appear as if she 's pushing Sanders to quit before he 's ready to leave the race . Yet she also takes her role as a party uniter `` seriously , '' according to the Warren source .
Much of how the party reacts after Tuesday 's primaries will be dictated by Sanders ' own actions , officials say . If he stays in the race , softens his rhetoric against Clinton and begins the process of healing the party , there will be less consternation . But if he blasts what he considers a rigged system , berates Clinton for her corporate donations and paid speeches to big banks on Wall Street and calls for a revolution at the convention , Democrats are bound to push back .
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut , a Clinton backer , said his `` preference '' would be for Sanders to `` take a hard look '' after Tuesday and conclude he has no viable path to the nomination . He said he had no problem with Sanders continuing his campaign until July because he 's confident that the party would be able to unite against Trump .
`` One thing I 'm slightly worried about is the tone and tenor of the convention , '' Murphy added . `` We 're going to need a very positive unified convention . He 's going to have send very clear signals to his delegates that he wants them to be vocal and loud in support of Hillary in our convention . ''
Even if Sanders were to win California , where polls show the race with Clinton in a dead-heat , the math looks grim for him to win the 2,383 delegates to become the nominee . He would need 67 % of the remaining pledged delegates to take the lead over Clinton in pledged delegates alone after the District of Columbia votes on June 14 . Clinton 's lead in superdelegates , however , means she is the only candidate who can secure enough delegates to win the nomination before the convention .
Reid , in an interview with the Associated Press Wednesday , made his strongest comments yet about Sanders ' bleak chances , saying the `` math is the math '' and that `` sometimes you just have to give up . ''
`` I think he better do a little mathing , '' Reid said .
The comments are significant because Reid -- who backs Clinton -- has avoided criticizing Sanders through the course of the campaign . Reid is perhaps Sanders ' closest friend in the Senate ; the two had an emotional call when Reid informed Sanders he was backing Clinton in February . And Sanders ' wife , Jane , hugged Reid and thanked him for staying neutral before the Nevada caucuses as well .
But Reid and Democrats know they need the support of Sanders to help bring his dedicated backers behind Clinton . After the Nevada convention last month spawned angry protests from Sanders ' supporters , many argue that the senator has to play a major role to unite the party -- or risk electing Trump .

`` My sense is if he believes as passionately about the issues he 's been talking about on the campaign trail , '' Becerra said , `` then , after June 7 , there 's a passionate need for him to be advocating for someone in the White House who will make much of what he is talking about a reality . ''

Much of how the party reacts after Tuesday's primaries will be dictated by Sanders' own actions, officials say.

The requirements to make the sixth Democratic presidential primary debate to be held tonight, December 19, were the strictest the Democratic National Committee has set so far, and it will make for the most intimate debate stage yet.

Candidates had to both secure 200,000 individual donors, of which 800 must be from 20 different states or territories, and earn 4% in four DNC-approved national or early-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada.

Alternatively, candidates could satisfy the polling requirement by reaching 6% in two early-state polls. Polls released by December 12, the week before the debate, counted towards qualification.

Ten candidates qualified for the fifth Democratic primary debate, which had less strict qualification thresholds and was co-hosted by the Washington Post and MSNBC in the Atlanta, Georgia, area on Wednesday, November 20.

The December debate will be co-hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico tonight, Thursday, December 19, at Loyola Marymount University in the first DNC primary debate to be held on the West coast. It's scheduled to be three hours long, airing at 8 p.m. ET.

California moved up its primary date to Super Tuesday, situating the delegate-rich state as a key player in the 2020 primary.

Who will be on stage:

These seven candidates met both the polling and fundraising requirements, according to Politico's tracker of DNC-approved debate polls, and will be arranged on stage in this order from left to right:

While Sen. Kamala Harris of California also qualified for the December debate, she dropped out of the race on December 3, meaning she won't be on stage.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard missed the debate by one qualifying poll. On December 9, Gabbard tweeted that she would not attend the December 19 debate even if she did qualify.

After Democrats lost the Georgia special election (and, you know, every other special election this year) there's a lot of talk about whether House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi should step down from her Democratic leadership role.

Now President Trump's getting in on the chatter and threw Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer into the mix.

""I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out,"" he tweeted Thursday morning. ""That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!""

Pelosi responded later that morning, saying it was a typical Republican line – and that she believed Trump was provided it by members of his party. ""He then added the Chuck Schumer bit,"" she said at a briefing.

Pelosi defended her position and said she was a master legislator and a politically astute leader. And while she said she respects the opinions of the members of her caucus, she added, ""My decision of how long I stay is not up to them.""

Since Jon Ossoff lost to Karen Handel on Tuesday night, a few congressional Democrats have started to talk about changing the top leadership in the caucus, including Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, according to CNN.

""We need leadership change,"" Rice told CNN. ""It's time for Nancy Pelosi to go, and the entire leadership team.""

According to Politico, Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas said, ""You'd have to be an idiot"" to think winning the House in 2018 was possible with Pelosi in charge.

“Nancy Pelosi is not the only reason that Ossoff lost,"" Vela said. ""But she certainly is one of the reasons.”

Among the Democratic governors who descended on Washington this weekend for the National Governors Association winter meeting, the only difference of opinion when it came to Secretary Clinton was whether she would clear the 2016 field entirely or merely loom colossus-like over the race until, and upon entering, the campaign.

Or, as Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper put it with a bit more brevity when asked about Clinton’s impact on the campaign, “You should be asking Martin O’Malley.”

O’Malley is the second-term Maryland governor who has been perhaps the most open about his 2016 ambitions, but whose prospects are largely out of his hands as long as Clinton looms on the horizon. Count New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin and Hickenlooper himself on that same roster of accomplished Democratic governors who are younger than the 65-year-old Clinton but could find themselves stuck in their state capitals for another decade-plus should she be elected president.

While the official review is underway , here are five pieces of advice offered by strategists , pollsters and party members as the party searches for direction .
When the main concern among voters , according to exit polls , was the economy , top Democratic campaigns were focused on abortion , contraception , and running from the president . Despite signs of economic improvement , voters all over the country weren ’ t feeling it personally . Democrats failed to adequately respond to that anxiety , and ultimately failed to win votes .

People understand that average families still have n't recovered to where they were [ before ] the Great Recession . ”
Agenda items like minimum wage , pay equity , income inequality and other parts of the so-called “ fairness ” agenda are good and valuable causes , Democrats say , but they don ’ t directly address the top concern that people have about their lives , and the lives of their children , getting better .
Friday ’ s jobs report , which showed an impressive increase in employment as well as an increase in wages , underscored missed opportunities for Democrats in 2014 . “ Democrats can ’ t be afraid to cheerlead the economic gains we ’ ve made , while also laying out new ideas , like a middle-class tax cut , that addresses the economic squeeze many people still feel , ” said Doug Thornell , a Democratic strategist . “ Our focus can never waver away from the economy , and too often it has . ”
Democrats spent so much time over the past election running away from the president and his negative approval ratings that they lost the opportunity to guide the conversation about the state of the economy . Strategists say Republicans were able to tap into voters ’ economic anxiety because Democrats weren ’ t saying anything at all . Current events -- ISIL , Israel and Gaza , Ebola -- dominated news coverage and played into that sense of insecurity .
“ There is an acute and historic middle-class anxiety , and the party that fully understands it and solves it will lead for a very long time , ” said Israel . “ Republicans do a better job than Democrats on bumper stickers . … The frustration that my colleagues and I share is that voters strongly agree with Democrats on most economic issues . But then , they elect Republicans because Republicans have messaged more effectively . ”","By Caitlin Huey-Burns - December 8, 2014

For the past few years, the term “soul searching” has been associated with Republicans, as the party publicly struggled with internal divisions and bruising electoral defeats. But now it’s the Democrats’ turn.

President Obama’s party -- though many Democrats this cycle were loath to associate themselves with him -- took a monumental beating last month. Many labels have been applied to the defeat: a rout, a shellacking, a drubbing. But incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s blunt characterization was perhaps most fitting: Democrats suffered an old fashioned “butt-kicking.”

The fanny-kicking continued Saturday, when longtime Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu lost a runoff election to Republican Bill Cassidy. The loss of the last Southern Democrat was highly anticipated and doesn’t alter the makeup of the upper chamber, but it twisted the knife.

The party now is in wake-up-call mode. After the midterms, the focus on Capitol Hill quickly shifted to the now-routine budget showdowns that come with the threat of a government shutdown. With that task now complicated by Obama’s executive order on immigration, the spotlight returned to how Republicans would navigate the political waters.

But that shift in attention isn’t a respite for Democrats, who are preparing for life in the minority in Washington for the first time since 2006. Lawmakers and party strategists are busy both in public and behind the scenes assessing next steps, grappling with why they lost so badly. The Democratic National Committee announced it would conduct an election postmortem (similar to the GOP “autopsy” report of 2012), due to be published in February. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt is among those on the task force conducting the study.

Democrats also know they can’t wait for internal reviews. Sen. Chuck Schumer, one of the party’s top strategists and the upper chamber’s chief messenger, made a bold first move by saying recently that the party, in effect, made a mistake by putting its energy into passing the Affordable Care Act in 2009-10 when it should have focused on the economy and the struggling middle class. Schumer’s argument may have been muddled by the ACA reference, as several party members have endorsed the decision to push for health care reform following Obama’s 2008 win. But the New York lawmaker, who is in line to be Democratic leader one day, voiced what fellow Democrats have been thinking. His concern about the party losing the constituency it claims to care about is real and shared by most members serious about getting back on track.

“We’re a party that professes to adore the middle class, but oftentimes that’s not returned at voting booth,” said Jim Kessler, vice president of the center-left think tank Third Way.

To many Democrats, the mistakes and missed opportunities are plain to see. The need for a coherent and cohesive message while keeping the caucus together is clear. But finding one that works may prove more challenging, especially as the party has varying ideas about its economic message. The progressive wing has become especially energized by a “fairness” message, and a feeling that the system is rigged against middle-class Americans. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has come to embody that sentiment, and the more centrist Hillary Clinton has taken notice.



Democrats are also faced with the challenge of inspiring members of its current coalition while rying to win back those who belonged to the old one, namely white voters.



Though the next presidential race is rapidly approaching, Democrats must also ride out this administration. Next month’s State of the Union address will be critical to congressional Democrats’ message and policy crafting.

While the official review is underway, here are five pieces of advice offered by strategists, pollsters and party members as the party searches for direction.

Talk About Things People Actually Care About

When the main concern among voters, according to exit polls, was the economy, top Democratic campaigns were focused on abortion, contraception, and running from the president. Despite signs of economic improvement, voters all over the country weren’t feeling it personally. Democrats failed to adequately respond to that anxiety, and ultimately failed to win votes.

“We saw elections where strong pro-choice women went to the polls and elected vehemently anti-choice Republicans because we are in this historic period of middle-class economic insecurity, where people’s paychecks are paramount in their decisions,” said Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who ran House Democrats’ campaign arm.

Israel is now chairing the conference’s policy and communications shop, created in the wake of the 2014 elections. (Schumer runs the Senate’s equivalent.) Israel said he is in the process of interviewing members about solutions and messaging, and will meet with Schumer to exchange ideas this week. The caucus is focused on paychecks, Social Security, and campaign finance reform as major policy areas.

“Democrats could also try to change the conversation by saying not only do we need to focus on the issues that matter, we also need to focus on the metrics,” said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser to President Clinton. “Why aren't we talking about the incomes of middle-class families every quarter? ... People understand that average families still haven't recovered to where they were [before] the Great Recession.”

Agenda items like minimum wage, pay equity, income inequality and other parts of the so-called “fairness” agenda are good and valuable causes, Democrats say, but they don’t directly address the top concern that people have about their lives, and the lives of their children, getting better.



Friday’s jobs report, which showed an impressive increase in employment as well as an increase in wages, underscored missed opportunities for Democrats in 2014. “Democrats can’t be afraid to cheerlead the economic gains we’ve made, while also laying out new ideas, like a middle-class tax cut, that addresses the economic squeeze many people still feel,” said Doug Thornell, a Democratic strategist. “Our focus can never waver away from the economy, and too often it has.”



Democrats spent so much time over the past election running away from the president and his negative approval ratings that they lost the opportunity to guide the conversation about the state of the economy. Strategists say Republicans were able to tap into voters’ economic anxiety because Democrats weren’t saying anything at all. Current events -- ISIL, Israel and Gaza, Ebola -- dominated news coverage and played into that sense of insecurity.

“There is an acute and historic middle-class anxiety, and the party that fully understands it and solves it will lead for a very long time,” said Israel. “Republicans do a better job than Democrats on bumper stickers. … The frustration that my colleagues and I share is that voters strongly agree with Democrats on most economic issues. But then, they elect Republicans because Republicans have messaged more effectively.”",www.realclearpolitics.com,center,j75biL3FOSBh2g9G

Protests, feuding sides, booing sitting senators—it’s been night after night of anything but ordinary.

But back to Mr. Noah’s contention. We actually are unsafe—in about a thousand ways.

(For the record, Mr. Noah, the threat doesn’t always come at the end of gun.)

We’re wildly in debt, we’re at tinderbox tension levels when it comes to race relations and policing, and our Constitutional rights to bear arms, worship God and speak freely are being jeopardized.

And yes, Mr. Noah, global terror is on the rise—and no, we’re not scared of it because they’re “non-white.” It’s a threat to our future.

But I digress.

So yes, it’s been a raucous convention, but it’s been one filled with people robustly feuding over principles; over what’s the best way to keep the country on a Constitutional track. However you (or I) feel personally about the speakers and nominee, it’s been one filled with un-sugarcoated speeches about the realities of our dangerous world—and the realities of a reckless approach to managing our country.

So, next week’s the Democratic National Convention. And according to one writer, “it’ll be a far cry from Donald Trump’s Republican circus.”

Let’s take a gander, shall we?

But here’s the big one:

You’ll hear from a woman who laughed about getting a suspected child rapist off the hook; you’ll hear from a woman who enabled her husband’s abuse and philandering; you’ll hear from a woman who lied about the attack on Benghazi that killed Americans.

You’ll hear from a woman who put the country’s national security in jeopardy by sending and receiving classified emails on a private server; you’ll hear from a woman who lied to the government and the American people about it.

Most importantly, you’ll hear from a woman who got away with it all.

And at the DNC, she’ll be accepting her party's nomination for president of the United States.

So you tell me: who exactly is putting on the circus?

democratic_party,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/2016-digital-campaign-101180.html?hp=t1,"With eyes on Hillary Clinton, Democrats fight to maintain digital edge",2013-12-20,Kenneth P. Vogel,"Democrats have maintained a clear advantage over Republicans in political technology . Dems fight to maintain digital edge
President Barack Obama ’ s team of 20-something data gurus gave him a major edge in 2008 and 2012 — and now they ’ re among the leading players in a quiet struggle for control of the Democratic data market in 2016 .
The biggest prize , both symbolically and financially , is a spot on the growing team surrounding Obama ’ s 2008 rival : Hillary Clinton .
The 2016 presidential campaign will be Big Data ’ s biggest proving ground yet . Expect the savviest campaigns and their techies to surpass Obama ’ s vaunted 2012 effort , where data and analytics influenced everything from which fundraising emails went where and which ads aired when on different cable stations , to which doors got knocked and what the volunteer said when they opened .
That the competition to take it to the next level is playing out a year before Clinton or any other serious candidate might enter the 2016 race underscores the increasing importance of the intersection of Big Data and Big Money in American politics . At stake are political clout , corporate branding opportunities and lucrative contracts from unions , super PACs , candidates and party committees planning ambitious new projects .
Some of the biggest names and deepest pockets of the Clinton and Obama eras are involved in various digital efforts , including billionaire financier George Soros , Clinton insider Harold Ickes , Google ’ s Eric Schmidt and former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina .
Democrats have maintained a clear advantage over Republicans in political technology over the past few years , as Obama ’ s operation invested in and controlled the Party ’ s efforts . But the data operation was a major weakness of Clinton ’ s campaign in 2008 , which creates both uncertainty and opportunity .
The network of super PACs functioning as a sort of wink-and-nod Clinton campaign-in-waiting are at the center of the data tug of war . The hub , Ready for Hillary , is working on data initiatives that are unprecedented for a candidate-specific super PAC — let alone one planning for a presidential campaign that ’ s still two years off . Sources with knowledge of the initiatives describe them to ███ as :
1 . A 50-state voter file that will merge granular historical data for every registered voter in the country with social media and email information being collected by Ready for Hillary . While the super PAC intends to deploy the new database as early as January to mobilize supporters , its real utility would come in building and executing a model of voter coalitions and messages to win a presidential campaign .
2 . A direct mail program that would use Clinton ’ s likeness and testimonials from high-profile surrogates to raise cash and collect supporter data . It ’ s expected to launch sometime in the first quarter of 2014 , say sources in Democratic direct mail circles .
Clinton hasn ’ t endorsed Ready for Hillary , but it has at least the patina of a Clinton imprimatur , having won the backing of several high-profile Hillaryland insiders . It ’ s expected that any data it collects would be rented , swapped or sold to Clinton ’ s campaign , meaning contracts for the projects — especially the voter file work — are being closely watched as a symbolic foot in the door to the 2016 effort .
Ready for Hillary declined to comment on the new projects , but Clinton could use all the data help she can get , said Kevin Thurman , who served as Clinton ’ s deputy Internet director in 2008 .
“ Obama took it to the next level and Hillary Clinton didn ’ t , ” Thurman said , noting the Clinton team resisted using her Senate campaign or leadership PAC to begin building a national voter file before she kicked off her presidential campaign . Then , after officially entering the race , her campaign headquarters failed to utilize data effectively in its decision-making process .
“ She had the potential advantage , but her advisers didn ’ t take advantage of it , ” Thurman said . “ So the question for Hillary Clinton is not who do they hire to do data analytics , because I think the cream will rise to the top . The question will be how central data will be to their efforts , and I think they are going to make it a central point . The Clintons learn from their mistakes . ”
Ready for Hillary ’ s voter file project was awarded a couple months ago to NGP-VAN , the dominant Democratic data firm of the Obama era . It provided a national voter file aggregated from all 50 state Democratic parties and is in the process of merging it with information the super PAC has been collecting through social media and email campaigns . Those were run by a newer firm called Rising Tide Interactive that cut its teeth the last couple years doing online fundraising and advertising for congressional and gubernatorial campaigns .
The super PAC ’ s direct mail project — which also utilizes voter file data — went to the storied Democratic data outfit Catalist , according to sources with knowledge of the plans . Catalist had also sought the voter file project , sources say , and the fact it lost out to NGP-VAN raised eyebrows in tight-knit Democratic data circles , given Catalist ’ s deep connections to Hillaryland .
Catalist is spearheaded by Ickes and financed by wealthy Democratic donors associated with the liberal Democracy Alliance financing network . When it was formed in 2005 , Catalist was seen as an effort to lay the groundwork for Clinton ’ s 2008 presidential campaign and to wrest control of Democratic voter data from the national party , which at the time was struggling to build its own voter file .
Catalist did , in fact , win contracts during the 2008 campaign to provide data-related services to both the Obama and Clinton campaigns , as well as the Democratic National Committee . But , when Obama won the nomination and then the presidency , his political operation , amid bad blood with Ickes , mostly pushed Catalist to the sidelines . Obama ’ s team built up the DNC ’ s voter file and assembled reams of its own data and analytics within the Obama campaign , relying on firms like NGP-VAN and Blue State Digital .
Some Democrats worried that Obama would be stingy with his data , but his team cast its work as for the good of Democrats as a whole . It also has undeniably benefited the firms that had a piece of it .
“ There is a halo effect that , for example , we or Blue State Digital might have seen from having worked on the Obama campaigns , ” acknowledged NGP-VAN CEO Stu Trevelyan . And it ’ s more than just reputation , he said . “ Presidential campaigns have big budgets and so they can be a source of innovation and that innovation ends up trickling down through the entire market . ”
Trevelyan declined to discuss his company ’ s work for Ready for Hillary or any other client . But NGP-VAN , which started as a fundraising compliance software company back in the late 1990s , has greatly expanded its offerings and market share during Obama ’ s presidency . It struck a deal in December 2011 with all 50 state Democratic parties to aggregate their voter files and enhance them with data from another firm called TargetSmart Communications . The resulting mega-database — which is marketed as SmartVAN to campaigns and the growing crop of super PACs and nonprofits seeking to use data analytics to target their efforts — is the one obtained by Ready for Hillary .
Showing the range of groups interested in the data , other recently signed SmartVAN customers include New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’ s Mayors Against Illegal Guns , Obama ’ s post-campaign nonprofit Organizing for Action and the nonprofit Obamacare facilitator Enroll America .
After the 2012 election , NGP-VAN also snapped up a firm launched by Obama digital alums called NationalField that offers a dashboard interface allowing campaigns and their volunteers to easily access all manner of voter data on mobile devices . The acquisition allowed NGP-VAN to expand its offerings , but was also seen as an effort to preempt potential competition in the increasingly profitable industry .
The candidates , unions and super PACs are all willing to spend big for the latest in digital offerings .
NGP-VAN has been paid $ 31 million by various campaigns and committees — including Ready for Hillary , which paid $ 34,000 for website development — since the beginning of 2007 , according to Federal Election Commission filings . In that same time , Catalist has reaped $ 3.2 million in payments , though neither tally includes the host of outside groups using political data that don ’ t regularly disclose their financial details to the FEC , such as labor unions , and 501 ( c ) 4 nonprofit groups like Organizing for Action or those affiliated with the Democracy Alliance .
That ’ s where Catalist does lots of its work , and it has developed something of a stranglehold on labor ’ s data contracts . Even that niche is poised to become more competitive , though , with at least one major union said to be considering issuing a request for proposal for a voter-file related contract .
As the field has advanced and become more lucrative , an increasing number of firms have rushed in — including Obama 2012 offshoots like Civis Analytics and BlueLabs and also nonpartisan outfits like NationBuilder — blurring the lines between once distinct niches in political technology . Increasingly , firms offer the data , along with the software , Web and mobile interfaces and analytics used to process it for voter contact and targeting , advertising , fundraising and even compliance .
As 2016 approaches , Catalist has faced questions about whether it ’ s kept pace with the rapid evolution . Not long after Ready for Hillary settled on NGP-VAN for the voter file project , Catalist announced a long-planned major fundraising push to boost its game , trumpeting a $ 2.25-million lead investment from Soros , a founding member of the Democracy Alliance . Soros had invested a similar , though slightly smaller , amount during Catalist ’ s last major fundraising round , back in 2006 , when it raised $ 11 million , and this fall he also pledged $ 25,000 to Ready for Hillary .
Catalist needs the cash to integrate new technology , including social media , into its systems , said Al Dwoskin , a major Democratic donor and the second-largest investor in Catalist behind Soros . “ Doing that work is not cheap , ” Dwoskin said .
Dwoskin has yet to write a check for the latest round of fundraising , but he said Catalist benefits — rather than suffers — from its age . “ They ’ ve been at this a little longer and perhaps have more experience with the architecture and data management , ” he said .
That ’ s not the sense of author Sasha Issenberg , whose 2012 book “ The Victory Lab ” is regarded as the definitive take on political data . “ Soros Throws Catalist a Lifeline , ” Issenberg tweeted after The New York Times reported Soros ’ s investment .
Catalist CEO Laura Quinn said she is puzzled by that assessment . And , while she wouldn ’ t comment on Ready for Hillary or any other specific clients , she said that generally the Democratic data marketplace is growing .
“ It ’ s becoming bigger , healthier , ” she said . “ We don ’ t see opportunities shrinking . We see it expanding and we see investment not drying up , but accelerating . ”
Catalist would compete for 2016 presidential data work , Quinn suggested . “ There is a big evolution in hand right now , and that ’ s very natural and normal and the Party goes through this all the time , ” she said .
The Democratic rivalry in some ways mirrors that which has been raging for the past few years on the right , where various technologists and firms have competed with another — sometimes bitterly — to come up with an answer to close a technology gap with Democrats . The Republican National Committee ’ s solution was a privatized voter file called Data Trust that in some ways was meant to mirror Catalist . It was to have opened avenues for campaign and parties to benefit from the data enhancements that could be made by deep-pocketed outside groups like Karl Rove ’ s Crossroads , but Data Trust has struggled to achieve lift-off .
Centralized , party-blessed voter files are yesterday ’ s news , asserted John Phillips , CEO of Aristotle , a company that provides data and support services to campaigns and committees on both sides of the aisle — making it a competitor to some of NGP-VAN ’ s work for Democrats . “ The competition is shifting to the data-mining software and the analytics as opposed to just the data itself , because the data is only so valuable , ” Philips said . He attributed the shift partly to the decreasing power of the parties in a super PAC age in which candidates can field their own operations and aren ’ t necessarily eager to align too closely with the parties .
“ Handing over your secret data to the party is so 2008 . In 2014 and 2016 , it ’ s every man for himself , ” said Phillips . “ You still have one firm or a handful of firms that are the favored firms of the national party , but there is no more monopoly in Democratic voter data . ”
Obama ’ s data trove — which includes detailed information about the issue , voting , volunteering , donating and social media proclivities of just about every voter in America — stands as the closest thing to a Democratic master file , and questions about its ultimate fate have loomed over the Democratic data scramble .
The list ’ s keeper , former campaign manager Messina , has ambitious , but still ambiguous , data plans , as do two firms spawned from the campaign to which he maintains close ties , BlueLabs and Civis Analytics , the latter of which was seeded by Google ’ s Schmidt . Both have done modeling work for campaigns and outside groups , and the DNC has paid BlueLabs $ 107,000 over the past few months for data services .
Messina and other Obama allies debated creating a new private , Catalist-type entity to house the various Obama databases and tools .

Dems fight to maintain digital edge

President Barack Obama’s team of 20-something data gurus gave him a major edge in 2008 and 2012 — and now they’re among the leading players in a quiet struggle for control of the Democratic data market in 2016.

The biggest prize, both symbolically and financially, is a spot on the growing team surrounding Obama’s 2008 rival: Hillary Clinton.

Story Continued Below

The 2016 presidential campaign will be Big Data’s biggest proving ground yet. Expect the savviest campaigns and their techies to surpass Obama’s vaunted 2012 effort, where data and analytics influenced everything from which fundraising emails went where and which ads aired when on different cable stations, to which doors got knocked and what the volunteer said when they opened.

( PHOTOS: Who’s talking about Hillary 2016?)

That the competition to take it to the next level is playing out a year before Clinton or any other serious candidate might enter the 2016 race underscores the increasing importance of the intersection of Big Data and Big Money in American politics. At stake are political clout, corporate branding opportunities and lucrative contracts from unions, super PACs, candidates and party committees planning ambitious new projects.

Some of the biggest names and deepest pockets of the Clinton and Obama eras are involved in various digital efforts, including billionaire financier George Soros, Clinton insider Harold Ickes, Google’s Eric Schmidt and former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina.

Democrats have maintained a clear advantage over Republicans in political technology over the past few years, as Obama’s operation invested in and controlled the Party’s efforts. But the data operation was a major weakness of Clinton’s campaign in 2008, which creates both uncertainty and opportunity.

The network of super PACs functioning as a sort of wink-and-nod Clinton campaign-in-waiting are at the center of the data tug of war. The hub, Ready for Hillary, is working on data initiatives that are unprecedented for a candidate-specific super PAC — let alone one planning for a presidential campaign that’s still two years off. Sources with knowledge of the initiatives describe them to POLITICO as:

1. A 50-state voter file that will merge granular historical data for every registered voter in the country with social media and email information being collected by Ready for Hillary. While the super PAC intends to deploy the new database as early as January to mobilize supporters, its real utility would come in building and executing a model of voter coalitions and messages to win a presidential campaign.

2. A direct mail program that would use Clinton’s likeness and testimonials from high-profile surrogates to raise cash and collect supporter data. It’s expected to launch sometime in the first quarter of 2014, say sources in Democratic direct mail circles.

( PHOTOS: Stars line up for Hillary Clinton 2016)

Clinton hasn’t endorsed Ready for Hillary, but it has at least the patina of a Clinton imprimatur, having won the backing of several high-profile Hillaryland insiders. It’s expected that any data it collects would be rented, swapped or sold to Clinton’s campaign, meaning contracts for the projects — especially the voter file work — are being closely watched as a symbolic foot in the door to the 2016 effort.

Ready for Hillary declined to comment on the new projects, but Clinton could use all the data help she can get, said Kevin Thurman, who served as Clinton’s deputy Internet director in 2008.

“Obama took it to the next level and Hillary Clinton didn’t,” Thurman said, noting the Clinton team resisted using her Senate campaign or leadership PAC to begin building a national voter file before she kicked off her presidential campaign. Then, after officially entering the race, her campaign headquarters failed to utilize data effectively in its decision-making process.

( PHOTOS: 12 Democratic underdogs who could be the 2016 nominee)

“She had the potential advantage, but her advisers didn’t take advantage of it,” Thurman said. “So the question for Hillary Clinton is not who do they hire to do data analytics, because I think the cream will rise to the top. The question will be how central data will be to their efforts, and I think they are going to make it a central point. The Clintons learn from their mistakes.”

Ready for Hillary’s voter file project was awarded a couple months ago to NGP-VAN, the dominant Democratic data firm of the Obama era. It provided a national voter file aggregated from all 50 state Democratic parties and is in the process of merging it with information the super PAC has been collecting through social media and email campaigns. Those were run by a newer firm called Rising Tide Interactive that cut its teeth the last couple years doing online fundraising and advertising for congressional and gubernatorial campaigns.

The super PAC’s direct mail project — which also utilizes voter file data — went to the storied Democratic data outfit Catalist, according to sources with knowledge of the plans. Catalist had also sought the voter file project, sources say, and the fact it lost out to NGP-VAN raised eyebrows in tight-knit Democratic data circles, given Catalist’s deep connections to Hillaryland.

Catalist is spearheaded by Ickes and financed by wealthy Democratic donors associated with the liberal Democracy Alliance financing network. When it was formed in 2005, Catalist was seen as an effort to lay the groundwork for Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign and to wrest control of Democratic voter data from the national party, which at the time was struggling to build its own voter file.

( PHOTOS: Obama’s 2012 data advantage)

Catalist did, in fact, win contracts during the 2008 campaign to provide data-related services to both the Obama and Clinton campaigns, as well as the Democratic National Committee. But, when Obama won the nomination and then the presidency, his political operation, amid bad blood with Ickes, mostly pushed Catalist to the sidelines. Obama’s team built up the DNC’s voter file and assembled reams of its own data and analytics within the Obama campaign, relying on firms like NGP-VAN and Blue State Digital.

Some Democrats worried that Obama would be stingy with his data, but his team cast its work as for the good of Democrats as a whole. It also has undeniably benefited the firms that had a piece of it.

“There is a halo effect that, for example, we or Blue State Digital might have seen from having worked on the Obama campaigns,” acknowledged NGP-VAN CEO Stu Trevelyan. And it’s more than just reputation, he said. “Presidential campaigns have big budgets and so they can be a source of innovation and that innovation ends up trickling down through the entire market.”

Trevelyan declined to discuss his company’s work for Ready for Hillary or any other client. But NGP-VAN, which started as a fundraising compliance software company back in the late 1990s, has greatly expanded its offerings and market share during Obama’s presidency. It struck a deal in December 2011 with all 50 state Democratic parties to aggregate their voter files and enhance them with data from another firm called TargetSmart Communications. The resulting mega-database — which is marketed as SmartVAN to campaigns and the growing crop of super PACs and nonprofits seeking to use data analytics to target their efforts — is the one obtained by Ready for Hillary.

(PHOTOS: 2016: Who’s next?)

Showing the range of groups interested in the data, other recently signed SmartVAN customers include New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Obama’s post-campaign nonprofit Organizing for Action and the nonprofit Obamacare facilitator Enroll America.

After the 2012 election, NGP-VAN also snapped up a firm launched by Obama digital alums called NationalField that offers a dashboard interface allowing campaigns and their volunteers to easily access all manner of voter data on mobile devices. The acquisition allowed NGP-VAN to expand its offerings, but was also seen as an effort to preempt potential competition in the increasingly profitable industry.

The candidates, unions and super PACs are all willing to spend big for the latest in digital offerings.

NGP-VAN has been paid $31 million by various campaigns and committees — including Ready for Hillary, which paid $34,000 for website development — since the beginning of 2007, according to Federal Election Commission filings. In that same time, Catalist has reaped $3.2 million in payments, though neither tally includes the host of outside groups using political data that don’t regularly disclose their financial details to the FEC, such as labor unions, and 501(c)4 nonprofit groups like Organizing for Action or those affiliated with the Democracy Alliance.

That’s where Catalist does lots of its work, and it has developed something of a stranglehold on labor’s data contracts. Even that niche is poised to become more competitive, though, with at least one major union said to be considering issuing a request for proposal for a voter-file related contract.

As the field has advanced and become more lucrative, an increasing number of firms have rushed in — including Obama 2012 offshoots like Civis Analytics and BlueLabs and also nonpartisan outfits like NationBuilder — blurring the lines between once distinct niches in political technology. Increasingly, firms offer the data, along with the software, Web and mobile interfaces and analytics used to process it for voter contact and targeting, advertising, fundraising and even compliance.

As 2016 approaches, Catalist has faced questions about whether it’s kept pace with the rapid evolution. Not long after Ready for Hillary settled on NGP-VAN for the voter file project, Catalist announced a long-planned major fundraising push to boost its game, trumpeting a $2.25-million lead investment from Soros, a founding member of the Democracy Alliance. Soros had invested a similar, though slightly smaller, amount during Catalist’s last major fundraising round, back in 2006, when it raised $11 million, and this fall he also pledged $25,000 to Ready for Hillary.

Catalist needs the cash to integrate new technology, including social media, into its systems, said Al Dwoskin, a major Democratic donor and the second-largest investor in Catalist behind Soros. “Doing that work is not cheap,” Dwoskin said.

Dwoskin has yet to write a check for the latest round of fundraising, but he said Catalist benefits — rather than suffers — from its age. “They’ve been at this a little longer and perhaps have more experience with the architecture and data management,” he said.

That’s not the sense of author Sasha Issenberg, whose 2012 book “ The Victory Lab” is regarded as the definitive take on political data. “Soros Throws Catalist a Lifeline,” Issenberg tweeted after The New York Times reported Soros’s investment.

Catalist CEO Laura Quinn said she is puzzled by that assessment. And, while she wouldn’t comment on Ready for Hillary or any other specific clients, she said that generally the Democratic data marketplace is growing.

“It’s becoming bigger, healthier,” she said. “We don’t see opportunities shrinking. We see it expanding and we see investment not drying up, but accelerating.”

Catalist would compete for 2016 presidential data work, Quinn suggested. “There is a big evolution in hand right now, and that’s very natural and normal and the Party goes through this all the time,” she said.

The Democratic rivalry in some ways mirrors that which has been raging for the past few years on the right, where various technologists and firms have competed with another — sometimes bitterly — to come up with an answer to close a technology gap with Democrats. The Republican National Committee’s solution was a privatized voter file called Data Trust that in some ways was meant to mirror Catalist. It was to have opened avenues for campaign and parties to benefit from the data enhancements that could be made by deep-pocketed outside groups like Karl Rove’s Crossroads, but Data Trust has struggled to achieve lift-off.

Centralized, party-blessed voter files are yesterday’s news, asserted John Phillips, CEO of Aristotle, a company that provides data and support services to campaigns and committees on both sides of the aisle — making it a competitor to some of NGP-VAN’s work for Democrats. “The competition is shifting to the data-mining software and the analytics as opposed to just the data itself, because the data is only so valuable,” Philips said. He attributed the shift partly to the decreasing power of the parties in a super PAC age in which candidates can field their own operations and aren’t necessarily eager to align too closely with the parties.

“Handing over your secret data to the party is so 2008. In 2014 and 2016, it’s every man for himself,” said Phillips. “You still have one firm or a handful of firms that are the favored firms of the national party, but there is no more monopoly in Democratic voter data.”

Obama’s data trove — which includes detailed information about the issue, voting, volunteering, donating and social media proclivities of just about every voter in America — stands as the closest thing to a Democratic master file, and questions about its ultimate fate have loomed over the Democratic data scramble.

The list’s keeper, former campaign manager Messina, has ambitious, but still ambiguous, data plans, as do two firms spawned from the campaign to which he maintains close ties, BlueLabs and Civis Analytics, the latter of which was seeded by Google’s Schmidt. Both have done modeling work for campaigns and outside groups, and the DNC has paid BlueLabs $107,000 over the past few months for data services.

Messina and other Obama allies debated creating a new private, Catalist-type entity to house the various Obama databases and tools. That could have united the Democratic datasphere by allowing super PACs and campaigns to benefit from one anothers’ data – which is tricky under campaign finance rules – but it would have threatened the market share of other data and analytics vendors, and raised questions about which candidates and super PACs could use it.

Ultimately, they decided to transfer most of the data — except Obama’s vaunted 20-million-address email list — to the DNC. The president’s still-functioning presidential campaign committee will retain possession of that and continue leasing it to the DNC, Organizing for Action and all manner of other groups. The arrangement will allow 2016 Democratic presidential candidates to access most of the Obama datasets, though they’d likely still bring on multiple consulting firms to develop models and interfaces to utilize the data and even contract for their own voter files on top of the data – as anticipated by Ready for Hillary’s plans.

There’s room for plenty of firms to do that work, said the donor Dwoskin. But he asserted Catalist is especially well-positioned in the Clinton 2016 sweepstakes, since it has “some people who have long-term relationships with not only Hillary, but Ready for Hillary. And they certainly will have an opportunity to have a foot in the door, just on that alone.” One of NGP-VAN’s founders, Nathaniel Pearlman, also has deep ties, having worked as chief technology officer on Clinton’s 2008 campaign.

But succeeding in the 2016 Big Data race will be less about learning from 2008 than looking toward 2020, said Dan Wagner, who spearheaded analytics for Obama’s campaigns and for the Obama DNC, then went on to found Civis. His firm is currently balancing political work — including building an electoral model that helped Ed Markey win a special election for Senate in Massachusetts — with corporate and nonprofit clients, but Wagner said he would jump at the chance to work in the 2016 presidential race.

Mccaskill, Kenneth P. Vogel","Bill Clinton 's staff used a decades-old federal government program , originally created to keep former presidents out of the poorhouse , to subsidize his family ’ s foundation and an associated business , and to support his wife ’ s private email server , a ███ investigation has found .
Taxpayer cash was used to buy IT equipment — including servers — housed at the Clinton Foundation , and also to supplement the pay and benefits of several aides now at the center of the email and cash-for-access scandals dogging Hillary Clinton ’ s presidential campaign .
This investigation , which is based on records obtained from the General Services Administration through the Freedom of Information Act , does not reveal anything illegal . But it does offer fresh evidence of how the Clintons blurred the line between their nonprofit foundation , Hillary Clinton ’ s State Department , and the business dealings of Bill Clinton and the couple ’ s aides .
The thousands of pages of newly uncovered records reveal sometimes granular detail about how Bill Clinton ’ s representatives directed the spending of taxpayer cash allocated by the GSA under the Former President ’ s Act .
The Act authorizes the GSA to fund the pensions , correspondence , support staff and travel of ex-presidents . It was passed in 1958 to “ maintain the dignity ” of the presidency by helping former commanders in chief avoid hard times like those that befell Harry S. Truman . He complained that , without help from Uncle Sam , he would be forced to “ go ahead with some contracts to keep ahead of the hounds . ”
After leaving the White House “ dead broke ” , in the words of Hillary Clinton , they quickly raked in tens of millions of dollars from book deals , speaking fees and consulting gigs . At the same time , Bill Clinton was relying on his connections to some of the world ’ s deepest-pocketed donors , corporations and governments to seed a global philanthropy operation that overlapped with his consulting work and speaking fees and his wife ’ s work as secretary of state — and served as a jumping-off point for her presidential campaign .
But even as the Clintons got rich and grew their foundation into a $ 2 billion organization credited with major victories in the fights against childhood obesity and AIDS — while paying six-figure salaries to top aides — Bill Clinton continued drawing more cash from the Former President 's Act than any other ex-president , according to a ███ analysis . The analysis also found that Clinton ’ s representatives , between 2001 , when the Clintons left the White House , and the end of this year , had requested allocations under the Act totaling $ 16 million . That ’ s more than any of the other living former presidents — Jimmy Carter , George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush — requested during that span .
The program supplemented the income of Clinton ’ s staff , while providing them with coveted federal government benefits , alleviating the need for the Clinton Foundation or other Clinton-linked entities to foot the bill for such benefits . Similarly , Clinton aides got the GSA to pay for computer technology used partly by the foundation .
An analysis of the records provided by GSA , combined with Clinton Foundation tax returns , found that at least 13 of the 22 staffers who have been paid by GSA to work for Clinton ’ s personal office also worked for the Clinton Foundation .
A Clinton aide said his boss ’ use of the GSA program is entirely consistent with the Former Presidents Act .
Generally , the aide explained that Clinton “ wears several hats — among them being former president of the United States and the founder of the Clinton Foundation . His staffing reflects those roles . ”
The aide added “ there is no legal prohibition that would preclude the former president ’ s staff from receiving compensation from other sources or doing personal work for the former presidents . We are unaware of any legal prohibition that would preclude these activities . ”
The aide wouldn ’ t discuss specific employees , or their sources of income , explaining “ the Office of Former President Bill Clinton does not discuss personnel matters . ”
But using the GSA records , ███ pieced together a list of Clinton loyalists who at various times have had their earnings supplemented by federal payments of about $ 10,000-a-year using funds from the Former Presidents Act .
The list reads like a field guide to Clinton World .
It includes longtime Bill Clinton aide Justin Cooper , who despite not having a security clearance , any apparent training in cybersecurity or a job at the State Department , in early 2009 helped set up the private email account that Hillary Clinton would use to send and receive classified information as secretary of state . Her use of that system has been dubbed “ extremely careless ” by the FBI director . Cooper continued working to maintain Clinton ’ s private email system — including advising her top aides , Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills , on attempted hacks — through at least 2012 , according to emails released by the State Department .
During some of that period , Cooper was on the GSA payroll , drawing a federal government stipend from February 2011 through 2013 , according to the records obtained by ███ .
At the same time , though , Cooper was working with Doug Band , a trusted Bill Clinton lieutenant , and Declan Kelly , a top Hillary Clinton fundraiser-turned-State Department official , to launch a global consulting firm called Teneo . It did lucrative work for foundation donors and entities with business before Clinton ’ s State Department . And it signed a contract reportedly worth $ 3.5 million with Bill Clinton to serve as a “ honorary chairman ” ( though the former president ultimately kept only $ 100,000 of that , according to his tax returns and a source familiar with the arrangement ) . Teneo also paid Abedin as a “ senior advisor . ”
All the while , Band and Abedin were working together to broker meetings between Secretary of State Clinton and donors to the foundation , where Band served as an official until 2012 , drawing an annual salary that in some years exceeded $ 111,000 .
Yet , despite the profitable consulting business and his foundation compensation , Band continued drawing a taxpayer-funded stipend from the GSA until 2013 .
Also receiving a salary from both the GSA and the Clinton Foundation was Laura Graham , who remained in extremely close contact with Clinton ’ s top aide at the State Department , swapping emails about sensitive foreign policy issues . During most of her time on the GSA payroll , Graham was earning a six-figure salary from the Clinton Foundation , which topped out at $ 190,000 per year in 2014 .
Cooper , Band and Graham are no longer on the GSA payroll , nor are they working for the foundation . They all either declined to comment or did not respond to questions about the overlap between their taxpayer-funded work , the foundation and the State Department .
According to several people familiar with the former president ’ s operation , the rationale behind the interwoven payrolls is that they allow for a small team to assist Clinton in a variety of settings without having to do logistically complicated hockey-like line changes . In a given day , Clinton might deliver a paid private speech ( during which time his employees ’ salaries could be paid by the executive services corporation ) and a public speech in his capacity as a former president ( during which his staff could be paid by the GSA funds ) . And he could attend events for the foundation ( where staff time would be paid by the foundation ) as well as his wife ’ s presidential campaign ( staff time would be paid by the campaign ) .
The records provided by GSA show that for each pay period , Clinton ’ s office submitted to GSA a list of personnel who were eligible to receive pay or reimbursement for travel done on behalf of the former president , along with the number of hours worked by each Clinton aide .
For many years , that list included two influential Clinton confidants who were listed as having worked zero hours each pay period — John Podesta , the former Clinton White House chief of staff who served as the foundation ’ s temporary CEO in 2011 , and Bruce Lindsey , the Clintons ’ Arkansas confidant who served as the foundation ’ s CEO from 2004 through mid-2013 .
A spokesman for Hillary Clinton ’ s presidential campaign said Podesta , who is the campaign ’ s chairman , was on the list because , in 2001 , he was paid less than $ 500 for helping “ transition President Clinton from the White House to a DC-based personal office to the Harlem office . Beyond that , he received no compensation for his work . ”
It ’ s unclear whether Lindsey ever received GSA payments for work or travel on behalf of the former president . Neither he nor Podesta responded to requests for comment .
A GSA spokesperson declined to comment on specific employees , but said ex-presidents have broad discretion over how they choose to divvy up the $ 96,600 they are provided each year for staffing . They can give the entire sum to a single employee or divide it among multiple employees .
George H. W. Bush has four people on his taxpayer-funded staff , while Bill Clinton has 10 , which has been roughly his staffing level for most of his post-presidency , according to the GSA documents . That means that each earned about $ 9,600 a year — far from a living wage in Manhattan , where both the Clinton Foundation and Clinton ’ s personal office are located .
But most Clinton aides on the GSA payroll also earned far more from other groups in the Clinton orbit — from the foundation to Teneo to an entity financed by the Clintons ’ personal funds called the Clinton Executive Services Corporation , or CESC .
The aide to Bill Clinton said that the former president “ personally pays the costs over and above what is provided for by GSA , ” adding that Clinton ’ s contribution “ far exceeds the $ 96,000 provided by GSA . ”
The key reason for adding staffers to the GSA payroll , according to two people familiar with the Clintons ’ staffing arrangements , was that each employee became eligible for full federal employee benefits , including health and life insurance and pensions . The two people familiar with Bill Clinton ’ s staffing said the employees on his GSA payroll almost never received benefits from either the Clinton Foundation or the CESC .
Neither the CESC nor the Clinton Foundation are obligated to release their full payrolls , and GSA wouldn ’ t release the names of the staff being paid through the Former President ’ s Act .
So ███ in March 2015 filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for GSA records detailing payments made through the Act to the offices of all former presidents from 1999 to the present . Nearly 18 months later , the agency partially fulfilled the request , this week delivering thousands of pages of emails , invoices and payroll documents covering 2009 through this year .
Correspondence related to Clinton ’ s payroll and requested purchases of computer equipment and other office gear through GSA under the Act compose the overwhelming majority of the records provided in response to ███ ’ s FOIA request .
That could be a quirk of the FOIA search process .
But Clinton ’ s reimbursement requests also seem to generate far more back-and-forth with GSA about the justification for the spending ( for instance , a GSA official asked in response to a request for a bed bug removal service , “ is there currently a bed bug issue … or is the request for some type of on-going maintenance services. ” The answer is not included in the documents ) . And Clinton ’ s requested purchases also prompted more debate about what ’ s allowable under the Act .
Part of that likely stems from Clinton ’ s approach to his ex-presidency , which is far more active and public than that of his former commander in chief peers — and that ’ s even before factoring in his wife ’ s history-making political career . But the GSA records also reveal just how tricky it can be to separate the various entities , players and controversies that have circulated for decades around Bill and Hillary Clinton .
In several cases , GSA officials raised questions about whether requested furniture and IT equipment including servers were intended for the Clinton Foundation , rather than Clinton ’ s personal office . In at least one instance , GSA paid to purchase and maintain a specialty Lockheed Martin database system called Intranet Quorom , the supporting systems for which were housed at one time at the Clinton Foundation ’ s offices , and used by both foundation staff and Bill Clinton ’ s personal office staff to store and process his correspondence .
The Clinton aide said servers supporting the Intranet Quorom system — which is used for data storage , not email — were the only pieces of equipment purchased by GSA that were housed at the Clinton Foundation at one point , but he said it was justified by the specific circumstances around it .
“ As staff needs to have the full picture of all correspondence sent by President Clinton , both staff from the Office of the Former President and the Foundation have access to , and can input into , the Intranet Quorum database , ” the aide said .
The Clinton Foundation ’ s website suggests that there ’ s a strict wall between the foundation and the ex-president ’ s personal office . “ All Foundation employees are paid for work through the Foundation payroll , ” the website says . “ No Foundation staff are paid for Foundation work with taxpayer dollars . ”
But the aide acknowledged “ staff at the Foundation and staff at the Office of the Former President may have similar tasks , and need to coordinate this work — specifically staff that handles President Clinton ’ s correspondence . ”
That shared work is facilitated by the Lockheed Martin IQ database system , the aide said .
But the system ’ s dual purpose raised questions among GSA officials , who pressed Clinton ’ s representatives when they submitted an invoice in September 2011 to the GSA to purchase a $ 7,700 Dell server and other IT equipment to support the Lockheed Martin IQ database .
Clinton Foundation officials explained to the GSA that they wanted the Dell server housed at foundation headquarters rather than at Clinton ’ s personal office . They explained in an email that the foundation office had better air conditioning , allowing it to support “ about 10-15 more servers , ” and also it was where IT staff were based , so “ trouble shooting with the servers can be done ASAP . ”
Bill Clinton on possibly transitioning out of the Clinton Foundation
The GSA staff asked Graham , then serving as the foundation ’ s COO , to demonstrate that “ safeguards are in place to ensure that the servers are solely for use by ” Clinton ’ s personal office . A note affixed to the bottom of an email produced pursuant to ███ ’ s FOIA request indicates that the GSA ultimately decided not to purchase the Dell server .
Asked about the reasoning this week , a GSA spokesman suggested that Clinton ’ s representatives failed to provide sufficient evidence that the Dell server was not for use by the foundation .
“ Consistent with the support we provide to every former President , GSA does not approve purchases for entities other than the offices of former Presidents , ” the spokesman said . “ In this case , GSA staff sought clarification about the intended use of proposed purchases . Ultimately , the referenced server was not purchased . ”
But , perhaps highlighting the confusion caused by the overlapping spheres in the Clinton ’ s universe , the Clinton aide offered a different recollection . “ We believe that the information GSA provided you with is incomplete . Our files show that GSA purchased the Dell server that operates the IQ database in 2010 . ”","Bill Clinton's staff used a decades-old federal government program, originally created to keep former presidents out of the poorhouse, to subsidize his family’s foundation and an associated business, and to support his wife’s private email server, a POLITICO investigation has found.

Taxpayer cash was used to buy IT equipment — including servers — housed at the Clinton Foundation, and also to supplement the pay and benefits of several aides now at the center of the email and cash-for-access scandals dogging Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

The analysis also found that Clinton’s representatives, between 2001, when the Clintons left the White House, and the end of this year, had requested allocations under the Act totaling $16 million. That’s more than any of the other living former presidents — Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush — requested during that span.

The program supplemented the income of Clinton’s staff, while providing them with coveted federal government benefits, alleviating the need for the Clinton Foundation or other Clinton-linked entities to foot the bill for such benefits. Similarly, Clinton aides got the GSA to pay for computer technology used partly by the foundation.

An analysis of the records provided by GSA, combined with Clinton Foundation tax returns, found that at least 13 of the 22 staffers who have been paid by GSA to work for Clinton’s personal office also worked for the Clinton Foundation.

A Clinton aide said his boss’ use of the GSA program is entirely consistent with the Former Presidents Act.

Generally, the aide explained that Clinton “wears several hats — among them being former president of the United States and the founder of the Clinton Foundation. His staffing reflects those roles.”

The aide added “there is no legal prohibition that would preclude the former president’s staff from receiving compensation from other sources or doing personal work for the former presidents. We are unaware of any legal prohibition that would preclude these activities.”

The aide wouldn’t discuss specific employees, or their sources of income, explaining “the Office of Former President Bill Clinton does not discuss personnel matters.”

But using the GSA records, POLITICO pieced together a list of Clinton loyalists who at various times have had their earnings supplemented by federal payments of about $10,000-a-year using funds from the Former Presidents Act.

The list reads like a field guide to Clinton World.

It includes longtime Bill Clinton aide Justin Cooper, who despite not having a security clearance, any apparent training in cybersecurity or a job at the State Department, in early 2009 helped set up the private email account that Hillary Clinton would use to send and receive classified information as secretary of state. Her use of that system has been dubbed “extremely careless” by the FBI director. Cooper continued working to maintain Clinton’s private email system — including advising her top aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, on attempted hacks — through at least 2012, according to emails released by the State Department.

During some of that period, Cooper was on the GSA payroll, drawing a federal government stipend from February 2011 through 2013, according to the records obtained by POLITICO.

At the same time, though, Cooper was working with Doug Band, a trusted Bill Clinton lieutenant, and Declan Kelly, a top Hillary Clinton fundraiser-turned-State Department official, to launch a global consulting firm called Teneo. It did lucrative work for foundation donors and entities with business before Clinton’s State Department. And it signed a contract reportedly worth $3.5 million with Bill Clinton to serve as a “honorary chairman” (though the former president ultimately kept only $100,000 of that, according to his tax returns and a source familiar with the arrangement). Teneo also paid Abedin as a “senior advisor.”

All the while, Band and Abedin were working together to broker meetings between Secretary of State Clinton and donors to the foundation, where Band served as an official until 2012, drawing an annual salary that in some years exceeded $111,000.

Yet, despite the profitable consulting business and his foundation compensation, Band continued drawing a taxpayer-funded stipend from the GSA until 2013.

Also receiving a salary from both the GSA and the Clinton Foundation was Laura Graham, who remained in extremely close contact with Clinton’s top aide at the State Department, swapping emails about sensitive foreign policy issues. During most of her time on the GSA payroll, Graham was earning a six-figure salary from the Clinton Foundation, which topped out at $190,000 per year in 2014.

Cooper, Band and Graham are no longer on the GSA payroll, nor are they working for the foundation. They all either declined to comment or did not respond to questions about the overlap between their taxpayer-funded work, the foundation and the State Department.

According to several people familiar with the former president’s operation, the rationale behind the interwoven payrolls is that they allow for a small team to assist Clinton in a variety of settings without having to do logistically complicated hockey-like line changes. In a given day, Clinton might deliver a paid private speech (during which time his employees’ salaries could be paid by the executive services corporation) and a public speech in his capacity as a former president (during which his staff could be paid by the GSA funds). And he could attend events for the foundation (where staff time would be paid by the foundation) as well as his wife’s presidential campaign (staff time would be paid by the campaign).

The records provided by GSA show that for each pay period, Clinton’s office submitted to GSA a list of personnel who were eligible to receive pay or reimbursement for travel done on behalf of the former president, along with the number of hours worked by each Clinton aide.

For many years, that list included two influential Clinton confidants who were listed as having worked zero hours each pay period — John Podesta, the former Clinton White House chief of staff who served as the foundation’s temporary CEO in 2011, and Bruce Lindsey, the Clintons’ Arkansas confidant who served as the foundation’s CEO from 2004 through mid-2013.

A spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign said Podesta, who is the campaign’s chairman, was on the list because, in 2001, he was paid less than $500 for helping “transition President Clinton from the White House to a DC-based personal office to the Harlem office. Beyond that, he received no compensation for his work.”

It’s unclear whether Lindsey ever received GSA payments for work or travel on behalf of the former president. Neither he nor Podesta responded to requests for comment.

A GSA spokesperson declined to comment on specific employees, but said ex-presidents have broad discretion over how they choose to divvy up the $96,600 they are provided each year for staffing. They can give the entire sum to a single employee or divide it among multiple employees.

George H. W. Bush has four people on his taxpayer-funded staff, while Bill Clinton has 10, which has been roughly his staffing level for most of his post-presidency, according to the GSA documents. That means that each earned about $9,600 a year — far from a living wage in Manhattan, where both the Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s personal office are located.

But most Clinton aides on the GSA payroll also earned far more from other groups in the Clinton orbit — from the foundation to Teneo to an entity financed by the Clintons’ personal funds called the Clinton Executive Services Corporation, or CESC.

The aide to Bill Clinton said that the former president “personally pays the costs over and above what is provided for by GSA,” adding that Clinton’s contribution “far exceeds the $96,000 provided by GSA.”

The key reason for adding staffers to the GSA payroll, according to two people familiar with the Clintons’ staffing arrangements, was that each employee became eligible for full federal employee benefits, including health and life insurance and pensions. The two people familiar with Bill Clinton’s staffing said the employees on his GSA payroll almost never received benefits from either the Clinton Foundation or the CESC.

Neither the CESC nor the Clinton Foundation are obligated to release their full payrolls, and GSA wouldn’t release the names of the staff being paid through the Former President’s Act.

So POLITICO in March 2015 filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for GSA records detailing payments made through the Act to the offices of all former presidents from 1999 to the present. Nearly 18 months later, the agency partially fulfilled the request, this week delivering thousands of pages of emails, invoices and payroll documents covering 2009 through this year.

Correspondence related to Clinton’s payroll and requested purchases of computer equipment and other office gear through GSA under the Act compose the overwhelming majority of the records provided in response to POLITICO’s FOIA request.

That could be a quirk of the FOIA search process.

But Clinton’s reimbursement requests also seem to generate far more back-and-forth with GSA about the justification for the spending (for instance, a GSA official asked in response to a request for a bed bug removal service, “is there currently a bed bug issue … or is the request for some type of on-going maintenance services.” The answer is not included in the documents). And Clinton’s requested purchases also prompted more debate about what’s allowable under the Act.

Part of that likely stems from Clinton’s approach to his ex-presidency, which is far more active and public than that of his former commander in chief peers — and that’s even before factoring in his wife’s history-making political career. But the GSA records also reveal just how tricky it can be to separate the various entities, players and controversies that have circulated for decades around Bill and Hillary Clinton.

In several cases, GSA officials raised questions about whether requested furniture and IT equipment including servers were intended for the Clinton Foundation, rather than Clinton’s personal office. In at least one instance, GSA paid to purchase and maintain a specialty Lockheed Martin database system called Intranet Quorom, the supporting systems for which were housed at one time at the Clinton Foundation’s offices, and used by both foundation staff and Bill Clinton’s personal office staff to store and process his correspondence.

The Clinton aide said servers supporting the Intranet Quorom system — which is used for data storage, not email — were the only pieces of equipment purchased by GSA that were housed at the Clinton Foundation at one point, but he said it was justified by the specific circumstances around it.

“As staff needs to have the full picture of all correspondence sent by President Clinton, both staff from the Office of the Former President and the Foundation have access to, and can input into, the Intranet Quorum database,” the aide said.

The Clinton Foundation’s website suggests that there’s a strict wall between the foundation and the ex-president’s personal office. “All Foundation employees are paid for work through the Foundation payroll,” the website says. “No Foundation staff are paid for Foundation work with taxpayer dollars.”

But the aide acknowledged “staff at the Foundation and staff at the Office of the Former President may have similar tasks, and need to coordinate this work — specifically staff that handles President Clinton’s correspondence.”

That shared work is facilitated by the Lockheed Martin IQ database system, the aide said.

But the system’s dual purpose raised questions among GSA officials, who pressed Clinton’s representatives when they submitted an invoice in September 2011 to the GSA to purchase a $7,700 Dell server and other IT equipment to support the Lockheed Martin IQ database.

Clinton Foundation officials explained to the GSA that they wanted the Dell server housed at foundation headquarters rather than at Clinton’s personal office. They explained in an email that the foundation office had better air conditioning, allowing it to support “about 10-15 more servers,” and also it was where IT staff were based, so “trouble shooting with the servers can be done ASAP.”

Bill Clinton on possibly transitioning out of the Clinton Foundation

The GSA staff asked Graham, then serving as the foundation’s COO, to demonstrate that “safeguards are in place to ensure that the servers are solely for use by” Clinton’s personal office. A note affixed to the bottom of an email produced pursuant to POLITICO’s FOIA request indicates that the GSA ultimately decided not to purchase the Dell server.

Asked about the reasoning this week, a GSA spokesman suggested that Clinton’s representatives failed to provide sufficient evidence that the Dell server was not for use by the foundation.

“Consistent with the support we provide to every former President, GSA does not approve purchases for entities other than the offices of former Presidents,” the spokesman said. “In this case, GSA staff sought clarification about the intended use of proposed purchases. Ultimately, the referenced server was not purchased.”

But, perhaps highlighting the confusion caused by the overlapping spheres in the Clinton’s universe, the Clinton aide offered a different recollection. “We believe that the information GSA provided you with is incomplete. Our files show that GSA purchased the Dell server that operates the IQ database in 2010.”

Note: The headline on this story has been revised to reflect that GSA funds were used for IT support.

Dems seize on income inequality
Democrats aren ’ t wasting any time tackling an issue they are convinced will help them this election year : income inequality .
One of the Senate ’ s first votes upon returning to Washington from its holiday break Monday will be on a bill reviving emergency unemployment benefits that lapsed at the end of 2013 .
The vote marks the first concrete step by Democrats toward a populist economic platform ahead of the November elections . The inequality campaign will intensify later in the year with a push in the Senate to raise the federal minimum wage that will be synced with President Barack Obama ’ s State of the Union speech , which is expected to dig heavily into the issue of economic disparity .
( Turn the Table : Control of Senate top of agenda in 2014 )
The focus on income inequality builds on the economic themes Obama successfully harnessed to beat Mitt Romney in 2012 . Democrats believe they can win again by spotlighting the growing divides between the rich and poor and daring Republicans to oppose legislation aimed at benefiting low-income Americans .
“ Our Republican colleagues should take note . Certainly we ’ re going to build on the progress we ’ ve made to reduce the deficit , but it is no longer the most important issue that we face , ” Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) said in laying out Senate Democrats ’ agenda for the coming year . “ Issues like job creation , minimum wage and unemployment insurance are going to weigh on the minds of voters far more than Obamacare by the time the 2014 elections roll around . ”
For their part , congressional Republicans sound open to an extension of unemployment benefits , but only if the $ 6.5 billion cost of a three-month extension is paid for — a nuanced argument that Democrats hope won ’ t sound convincing at a time when the number of long-term unemployed is on the uptick . And no matter what Democrats argue , Republicans will seek to keep voters ’ focus on Obamacare .
For now , reviving emergency unemployment insurance may have more legislative legs than a federal minimum wage increase , given that the three-month extension has the support of Sen. Dean Heller ( R-Nev. ) , a key development for a bill that will need the support of four more Republicans to break a filibuster .
The lead sponsor of the bill , Sen. Jack Reed ( D-R.I. ) , said he hopes other Republicans from high-unemployment states will come around when they “ begin to recognize these are real constituents in their home state that have worked very hard . ”
“ The most encouraging thing , ironically , is the fact that a lot of the stories about people being affected by this are coming out . It turns out these are men and women in their 50s , they ’ ve worked all their lives , ” Reed said . “ These are the people that kept working some of the toughest days of the recession . ”
Democrats argue that seizing on the minimum wage is also key to appearing serious about improving peoples ’ lives — and even if legislation fails on the Senate floor , as is currently expected , the party believes the high-profile vote will augment vulnerable incumbents ’ campaigns as Democrats work to defend their five-seat Senate majority .
The Capitol Hill push follows a wave of national polls that show Americans increasingly favor raising the minimum wage , a rate that has stayed put at $ 7.25 per hour since 2009 for most workers . Few , if any , Republicans are likely to support Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin ’ s ( D ) bill to raise the rate to $ 10.10 an hour , though his legislation could be filled with incentives for small businesses , and the wage could be whittled to a more palatable number to entice moderates in both parties .
Democrats see special appeal in spotlighting a rate hike when the road to retaining the Senate runs through red states with Democratic incumbents such as Alaska ’ s Mark Begich , Arkansas ’ s Mark Pryor , Louisiana ’ s Mary Landrieu and North Carolina ’ s Kay Hagan . Minimum wage issues are particularly poignant in Southern states like North Carolina , Louisiana and Arkansas , all of which have above-average numbers of employees paid at or below the federal minimum wage , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
“ In all the battleground states , I think that it will be not only a rallying cry for the Democratic base but also an important appeal to voters in the middle , ” said Matt Canter , a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . “ This is not a 50/50 issue ; this is not a 55/45 issue . It ’ s a 70/30 . It puts Republicans squarely on the side of wealthy special interests . ”
The congressional spotlight will give the nation ’ s lowest-paid workers the most attention nationally since Congress last approved a rate hike in 2007 under President George W. Bush , part of massive legislation that included tax cuts . But the minimum wage is also the centerpiece of a larger shift for Senate Democrats away from approving presidential nominees and social legislation and toward fiscal policy .
“ The thing that is going to help us keep the Senate is focusing on the economy , ” said a Democratic leadership aide .
While most 2014 Democratic candidates are supportive of the liberal Harkin legislation and associated fiscal messaging , their positions aren ’ t uniform . Begich is a co-sponsor of the $ 10.10-an-hour bill , and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes , who is challenging Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R ) , is making the $ 10.10 rate a central focus of her campaign .
Landrieu said she wants to raise the wage but isn ’ t sure how high , while Hagan is simply supportive of the effort generally , an aide said . Pryor has attacked his presumptive 2014 GOP opponent , Rep. Tom Cotton ( R ) , for not supporting a wage-rate raise , but Pryor ’ s support thus far has largely been muted .
So while the precise wage rate they will advocate has yet to be settled , Senate Democrats have decided that tackling the federal minimum wage is a way to reach out to reliable Democratic voters and drive a wedge between them and Republicans .
“ It ’ s the smart substantive position , the smart economic position , the smart humanitarian position . And it is also the smart political position , ” the retiring Harkin said in an interview . Running to replace the veteran Democrat is Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley , a co-sponsor of a companion House bill to Harkin ’ s supported by more than 150 House Democrats .
Top Senate aides and party strategists privately acknowledge that the issue meshes perfectly with their defense of a Southern-tilted 2014 Senate map that has the GOP licking its chops . But lawmakers are loath to admit that the issue could be an electoral tool and insist their focus on it is about good policy , not politics .
“ I don ’ t think it ’ s being offered for my election . I think it ’ s being offered because it ’ s clear that the income inequality in the country is moving in the wrong direction , ” Landrieu said in an interview . “ Even people that don ’ t work at the minimum wage understand that it ’ s important to pay people fairly . What impact it has on the election , I don ’ t know . ”
The GOP has the hefty backing of the business community in opposing a rate increase , including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which says that any federal increase would weigh heavily on small businesses and must be offset by financial relief for them . Another key opponent is the National Restaurant Association , a heavy-hitting industry group that is historically a generous benefactor to Republican candidates .
Known colloquially as “ the other NRA , ” the organization argues that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment — also a commonly held belief among Republicans .
“ Every time you raise the minimum wage , fast-food restaurants mechanize more . They lay off people , ” said Rep. Bill Cassidy ( R-La . ) , who is facing Landrieu this year in the deep red state . “ If your cost is labor and you raise your cost of labor , it makes the cost of investing in a machine to do that manual labor more attractive . ”
In Arkansas , Pryor may be able to stay quiet on the issue and still benefit from its resonance : A statewide ballot initiative is brewing to raise the rate , which Democratic strategists believe will lead to a voter registration surge and stronger turnout regardless of how closely Pryor ’ s campaign embraces the national push .
In Kentucky , Grimes ’ s campaign has made major hay of Kentuckians ’ support for raising the minimum wage and McConnell ’ s opposition historically to nationwide rate increases . McConnell ’ s campaign manager has dismissed Grimes ’ s focus on the wage as “ class warfare ” and “ divisive , ” but it certainly does poll well : A December survey by Public Policy Polling found that 54 percent of Kentucky voters support raising the minimum wage to $ 10 an hour — 23 percentage points higher than the favorability or approval ratings of either Grimes or McConnell .
Still , McConnell ’ s campaign scoffed at the possibility of the issue becoming the centerpiece of the high-profile Kentucky race .
“ You have to work pretty hard to find an issue that isn ’ t overwhelmingly on our side . This is literally the only issue [ Grimes has ] spoken about in months , ” said McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore .
But it isn ’ t just in Kentucky — Democrats see an issue several times as popular as Congress ’ s abysmal approval ratings . A November Gallup poll found 76 percent support nationally for a wage of $ 9 an hour — a 5-point bump since March . A December Washington Post poll found 66 percent of respondents supported boosting the wage .
That sort of national buy-in has Democrats convinced that talking about inequality and reasonable pay will help shift the midterm election focus from Obamacare to the economy . It ’ s a tactic not lost on Republicans , who believe outrage over the health care law will vastly outweigh any voter intensity on raising wages for the country ’ s poorest .
“ Well , when you believe that the federal government is the solution to everything , from health care to jobs , wealth creation to success , you are forced to talk about things like minimum wage instead of maximizing the potential for the middle class and working families , ” said Brad Dayspring , a spokesman for Senate Republicans ’ campaign arm . “ Democrats are going to spend 2014 focusing on anything but Obamacare and the economy . ”
To the GOP , a conversation about tackling inequality is impossible without talking about Obamacare .
“ Democrats are great at taking lousy policy and making good rhetoric out of it , ” Cassidy said . “ We ’ re going to look at the rollout of Obamacare and people paying $ 10,000 more a year in premiums . ”","Jack Reed says he hopes Republicans from high-unemployment states support his bill.

Democrats aren’t wasting any time tackling an issue they are convinced will help them this election year: income inequality.

One of the Senate’s first votes upon returning to Washington from its holiday break Monday will be on a bill reviving emergency unemployment benefits that lapsed at the end of 2013.

The focus on income inequality builds on the economic themes Obama successfully harnessed to beat Mitt Romney in 2012. Democrats believe they can win again by spotlighting the growing divides between the rich and poor and daring Republicans to oppose legislation aimed at benefiting low-income Americans.

“Our Republican colleagues should take note. Certainly we’re going to build on the progress we’ve made to reduce the deficit, but it is no longer the most important issue that we face,” Sen.

“The most encouraging thing, ironically, is the fact that a lot of the stories about people being affected by this are coming out. It turns out these are men and women in their 50s, they’ve worked all their lives,” Reed said. “These are the people that kept working some of the toughest days of the recession.”

Democrats argue that seizing on the minimum wage is also key to appearing serious about improving peoples’ lives — and even if legislation fails on the Senate floor, as is currently expected, the party believes the high-profile vote will augment vulnerable incumbents’ campaigns as Democrats work to defend their five-seat Senate majority.

The Capitol Hill push follows a wave of national polls that show Americans increasingly favor raising the minimum wage, a rate that has stayed put at $7.25 per hour since 2009 for most workers. Few, if any, Republicans are likely to support Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin’s (D) bill to raise the rate to $10.10 an hour, though his legislation could be filled with incentives for small businesses, and the wage could be whittled to a more palatable number to entice moderates in both parties.

Democrats see special appeal in spotlighting a rate hike when the road to retaining the Senate runs through red states with Democratic incumbents such as Alaska’s Mark Begich, Arkansas’s Mark Pryor, Louisiana’s Mary Landrieu and North Carolina’s Kay Hagan. Minimum wage issues are particularly poignant in Southern states like North Carolina, Louisiana and Arkansas, all of which have above-average numbers of employees paid at or below the federal minimum wage, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“In all the battleground states, I think that it will be not only a rallying cry for the Democratic base but also an important appeal to voters in the middle,” said Matt Canter, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “This is not a 50/50 issue; this is not a 55/45 issue. It’s a 70/30. It puts Republicans squarely on the side of wealthy special interests.”

The congressional spotlight will give the nation’s lowest-paid workers the most attention nationally since Congress last approved a rate hike in 2007 under President George W. Bush, part of massive legislation that included tax cuts. But the minimum wage is also the centerpiece of a larger shift for Senate Democrats away from approving presidential nominees and social legislation and toward fiscal policy.

“The thing that is going to help us keep the Senate is focusing on the economy,” said a Democratic leadership aide.

( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)

While most 2014 Democratic candidates are supportive of the liberal Harkin legislation and associated fiscal messaging, their positions aren’t uniform. Begich is a co-sponsor of the $10.10-an-hour bill, and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), is making the $10.10 rate a central focus of her campaign.

Landrieu said she wants to raise the wage but isn’t sure how high, while Hagan is simply supportive of the effort generally, an aide said. Pryor has attacked his presumptive 2014 GOP opponent, Rep. Tom Cotton (R), for not supporting a wage-rate raise, but Pryor’s support thus far has largely been muted.

So while the precise wage rate they will advocate has yet to be settled, Senate Democrats have decided that tackling the federal minimum wage is a way to reach out to reliable Democratic voters and drive a wedge between them and Republicans.

“It’s the smart substantive position, the smart economic position, the smart humanitarian position. And it is also the smart political position,” the retiring Harkin said in an interview. Running to replace the veteran Democrat is Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, a co-sponsor of a companion House bill to Harkin’s supported by more than 150 House Democrats.

Top Senate aides and party strategists privately acknowledge that the issue meshes perfectly with their defense of a Southern-tilted 2014 Senate map that has the GOP licking its chops. But lawmakers are loath to admit that the issue could be an electoral tool and insist their focus on it is about good policy, not politics.

“I don’t think it’s being offered for my election. I think it’s being offered because it’s clear that the income inequality in the country is moving in the wrong direction,” Landrieu said in an interview. “Even people that don’t work at the minimum wage understand that it’s important to pay people fairly. What impact it has on the election, I don’t know.”

The GOP has the hefty backing of the business community in opposing a rate increase, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which says that any federal increase would weigh heavily on small businesses and must be offset by financial relief for them. Another key opponent is the National Restaurant Association, a heavy-hitting industry group that is historically a generous benefactor to Republican candidates.

Known colloquially as “the other NRA,” the organization argues that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment — also a commonly held belief among Republicans.

“Every time you raise the minimum wage, fast-food restaurants mechanize more. They lay off people,” said Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is facing Landrieu this year in the deep red state. “If your cost is labor and you raise your cost of labor, it makes the cost of investing in a machine to do that manual labor more attractive.”

In Arkansas, Pryor may be able to stay quiet on the issue and still benefit from its resonance: A statewide ballot initiative is brewing to raise the rate, which Democratic strategists believe will lead to a voter registration surge and stronger turnout regardless of how closely Pryor’s campaign embraces the national push.

In Kentucky, Grimes’s campaign has made major hay of Kentuckians’ support for raising the minimum wage and McConnell’s opposition historically to nationwide rate increases. McConnell’s campaign manager has dismissed Grimes’s focus on the wage as “class warfare” and “divisive,” but it certainly does poll well: A December survey by Public Policy Polling found that 54 percent of Kentucky voters support raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour — 23 percentage points higher than the favorability or approval ratings of either Grimes or McConnell.

Still, McConnell’s campaign scoffed at the possibility of the issue becoming the centerpiece of the high-profile Kentucky race.

“You have to work pretty hard to find an issue that isn’t overwhelmingly on our side. This is literally the only issue [Grimes has] spoken about in months,” said McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore.

But it isn’t just in Kentucky — Democrats see an issue several times as popular as Congress’s abysmal approval ratings. A November Gallup poll found 76 percent support nationally for a wage of $9 an hour — a 5-point bump since March. A December Washington Post poll found 66 percent of respondents supported boosting the wage.

That sort of national buy-in has Democrats convinced that talking about inequality and reasonable pay will help shift the midterm election focus from Obamacare to the economy. It’s a tactic not lost on Republicans, who believe outrage over the health care law will vastly outweigh any voter intensity on raising wages for the country’s poorest.

“Well, when you believe that the federal government is the solution to everything, from health care to jobs, wealth creation to success, you are forced to talk about things like minimum wage instead of maximizing the potential for the middle class and working families,” said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Senate Republicans’ campaign arm. “Democrats are going to spend 2014 focusing on anything but Obamacare and the economy.”

To the GOP, a conversation about tackling inequality is impossible without talking about Obamacare.

“Democrats are great at taking lousy policy and making good rhetoric out of it,” Cassidy said. “We’re going to look at the rollout of Obamacare and people paying $10,000 more a year in premiums.”",www.politico.com,left,u06r6kM0cY1R7z7o

MIDTERM EFFECT

Democrats are keen to remind voters of the issue of Russia and the 2016 election ahead of November’s midterm congressional elections. Early polls show Republicans run some risk of losing control of Congress.

“The suit gives Democrats a useful and perhaps compelling narrative to counter the president’s and Republicans’ mantra of ‘no collusion,’” said Leonard Williams, a political science professor at Manchester University. “From that partisan standpoint, it is exactly what their candidates and spokespeople need.”

WikiLeaks, and attorneys for Trump Jr., Manafort, Gates and Papadopoulos also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Stone said the lawsuit was based on “a left-wing conspiracy theory.”

“NO proof or evidence,” he wrote in an email to Reuters.

The lawsuit, should it go forward, seems likely to help keep the spotlight on the issue of Russian election interference and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. Both are being investigated by Mueller, whose office declined to comment on the Democratic lawsuit.

Through the process of legal discovery, lawyers for the Democratic Party could force the defendants to produce documents they say relate to the collusion issue.

The decision is a huge disappointment for New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio had made a major effort to land the convention for Brooklyn. The city had put together a rich financial package to lure the Democratic National Committee.

Rep. Maxine Waters said those who want to harm her had better ""shoot straight because there’s nothing like a wounded animal.""

The California Democrat made the comments during a rally Saturday in Los Angeles protesting President Donald Trump's immigration policies days after the veteran lawmaker said she had to cancel speaking events in Alabama and Texas this weekend due to death threats.

Those threats came after she exhorted opponents of Trump's immigration policies to confront and harass Cabinet members wherever possible.

""Already you have members of your Cabinet who have been booed out of restaurants,"" she said in remarks last weekend directed at the president.

Waters, who has repeatedly called for Trump's impeachment, was apparently pointing to an incident last week in which Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted by protesters at an upscale Mexican restaurant in Washington, D.C.

In addition, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the owner of a Virginia restaurant asked her to leave Friday night because of her association with Trump.

Trump warned Rep. Maxine Waters on Monday to ""be careful what you wish for"" after the California Democrat called on activists to confront White House officials over their immigration policies.

""Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,"" Trump tweeted. ""She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!""

It's not the first time Waters has suggested people thinking of firing at her should have good aim.

At a town hall meeting in Ingelwood last year, Waters was criticizing Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, when she heard a pop.

""I don’t know what the sound was,"" she told the crowd without flinching. ""But whoever it is, if it’s a shot, you better shoot straight!”",www.usatoday.com,center,bfGxnijLkBPTU9Sm

In New Hampshire , his campaign was building out an upcoming trip , announcing he would participate in the famed `` Politics and Eggs '' speaking series on Nov. 8 .
And in El Paso , staffers were readying a policy on disability issues to coincide with a forum on the topic Saturday in Cedar Rapids .
In many ways , it was business as usual for the campaign — until it was n't .

O'Rourke decided to drop out just in the last couple days , according to campaign sources , and senior staff did not begin learning about the decision until Thursday . More senior staff learned Friday , and late in the afternoon , just a few hours before his first event of the weekend in Iowa , he held an all-staff call to share his decision .
On the call , O'Rourke discussed the tough financial choices he was facing if he were to continue running , the sources said . He also told staff he would not run for U.S. Senate next year in Texas — something he has previously denied interest in but a possibility that was bound to generate more speculation with him no longer running for president .
O'Rourke 's campaign was facing a number of pressures , perhaps none more serious than money . While he raised more in the third quarter than he did in the second , both saw the campaign spending at an alarming rate , burning through significantly more money than it took in . In the third quarter , the campaign spent $ 1.43 for every $ 1 it raised , with payroll and related costs taking up the bulk of expenses .

Unlike rivals Cory Booker and Julián Castro , O'Rourke did not resort to threats to drop out if he did not raise a certain amount of money in a short period of time .

It would end up being one of his final media appearances as a presidential candidate . The night before , he held his last campaign event before heading to Iowa — and it was a fitting twilight for a candidate who had become doggedly focused on gun violence : a town hall in Newtown , Connecticut , not far from the site of the tragic 2012 school shooting .
The event appeared to weigh on O'Rourke as he sought to rally supporters Friday evening who had just learned his White House bid was over .
`` The very last place that I got to visit before being here in Des Moines as a candidate — just as an American , as a human being — was Newtown , Connecticut , '' O'Rourke said , `` and I listened to a community and to families who had been through so much and today , almost seven years later , show us so much courage and give us an example for the way forward . ''
In the lead-up to Friday evening , O'Rourke 's campaign had shown no signs of slowing down , especially in the early voting states . His campaign announced Wednesday that he would visit New Hampshire on Nov. 8 to file for the state 's primary , and on Friday afternoon , the campaign announced his plans to participate in Politics and Eggs .

Keith Ellison as their new chairman on Saturday , concluding a hotly contested race to lead a battered party as it tries to channel the anti-Donald Trump energy of its base into an electoral rebound .
Perez defeated Ellison in a 235-200 vote among the Democratic National Committee 's 435 members who cast ballots Saturday .
It took two rounds of voting to select a winner after Perez found himself just one vote shy in the first ballot . The five other candidates , who had amassed 13.5 total votes , all exited the race before the second round began .
In a victory speech , Perez vowed that Democrats would wage an all-out battle to deny Trump a second term .
`` We are at a 'where were you ? ' moment in American history : Where were you in 2017 when we had the worst President in US history ? '' he said .
Immediately after winning , Perez made a quick move to bring Ellison 's supporters into the fold -- appointing Ellison as the deputy chair of the DNC , to cheers and unanimous approval from the crowd .
`` It 's my honor to serve this party under the chairmanship of Tom Perez , '' he said .
The results brought a chaotic close to a race that stretched on for three months . In the waning days , former Vice President Joe Biden and several aides to former President Barack Obama -- including Valerie Jarrett and David Simas -- made calls to undecided members in an effort to sway them toward Perez .
In Ellison 's camp , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and supportive members of Congress applied pressure on DNC members with phone calls .
The behind-the-scenes calls underscored why the race was broadly seen as a proxy battle between the Sanders-aligned progressive wing of the party , which supported Ellison , and those more closely connected with Hillary Clinton and Obama , who largely backed Perez .
By selecting Perez -- and again spurning Sanders supporters -- Democrats risk the backlash that could come with leaving the left wing of the party disappointed a second time in the past year .
In a statement congratulating Perez , Sanders said `` it is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old , same-old is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before .
`` Now , more than ever , the Democratic Party must make it clear that it is prepared to stand up to the 1 % and lead this country forward in the fight for social , racial , economic and environmental justice , '' he said .
While Obama and Clinton are bigger names , Sanders ' reaction is probably what matters most in terms of whether the election result polarizes party members .
Meanwhile , Perez was praised by the most recent Democratic president and Democratic presidential nominee .
Obama touted what he said was the party 's track record of expanding the economy , creating new jobs , keeping Americans safe through `` tough , smart '' foreign policy , and expanding the right to health insurance .
`` That 's a legacy the Democratic Party will always carry forward , '' Obama said . `` I know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity , and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big , bold , inclusive , dynamic America we love so much . ''
In a tweet , Hillary Clinton congratulated Perez and Ellison , writing : `` Excited for strong , unified party standing for best of our country into the future . ''
Congrats to @ DNC chair @ TomPerez & deputy @ keithellison . Excited for strong , unified party standing for best of our country into the future . — Hillary Clinton ( @ HillaryClinton ) February 25 , 2017
President Donald Trump also tweeted his kudos to the victor , but not without getting in a jab .
`` Congratulations to Thomas Perez , who has just been named Chairman of the DNC , '' he wrote . `` I could not be happier for him , or for the Republican Party ! ''
Congratulations to Thomas Perez , who has just been named Chairman of the DNC . I could not be happier for him , or for the Republican Party ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 25 , 2017
That prompted Perez to tweet back : `` @ keithellison and I , and Democrats united across the country , will be your worst nightmare . ''
Call me Tom . And do n't get too happy . @ keithellison and I , and Democrats united across the country , will be your worst nightmare . https : //t.co/fu7WvLofrD — Tom Perez ( @ TomPerez ) February 25 , 2017
Perez , a Maryland Democrat who worked in Obama 's Justice Department before serving as labor secretary and making Clinton 's short list for the vice presidential nomination , made overtures to Ellison 's backers in his nomination speech before the votes were cast .
`` Good leaders are great listeners . You will always have my ear , and I will always have your back , '' Perez told the crowd , promising to `` plan strategy together , lift each other up together . ''
`` You will not be underutilized , '' he said . `` You are of import in everything we do . The most important question you will hear from me is , 'What do you think ? ' ''
In a joint news conference late Saturday afternoon , Ellison said he sees his job as serving as a `` bridge '' for Democratic institutions , adding that he he did not plan to give up his House seat .
Ellison also attempted to rally his supporters behind Perez . `` I trust Tom Perez , '' Ellison said . `` If you trust me , then you 've got to come on board with Tom Perez . ''
Perez said the two had discussed naming the race 's loser the DNC 's deputy chair `` for some time . ''
Democrats had long anticipated the election could require several ballots to settle the contest and might drag on for much of the day Saturday .
But the pool of votes that the candidates aside from Ellison and Perez would amass shrank significantly when New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley dropped out a week ago to support Ellison and then South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison exited to back Perez .
On Saturday , Pete Buttigieg , the 35-year-old mayor of South Bend , Indiana , dropped out minutes before the vote without endorsing another candidate .
The move allowed Buttigieg , who is seen as a rising star within the Democratic ranks , to reap the benefits of the bigger stage of the DNC race without suffering the embarrassment of a low vote total or angering either camp by making a last-second endorsement .
`` We saw the potential of doing well on multiple ballots , but we can do the math , '' he said in what was supposed to be his nomination speech . `` It is time for this process to move toward a solution that we can all get on board with . ''
Buttigieg 's exit left Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown as the third-place contender , drawing 12 votes in the first round before dropping out .
Television analyst Jehmu Greene , Air Force veteran Sam Ronan and attorney Peter Peckarsky also ran . Greene received half a vote in the first round of balloting before dropping out . Ronan and Peckarsky received none before doing the same . And one voter backed Buttigieg in the first round despite his having already dropped out of the race .","ATLANTA (CNN) Democrats selected former Labor Secretary Tom Perez over Minnesota Rep.

""Now, more than ever, the Democratic Party must make it clear that it is prepared to stand up to the 1% and lead this country forward in the fight for social, racial, economic and environmental justice,"" he said.

While Obama and Clinton are bigger names, Sanders' reaction is probably what matters most in terms of whether the election result polarizes party members.

Meanwhile, Perez was praised by the most recent Democratic president and Democratic presidential nominee.

Obama touted what he said was the party's track record of expanding the economy, creating new jobs, keeping Americans safe through ""tough, smart"" foreign policy, and expanding the right to health insurance.

""That's a legacy the Democratic Party will always carry forward,"" Obama said. ""I know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity, and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big, bold, inclusive, dynamic America we love so much.""

In a tweet, Hillary Clinton congratulated Perez and Ellison, writing: ""Excited for strong, unified party standing for best of our country into the future.""

Congrats to @DNC chair @TomPerez & deputy @keithellison. Excited for strong, unified party standing for best of our country into the future. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 25, 2017

President Donald Trump also tweeted his kudos to the victor, but not without getting in a jab.

""Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC,"" he wrote. ""I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!""

Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017

That prompted Perez to tweet back: ""@keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare.""

Call me Tom. And don't get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare. https://t.co/fu7WvLofrD — Tom Perez (@TomPerez) February 25, 2017

Perez, a Maryland Democrat who worked in Obama's Justice Department before serving as labor secretary and making Clinton's short list for the vice presidential nomination, made overtures to Ellison's backers in his nomination speech before the votes were cast.

""Good leaders are great listeners. You will always have my ear, and I will always have your back,"" Perez told the crowd, promising to ""plan strategy together, lift each other up together.""

""You will not be underutilized,"" he said. ""You are of import in everything we do. The most important question you will hear from me is, 'What do you think?'""

In a joint news conference late Saturday afternoon, Ellison said he sees his job as serving as a ""bridge"" for Democratic institutions, adding that he he did not plan to give up his House seat.

Ellison also attempted to rally his supporters behind Perez. ""I trust Tom Perez,"" Ellison said. ""If you trust me, then you've got to come on board with Tom Perez.""

Perez said the two had discussed naming the race's loser the DNC's deputy chair ""for some time.""

Democrats had long anticipated the election could require several ballots to settle the contest and might drag on for much of the day Saturday.

But the pool of votes that the candidates aside from Ellison and Perez would amass shrank significantly when New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley dropped out a week ago to support Ellison and then South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison exited to back Perez.

On Saturday, Pete Buttigieg, the 35-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, dropped out minutes before the vote without endorsing another candidate.

The move allowed Buttigieg, who is seen as a rising star within the Democratic ranks, to reap the benefits of the bigger stage of the DNC race without suffering the embarrassment of a low vote total or angering either camp by making a last-second endorsement.

""We saw the potential of doing well on multiple ballots, but we can do the math,"" he said in what was supposed to be his nomination speech. ""It is time for this process to move toward a solution that we can all get on board with.""

Buttigieg's exit left Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown as the third-place contender, drawing 12 votes in the first round before dropping out.

Television analyst Jehmu Greene, Air Force veteran Sam Ronan and attorney Peter Peckarsky also ran. Greene received half a vote in the first round of balloting before dropping out. Ronan and Peckarsky received none before doing the same. And one voter backed Buttigieg in the first round despite his having already dropped out of the race.",www.cnn.com,left,DHSpmq5QTWAPKuh9

So how is it that Republicans have a stranglehold on the state ’ s congressional delegation , holding eight seats to Democrats ’ three ?
That question is at the heart of a legal battle over whether Republicans have improperly leveraged their power over the redistricting process . The outcome could have far-reaching implications because the contours of congressional districts drawn by Republican-controlled legislatures are seen as a driving reason why Democrats may be locked in the House minority until at least after the next census in 2020 .
In Virginia , Democrats are hoping to redraw the lines to make some GOP districts more competitive after a panel of federal judges ruled recently that the Republican-led Legislature ’ s decision to pack African-American voters into the 3rd Congressional District , which is represented by Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott , was motivated purely by race — a violation of the 14th Amendment .
Other battleground states such as North Carolina and Florida also have redistricting battles pending .
The North Carolina Supreme Court recently made the opposite decision in a case similar to Virginia ’ s , and plaintiffs have already said they will take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court . And in Florida , a coalition of Democratic groups has appealed a court ’ s decision to keep the state ’ s congressional districts , which were tweaked only slightly by the Legislature last year after a court threw them out .
But the Virginia court ruling striking down the state ’ s map based on race , and the legislative wrangling that ’ s been triggered by it , has put the commonwealth in the spotlight because of the potential to boost Democrats in other states as well .
“ The Virginia case is so important because it tells government decision makers how to evaluate the use of race in the redistricting process , ” said Justin Levitt , a redistricting expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles , who also worked as the Democratic National Committee ’ s National Voter Protection counsel in 2008 .
Levitt added that the divided government in Virginia with Democrats controlling the governorship and Republicans controlling the Legislature opens up the real possibility for revisions to the map that might be more in line with a string of recent Democratic victories in close statewide races : The contests for Virginia ’ s 13 electoral votes in the presidential race have mirrored the national popular vote in the past two elections . The state ’ s Senate races in 2014 and 2012 were among the closest in the country . The 2013 governor ’ s race was decided by fewer than 3 points , and its attorney general , Democrat Mark Herring , was elected only after a protracted recount .
But 2014 ’ s congressional races weren ’ t just lopsided in the GOP ’ s favor overall , the individual races weren ’ t even close : Each contest was decided by a margin of more than 16 points .
The dichotomy between statewide offices and the congressional delegation is a familiar story for Democrats . As a result of population patterns and gerrymandering , Democrats find themselves in the minority in the congressional delegations in other swing states . President Obama has won Florida twice , but Republicans hold 17 of 27 House seats . In Ohio , the GOP controls 12 of 16 seats . In Pennsylvania , it ’ s 13 of 18 .
After losing control of governorships and state legislatures before the latest round of redistricting , the party is taking the fight to the courts . Democrats have been financing legal battles over redistricting across the country in an effort to make some political gains in key states , including in Virginia , where Democrats see an opportunity to change the political dichotomy in the state .
After a panel of federal judges last October struck down the state ’ s congressional map , the court ordered the Legislature to draw a new map by April 1 . But the decision has since been appealed , leaving open the question of when or if the districts will actually need to be redrawn . The status of Virginia ’ s map is largely dependent on a similar case out of Alabama , on which the Supreme Court is expected to rule later this year . ?
Still , the case in Virginia has given Democrats a chance to push for new lines that could make at least two districts — the 2nd and 4th , currently represented by GOP Reps. Scott Rigell and Randy Forbes , respectively — more competitive once some of the black population from Scott ’ s district is moved .
“ The court ’ s ruling cemented what everyone already knows about Virginia ’ s congressional districts , which is that they are wildly unfair and need to change , ” said Morgan Finkelstein , spokeswoman for the Virginia Democratic Party . “ These gerrymandered districts leave no room for moderation when Virginia Republicans are more concerned with a tea party challenge than with actually representing what the majority of Virginians want . That does not benefit Virginia . ”
Although Republicans still hold a majority in the state Legislature , if the lower court ’ s decision is upheld the GOP will have to work with Democratic Gov . Terry McAuliffe to draw a new map .
Republicans might try to mitigate potential Democratic gains in the districts held by Rigell and Forbes by moving black voters to the 7th District instead , a solidly conservative district now represented by GOP Rep. Dave Brat , who defeated then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary last year and took office in a special election after Cantor resigned . Brat might not have the seniority and influence in the state to keep Virginia ’ s GOP leadership from making his district more Democratic .
When asked about that scenario , Brat said after a long pause : “ I don ’ t think we know anything yet . It ’ s all in flux . There ’ s no ‘ it ’ yet to be concerned about . ”
Another scenario that some Democrats in the state are considering , sources say , is a standoff between McAuliffe and the Republicans in the state Legislature , which would take the redistricting process entirely out of their hands and give the courts control .
“ I ’ ve heard some Democrats say that won ’ t be so bad because it can ’ t get any worse than it is now , but it could be better for them if the courts could make these districts more competitive , ” said Quentin Kidd , director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University . “ The question is — do you take a reputational hit for your state for potential partisan gain ? ”
While some in the black community are worried about breaking up Scott ’ s district , the congressman is confident he can keep his seat even with a minority-influenced district , rather than a majority-minority district .
“ The Republicans appealed . I didn ’ t . So you ’ ll have to ask them what they ’ re so worried about , ” he said . “ I ’ m not concerned . ”
Meanwhile , Republicans have argued that wide margins of victory in House races don ’ t qualify as political gerrymandering , pointing to the fact that Obama narrowly carried Rigell ’ s district in 2012 , and Mitt Romney won Forbes ’ by only 2 points .

• Senate Dems go Old Testament : An eye for an eye
• It was 1492 , but the ocean was really kind of a greenish color
SENATE DEMS GO OLD TESTAMENT : AN EYE FOR AN EYE - Senate Democrats are hunting for six Republicans votes to help Majority Leader Harry Reid jam the GOP-controlled House . With debt-limit doom just three days away , Senate Democrats are still finding time to pay back the House for making the focus of the current fiscal fights all about ObamaCare . Rather than rush to a deal , the evident effort in the Senate is to make House Republicans gag on an increase in federal spending with zero concessions on President Obama ’ s health law . Democrats over the weekend dissed a plan from Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , to allow current spending levels to stay in place until March , while raising the debt-limit through January . Collins ’ plan would also have delayed for two years a new ObamaCare tax on medical devices and beefed up anti-fraud measures in the law . But Senate Democrats are not looking for a quick solution . They are looking to run out the clock and to punish Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , and other conservatives for pushing a doomed bid to defund the law .
[ Backroom bargaining : With all ears tuned-in for hints of behind-closed-doors deal on the budget/debt limit impasse , the Senate is slated to convene at 2 p.m . ET ]
Equally impossible - Republicans started the messy debate over government funding and borrowing with an impossible ask : ripping out funding for a cherished new Democratic entitlement program . Now , Senate Democrats will return the favor and are demanding the undoing of current spending levels set in the 2011 debt-limit debacle . Those rates , known as “ sequestration ” are considered sacrosanct to Republicans of all stripes . But now , thanks to the “ defund ” gambit , Republicans are scrambling to hold ground that most had taken for granted when the back-and-forth began .
Baier Tracks : Unbelievable… “ What seemed like a path to at least a partial solution on Friday , seems today like a path to more confusion . While the going bet is , ‘ They 'll work everything out . They have to , ’ there is increasingly a hint of , ‘ Um ... Maybe they won ’ t. ’ Democrats are now demanding that any talks on the debt-ceiling increase start at a pre-sequester figure . That prompted normally negotiating Republican Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , to tell Chris Wallace that the fight over the debt limit is ‘ typically a point where you try to create reforms and reduce deficits , so to agree to something that raises spending from previously agreed to levels , I just ca n't imagine that . I just ca n't imagine how that has any possibility of becoming law. ’ Many people ca n't ... and we 're one day closer. ” – Bret Baier .
[ “ Republicans started off in a place that was an overreach to try to change a law that is central to the president 's agenda and now Democrats are in the position of being one tick too cute and are now overreaching…We need to get back to the middle of the road ... with something for both sides. ” – Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , on “ Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace ” ]
[ Watch Fox : Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , appears in the 9 a.m . ET Hour ]
NO NUKES… YET - Appearing on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press ” Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , noted that Democrats might employ the “ nuclear option ” to change Senate rules and lower the 60-vote threshold on legislation required to push for an increase of the debt limit . Sen. Joe Manchin , D-W.Va , responded on “ Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace ” saying , “ I do n't think we need to go that direction whatsoever and I think we can come to an agreement . ”

NO SHUTTING DOWN 2016 - Cruz wins over ‘ Values Voters ’ - Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , won a Saturday straw-poll of religious conservatives at the 2013 Value Voters Summit in Washington . Cruz took 42 percent of the vote with Dr. Ben Carson and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum each getting 13 percent . Sens . Rand Paul , R-Ky. , and Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , rounded out the field with 6 percent and 5 percent respectively .
Christie slams Congress - In an interview with Daily Beast , Gov . Chris Christie , R-N.J. , had some harsh words for both parties when it comes to the government shutdown : “ You send people down here to run the government , not to shut it down . And everybody ’ s failed. ” When asked about his thoughts on the current state of the GOP , Christie offered , “ I don ’ t worry about the Republican brand . Not my job to worry about it . ”
THE OBAMACARE ATTACK THAT WASN ’ T - Washington Examiner ’ s Byron York imagines what the past two months might have looked like had Republicans not been focused on bitter internal fighting : “ Instead of pounding Obama on the mandates , defects , false promises , and expense of Obamacare , Republicans ended up pounding themselves…Obamacare will still be a major , and for many unwelcome , factor in American life . But what an opportunity missed , at such a crucial time . ”

Buzz Cut:

• Senate Dems go Old Testament: An eye for an eye

• No nukes, yet

• Can’t shut down 2016

• The ObamaCare attack that wasn’t

• It was 1492, but the ocean was really kind of a greenish color

SENATE DEMS GO OLD TESTAMENT: AN EYE FOR AN EYE - Senate Democrats are hunting for six Republicans votes to help Majority Leader Harry Reid jam the GOP-controlled House. With debt-limit doom just three days away, Senate Democrats are still finding time to pay back the House for making the focus of the current fiscal fights all about ObamaCare. Rather than rush to a deal, the evident effort in the Senate is to make House Republicans gag on an increase in federal spending with zero concessions on President Obama’s health law. Democrats over the weekend dissed a plan from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to allow current spending levels to stay in place until March, while raising the debt-limit through January. Collins’ plan would also have delayed for two years a new ObamaCare tax on medical devices and beefed up anti-fraud measures in the law. But Senate Democrats are not looking for a quick solution. They are looking to run out the clock and to punish Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and other conservatives for pushing a doomed bid to defund the law.

[Backroom bargaining: With all ears tuned-in for hints of behind-closed-doors deal on the budget/debt limit impasse, the Senate is slated to convene at 2 p.m. ET]

Equally impossible - Republicans started the messy debate over government funding and borrowing with an impossible ask: ripping out funding for a cherished new Democratic entitlement program. Now, Senate Democrats will return the favor and are demanding the undoing of current spending levels set in the 2011 debt-limit debacle. Those rates, known as “sequestration” are considered sacrosanct to Republicans of all stripes. But now, thanks to the “defund” gambit, Republicans are scrambling to hold ground that most had taken for granted when the back-and-forth began.

Baier Tracks: Unbelievable… “What seemed like a path to at least a partial solution on Friday, seems today like a path to more confusion. While the going bet is, ‘They'll work everything out. They have to,’ there is increasingly a hint of, ‘Um... Maybe they won’t.’ Democrats are now demanding that any talks on the debt-ceiling increase start at a pre-sequester figure. That prompted normally negotiating Republican Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., to tell Chris Wallace that the fight over the debt limit is ‘typically a point where you try to create reforms and reduce deficits, so to agree to something that raises spending from previously agreed to levels, I just can't imagine that. I just can't imagine how that has any possibility of becoming law.’ Many people can't... and we're one day closer.” – Bret Baier.

[“Republicans started off in a place that was an overreach to try to change a law that is central to the president's agenda and now Democrats are in the position of being one tick too cute and are now overreaching…We need to get back to the middle of the road ... with something for both sides.” – Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., on “Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace”]

[Watch Fox: Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., appears in the 9 a.m. ET Hour]

NO NUKES… YET - Appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., noted that Democrats might employ the “nuclear option” to change Senate rules and lower the 60-vote threshold on legislation required to push for an increase of the debt limit. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va, responded on “Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace” saying, “I don't think we need to go that direction whatsoever and I think we can come to an agreement.”

[“Maybe we need to get Joe Biden out of the witness protection program.”— Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Biden’s absence from budget negotiations, on CBS’ “Face the Nation”]

Veterans to White House: ‘tear down these walls’ - Fox News: Veterans marched on Sunday in Washington in protest of the partial government shutdown that has kept them and other Americans from visiting war memorials across the country, with support from former Gov. Sarah Palin, R-Alaska, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and other politicians. Some metal barricades were carried the roughly half-mile walk from the memorial to the White House, where they were left near the fence in front of Pennsylvania Avenue.

[The Republican National Committee is launching robo-calls targeting Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz D-Fla., Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sens. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Mary Landrieu, D-La, and Kay Hagan, D-N.C. for “playing politics” by not taking up a House measure that would ensure veterans receive benefits]

NO SHUTTING DOWN 2016 - Cruz wins over ‘Values Voters’ - Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, won a Saturday straw-poll of religious conservatives at the 2013 Value Voters Summit in Washington. Cruz took 42 percent of the vote with Dr. Ben Carson and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum each getting 13 percent. Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., rounded out the field with 6 percent and 5 percent respectively.

Christie slams Congress - In an interview with Daily Beast, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., had some harsh words for both parties when it comes to the government shutdown: “You send people down here to run the government, not to shut it down. And everybody’s failed.” When asked about his thoughts on the current state of the GOP, Christie offered, “I don’t worry about the Republican brand. Not my job to worry about it.”

THE OBAMACARE ATTACK THAT WASN’T - Washington Examiner’s Byron York imagines what the past two months might have looked like had Republicans not been focused on bitter internal fighting: “Instead of pounding Obama on the mandates, defects, false promises, and expense of Obamacare, Republicans ended up pounding themselves…Obamacare will still be a major, and for many unwelcome, factor in American life. But what an opportunity missed, at such a crucial time.”

E-VERIFY NOT VERIFYING DURING SHUTDOWN - The Department of Homeland Security recently notified employers all over the country that E-Verify, the online system that allows them to check the immigration status of potential workers, will be unavailable during the partial government shutdown. Correspondent Alicia Acuna considers the concern that illegal immigrants and unscrupulous employers could take advantage of the shutdown.

YOUR VOICE WAS HEARD - Men, women, Republicans, Democrats and independents all agreed with Charles Krauthammer when he said that the debt limit was a “trump card” for the GOP in the ongoing budget debate. Bing Pulse also tracked wide agreement among all parties with the assessment from Sen. Lindsey Graham’s, R-S.C., that polls are driving congressional activity. Both men and women agreed with columnist George Will’s conclusion that most Americans do not raise a concern about an issue until a pollster asks them.

Peak viewer engagement on Friday’s “Special Report with Bret Baier” was 33,000 voters per minute, coming when Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, told the audience at the Value Voters Summit, “We've seen an explosion of federal government power. None more important or significant or dangerous than ObamaCare.” Bing Pulse measured a total of 188,000 viewer votes during the All-Star Panel. Was your voice included? Make sure by taking your seat on the panel. Get Friday’s full results here.

Krauthammer found agreement from Democrats when he stated the ObamaCare’s exchange debut was, “...the worst rollout since new coke or new Miley Cyrus.” Women disagreed with Krauthammer’s conclusion more than men. There is a reason it’s called the All-Star Panel, because there is always room for you.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE…Richard Kahlenberg, of the conservative Century Foundation, considers how a case before the Supreme Court this week could help bring an end to racial preferences in higher-education admissions. From Kahlenberg’s WSJ OpEd A Fresh Chance to Rein in Racial Preferences: “A ruling in [Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action] that promotes race-neutral strategies to boost minority admissions would reinforce the message the court tried to deliver last term in Fisher v. University of Texas but has largely fallen on deaf ears. In Fisher, the justices supported higher education's goal of achieving a racially diverse student body, but they gave universities a strong push toward creating that diversity through race-neutral strategies...”

MCAULIFFE DONOR CONTROVERSY - A $120,000 donation to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe’s campaign from The Liberian International Ship and Corporate Registry (LICSCR), which runs Liberia’s shipping industry, is drawing scrutiny. From the News Leader of Staunton, Va.: “The company is a frequent target of organized labor, making it an odd ally for McAuliffe, who enjoys robust union support… LISCR also played a controversial role during the bloody regime of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, whose war crimes conviction by the U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone was upheld last month.”

IF OBAMA CAN TALK TO ROUHANI, HE CAN TALK TO DR. K - Charles Krauthammer explained to Howard Kurtz on “#Media Buzz” Sunday why he agreed to an off-the-record meeting with President Obama. Krauthammer told Kurtz, “He has got deadlines coming up and I think he wants to make as many friends as he can, or at least to make his case. The other interpretation is that if he can talk to [Iranian President] Hassan Rouhani, he figured he can now talk to me.”

KT FROM CAIRO - Fox News Security Analyst KT McFarland was one of the first American journalists to meet with Egypt’s leaders since the coup that ousted that country’s Islamist government. She shares her take for Fox News Opinion: “While Washington quibbles over whether Egypt’s current government meets the legal definition of a coup… Egyptians are grappling with life and death issues of survival…We talked to many people neither the U.S. government nor western media has bothered to meet with. Not surprisingly, we heard a very different story.”

FATHER OF THE BRIDE - Scott Nagy, 56, of Brunswick, Ohio did not let his battle with terminal cancer keep him from fulfilling a promise he made to his daughter. Nagy’s doctors told him that he faced long odds in surviving until the original wedding date next year, so his daughter, Sarah, moved up the event. Dad arrived by ambulance to give her away from a hospital gurney. “It was a promise I made in March, to walk her down the aisle,” Nagy told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. “She's my princess. This is my definition of walking down the aisle,” adding “There are no guarantees in life…this is a bonus.” Thanks to Skype, Dad was able to deliver the traditional toast at the reception.

THE OCEAN BLUE…Today marks the observance of Christopher Columbus’ Oct. 12, 1492 arrival in the New World. But what don’t you know about Italy’s most famous explorer and his voyage? Salt Lake City’s Deseret News is glad you asked. On the paper’s list of Columbian facts: Columbus wrote in his journal that he lied to his crew about the distances sailed each day “that the crew might not be dismayed if the voyage should prove long.” And do you know where Columbus first stepped ashore? It wasn’t Hispaniola. The Bahamas can claim the title. Or how many years it took for Columbus to begin to realize the magnitude of his discovery? Nearly six. And who held the first Columbus Day celebration? Why, politicians, of course. Tammany Hall, the birthplace of New York Democratic machine politics, was also the birthplace of Columbus Day, hosting the first celebration in 1792.

Gone the days of bipartisan socializing

It started in the 1980s when reaching across the aisle was more common than today, despite sharp ideological differences. It rose through a period of general cohesiveness at the turn of the decade, when the Berlin Wall fell and Operation Desert Storm repelled Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait.

Deploying the 'nuclear option' against Republicans

It was as whip that Reid mastered the parliamentary skill and maneuvering that prepared him to take over as minority leader after Senator Daschle’s stunning defeat in 2004.

“He learned that tactics is everything,” says Ross Baker, an expert on Congress at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. Unusually, Mr. Baker has three times perched himself as a “scholar in residence” observing Reid's office – the latest this past spring.

Reid's decision to drop that bomb is perhaps the best illustration of his overriding character as a “fighter,” as his No. 2, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois describes it.

Tough childhood

Reid’s battles go back to his tough childhood in Searchlight, Nev., south of Las Vegas. His father was a hard-rock miner and alcoholic who committed suicide. To make ends meet, his mother did the laundry for nearby brothels.

In his farewell speech, he mentioned his pride in saving up to buy false teeth for his mother, who had lost hers due to an accident. This, and other health needs for his impoverished family, help explain why he's been such ""an avid supporter"" of Obamacare, he said.

As a teenager, Reid hitchhiked 40 miles to high school in Henderson. There his civics teacher and boxing coach – Reid became locally known as a middleweight boxer – became his political mentor.

After law school, he was elected to the Nevada Assembly, and later was elected lieutenant governor. He was appointed Nevada’s gaming commissioner, and then it was on to Washington. Few of his elections have been cakewalks.

As Reid acknowledges, he's no great orator (journalists have to lean in close at press conferences to hear his whispery voice), nor is he a policy visionary.

But he can block a punch, protecting his caucus from dangerous Republican “messaging” or “gotcha” votes, as well as deliver one. The senator is known for his indelicate comments, calling the second President Bush “a loser” and “a liar.”

The filibuster

Reid has often defended his decision to “go nuclear,” justifying it as the only way to break through heavy use of the filibuster by obstructionist Republicans – the same criticism Republicans level at Democrats.

He was particularly frustrated by his inability to get Obama’s federal judges confirmed, particularly to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals – the second most powerful court in the country. Reid was able to confirm three judges to the court after he swept away the filibuster. His move helped stoke GOP retaliation over Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland – who was never granted a hearing.

“I do hope my colleagues are able to temper their use of the filibuster, otherwise it will be gone,” he said.

A test is coming when a President Trump will send his Supreme Court nominee to the Senate. Will Democrats filibuster? Will Republicans unilaterally decided to remove that barrier as well?

Given their strong objections to several of Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees and their inability to block them, “many Democrats are now ruing their decision,” says Mr. Baker.

Reid urged both parties to work together on the filibuster issue. That may be easier now that he’s being replaced by the incoming Democratic leader, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who is respected by Republicans.

Hopefully things will improve, said Durbin, speaking of the difficult working relationship between Senator McConnell and Reid. “I hope that with Senator Schumer there will be a different approach, a new day and new opportunity, but only time will tell.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,96mjkkQQj0x1SbQQ

A month after President Barack Obama won reelection , top brass from three dozen of the most powerful groups in liberal politics met at the headquarters of the National Education Association ( NEA ) , a few blocks north of the White House . Brought together by the Sierra Club , Greenpeace , Communication Workers of America ( CWA ) , and the NAACP , the meeting was invite-only and off-the-record . Despite all the Democratic wins in November , a sense of outrage filled the room as labor officials , environmentalists , civil rights activists , immigration reformers , and a panoply of other progressive leaders discussed the challenges facing the left and what to do to beat back the deep-pocketed conservative movement .
At the end of the day , many of the attendees closed with a pledge of money and staff resources to build a national , coordinated campaign around three goals : getting big money out of politics , expanding the voting rolls while fighting voter ID laws , and rewriting Senate rules to curb the use of the filibuster to block legislation . The groups in attendance pledged a total of millions of dollars and dozens of organizers to form a united front on these issues—potentially , a coalition of a kind rarely seen in liberal politics , where squabbling is common and a stay-in-your-lane attitude often prevails . “ It was so exciting , ” says Michael Brune , the Sierra Club ’ s executive director . “ We weren ’ t just wringing our hands about the Koch brothers . We were saying , ‘ I ’ ll put in this amount of dollars and this many organizers . ' ”

It was the kind of meeting that conspiratorial conservative bloggers dream about.

A month after President Barack Obama won reelection, top brass from three dozen of the most powerful groups in liberal politics met at the headquarters of the National Education Association (NEA), a few blocks north of the White House. Brought together by the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Communication Workers of America (CWA), and the NAACP, the meeting was invite-only and off-the-record. Despite all the Democratic wins in November, a sense of outrage filled the room as labor officials, environmentalists, civil rights activists, immigration reformers, and a panoply of other progressive leaders discussed the challenges facing the left and what to do to beat back the deep-pocketed conservative movement.

At the end of the day, many of the attendees closed with a pledge of money and staff resources to build a national, coordinated campaign around three goals: getting big money out of politics, expanding the voting rolls while fighting voter ID laws, and rewriting Senate rules to curb the use of the filibuster to block legislation. The groups in attendance pledged a total of millions of dollars and dozens of organizers to form a united front on these issues—potentially, a coalition of a kind rarely seen in liberal politics, where squabbling is common and a stay-in-your-lane attitude often prevails. “It was so exciting,” says Michael Brune, the Sierra Club’s executive director. “We weren’t just wringing our hands about the Koch brothers. We were saying, ‘I’ll put in this amount of dollars and this many organizers.'”

The liberal activists have dubbed this effort the Democracy Initiative. The campaign, Brune says, has since been attracting other members—and also interest from foundations looking to give money—because many groups on the left believe they can’t accomplish their own goals without winning reforms on the Initiative’s three issues. “This isn’t an optional activity for us,” Brune tells me. “It is mission critical.”

Aides say they plan to use two tried-and-true strategies to unleash them: the outside game — getting the public, especially Republicans, so riled up that Washington is forced to listen — and the inside game, lobbying in Washington in hopes of peeling off Republicans.

Democrats and the outside game

There is no shortage of Democratic outrage at Trump. The key for the opposition, they say, is to resonate with voters who supported Trump because he ran as an outsider, a populist, and a pro–working class candidate.

In interviews, Senate Democratic aides say one answer may be to hammer Trump for failing to live up to his campaign pledges to break from the most unpopular elements of Republican orthodoxy.

“The story is something like, ‘Trump said he was a different kind of Republican on entitlements. Then he nominates the architect of a Medicare privatization scheme to be HHS secretary,” says one Senate Democratic aide close to leadership.

The second story Democrats might try to tell through the Cabinet fights is how they illustrate the meaninglessness of Trump’s plan to “drain the swamp.” Trump promised on the campaign trail to be free from the influence of outside donors, yet his team has been stuffed full of lobbyists. His business empire stands to benefit in a big way from his presidency.

“A lot of the nominees are going to be subject to the same conflict-of-interest problems as Trump,” the aide said.

Incoming presidential administrations — at least historically — are often harried and unusually sensitive to intense public backlash. That gives the opposition an opening.

“The strategy is to make fighting for the appointment too costly to the incoming administration,” says Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden. “You come into the White House, you’re trying to set up your operation, and all of a sudden you have to devote a lot of your bandwidth and energy to supporting a Cabinet post. If the pressure is strong enough, that can move the calculus. If you have to spend a week or two on it, and if you have other people in the wings, you may just throw them under the bus instead.”

Peeling off moderate Republican senators

The inside game may point in a very different direction. Instead of putting the priority on generating a national outcry, it entails lobbying individual moderate Republicans to try convincing them to buck their party.

And that’s only possible if Senate Democrats themselves stay completely unified. That itself is no sure bet, given that at least one senator in Democratic leadership — West Virginia Blue Dog Joe Manchin — is already saying the party shouldn’t try too hard to delay Trump’s Cabinet. (Politico says the votes are already there for Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, who maintains a collegial relationship with the Senate — racist comments in his past aside.)

Beyond taking the case to the individual senators, the inside game also involves going to interest groups or other big organizations on Capitol Hill and trying to get them to turn Republicans’ incentives.

Alone, there’s no single group with the kind of pull to make that happen. But, speaking on the condition of anonymity, one Senate Democratic aide offered suggestions of what this could look like:

We’re going to learn a lot about what the opposition to Trump looks like

After the election, it was hard not to run into a liberal who wasn’t eager to tell you that they want Senate Democrats to “fight back.” “Hold Trump accountable” became the rallying cry du jour. Activists are abuzz about leading “the resistance” to the Trump era.

David Gergen, a CNN commentator who served key White House roles under both Republican and Democratic administrations, laid out how to think about what it takes for a presidency to react to public disapproval of a Cabinet choice:

It takes an organized outcry, and right now there are a lot of people who are getting aroused or negative about what Trump people are up to. But it's still inchoate — the opposition, it hasn’t really formed. You’ll need a specific issue, something that hasn’t been talked about yet — policy X or decision Y or past thing Z — to just take off and set off a firestorm. The talk shows and social media and op-eds — that's where the boiling starts. But it takes more than that to get things to erupt. It takes either people in the streets or polls that are really wildly lopsided or phone calls from unexpected sources.

To get this done, Democrats will need to pick their priorities, craft their message, stay united, and create public outcry that will speak to a wide enough audience inside the Senate. The best test yet of whether they can do so is fast approaching.",www.vox.com,left,f1UdnHzwWWiC7KGn

democratic_party,Business Insider,1,http://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-party-civil-war-clinton-loss-trump-2016-11,The Democratic Party descends into 'civil war' after Clinton's loss,2016-11-12,Oliver Darcy,"President-elect Donald Trump ’ s unforeseen election win over Hillary Clinton has ignited immediate infighting inside the Democratic Party , with progressive members lashing out at the establishment wing for failing to defeat one of the most flawed Republican presidential candidates in a generation .
“ There is no question there is a civil war taking place inside the Democratic Party , ” said Cenk Uygur , co-founder of The Young Turks , a progressive internet-based commentary program .
Progressives have long felt disaffected from the Democratic Party , often arguing elected officials cater to special interests and regularly compromise their values to work with Republicans across the aisle .
But Trump 's electoral triumph has shattered the Democratic Party , bringing out venom that bubbled to a breaking point during the campaign . Last summer , WikiLeaks published hacked emails exposing top members of the Democratic National Committee . Those emails showed that party officials were actively working to help Clinton secure the nomination , while simultaneously sabotaging the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , who became a progressive hero in a stunning outsider run of his own .
The outrage was enough to force then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign . Donna Brazile was promoted from vice chair to interim chair of the party , temporarily pacifying progressive concerns .
But , following a stunning defeat Tuesday night , progressives are once again up in arms . They contend that the Democratic Party has allowed corporate interests to dictate its policy agenda for far too long , resulting in major losses like the one to Trump .
“ It ’ s so obvious , I can ’ t believe they can ’ t see it , ” Uygur told ███ . “ The Democrats have become the establishment party . And people hate the establishment . ”
Clinton “ represents the establishment , ” he added . “ She looks like and acts like she ’ s from The Capitol in 'The Hunger Games . ' ''
The most immediate battlefield for the anti-establishment war is over who will be selected as the next Democratic Party chair . Progressives have consolidated around Rep. Keith Ellison , a reliable liberal from Minnesota , while former party chair Howard Dean represents a more establishment minded candidate .
On Friday morning , Ellison received a significant endorsement from likely future-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . But to progressives , the move from Schumer did not seem sincere . Instead , they argued , it was one done in an attempt to maintain power .
“ Chuck is a very smart guy , ” said Nomiki Konst , a Democratic strategist , former Sanders surrogate , and host of “ The Filter ” on Sirus XM . “ He has to be a senator . He has the responsibility in the Senate to make things work , and he knows probably half the Hillary supporters were much more progressive . ”
She added : “ I think he knows he has a responsibility to follow the trend — otherwise , he would have a riot on his hands . ”
Konst has offered a number of suggestions to Democratic Party leadership on how to initiate reform .
The Democratic strategist suggested barring consultants and lobbyists from being members of the DNC , implementing a union membership quota , and eliminating superdelegates , Democratic Party leaders and elected officials who can vote for their candidate of choice during the primaries .
“ I would call for emergency elections , ” she added . “ This is crisis level — get rid of these vice chairs . A lot of these vice chairs are really bad people . ”
Ryan Williams , a former deputy national press secretary for Mitt Romney ’ s 2012 presidential campaign , said what is taking place inside the Democratic Party is perhaps worse than what happened when President Barack Obama defeated the Republican nominee in 2012 , while Democrats retook the Senate and made gains in the House . Now , after Tuesday 's shock results , Republicans have control of all three branches of government .
“ They are in a dark place , ” he said , adding , “ It ’ s very difficult to go from a party being in control of the White House to being cast into the wilderness . The White House is the glue that holds the party together . You have a set leader . Right now , the Democrats have no set leader . ”
Both Konst and Uygur said progressives will absolutely fight for control of the party while the vacuum is open .
Establishment Democrats , including leaders like Schumer , should not feel their positions are secure , Uygur said .
“ We are going to rip you down , ” he warned , speaking of the Democratic Party establishment . “ I have no use for them . I don ’ t know what to tell them other than we are going to beat them . I don ’ t want their help . I know what their incentives are . They want the money . Almost anything else is a trick . ”
The political commentator predicted that in a week progressives should win the DNC chair fight and `` firmly establish in the voters ' mind — and in Washington 's mind — that the progressives are right and the establishment was wrong . ''
`` Having said that , the empire will strike back , '' Uygur anticipated , adding that progressives were more than ready for what he called the `` long war '' ahead .","President-elect Donald Trump’s unforeseen election win over Hillary Clinton has ignited immediate infighting inside the Democratic Party, with progressive members lashing out at the establishment wing for failing to defeat one of the most flawed Republican presidential candidates in a generation.

“There is no question there is a civil war taking place inside the Democratic Party,” said Cenk Uygur, co-founder of The Young Turks, a progressive internet-based commentary program.

“And the progressive side is going to win.”

Progressives have long felt disaffected from the Democratic Party, often arguing elected officials cater to special interests and regularly compromise their values to work with Republicans across the aisle.

But Trump's electoral triumph has shattered the Democratic Party, bringing out venom that bubbled to a breaking point during the campaign. Last summer, WikiLeaks published hacked emails exposing top members of the Democratic National Committee. Those emails showed that party officials were actively working to help Clinton secure the nomination, while simultaneously sabotaging the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who became a progressive hero in a stunning outsider run of his own.

The outrage was enough to force then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign. Donna Brazile was promoted from vice chair to interim chair of the party, temporarily pacifying progressive concerns.

But, following a stunning defeat Tuesday night, progressives are once again up in arms. They contend that the Democratic Party has allowed corporate interests to dictate its policy agenda for far too long, resulting in major losses like the one to Trump.

“It’s so obvious, I can’t believe they can’t see it,” Uygur told Business Insider. “The Democrats have become the establishment party. And people hate the establishment.”

Clinton “represents the establishment,” he added. “She looks like and acts like she’s from The Capitol in 'The Hunger Games.'""

The most immediate battlefield for the anti-establishment war is over who will be selected as the next Democratic Party chair. Progressives have consolidated around Rep. Keith Ellison, a reliable liberal from Minnesota, while former party chair Howard Dean represents a more establishment minded candidate.

On Friday morning, Ellison received a significant endorsement from likely future-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But to progressives, the move from Schumer did not seem sincere. Instead, they argued, it was one done in an attempt to maintain power.

“Chuck is a very smart guy,” said Nomiki Konst, a Democratic strategist, former Sanders surrogate, and host of “The Filter” on Sirus XM. “He has to be a senator. He has the responsibility in the Senate to make things work, and he knows probably half the Hillary supporters were much more progressive.”

Now, after Tuesday's shock results, Republicans have control of all three branches of government.

“They are in a dark place,” he said, adding, “It’s very difficult to go from a party being in control of the White House to being cast into the wilderness. The White House is the glue that holds the party together. You have a set leader. Right now, the Democrats have no set leader.”

National Democrats are taking steps to create a large-scale independent group aimed at turning traditionally conservative Texas into a prime electoral battleground , crafting a new initiative to identify and mobilize progressive voters in the rapidly-changing state , strategists familiar with the plans told ███ .
The organization , dubbed “ Battleground Texas , ” plans to engage the state ’ s rapidly growing Latino population , as well as African-American voters and other Democratic-leaning constituencies that have been underrepresented at the ballot box in recent cycles . Two sources said the contemplated budget would run into the tens of millions of dollars over several years - a project Democrats hope has enough heft to help turn what has long been an electoral pipe dream into reality .
At the center of the effort is Jeremy Bird , formerly the national field director for President Barack Obama ’ s reelection campaign , who was in Austin last week to confer with local Democrats about the project .
In a statement to ███ , Bird said the group would be “ a grass-roots organization that will make Texas a battleground state by treating it like one . ”
“ With its diversity and size , Texas should always be a battleground state where local elections are vigorously contested and anyone who wants to be our commander in chief has to compete and show they reflect Texas values . Yet for far too long , the state ’ s political leaders , both in Austin and in Washington , D.C. , have failed to stand for Texans , ” said Bird , who recently founded a consulting firm , 270 Strategies . “ Over the next several years , Battleground Texas will focus on expanding the electorate by registering more voters — and as importantly , by mobilizing Texans who are already registered voters but who have not been engaged in the democratic process . ”
Said Bird : “ Candidates who represent Texans should have to fight hard for the honor — and Battleground Texas will help make sure they do .
One Democrat close to the planning process said the group intended to bring in “ top campaign talent to Texas ” for a long-term organizing push . Strategists filed papers with the Texas Ethics Commission to create Battleground Texas earlier this month with that goal in mind .
“ It ’ s going to take a sustained effort and we ’ re going to have to prove ourselves over time , ” the Democrat said . “ We need to have the talent in state to build something real over time and make the environment such that you can look someone in the eye and say , ‘ You can run statewide and you can win , ’ or you can tell a presidential candidate that you should really consider putting resources here . ”
Another strategist tied to Texas called the project a “ very positive effort to try to put together a pretty broad grass-roots organization to try to identify and ultimately mobilize progressive voters . ”
“ There ’ s a realistic view that that will take more than one cycle , ” the strategist said . “ None of this stuff is ever real until you ’ ve got money . ”
Democrats have eyed Texas longingly for years , watching as the Republican bastion has transformed into a majority-minority state . The 2010 census found that 38 percent of Texans identified themselves as Latino or Hispanic ; just under 45 percent were non-Hispanic whites .
But the Democratic infrastructure in Texas has decayed over two decades of GOP ascendancy . Congressional and legislative redistricting has undercut the party ’ s efforts to rebuild there . Republicans control every statewide office , and Obama lost to Mitt Romney in the state by 16 points in November . No exit poll was taken in Texas last November , but Latinos have typically made up a smaller share of the electorate than the overall population .
Still , Democrats buoyed by the breadth of their 2012 victories are looking to Texas as a political holy grail : a prize so spectacular that it might just be worth a big , sustained investment of money and energy . If state and national party leaders committed the time and almost presidential-level resources required , the thinking goes , the most important cornerstone of the GOP ’ s electoral map could become competitive .
“ I ’ m excited to see that at national levels , people are now looking at Texas and saying , ‘ That ’ s where we need to make our next investment . That ’ s where the next opportunity lies. ’ The enthusiasm that I ’ m hearing in that regard is growing every day , ” said Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis .
The Fort Worth legislator , who won a difficult reelection campaign last year in a conservative district , is viewed in and outside of Texas as perhaps her party ’ s strongest statewide prospect for 2014 . Both Davis and San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro visited Washington during the Inauguration this week and addressed a fundraiser for the Lone Star Project , an influential outside group that drives Democratic messaging in Texas .
At the Sunday event , U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk , the former Dallas mayor , whipped up the crowd with a concise version of the case for competing in Texas : “ When Texas turns blue , this country ’ s going to turn blue and it ’ s going to stay blue . ”
Matt Angle , the former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee who founded the Lone Star Project , argued that there ’ s “ a lot of optimism in Texas , but it ’ s tempered with realism . ”
“ People understand that it ’ s going to take a lot of focused resources and a deliberate effort to define the Republican leadership in Texas for what it is , which is failed . Absent that , the hill remains very steep , ” Angle said . “ The demographics are coming into place and Republicans have created an opportunity … But it ’ s also doing the hard work and raising the money that it takes . ”
Davis — whom multiple Republicans privately described as “ scary ” to the GOP — agreed that there ’ s political opportunity for Democrats in Texas but said it remains to be seen how quickly the party can take advantage of it .
“ Our issues already are the issues that are reflective of the values of the people in Texas : building a strong public education , creating an opportunity for higher education and making sure that we keep our citizens healthy so that their families are strong and our economy is strong , ” Davis told ███ . “ I ’ m excited that people are talking about the opportunity for me to do something statewide one day . What I ’ m smart enough to know is that you can ’ t decide that ’ s a good idea for yourself . Instead , the support for that has to generate from under . ”
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker said her party couldn ’ t afford to wait passively for population change to turn Texas blue . Instead , they should dig in for a longer , harder campaign to make it a swing state .
“ We have been waiting in Texas for a very long time for the Latino vote to come into its own and turn the tide . But many of us have decided that we can ’ t wait for that . We have to do the old-fashioned work of going out and talking to Texans , ” said Parker , who didn ’ t rule out a statewide campaign “ when I am done [ being ] mayor . ”
“ Do I think we ’ re going to turn Texas in two years ? Probably not . Do I think we can turn Texas in four years ? Absolutely , because I think the Republican Party in Texas is going to drive itself off a cliff , ” Parker said . “ You hear Republicans with rhetoric , literally talking about the jack-booted thugs coming and taking guns out of people ’ s homes , going door to door . You have legislators who will file , once again , virulently anti-immigrant legislation in the state House . ”
Any new national group aimed at building up Texas Democrats would join a small but significant array of in-state organizations developing progressive infrastructure . In addition to the Lone Star Project and the germinal Battleground Texas effort , strategists pointed to the group Be One Texas as a significant player in their comeback effort .
That organization plans to spend heavily across several elections to coordinate action among Democratic interest groups , said Texas strategist Robert Jones , who ’ s taking over as the group ’ s CEO next week . Be One Texas will follow the “ roundtable ” model adopted successfully by Democrats in states such as Colorado and Minnesota , where collaboration between big donors , labor groups , women ’ s groups and other core Democratic constituencies have powered major gains .
“ I think there ’ s a lot of conversations about Texas right now , looking at the electoral map and how you change the nature of politics in the country , ” said Jones . “ The state is on track to have 42 electoral votes in the 2020 census , so it has the potential to be a huge player in national politics . ”
Ideally , Democrats said , the existing progressive groups there and a new entity would end up “ embracing and reinforcing one another . ”
Republicans have consistently scoffed at Democratic attempts to woo the Texas electorate — and with some cause . As strategists in both parties see it , national Democrats periodically find themselves gripped with excitement about competing there , only to find that the state is too big , too expensive and too culturally conservative for them to pull it off .
The party fielded a strong candidate for governor in 2010 , former Houston Mayor Bill White , only to see him lose by 13 points to incumbent Gov . Rick Perry . Two years later , Democrats recruited retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez into the open-seat Senate race , presenting him as a candidate who could appeal to conservative voters and energize Latinos . Sanchez withdrew several months later after raising a paltry sum for the race .
From the deeply skeptical Republican perspective , Democratic hopes for flipping Texas — even over the medium to long term — recall the GOP ’ s short-lived aspirations to compete in California at the height of George W. Bush ’ s popularity .
Republican strategist Dave Carney , who has worked extensively in Texas and steered Perry ’ s 2010 reelection , dismissed Democratic claims that a brand-new voter mobilization project would help transform the state . He called it a matter of “ consultants coming up with a project to get paid . ”
“ The more money they spend on [ Battleground Texas ] , the better it is for Texas and the taxpayers of Texas , because it will basically lead to continued conservative dominance of the state . There ’ s a reason voters are low-propensity voters . They don ’ t vote , ” Carney said . “ It ’ s their message that hurts [ Democrats ] . It ’ s their inability to articulate a message that the vast majority of Texas voters agree with . ”
Andy Seré , a national GOP strategist with Texas ties , emphasized just what a steep challenge Democrats have ahead of them : “ Democrats simply lack anything close to the statewide infrastructure that a majority party has , and they don ’ t appear even close to it . In order to become competitive , they need to expand their donor base beyond trial lawyers and their voter base beyond minorities . And until they do , they are not going to be competitive in a state as big and fast-growing as Texas is . ”
Even more-than-usually upbeat Texas Democrats acknowledge that state Republicans have built a formidable edifice to protect their majority . If Perry currently looks like a weakened governor , he has been underestimated before ; and state Attorney General Greg Abbott is waiting in the wings as a possible successor with a massive war chest at his disposal .
“ Republicans here have a decade ’ s worth of fundraising and infrastructure that plays to their advantage . I don ’ t care what state you ’ re in , that ’ s going to be hard for any challenger to go up against , ” said Austin-based Democratic operative Ed Espinoza . “ Having said that , we have some really bright stars . We don ’ t have a deep bench , but we do have a good bench . ”
Looking to 2014 and beyond , Espinoza echoed the Democratic consensus that building viable statewide institutions for Democrats is the top priority .
“ We do need to have a good team , and we do need to have a good ticket . We ’ ve had too many go-it-alone candidacies that just weren ’ t able to do it on their own , ” he said . “ Coordination should focus on things like who can raise money , who can build structure and who can build votes . Too often we say , ‘ Well , this person ’ s brown , so they can win brown votes , and this person ’ s a woman , so she can win women ’ s votes . ’ ”","Democrats have eyed the Lone Star State longingly for years. | REUTERS Dems launch plan to turn Texas blue

Tom Cole may have said it best when he joked during a meeting of the House Rules Committee on Wednesday that “ it ’ s been great to listen to this debate over the soul of the Democratic Party . ”
The Oklahoma Republican was gently teasing his friend , Rep. George Miller ( D-Calif. ) , who had just had a heated exchange with a fellow liberal , Rep. Alcee Hastings ( D-Fla. ) , over pension legislation attached to a must-pass spending bill . Having spent years explaining to neighbors all the screaming from the Republican household , Cole welcomed the chance to look over the fence and gloat at the discord among Democrats .
Twenty-four hours later , amid tense vote counting on the House floor , the laughs were harder to come by . But Cole ’ s remark and that old Watergate line— “ Follow the money ” —are the best way to understand all the fireworks over an otherwise flat-line $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that finally cleared Congress on Saturday night .
Indeed , with the loss of the Senate and President Barack Obama reduced to lame-duck status , Democrats in Congress seem torn between two choices : Dig in , or head to the hills and try to rebuild a guerrilla army .
For sure , Republicans still have their own problems . The GOP lost 67 of its own members in the House vote Thursday night ; Senate passage this weekend was stalled by Republican infighting and the open disdain by the Tea Party right toward the incoming Majority Leader , Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) .
But it ’ s the splits among Democrats that are the fresh news since November . And like the fading winter light outside the Capitol , these four days in December became their own reality check on what lies ahead for the party : less power over already limited government resources .
“ This is the beginning of the new Congress . It ’ s not really the last fight of the last Congress , ” said Miller later . And while he ’ s now retiring to California , the lessons of November are plain for his party when it comes back in January . “ We ’ re fully aware there are no reinforcements , ” Miller said . “ There ’ s no bugle being sounded from our side . ”
In the case of the spending bill , Obama and Appropriations Committee Democrats chose the route of compromise even when it meant helping their past tormentor , Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) . At the same time , Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California , a former speaker and appropriator herself , chose greater confrontation , abandoning old friends for an alliance with a new one , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) .
It was a vote for stability vs. a vote for spunk , a contest less about principle in the end than price , and to a striking degree , one dominated by four powerful women .
Pelosi and Warren were matched against the two top Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations committees , Rep. Nita Lowey of New York and Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland . How each pair handled a controversial regulatory carve-out for banks engaged in swaps trading was telling .
Pelosi and Warren saw the carve-out as a powerful symbol , even a bugle call , for Democrats to help the party reconnect with struggling families who aren ’ t enjoying the same recovery as the Wall Street banks already bailed out by Washington and now seeking concessions .
This populist narrative was helped , too , by the fact that Pelosi ’ s fellow top leaders in Congress had slipped in last-minute language allowing wealthy donors to give more to the political parties for the purposes of funding the national conventions—a change Pelosi felt she was not fully informed of in advance .
When Obama finally stepped in to tip the scales against her , Pelosi didn ’ t hide her disappointment at what she saw as a blown opportunity to revitalize the party . Friday night , in the most personal terms , Warren put down her marker on the Senate floor : blaming Citigroup directly and warning that if Wall Street wants to revisit the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law in the new Congress , she would use her voice to make it tougher .
“ Enough is enough , ” she said . “ To anyone who is listening at Citi , I agree with you that Dodd-Frank isn ’ t perfect . It should have broken you into pieces . ”
By contrast , Lowey and Mikulski saw the same bank language as an irritant but also leverage with which to gain money to strengthen the very same regulators—the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission—charged with implementing Dodd-Frank .
Neither woman had wanted the carve-out in the spending package , but with Republicans taking over the Senate next month , the common judgment—shared by the White House—was that the provision stood a very good chance of becoming law .
Lowey herself was one of 70 Democrats who had backed a free-standing House bill with almost identical language—a measure that passed by a veto-proof 292-122 margin in 2013 . And by giving in to Republicans now , she and Mikulski were able to secure a total of $ 185 million more for the CFTC and SEC and protect the independence of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a past priority for Warren .
For all the inflammatory rhetoric about a “ sellout ” to Wall Street , the bottom-line critique was really that Lowey and Mikulski had just sold too cheap .
“ It ’ s not very much , ” said former Rep. Barney Frank ( D-Mass . ) , who was appalled by the whole process . But Frank then quickly added that if the sum had been larger , “ There might have been a deal . ”
Miller ’ s own pension amendment seems lost in this fray but also reflected the tough , divisive choices for his party after November .
In fact , the supreme irony of Thursday night was that this man—who had been Pelosi ’ s strong right arm for years— should spend his last hours in the House fighting to save a bill against the wishes of the woman he had helped to make history .
Most simply , the pension measure seeks to help financially strapped multi-employer plans by taking two steps . The first is an increase in the insurance premiums paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp . The second is a precedent-setting change in law that will allow union workers and retirees the right to vote to trim benefits in hopes of avoiding still worse results if their pension plans fail .
This goes against the grain of Democrats like Hastings who argue that the bill makes it easier then to undercut what ’ s guaranteed workers in their retirement . But Miller answered that those guarantees are already fading in today ’ s economy . And it ’ s better for Democrats , he said , to give workers the option to make choices of their own to get through the storm .
“ If we trust labor unions , and if we trust workers and we talk about the dignity of the worker , ” he challenged Hastings . “ How about the dignity of the worker deciding whether he , she or their co-workers can try to save their pension ? ... That ’ s all this bill does . There ’ s no mandate here . ”
“ Do you agree it is a radical change in 40 years of law ? ” Hastings countered .
“ It would be a radical change if I ’ m cutting their benefits , ” Miller answered , his voice rising in anger and left finger jabbing the air . “ I don ’ t think it ’ s radical when you empower the people who have the greatest at stake to make a decision on their own behalf . ”
Then after a short pause—as if the words he had just said were sinking in—Miller fell back in his chair and laughed : “ Well , actually , that would be fairy radical , ” he said .
Later , in an interview , the California Democrat was just as blunt : “ There aren ’ t any guarantees , and [ after November ’ s elections ] there are no guys coming over the hill to deliver them , ” Miller said .
It ’ s this same reality that applies to Democrats and the remainder of the giant spending bill . Filling over 1,600 pages , the measure provides close to $ 1.1 trillion for the coming year , but inside the numbers , domestic appropriations are largely frozen in 2015 and won ’ t get any better in 2016 , the last year of Obama ’ s presidency .
These caps forced negotiators like Mikulski and Lowey to make scores of puts and takes to stay underneath . The Internal Revenue Service and Environmental Protection Agency , two favorite Republican targets , will absorb real cuts . But elsewhere the measure locks in modest increases for science and college affordability , for example , while preserving gains in early childhood education supported by the president .
A little-noticed initiative makes Pell Grants more accessible to low-income students in career programs at community colleges . And after all the bitterness over immigration policy , the bill is quietly supportive of efforts to find attorneys for the thousands of unaccompanied children who crossed into the U.S. from Central America this year—and now face deportation proceedings .
As seen already , the policy riders are a political minefield and will certainly get worse for Obama once Republicans are in full control next year .
But the Affordable Care Act and his climate change agenda are left largely intact for the moment . And on balance , both the White House and Agriculture Department were pleased that the final compromises tilted in favor of first lady Michelle Obama ’ s campaign to improve the nutrition standards for school lunches .
For much of his presidency , Obama has been famously detached from the gritty details of appropriations bills . And even with this package , he was surprisingly slow to step in and help save the giant measure in the House .
Yet with the economy beginning to grow , Obama has a real stake in the stability afforded by the agreement . This spending bill—which builds on a similar one adopted last winter—promises him a rare two-year window of relative order after all the prior shutdown and debt ceiling crises since Republicans won the House in 2010 .
The sole exception is the Department of Homeland Security , which remains on a short leash until Republicans decide how they will respond next year to Obama ’ s executive orders on immigration .
Funding for DHS is extended only through February , and the bitterness of the immigration issue and Obama ’ s executive action can not be underestimated , as seen in the Senate this weekend .
But Homeland is not a hostage the GOP can afford to kill , since too many Republican priorities are affected , from border security to the troubled operations at the Secret Service . This could militate against a prolonged fight because as long as the department remains on a stopgap continuing resolution , or CR , Republicans know that these agencies will be shortchanged .
If a more stable government helps the economy , the bill is also a political asset for Obama since it defines a bipartisan benchmark from which future Republican-backed spending cuts will be made .
A lot of the 2015 decisions are really about 2016 . This was part of the calculation in trying to pump up the CFTC and SEC at this stage even if it meant accepting the bank carve-out . For sure the CFTC will again be a target for the GOP . But with the $ 35 million increase in the bill now , the regulator will have established a budget level of $ 250 million—still well below what the administration believes is needed but significantly better than just a few years ago .
The carve-out—sought by Citigroup and other major Wall Street and regional banks—will give them more flexibility to keep their hedging and swaps trading in-house , rather than being pushed out to a separate entity .
Warren argues that the real goal is to continue to enjoy federal bank insurance while making these trades . But proponents of the modifications insist this is not the case . And the language inserted in the spending bill doesn ’ t alter the broad prohibition in Section 716 of Dodd-Frank against federal assistance for “ any swaps entity with respect to any swap , security-based swap , or other activity of the swaps entity . ”
The changes are “ worse procedurally than substantively , ” said Frank , who chaired the House Financial Services Committee and gave his name to Dodd-Frank . “ It weakens the bill somewhat , though I think there ’ s been a little hyperbole there . ”
Derivatives in banks , he pointed out , are also covered by the so-called Volker rule , credited to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker and enacted in Dodd-Frank to curb speculative trading . Frank himself had not included what became Section 716 in his initial financial reform bill in the House . And in 2012 he chose not to fight those wanting some of the same modifications in dispute now .
That said , the legislative process used now is an “ outrage ” procedurally , he said , and a dangerous precedent . His fear is that banks will use more backroom deals to undo Dodd-Frank at a time when there is still anti-Wall Street sentiment in the country .
“ If it was left out initially , I don ’ t think it would have been a major defect , ” Frank said of Section 716 . “ But at this point , now that they have integrated it into the rules that are going forward , it is very disruptive to pull it out . ”
“ Unlike health care , financial reform was very popular , ” Frank said . “ They [ banks and Wall Street ] would never take it on , head on . This is the danger , that they do it in these kinds of ways . ”","David Rogers is a senior congressional reporter at POLITICO.

Still many of the same politicians and union leaders who stood with de Blasio or were making the case inside the Capitol complain that Obama’s abandoned them and can’t believe he’s beating up on them.

“For six years, we have wanted him to be the president we voted for,” said Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), laying out what he says is the liberal mindset. “We’re still waiting.”

“President Obama has never attacked Republican Leader Mitch McConnell the way he’s attacking Elizabeth Warren,” the Progressive Change Committee carped in an email to members.

No, people around the White House say, the only difference now is that the president is going after Democrats the same way he went after Republicans, and importantly, on something that might actually pass. They loved it during the shutdown when he sneered at the GOP proposals and refused to budge, and they’re just upset to see him treat them the same way.

On that, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), said he could agree, even though he’s not ever going to agree with Obama on trade.

“He’s not using any different rhetoric here than he has on other issues. It just happens that he’s speaking to Democrats,” Murphy said. “Democrats shouldn’t take it personally, just like Republicans shouldn’t take it personally.”

Republicans have been taking it personally for years. And though many of them want to see trade pass, they can’t help enjoying watching Obama take on his own party.

“The Terminator has turned on his fellow machines,” one House Republican leadership aide said. “It’s loud, it’s violent, and it’s awesome, but – unlike Arnold’s movies – I don’t expect a sequel.”",www.politico.com,left,JVmrfdp4BWeWvrGV

Why is the Senate in session over the weekend?

The Senate needed to pass something by midnight Saturday night to prevent the federal government from running out of money and shutting down.

On Friday night, the Senate was supposed to pass a bill funding the government through Wednesday. Then, they would adjourn for the weekend, and come back on Monday to pass the $1.1 trillion ""CRomnibus"": the bill to fund most of the government through September, 2015.

This plan got worked out by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday.

Were other Republicans on board with Cruz and Lee?

But now, Reid can schedule votes that will have the time to ripen by the beginning of the week. At this rate, they'll be able to start voting for cloture on the nominees on Monday.

Who are the nominees in question?

It's a mix of judicial appointments and executive picks.

The highest-profile nomination is Surgeon General nominee Vivek Murthy, who is opposed by the NRA because he's called gun violence a public health issue. There's also a nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement — the government's chief immigration agency — who Republicans oppose because of their opposition to President Obama's recent executive actions on immigration.

In a day awash with eulogies for swashbuckling former Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee , who died Tuesday at 93 , why not get the straight dope from the man who did Bradlee ’ s exit interviews ? Howard Kurtz wrote the story for the Post when Bradlee stepped down in 1991 and also conducted Bradlee ’ s final interview in 2012 . “ He now seems a throwback in a more corporate era , a constantly cursing Navy vet who walked the newsroom floor , slapping backs , lifting spirits with a few words of praise , ” wrote Howie . New Yorker Editor David Remnick argues that Bradlee was such an over-the-top figure that even Jason Robards ’ portrayal was “ underplayed. ” Remnick passes along the story from former Post reporter Tom Zito of the day that he was served with a subpoena while working at the Post : “ I explained that my father was of Italian descent , lived in New Jersey , had constructed many publicly financed apartment buildings—and was now being investigated by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York regarding income-tax evasion . ‘ Your father ? ’ Ben exclaimed in disbelief , and then called out to his secretary , ‘ Get John Mitchell on the phone. ’ In less than a minute , the voice of the Attorney General could be heard on the speaker box , asking , somewhat curtly , ‘ What do you want , Ben ? ’ In his wonderfully gruff but patrician demeanor , and flashing a broad smile to me , Ben replied , ‘ What I want is for you to never again send a subpoena over here asking any of my reporters to give grand-jury testimony about their parents .

That’s a shift in the GOP’s favor since an AP-GfK poll in late September, when the two parties ran about evenly among likely voters. Women have moved in the GOP’s direction since September. In last month’s AP-GfK poll, 47 percent of female likely voters said they favored a Democratic-controlled Congress while 40 percent wanted the Republicans to capture control. In the new poll, the two parties are about even among women, 44 percent prefer the Republicans, 42 percent the Democrats.”



[“In fact, Democrats are more trusted than the GOP on just two of nine top issues, the poll showed. The economy remains the top issue for likely voters — 91 percent call it ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ important. And the GOP has increased its advantage as the party more trusted to handle the issue to a margin of 39 percent to 31 percent.”]



Senate Dems ‘lashing out’ at White House - National Journal: “The relationship between the White House and Senate Democrats hit a new low Tuesday evening after the administration's press office released a transcript of First Lady Michelle Obama's appearance in Iowa on behalf of Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley. The problem: The subject line of the e-mail referred to Braley as the ‘Democratic candidate for governor’… Indicating the sensitivity of the mistake, top Senate Democratic officials wasted no time lashing out at the Obama administration's political team in response, suggesting it was acting like a junior varsity operation two weeks before the midterms…



Base backfire - “The slip-up comes one day after President Obama told Rev. Al Sharpton on his radio show that Senate Democrats keeping their distance from him are still ‘folks who vote with me. They have supported my agenda in Congress.’ That alarmed Senate Democrats up for reelection this November, most of whom are working hard to distance themselves from an unpopular president. ‘The ineptitude of the White House political operation has sunk from annoying to embarrassing,’ one senior Senate Democratic aide told National Journal. Another Senate official told the Washington Post that Obama's comments were ‘not devised with any input from Senate leadership.’’’

HILLARY SAYS UDALL’S GYNECOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN AT ‘THE FRONTIER OF FREEDOM’

In another clear foreshadowing of her 2016 campaign speech, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton defended Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. against press criticism of his “obnoxious one-issue campaign” focused on birth control and abortion that earned him the nickname “Mark Uterus.” Via National Journal: “‘I want you to understand that as far as I’m concerned and as far as Mark is concerned, when he’s fighting for women’s rights, he is fighting on the frontier of freedom,’ [Clinton said.]…‘This election is important to everybody, but it’s especially important to the women of Colorado’… ‘These Democrats will never support so-called personhood laws,’ Clinton told the rally.”

Film lays out left strategy for Colorado takeover - Colorado’s porous new election law, which has raised alarm over the potential for rampant voter fraud, is part of a long-term effort by powerful Democrats to turn Colorado to a deep hue of blue according to the film “Rocky Mountain Heist” hosted by Michelle Malkin and produced by Citizens United. Malkin and Citizens United President David Bossie discussed the film with Megyn Kelly. Malkin, who has dubbed the law allowing residents to print ballots from their home computers, then turn them over to “collectors” a “voter-fraud Frankenstein” warned “what happened here in Colorado can happen in the rest of the country.” Watch the discussion on “The Kelly File” here.

WITH YOUR SECOND UP OF COFFEE…

In a day awash with eulogies for swashbuckling former Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee, who died Tuesday at 93, why not get the straight dope from the man who did Bradlee’s exit interviews? Howard Kurtz wrote the story for the Post when Bradlee stepped down in 1991 and also conducted Bradlee’s final interview in 2012. “He now seems a throwback in a more corporate era, a constantly cursing Navy vet who walked the newsroom floor, slapping backs, lifting spirits with a few words of praise,” wrote Howie. New Yorker Editor David Remnick argues that Bradlee was such an over-the-top figure that even Jason Robards’ portrayal was “underplayed.” Remnick passes along the story from former Post reporter Tom Zito of the day that he was served with a subpoena while working at the Post: “I explained that my father was of Italian descent, lived in New Jersey, had constructed many publicly financed apartment buildings—and was now being investigated by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York regarding income-tax evasion. ‘Your father?’ Ben exclaimed in disbelief, and then called out to his secretary, ‘Get John Mitchell on the phone.’ In less than a minute, the voice of the Attorney General could be heard on the speaker box, asking, somewhat curtly, ‘What do you want, Ben?’ In his wonderfully gruff but patrician demeanor, and flashing a broad smile to me, Ben replied, ‘What I want is for you to never again send a subpoena over here asking any of my reporters to give grand-jury testimony about their parents. And if you do, I’m going to personally come over there and shove it up your ass.’ The subpoena was quashed the next day.”

FREEDOM PARTNERS PICKS THEIR SIX

The free-market Freedom Partners Action Fund debuts today its closing argument in six key Senate races, putting $6.5 million dollars toward a simple message: a vote for Democratic Senate candidates is a vote for President Obama’s policies. The group, backed by industrialist brother Charles and David Koch unveiled this morning similar spots in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire that feature residents blasting Democrats for placing partisan priorities over constituents needs. From the attack on Iowa Democrat Bruce Braley: “There are lots of reasons Bruce Braley isn’t right for Iowa,” says Sandy Metzel of Sioux City, “the most important reason is that a vote for Bruce Braley is a vote for President Obama and his failed policies.”



Ernst hogs attention with closing spot - Iowa Republican Senate nominee Joni Ernst heads back to the pig pen for her closing spot. The swine are bigger this time, but the message is the same.



Harkin not hopeful - Retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, may have let it slip he doesn’t feel confident Democrats will hold the Senate after November. In his defense of Iowa Democrat Bruce Braley’s swipe at Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Harkin told the NYT: “I think Chuck Grassley is pretty proud of the fact that he didn’t go to law school and he’s going to be chairman of the Judiciary Committee — first time ever. What’s wrong with that?”



POWER PLAY: THE HAY ISN’T IN THE BARN YET

With the focus on foreign policy and the administration’s handling of the Ebola crisis dragging down Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., Republican challenger Thom Tillis has been able to cut into her lead. As Hagan continues to play defense, just how much are Tillis’ attacks trying Hagan to President Obama’s unpopularity working? Watch “Power Play with Chris Stirewalt” as Chris breaks down the Tar Heel Senate race in 90-seconds.

SHAHEEN TRIES TO TAP DANCE ON OBAMA SUPPORT

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., is the latest Democrat to offer less than tepid support for President Obama. During a debate Tuesday against Republican Scott Brown, Shaheen drew audible laughs when she said, “In some ways I approve, and some things I don’t approve,” when asked if she approved of the job the president is doing. “So, you know, like most questions that we deal with as policymakers,” she continued, “there aren’t simple answers, ‘yes’ or ‘no.’”



ROBERTS: ‘NOT ON MY WATCH’

The Roberts campaign released a new ad touting Sen. Pat Roberts’, R-Kan., stand against an administration proposal to transfer Guantanamo inmates to U.S. prisons and blasting independent Senate challenger Greg Orman. “Kansas needs a senator who will stand up to Barack Obama” the ad says. “Greg Orman helped elect Obama and would side with him on ObamaCare, Amnesty and wasteful spending.”



EMILY’S LIST POUNDS PURDUE OVER WOMEN’S PAY

The Pro-choice group Emily’s List has released an ad hitting Georgia Republican Senate hopeful David Purdue over equal pay. From the ad: “Federal investigators found a company Perdue ran discriminated against women. Paid them less than men for the same work while Perdue made $42 million. When over 2,000 women fought back to provide for their families, Perdue’s company was forced to pay nearly $19 million. David Perdue takes care of millionaires like David Perdue. And Georgia families get left behind.”



SULLIVAN: BEGICH IS DESPERATE

Alaska Republican Senate contender Dan Sullivan is calling Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, “desperate” in a new ad. Sullivan appears in the ad saying, “Why is Mark so desperate? Because on EPA overreach, ObamaCare, gun rights, amnesty, spending, Mark Begich is with Obama and I’m with you.”



LAWYERS LAY OUT CASH TO KEEP SENATE IN DEMS’ HANDS

Washington Examiner: “Lawyers and law firms have given more money to House and Senate candidates and party committees than any other industry, with an overwhelming majority going to Democrats…The focus of lawyer money this year is control of the U.S. Senate. The Democratic candidates in the 15 most competitive Senate races have raised $11 million from trial lawyers for the 2014 election. The industry’s main lobby is the American Association for Justice… In each of the eight most competitive Senate races, the industry providing the most money is trial lawyers. … In no race, however, do the lawyers play a greater role than in the open-seat Senate race in Iowa. Bruce Braley is a trial lawyer and a former member of AAJ’s board of governors…. Braley’s lawyer haul of $1.25 million is more than what he brought in from the next 34 industries combined. AAJ knows that Braley would be their man in the U.S. Senate.”



WATCHDOG GROUP STILL WAITING ON REID ETHICS COMPLAINT

Watchdog group Cause of Action is calling on a Senate Ethics panel to respond to a complaint it filed against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in 2013. At the center of the complaint is Reid’s alleged use of his political clout to lobby U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to reconsider and approve EB-5 immigrant investor visa petitions where a company receiving the foreign funding was a major contributor to the Democratic Party, and, at the time, was represented by the Senator’s son. “For over 300 days to pass since our complaint was received with no reasoned notice of the Committee’s determination is unacceptable. The Committee appears to have dismissed Cause of Action’s complaint without engaging in a preliminary inquiry and without explanation, where independent evidence unearthed by the media supports the allegations of misconduct. The American public, who elected their Senators, deserve an ethics committee that takes its role seriously, and our hope is that the public receives an explanation for this delay in oversight,” the groups CEO Dan Epstein said in a statement.

PICK SIX: UDALL THROWN FOR A HICKENLOOP?

Republicans need to win an additional six seats to take control of the Senate this November. Which six Democrat-held seats are the most vulnerable? Based off of your e-mails and tweets, here are the top picks of Fox News First readers: Arkansas (13.8%), Montana (13.2%), West Virginia (12.4%), South Dakota (12%), Louisiana (11.7%), and Alaska (8.8%). Reader Dave Lutter of Golden, Colo., argues that it is just not President Obama’s unpopularity that could propel the Centennial State to the top tier. Lutter writes, “Look no further that embattled Gov. John Hickenlooper [D-Colo.] [He] signed off on some of the most restrictive gun laws in the US following the Aurora Theatre and Sandy Hook shootings, enraging responsible gun owners here in the Centennial State. Adding to that, is [his] steadfast refusal to green-light the execution of mass murderer Nathan Dunlap. Coloradans support the Death Penalty at 64%, meaning this crosses well over partisan lines.”

NYT’s Upshot says there’s a 67 percent likelihood of the GOP winning the Senate, up a point from Tuesday.



WaPo’s Election Lab forecasts that Republicans will see a net gain of eight Senate seats with a 94 percent chance they win the upper chamber, up one from Tuesday.



Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight gives the GOP a 65.7 percent chance of winning the Senate, up just over two points from Tuesday.

HOT AIR, NO BREEZES IN CRIST-SCOTT SHOWDOWN

AP: “Florida’s leading candidates for governor clashed fiercely during their final debate on Tuesday night, sniping at each other over everything from the economy and the minimum wage to the death penalty. Republican-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, essentially tied in the polls, used their final moments before the television cameras to come up with some of the most personal attacks leveled so far in what has already been an extremely negative campaign… [O]ne of the sharpest exchanges may have been while they discussed the death penalty. Both men said they supported it, but Crist questioned how serious Scott takes the duty because he delayed an execution when the date conflicted with a political fundraiser for Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi later apologized for the incident and Scott said at the time he was unaware of the reason for the delay. But Crist hammered away at Scott, asking him outright if he knew the delay was due to a fundraiser. Scott finally replied, ‘She apologized, Charlie. What would you like her to do?’ Crist responded, ‘He doesn't answer questions. Pleads the Fifth.’’’

Chris Christie [R-N.J.] launched a preemptive strike Tuesday against some potential Republican rivals for the White House, saying the ‘experiment’ of promoting a lawmaker to president has failed—and arguing that Republicans must nominate a governor in 2016… ‘To have any chance of electing a Republican president, there's a bunch of things we need to do. But the first is to have a good bench of Republican candidates,’ Christie said. ‘And I am convinced that the next president of the United States is going to be a governor—and needs to be.’’’



ACU FIRES BACK AT MANCHIN ‘PROSTITUTE’ AD

The American Conservative Union is hitting back at Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., for appearing in an ad that calls West Virginia Republican Congressional Candidate Alex Mooney a “political prostitute.” In a $350,000 ad buy, the group ties Democrat Nick Casey to President Obama’s EPA regulations which are highly unpopular in the coal producing state along with Casey’s support of ObamaCare.

BIG ENOS, LITTLE ENOS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

WFTV: “A truck driver broke down in tears on Tuesday while telling Channel 9 about the thieves who drove off with his semi full of beer from an Orange County [Fla.] truck stop. …Van Thomas was trying to live the American dream. After years as a trucker, he bought a semi three weeks ago and made a company of his own. Thomas was traveling from Texas to Pompano Beach and was on his last stop before a delivery in Orlando when his entire truck and alcohol cargo was stolen. ‘I don’t mean to cry about it but I’m just trying to do the best I can and make a better life,’ Thomas told WFTV. Inside the truck was 44,000 pounds of Miller High Life, which comes out to about 9,700 [tallboy] four-packs. ‘It’s just so devastating to me,’ said Thomas. … Just when Thomas thought he lost everything, he received a phone call telling him the truck and most of the cargo had been located. ‘Oh, my God. That’s beautiful,’ he said. The call came in from detectives that the truck had been found in Miami. There’s no word on whether the robbers knew ‘The Champagne of [Bottled] Beers’ was inside at the time of the theft.”



AND NOW, A WORD FOR CHARLES…

“[President Obama] is a guy who six years ago had a worship service at a Denver stadium being cheered by people while he was behind Greek columns. A few weeks earlier he had been the hero of 200,000 Germans in Berlin… Here was a man … the most sought after rock star -- a political rock star and now he’s gotta hide under his desk until November.”—Charles Krauthammer, on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary , cementing his position as the Democratic front-runner for president . With 97 percent of the expected vote counted , Sanders had 26 percent of the vote , while former South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg had 24 percent . The big surprise of the night was Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who finished third with 20 percent . After those three , there was a big drop-off : Sen. Elizabeth Warren finished fourth with 9 percent , and former Vice President Joe Biden ended up fifth with 8 percent .
So how did Sanders win ? According to the exit polls , he racked up big margins among demographic groups that make up a good chunk , but still a minority of , the Democratic electorate . Crucially , though , he was still able to win because the rest of the electorate was split among his rivals . For example , “ very liberal ” voters made up just 21 percent of the New Hampshire Democratic electorate on Tuesday , and Sanders easily beat out Warren to win that group . He tied Buttigieg for the lead among the much larger “ somewhat liberal ” group , and Buttigieg and Klobuchar split the “ moderate ” vote .
Buttigieg and Klobuchar split moderate voters Share of respondents who voted for each candidate in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary by ideology , according to preliminary exit poll data Candidate Very liberal ( 21 % ) Somewhat liberal ( 40 % ) Moderate ( 36 % ) Conservative ( 3 % ) Buttigieg 15 % 26 % 28 % 21 Sanders 48 26 16 11 Klobuchar 9 19 26 19 Warren 19 10 3 4 Biden 4 8 12 6 Steyer 1 5 4 4 Yang 3 3 3 4 Gabbard 1 1 5 18 Sample size is 2,935 . Not all candidates are listed on the exit poll . Source : ABC news/Edison research
Similarly , people between the ages of 18 and 44 made up just 37 percent of the electorate , and Sanders crushed Buttigieg among this group . But the 63 percent of voters aged 45 or above split nearly evenly between Klobuchar and Buttigieg .

Not all candidates are listed on the exit poll . Source : ABC news/Edison research
Continuing the pattern , a full 61 percent of voters said they made up their mind on whom to vote for this month ; 31 percent of this group went for Buttigieg ( who won the most delegates in Iowa ) , and 23 percent went for Klobuchar ( who had a good debate performance on Friday ) . However , among the 38 percent who made up their mind before this month , Sanders won a whopping 43 percent to Buttigieg ’ s 18 percent and Klobuchar ’ s 6 percent .
Finally , Sanders won a clear victory over Buttigieg , 35 percent to 23 percent , among the 38 percent of voters who said the most important quality in a candidate was their ability to “ bring needed change. ” However , the group of people who thought it was more important to unite the country ( 32 percent of the electorate ) gave 31 percent of the vote each to Buttigieg and Klobuchar . ( Sanders got just 9 percent of these voters . )
Geographically , Sanders won by racking up large vote margins in New Hampshire ’ s cities ( just as he did in Iowa en route to winning the final-alignment popular vote there — but luckily for Sanders , New Hampshire doesn ’ t have “ state delegate equivalents ” ) . Sanders won New Hampshire ’ s six largest municipalities — Manchester , Nashua , Concord , Derry , Dover and Rochester .
By contrast , a map of the results shows Buttigieg had pockets of support in the rural , conservative Lakes Region and especially in the far-flung Boston suburbs in the southeastern corner of the state . These heavily white towns have high median incomes , high educational attainment and a strong Republican lean in general elections , making them good fits for Buttigieg and his message of reaching across the aisle .
But even in those spots , Buttigieg was likely again held back by Klobuchar . According to the exit polls , Klobuchar and Buttigieg were the two top choices of college-educated white voters , at 26 percent and 24 percent support . It seems likely that , if Klobuchar hadn ’ t been in the race , many of her votes in highly educated communities would have gone to Buttigieg ( or vice versa ) . Given that Buttigieg lost to Sanders statewide by only about 4,000 votes , it ’ s quite possible that Sanders only won because the Buttigieg/Klobuchar vote was split .
The final notable result from New Hampshire had nothing to do with the candidates at all : It was the more than 283,000 people who cast a ballot in the Democratic primary . Results are still coming in , but the number is close to the all-time turnout record for any one party in a New Hampshire primary ( 288,672 in the 2008 Democratic primary ) . However , that number is less impressive once you factor in the fact that New Hampshire has roughly 89,000 more eligible voters in 2020 than it did in 2008 , according to estimates by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald . As a percentage of eligible voters , turnout in the Democratic primary this year was around 26 percent , while it was 29 percent in the 2008 Democratic primary .","On Tuesday, as expected, Sen.

On the roster : - How broken are Democrats ? - White House pushed FBI to stifle reports on Russia ties - Annnnnd…Trump responds to report slamming FBI in tweets - Power Play : CPAC pop quiz ! - We used to call this ‘ childhood ’
As the members of the Democratic National Committee gather this weekend in Atlanta to choose a new leader , much as been said about the paths forward for the party .
One , personified by Rep. Keith Ellison , D-Minn. , is maximal confrontation . Ellison , the first Muslim elected to Congress , urges his party to face down Trump as not just wicked but also criminal .
It was at least three years before Republicans in the Obama era had to deal with bleating from their base about impeachment , but Ellison & Co. are already there .
Think about that for a second . A sitting member of Congress potentially in line to lead a major political party is calling for the impeachment of a president who has been in office for five weeks . Whatever you think of Donald Trump , that ’ s gonzo stuff .
The other way forward is being cast in the press as a more moderate choice , that of former Labor Secretary Tom Perez .
The very fact that Perez , a staunch uber-liberal , is being depicted as some sort of squish tells you how bad off the Democrats are now .
If you thought John Boehner and Reince Priebus had it bad keeping Republicans from swallowing their tongues in the Obama era , Perez and other basically normal Democrats are about to walk through a hellscape even more diabolical in nature .
Where Republicans had Obama ’ s supposedly forged birth certificate , Democrats have Vladimir Putin rigging the election . The Democrat ’ s conspiracy theory is less insane sounding , but will be equally damaging to the party and its mental health – if not more so .
From a practical point of view , dealing with Trump for Democrats would be a pretty straightforward matter . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has basically said as much : Find the points on which Trump , no conservative , agrees with Democrats -- especially on stimulus spending , labor policy and trade -- and then jam the GOP .
One of the advantages of having a non-ideological president was supposed to be all the deal-making that would get done . But instead , Washington is still stuck .
Yes , that is in part because Trump and his fellow Republicans can ’ t quite get the signal calling down on moving the big legislation still in the discussion phase , but also because no Democrat other than those from bright-red states feel free to work with Trump on anything .
If Schumer really wanted to be in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ’ s head , the Democrat would be paying multiple visits to his fellow New Yorker at the White House .
But Schumer knows that he can ’ t because his party ’ s base doesn ’ t even consider Trump the legitimate president , just as some Republicans , including Trump , felt about Obama .
If Perez wins this weekend , his task of leading a political party , not a resistance , will be daunting to say the least . It would be easier for him than it is for Schumer since the party isn ’ t concerned with policy so much as fundraising and organizing .
Even so , dealing with the frothiest parts of his party is a task no prospective Democratic chairman , save perhaps Ellison , could relish .
The last time Democrats were in the wilderness like this was 13 years ago after the emotionally devastating defeat of John Kerry by incumbent president George W. Bush . Obama proved an unlikely but effective Moses for his party by effectively absorbing the energy the kooks of the far left and channeling it into more productive aims .
Right now , there is no one on the horizon with the potential exception of California Sen. Kamala Harris who could unite this angry , broken party .
This weekend we will find out just how angry and broken it is .

HOW BROKEN ARE DEMOCRATS?

What kind of party do Democrats want to have?

Simple: One that stops losing elections.

As the members of the Democratic National Committee gather this weekend in Atlanta to choose a new leader, much as been said about the paths forward for the party.

One, personified by Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., is maximal confrontation. Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, urges his party to face down Trump as not just wicked but also criminal.

It was at least three years before Republicans in the Obama era had to deal with bleating from their base about impeachment, but Ellison & Co. are already there.

Think about that for a second. A sitting member of Congress potentially in line to lead a major political party is calling for the impeachment of a president who has been in office for five weeks. Whatever you think of Donald Trump, that’s gonzo stuff.

The other way forward is being cast in the press as a more moderate choice, that of former Labor Secretary Tom Perez.

The very fact that Perez, a staunch uber-liberal, is being depicted as some sort of squish tells you how bad off the Democrats are now.

If you thought John Boehner and Reince Priebus had it bad keeping Republicans from swallowing their tongues in the Obama era, Perez and other basically normal Democrats are about to walk through a hellscape even more diabolical in nature.

Where Republicans had Obama’s supposedly forged birth certificate, Democrats have Vladimir Putin rigging the election. The Democrat’s conspiracy theory is less insane sounding, but will be equally damaging to the party and its mental health – if not more so.

From a practical point of view, dealing with Trump for Democrats would be a pretty straightforward matter. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has basically said as much: Find the points on which Trump, no conservative, agrees with Democrats -- especially on stimulus spending, labor policy and trade -- and then jam the GOP.

One of the advantages of having a non-ideological president was supposed to be all the deal-making that would get done. But instead, Washington is still stuck.

Yes, that is in part because Trump and his fellow Republicans can’t quite get the signal calling down on moving the big legislation still in the discussion phase, but also because no Democrat other than those from bright-red states feel free to work with Trump on anything.

If Schumer really wanted to be in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s head, the Democrat would be paying multiple visits to his fellow New Yorker at the White House.

But Schumer knows that he can’t because his party’s base doesn’t even consider Trump the legitimate president, just as some Republicans, including Trump, felt about Obama.

If Perez wins this weekend, his task of leading a political party, not a resistance, will be daunting to say the least. It would be easier for him than it is for Schumer since the party isn’t concerned with policy so much as fundraising and organizing.

Even so, dealing with the frothiest parts of his party is a task no prospective Democratic chairman, save perhaps Ellison, could relish.

The last time Democrats were in the wilderness like this was 13 years ago after the emotionally devastating defeat of John Kerry by incumbent president George W. Bush. Obama proved an unlikely but effective Moses for his party by effectively absorbing the energy the kooks of the far left and channeling it into more productive aims.

Right now, there is no one on the horizon with the potential exception of California Sen. Kamala Harris who could unite this angry, broken party.

This weekend we will find out just how angry and broken it is.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Why isn’t anyone talking about the two countries responsible for 50% of the industrial worlds CO2 emissions in 2013? Two countries with 45% of the world’s population but little in environmental controls. If you want to stop rising CO2 levels, how is it done without huge efforts by China and India? Two countries identified as emerging industrial economies.” – Les Pappas, Scottsdale, Ariz.



[Ed. note: Well, some people are talking about it, but the fact is it seems highly unlikely that any action will be taken on that front anytime in the next four years. And while your point is well taken, we also remember that if Britain and Germany had told the U.S. to scale back our industrial revolution in the 1880s, we would have scoffed too.]



“Your estimate that perhaps ten percent of the country is illegal seems way too high. Pew puts it 3.5 percent.” – Brien Downes, Delmar, N.Y.

[Ed. Note: I was told there would be no math! No, you are quite right. That was my simple sloppy calculation. The Pew estimate of 11 million illegal immigrants out of a total population of 318 million is as close to authoritative as we are likely to get. Good catch.]

Except, instead of fighting over whether or not to defund Obamacare, Democrats want to fight over ending the sequester.

That is the Democrats plan going into this week: 1) get a debt limit hike for as long as possible; 2) get a continuing resolution at sequester levels for as short as possible; 3) turn the governemnt shutdown fight from a debate about Obamacare into a debate about repealing the sequester.",www.townhall.com,right,TflQhDK93NUndHDT

PHILADELPHIA -- Bill Clinton isn't used to being the second act, but he slipped comfortably into that role Tuesday night when making a forceful case that his wife is the proven change-maker who should become president of the United States in November.

After struggling to control his temper and his outbursts on the campaign trail in 2008, the former president has been a far more disciplined, supportive spouse on the campaign trail this time -- traveling across the country to campaign for his wife and carefully avoiding GOP nominee Donald Trump's provocations.

On Tuesday night, he delved deeply into her biography to cast her as change agent -- hinting that while she might not be as natural a politician, she has spent her life fighting to improve people's lives, particularly the lives of children and the disabled.

""She's the best darn change-maker I've ever met in my entire life. This is a really important point,"" Clinton said of his wife. ""This woman has never been satisfied with the status quo ... She always wants to move the ball forward. That is just who she is.""

At a time when many voters say they don't trust Hillary Clinton, her husband sought to soften her harder edges. He recalled how relentlessly he had pursued her, proposing to her three times before she accepted.

Bill Clinton brought to the convention floor a certain rock star status within the Democratic Party. He has shown his unique ability to fire up the base and turn out voters.

He holds a much higher favorability rating than his wife. Among Democratic voters, 79% view him favorably.

The former president has turned into a frequent target for Trump, who has railed about the former president's personal life from the campaign trail.

""She's married to a man who is the worst abuser of women in the history of politics. She's married to a man who hurt many women,"" Trump said at a rally in Spokane, Washington. ""And Hillary was an enabler and she treated these women horribly. Just remember this. And some of those women were destroyed not by him, but by the way Hillary Clinton treated them after everything went down.""

Trump has also seized on Clinton-era policies, going after NAFTA, which Trump has vowed to renegotiate.

""She doesn't understand trade,"" Trump said. ""Her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done.""

Bill Clinton has also faced scrutiny over his legislative record directly from voters on the campaign trail. In April he was confronted at a campaign event for his wife in Philadelphia by Black Lives Matter activists over his administration's 1994 crime bill.

""You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter,"" Clinton pushed back from the podium.

On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has at times tried to distance herself from her husband, repeating regularly that she is running on her own record, not ""running for her husband's third term.""

But she has had to clean up after him at times -- most recently in the aftermath of Bill Clinton's private, impromptu meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch at the Phoenix airport in June. The meeting was widely criticized given that the attorney general was overseeing the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state.

""I think, you know, hindsight is 20/20,"" Hillary Clinton said of the meeting in an interview with NBC News. ""Both the attorney general and my husband have said they wouldn't do it again, even though it was from all accounts that I have heard and seen, an exchange of pleasantries. But obviously no one wants to see any untoward conclusions drawn, and they've said, you know, they would not do it again.""

Still, Hillary Clinton sees her husband as an asset.

She has pledged to give him a role in a potential second Clinton administration dealing with the economy, trying to capitalize on her husband's economic record while he was in the White House.

""I'm going to put (him) in charge of revitalizing the economy,"" Clinton said in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, this May. ""You know he knows how to do it, especially in places like coal country and inner cities and other parts of our country that have really been left out.""

Bill Clinton would still be entering unchartered waters should the White House be helmed by his wife, becoming the first man to fill the role of president's spouse.

Hillary Clinton has suggested that in lieu of first lady he could be called ""first dude, the first mate, the first gentlemen.""

Bill Clinton has suggested ""first laddie.""

""I don't know, I don't really know because it'd be such a precedent,"" he said of a potential title. ""I don't care what I'm called, it's more about what I'm called to do.""",www.fox40.com,right,3AjIGAFhlaf66Tr8

It 's a vulnerability that Republicans have n't figured out how to exploit , and it 's clearly one of the biggest weaknesses in the Obama economic recovery .
In 2014 , the last year for which Census data are available , median household income was $ 1,656 lower than it was in January 2009 , when President Barack Obama took office .

Story Continued Below

In 2014, the last year for which Census data are available, median household income was $1,656 lower than it was in January 2009, when President Barack Obama took office. A recent survey by the private firm Sentier Research showed household income finally rose this year above its level in June 2009, when the Great Recession ended — but only by 1.3 percent. That's a terrible record for any presidency. But that such stagnation occurred during a Democratic one is potentially a big problem for Democratic candidates, and especially for Clinton, who's running on her role in that administration.

“I think that there are two phenomena here,” said Stuart Stevens, a senior strategist in Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign. “Those who normally are the most articulate, passionate voices for those who are doing least well in the economy have been muted over the past seven years” because they don’t want to undercut Obama. That should create an opening for Republicans.

But “Republicans have never been great at talking about this,” Stevens said.

The Republican candidates’ wage conundrum isn’t about excoriating the Democrats. They’re all too happy to call out Obama for failing to lift incomes.

“These last seven years,” Bobby Jindal said at this week’s GOP “undercard” debate, “inequality has gone up. Only the top 10 percent have seen their incomes go up.” Rick Santorum said not once, not twice, but three times that the middle class was “hollowing out.” In the primetime debate that followed, Jeb Bush said “the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks … Jobs are being created, but they’re lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost.”

But while the GOP candidates are eager to state the wages problem, they struggle to explain how they would fix it.

“It’s a bit awkward,” says Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth, “if Republicans are talking about the need for wage growth and opposed to a minimum wage increase.”

Only one of the Republican presidential candidates has endorsed a specific minimum-wage hike: Rick Santorum, who would raise the hourly minimum to $8.75, up from the current $7.25, over a period of three years. The Democratic field, meanwhile, proposes raising the minimum to $12 (Clinton) or $15 (Sanders, O’Malley).

Ben Carson expressed in the September CNN debate tentative support for an unspecified increase. He also said he favored a lower “starter” minimum wage for young people. And Carson said the wage minimum should rise automatically with inflation “so that we never have to have this conversation again.”

Romney also favored indexing the minimum wage, figuring, like Carson, that it would remove the topic permanently from the partisan arena. (Because the minimum wage is popular, politicizing it mostly hurts Republicans.) “It was a position [Romney] had as governor and a position he kept,” Stevens said, “and he ended up with a higher percentage of the GOP vote than Bush in 2000.” (Actually, Romney muddied his support in 2012 by proposing the minimum be indexed not only to inflation but also to “the jobs level throughout the country, unemployment rate [and] competitive rates in other states, or, in this case, other nations.”)

But earlier this week Carson appeared to back away from his pro-minimum wage stance. “I would not raise it,” Carson said at Tuesday’s debate, “because I'm interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities.”

The Carson campaign didn’t answer POLITICO’s request for clarification, but spokesman Doug Watts told the Daily Beast that Carson’s position was unchanged. “His answer focused on the lower tier, which he does not believe needs raising, as it is an entry-level wage. He believes in a second, higher tier that, once determined, is indexed,” Watts told the Daily Beast’s Gideon Resnick in a post-debate email.

The other Republican candidates all oppose raising the minimum wage, and two of them — Carly Fiorina and Jeb Bush — have indicated a preference for leaving the matter to the states. Then there's Trump, who since Tuesday has clarified that when he said wages were too high he was referring to the minimum wage, not to wages in general. (He did not propose lowering it.)

Perhaps no candidate has underscored the Republicans’ wage dilemma more than Marco Rubio. “You can’t live on $10 an hour,” Rubio said in October. “You can’t live on $11 an hour.” That would indicate, logically, that still less can one live on $7.25 an hour.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle , “ Feinstein , who has not debated her Republican opponent in her last two U.S. Senate campaigns — state Sen. Dick Mountjoy in 2006 and Republican Elizabeth Emken in 2012 — has no plans for any town halls during Congress ’ current recess . ”
People attending Feinstein ’ s ticketed event were reportedly invited to send questions via email to the event moderator in advance . Tickets were free . There were reportedly only 240 chairs in the room , although many more were standing .
The Sacramento Bee reported that during the event , Feinstein said she somewhat enjoyed the outbursts . The moderator reportedly “ asked the audience to settle down so that he could continue asking questions ” when “ Feinstein admitted , ‘ I kind of enjoy it . ' ”
The protesters were from the San Francisco chapter of Indivisible , a liberal group that has crashed talks in recent weeks to push their “ anti-Donald Trump ” agenda .
The Bee notes that they held up signs reading , “ Hold a real town hall. ” Others held up a green “ agree ” and a red “ disagree ” sign .
At another point during the event , Feinstein reportedly said there was not much she could do to remove Stephen K. Bannon from his position as President Trump ’ s chief White House strategist , which prompted the activists to hold up a red “ disagree ” sign . ”
“ Wait a minute , all the red-card geniuses , ” Feinstein reportedly objected , before noticing a sign that said , “ Ban Bannon to Russia. ” The Bee notes that she then said , “ Well , it ’ s a nice thought . ”
Friday was not the first time Feinstein ’ s constituents have confronted her .
In January , approximately 200 radical leftists protested and picketed outside of her Pacific Heights mansion in San Francisco to oppose what they have labeled as her “ pro-Trump voting record ” because she voted for confirming several of the president ’ s Cabinet picks .

During a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention , the former president sought to humanize his wife by describing her as a loving mother and wife whose service to others started long before she walked the halls of power in Washington .
“ She ’ s the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life , ” Clinton said in Philadelphia . “ This woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything . She always wants to move the ball forward . That is just who she is . ”

Bill Clinton on Tuesday addressed a Democratic Party that remains divided over not only his wife’s candidacy but his own legacy as president. During a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention, the former president sought to humanize his wife by describing her as a loving mother and wife whose service to others started long before she walked the halls of power in Washington.

“She’s the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life,” Clinton said in Philadelphia. “This woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything. She always wants to move the ball forward. That is just who she is.”

Dubbed the “secretary of explaining stuff” for his well-received speech endorsing President Barack Obama in 2012, Clinton faced a much different environment when he entered the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, where supporters of Bernie Sanders have booed and chanted against Hillary Clinton. The former president’s speech was greeted with cheers and applause as he laid out the chronology of his relationship with the woman he met at Yale Law School 45 years ago.

‘Change-Maker’

Using the term ""change-maker"" multiple times to describe his wife, the former president sought to counter criticism, voiced by Sanders during the primary campaign, that she is a member of the political establishment who will defend the status quo. The 69-year-old Clinton, who built his political career on moving Democrats toward the center and now is the elder statesman of a party surging toward the left, steered clear of discussing his own presidential legacy.

During the primary campaign, Sanders regularly whipped up the crowd at his rallies with broadsides against policies that Bill Clinton championed two decades ago.

The former president has also attacked Sanders for promising an unattainable political revolution, and accused his supporters -- so-called “Bernie Bros” -- of engaging in sexism and abuse online in February.

Limited Role

Clinton, who has had a limited role in his wife’s campaign since those early stumbles, has done little to smooth over things with Sanders supporters. He drew rebukes from Democrats and Republicans last month after privately meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac just days before Hillary Clinton was cleared in an FBI investigation into her handling of classified information as secretary of State.

In Philadelphia, where hundreds of Sanders supporters have taken to the streets to chant “lock her up!” and “Never Hillary,” Bill Clinton sought to persuade doubters who say his wife is neither honest nor trustworthy. He said critics had painted a “cartoon” image of Hillary Clinton.

“She is constantly referred to as the least-known best person in America, and I think you will get to hear from him that sense of what attracted him to her in the first place,” John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, said Tuesday morning at a Bloomberg Politics breakfast in Philadelphia.

When Obama faced questions over his handling of the economy in 2012, Clinton used his 50-minute speech at the Democratic convention to lay out a statistics-laden economic case for Obama’s re-election.

And although his candidacy once had great promise , O ’ Rourke ’ s exit from the race came down to his weak poll numbers and reduced fundraising numbers , as well as the fact that he may never have had the base of support he needed to truly compete for the Democratic nomination .
Coming off a close loss in Texas ’ s 2018 Senate race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz , O ’ Rourke entered the presidential race with great fanfare in March , though some wondered if he had waited too long to fully capitalize on the national notoriety he gained from his 2018 performance . Still , O ’ Rourke ’ s initial polling numbers suggested he might really be in the mix to compete for the nomination — he was polling at 10 percent or more in some national polls not long after he announced . However , his survey numbers quickly deteriorated as the race moved along , and he spent the past four months mostly polling below 5 percent even after he tried to revive his campaign in August by tacking left on some issues and focusing more on President Trump .
O ’ Rourke ’ s tumble in the polls was also accompanied by fundraising difficulties . Having been a prodigious fundraiser in 2018 , he seemed capable of attracting the resources to run a top-level presidential campaign , and he showed early promise by raising $ 6.1 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign , the second best opening day after only former Vice President Joe Biden . But fundraising dollars started drying up shortly thereafter . He had raised only $ 13 million by the end of the second quarter , and added just another $ 4.5 million in the third quarter .

His place at future debates was in serious jeopardy , too . O ’ Rourke was two qualifying polls shy of making the November debate and had yet to register a single qualifying survey for the December debate .
But O ’ Rourke might always have struggled to attract a large enough base of support in the primary given the makeup of the Democratic electorate . As a moderate three-term congressman , he won over many suburban white voters in his Texas Senate bid , but as editor-in-chief Nate Silver wrote back in July , a base of white moderates , particularly younger ones , wasn ’ t enough . As you can see in the table below , only about 12 percent of 2016 Democratic primary voters fit all three descriptors — young , white , moderate — based on data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study .

After your LGBTQ forum, I'm not sure.",2019-10-12,,"We ’ ve been together for a while now . It ’ s platonic , and probably always will be , as we share a home together as friends ever since I left the Republicans . But I appreciate our new relationship , and that ’ s why I ’ m comfortable telling you here that I ’ m worried about you .
We don ’ t agree about everything . Still , we get along pretty well , you and I , centered around the daily understanding that Donald Trump is a dire threat to the United States . That ’ s why I ’ ve been comfortable in my public commitment to vote for the Democratic presidential nominee , come hell or high water . You ’ ve mostly responded to this by …
Well , that ’ s the thing , isn ’ t it ? I feel like you ’ re not doing your part here .
We take our walks together and we discuss the importance of getting rid of Donald Trump . And yet , when we both leave for work in the morning , it feels like only one of us is really , truly serious about that .
When we watched CNN 's LGBTQ town hall for the Democratic candidates Thursday , we had very different reactions . This is the event , you remember , where former Rep. Beto O ’ Rourke of Texas said he ’ dpunish religious institutions for refusing gay marriage , and where Sen. Kamala Harris of California started by informing us of her pronouns , and then host Chris Cuomo , after a mild and dopey joke , had to go on Twitter the next day and apologize for making light of it . This is where Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts fielded a question about traditional marriage with a sneering , smug insinuation that the only people who would ask her about that are men who can ’ t find a woman .
You thought it was great . You saw a ringing defense of LGBTQ rights and a reaffirmation of what Democrats stand for .
I saw it and thought : Are these people insane ? Are they trying to lose the election ?
And not for the first time , I had that chilly feeling that I ’ m going to be alone at the voting booth in 2020 , while you ’ re back at the house arguing with your friends about guns and gay marriage and climate change like a nightmarish Very Special Episode of `` Friends . ''
Now , I would really prefer that this not devolve into our usual fights about the importance of same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights , because we ’ re not that far apart on any of this . I might not ever get past rolling my eyes at people informing me about pronouns , but I have come to accept the importance of marriage equality . And if former President Barack Obama can “ evolve ” on gay marriage , so can I .
But you told me when we moved in together that you agreed with me that removing Trump was the most important thing in the world to you . And I believed you . Why can ’ t you act like you believe it , too ? The goal here is to assemble at least 270 electoral votes . Don ’ t we agree on that anymore ?
I ’ m not asking you to betray your principles . But I ’ m going to be honest : When it comes to the election of 2020 , I don ’ t care about LGBTQ issues . And neither should you — not because these issues are not important , but because there isn ’ t a single Democratic candidate who is against you on any of this , and not one of them will be worse than Trump .
One job for 2020 : Why this Never Trump ex-Republican will vote for almost any 2020 Democratic nominee
In fact , I still wonder what the point of a nationally televised LGBTQ town hall was in the first place . To me , it looked like a beauty contest aimed at increasing fundraising among a wealthy Democratic demographic , but at the risk of alienating the African-American and suburban women who propelled you into the majority in 2018 . Did you really need a primary-driven bidding war to see who could be more demonstratively empathetic and accepting ?
Now , I know that ’ s how you do things . It ’ s not my way , but I get it . And maybe on some other planet where Trump isn ’ t president and the GOP is not a mindless cult that will vote for him under any circumstances , this would be an understandable thing to do .
You ’ re scaring me , however , when you tell me that you think you have to hammer on these hot-button issues in the places you need to win back electoral votes — in order to motivate your base to come out and vote .
Do you realize what you ’ re saying ? If you need an evening-long town hall on LGBTQ issues to “ motivate ” yourselves , then you ’ re already doomed .
I ’ m not telling you to go win the votes of old racists wearing MAGA hats ; I ’ m telling you to make sure that the people who helped you in 2018 don ’ t simply stay home in 2020 . And the first thing you can do to avert this , which will result in another supermajority win on the coasts while losing the Electoral College , is to stop handing issues to the Republican culture warriors .
Take it from a former member of the GOP tribe , they ’ re waiting for you . They are praying , you should pardon the expression , that you will do something stupid and pointless so that they can take the spotlight off of Trump . They will do anything to change the subject , so that you can not run on the simple platform that Trump is an emotionally unstable ignoramus who is endangering our national security and trampling on the Constitution .

Dear Democrats:

We’ve been together for a while now. It’s platonic, and probably always will be, as we share a home together as friends ever since I left the Republicans. But I appreciate our new relationship, and that’s why I’m comfortable telling you here that I’m worried about you.

We don’t agree about everything. Still, we get along pretty well, you and I, centered around the daily understanding that Donald Trump is a dire threat to the United States. That’s why I’ve been comfortable in my public commitment to vote for the Democratic presidential nominee, come hell or high water. You’ve mostly responded to this by …

Well, that’s the thing, isn’t it? I feel like you’re not doing your part here.

We take our walks together and we discuss the importance of getting rid of Donald Trump. And yet, when we both leave for work in the morning, it feels like only one of us is really, truly serious about that.

Are you trying to lose the election?

When we watched CNN's LGBTQ town hall for the Democratic candidates Thursday, we had very different reactions. This is the event, you remember, where former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas said he’dpunish religious institutions for refusing gay marriage, and where Sen. Kamala Harris of California started by informing us of her pronouns, and then host Chris Cuomo, after a mild and dopey joke, had to go on Twitter the next day and apologize for making light of it. This is where Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts fielded a question about traditional marriage with a sneering, smug insinuation that the only people who would ask her about that are men who can’t find a woman.

You thought it was great. You saw a ringing defense of LGBTQ rights and a reaffirmation of what Democrats stand for.

I saw it and thought: Are these people insane? Are they trying to lose the election?

And not for the first time, I had that chilly feeling that I’m going to be alone at the voting booth in 2020, while you’re back at the house arguing with your friends about guns and gay marriage and climate change like a nightmarish Very Special Episode of ""Friends.""

Now, I would really prefer that this not devolve into our usual fights about the importance of same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights, because we’re not that far apart on any of this. I might not ever get past rolling my eyes at people informing me about pronouns, but I have come to accept the importance of marriage equality. And if former President Barack Obama can “evolve” on gay marriage, so can I.

Why have an LGBTQ town hall?

But you told me when we moved in together that you agreed with me that removing Trump was the most important thing in the world to you. And I believed you. Why can’t you act like you believe it, too? The goal here is to assemble at least 270 electoral votes. Don’t we agree on that anymore?

I’m not asking you to betray your principles. But I’m going to be honest: When it comes to the election of 2020, I don’t care about LGBTQ issues. And neither should you — not because these issues are not important, but because there isn’t a single Democratic candidate who is against you on any of this, and not one of them will be worse than Trump.

One job for 2020:Why this Never Trump ex-Republican will vote for almost any 2020 Democratic nominee

In fact, I still wonder what the point of a nationally televised LGBTQ town hall was in the first place. To me, it looked like a beauty contest aimed at increasing fundraising among a wealthy Democratic demographic, but at the risk of alienating the African-American and suburban women who propelled you into the majority in 2018. Did you really need a primary-driven bidding war to see who could be more demonstratively empathetic and accepting?

Now, I know that’s how you do things. It’s not my way, but I get it. And maybe on some other planet where Trump isn’t president and the GOP is not a mindless cult that will vote for him under any circumstances, this would be an understandable thing to do.

Don't hand issues to culture warriors

You’re scaring me, however, when you tell me that you think you have to hammer on these hot-button issues in the places you need to win back electoral votes — in order to motivate your base to come out and vote.

Do you realize what you’re saying? If you need an evening-long town hall on LGBTQ issues to “motivate” yourselves, then you’re already doomed.

I’m not telling you to go win the votes of old racists wearing MAGA hats; I’m telling you to make sure that the people who helped you in 2018 don’t simply stay home in 2020. And the first thing you can do to avert this, which will result in another supermajority win on the coasts while losing the Electoral College, is to stop handing issues to the Republican culture warriors.

Take it from a former member of the GOP tribe, they’re waiting for you. They are praying, you should pardon the expression, that you will do something stupid and pointless so that they can take the spotlight off of Trump. They will do anything to change the subject, so that you cannot run on the simple platform that Trump is an emotionally unstable ignoramus who is endangering our national security and trampling on the Constitution. Why help them?

You’ve told me many times, as we’ve sat together in front of the television, that the Democrats can advocate for very liberal social justice positions and still strategize to beat Trump. I have squeezed my eyes tight, and I have wanted to believe you. And in fairness, you did a great job in 2018. If there’s any chance of impeaching the Mad King, it’s because you and your compatriots held back on the fringey stuff and elected a lot of solid, moderate candidates who flipped a lot of seats. My fears back then were unfounded.

I will blame you if Trump wins

But now you’re running a primary that is nothing but a bonanza for GOP ad-makers. Warren’s creepy zinger, Harris’ pretentious pronouns … I’m sorry, what was the point of all that again? Was the LGBTQ vote in danger of going to the Republicans and I missed it?

We pledged over two years ago to join hands on this one issue. But now I worry that in your zeal to win the Woke Twitter and college campus primary, you will simply make the same mistakes you made in 2016. Your nominee will crush it in the bicoastal race to be the Honorary Governor of the New Californiork Republic. Blue cities everywhere will welcome you as liberators. And Trump will laugh at you every day from Washington.

Ex-Republican and ex-Clinton aide: How Democrats should impeach Trump

This election could be a landslide if the public focuses on Trump’s abuses of power, his offenses against the Constitution, his insane foreign policy, his barely contained megalomania and narcissism. I support your efforts to impeach him, but that’s likely to fail, and it is well within your — our — power to remove him at the ballot box when that happens.

But if you can’t get to 270 electoral votes, you’re going to have to live with me as the grumpiest roommate you ever had. You can count on four years of me letting the tub get grimy, leaving my dishes in the sink and not speaking to you.

Because if Trump wins again, it’s going to be your fault.

The great Democratic hope
They ’ d never say it publicly . But catch many Democrats in an honest moment and they would admit that a Republican-led government shut down this fall might be the best thing — perhaps the only thing — that could revive their fading hopes of capturing the House next year .
As it stands now , the midterm is shaping up as a stale , status-quo election — with Democrats calling their counterparts right-wing extremists , Republicans attacking their rivals over Obamacare and neither side making much headway . That ’ s good for Republicans , since the party out of power in the White House almost inevitably picks up House seats in the sixth year of the presidency . Heavily-gerrymandered districts provide the GOP an extra layer of protection .
Nothing short of a powerful jolt — a moment that grabs casual voters by the lapels and makes them take notice — is likely to alter the landscape in a dramatic way . A shutdown could be it , Democrats argue , putting in play GOP-leaning districts now thought to be all but out of reach .
“ There are no ifs , ands , or buts about it . It would be a boon to us , ” said Andrew Myers , a national Democratic pollster . “ How could it not be ? ”
Many Republicans understand that — former National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Cole ( R-Okla. ) warned in late July that a shutdown would be “ suicidal ” — and there ’ s a persuasive school of thought that they won ’ t be foolish enough to risk their one base of power in Washington . But the GOP has shown to be nothing if not unpredictable of late , so the shutdown scenario lives on .
Some Democrats argue that it would provide huge motivation for their party ’ s voters , who historically have been less likely to turn out for midterm elections than presidential ones . A shutdown , they say , would fire up liberals across the country who might check out without President Barack Obama on the ballot .
They note that there ’ s reason to believe that a shutdown would have a real impact on people ’ s lives . When Republicans forced consecutive government closures in late 1995 and early 1996 , some museums and national parks closed , services for veterans took a hit , the National Institutes of Health stopped taking new patients and the Centers for Disease Control halted disease surveillance .
But more than that , it was a genuine media earthquake , with nightly newscasts and headlines dominated by damaging stories about then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his GOP foot soldiers .
A repeat of that , say Democrats , would give their candidates potent ammunition to attack Republicans as uncompromising and dysfunctional . The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has sent out a batch of press releases labeling a possible fiscal crisis “ Tom Cotton ’ s government shutdown , ” in reference to the freshman Republican House member who just announced he is running for Senate next year .
“ I think a government shutdown would change things dramatically , ” said Ali Lapp , who heads up a House Democratic super PAC . “ It would be a pretty big movement going in favor of Democrats . ”
Whether a shutdown will happen has become Washington ’ s summer guessing game . With a Sept. 30 deadline for passing a continuing resolution to keep the government funded , congressional leaders have little time to hash out a deal . By the time members return from their August recess , they ’ ll have just nine working days until the deadline hits .
The big sticking point in the negotiations is Obamacare . Some conservatives , such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , have been pushing for any bill to fund the government to be stripped of funding for the soon-to-be implemented health care bill .
The establishment wing of the GOP , however , has warned conservatives that shutting down the government over Obamacare funding would have drastic political consequences and possibly cost the party its House majority . Some Republicans remember all too well the last shutdown , from which Clinton emerged the clear victor and the Gingrich-led House GOP took a hit .
While Republicans appeared intransigent and petty , Clinton used the episode to cast himself as a level-headed pol who was willing to compromise . And when the government reopened , he took all the credit . The next year , Clinton won reelection convincingly and Republicans lost nine House seats but kept the majority ( a result that Gingrich has argued shows the fallout from the shutdown wan ’ t as bad for the GOP as some now claim ) .
Democrats , of course , aren ’ t openly pleading for House Republicans to shut down the government — they realize that would look crass and baldly political . Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel ( D-N.Y. ) said such a dramatic event “ would be a catastrophe for the country . ”
But he was also quick to highlight the political consequences for Republicans .
“ It has the potential to create a national narrative that becomes a challenge for House Republicans , ” he said . “ They ’ re playing with fire . ”
“ The fact that House Democrats are rooting for a government shutdown just so that they can attempt to score political points is the lowest of the low , ” said Daniel Scarpinato , an NRCC spokesman . “ The longer these Democrats refuse to be part of the solution to reducing our debt , creating jobs and stopping Obamacare , the longer voters will continue to reject putting Nancy Pelosi back in the speaker ’ s chair . ”
Democrats have been trying to make the case of late that their 2014 prospects are brightening , pointing out that Republicans have done little to improve their tarnished brand since last year ’ s presidential election . But the reality is that the political winds are , at this point at least , fairly still . And while the GOP ’ s numbers are in the tank , Democrats have their own problems : Obama ’ s approval numbers have slipped recently , and the party has the unenviable job of defending the health care rollout .
Then there ’ s the matter of the electoral playing field , which is tilted against Democrats . In the Senate , where the GOP needs to net six seats to win control , Democrats are hard-pressed to defend vacant seats in Montana , West Virginia and South Dakota . They ’ re also on defense in the House , where the Cook Political Report lists nine more Democratic seats as being vulnerable to a takeover than Republican seats . Democrats need to net 17 House seats to take the speaker ’ s gavel .
Democrats , however , argue that a shutdown could upend the current wisdom about how many seats are truly in play . House races are typically more vulnerable to the whims of the national environment than Senate contests , which are often race-by-race affairs .
Under the current Cook projections , just 29 of the 234 House Republicans are listed as vulnerable . If a shutdown occurs , Democrats contend , that number will grow considerably . While voter anger at the federal government isn ’ t at the levels it was in 2006 , 2008 or 2010 , a shutdown , they say , would make it come back with a vengeance — with the blame put squarely on the GOP .
“ It ’ s exceedingly difficult for Democrats to win back the House unless there ’ s a groundswell of frustration that upsets traditional voting habits , ” said Ben Tulchin , a San Francisco-based Democratic pollster . “ If they force a shutdown , they ’ re done . … It could really open the door for Democrats to take back the House . ”
Not everyone is convinced a shutdown would be a big difference-maker in 2014 . With more than a year until the election , there ’ s still plenty of time for the political environment to go through several transformations .
“ If something happens now , it ’ s not going to matter in 2014 , ” said Dave Beattie , a Democratic pollster .
Israel agreed that a shutdown alone wouldn ’ t hand Democrats the House , but the DCCC chairman said it would bolster his party ’ s case against Republicans . It wouldn ’ t create a wave itself , he said , but would help it develop .
Other Democrats worry that they , too , would pay a price in the event of a fiscal crisis .
Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen , the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee and a former DCCC chairman , predicted that incumbents from both parties would see their poll numbers crater as voters fume .
“ It would further cement that this is a dysfunctional Congress , and that doesn ’ t help anybody , ” he said . “ I think it ’ s a political loser for everybody . ”","A shutdown could be the jolt Democrats need to alter the landscape in a dramatic way. The great Democratic hope

They’d never say it publicly. But catch many Democrats in an honest moment and they would admit that a Republican-led government shut down this fall might be the best thing — perhaps the only thing — that could revive their fading hopes of capturing the House next year.

Many Republicans understand that — former National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.) warned in late July that a shutdown would be “ suicidal” — and there’s a persuasive school of thought that they won’t be foolish enough to risk their one base of power in Washington. But the GOP has shown to be nothing if not unpredictable of late, so the shutdown scenario lives on.

Some Democrats argue that it would provide huge motivation for their party’s voters, who historically have been less likely to turn out for midterm elections than presidential ones. A shutdown, they say, would fire up liberals across the country who might check out without President Barack Obama on the ballot.

They note that there’s reason to believe that a shutdown would have a real impact on people’s lives. When Republicans forced consecutive government closures in late 1995 and early 1996, some museums and national parks closed, services for veterans took a hit, the National Institutes of Health stopped taking new patients and the Centers for Disease Control halted disease surveillance.

But more than that, it was a genuine media earthquake, with nightly newscasts and headlines dominated by damaging stories about then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his GOP foot soldiers.

A repeat of that, say Democrats, would give their candidates potent ammunition to attack Republicans as uncompromising and dysfunctional. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has sent out a batch of press releases labeling a possible fiscal crisis “Tom Cotton’s government shutdown,” in reference to the freshman Republican House member who just announced he is running for Senate next year.

“I think a government shutdown would change things dramatically,” said Ali Lapp, who heads up a House Democratic super PAC. “It would be a pretty big movement going in favor of Democrats.”

( Also on POLITICO: Romney warns against shutdown)

Whether a shutdown will happen has become Washington’s summer guessing game. With a Sept. 30 deadline for passing a continuing resolution to keep the government funded, congressional leaders have little time to hash out a deal. By the time members return from their August recess, they’ll have just nine working days until the deadline hits.

The big sticking point in the negotiations is Obamacare. Some conservatives, such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, have been pushing for any bill to fund the government to be stripped of funding for the soon-to-be implemented health care bill.

The establishment wing of the GOP, however, has warned conservatives that shutting down the government over Obamacare funding would have drastic political consequences and possibly cost the party its House majority. Some Republicans remember all too well the last shutdown, from which Clinton emerged the clear victor and the Gingrich-led House GOP took a hit.

( Also on POLITICO: Coburn: Shutdown will lead to pain)

While Republicans appeared intransigent and petty, Clinton used the episode to cast himself as a level-headed pol who was willing to compromise. And when the government reopened, he took all the credit. The next year, Clinton won reelection convincingly and Republicans lost nine House seats but kept the majority (a result that Gingrich has argued shows the fallout from the shutdown wan’t as bad for the GOP as some now claim).

Democrats, of course, aren’t openly pleading for House Republicans to shut down the government — they realize that would look crass and baldly political. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) said such a dramatic event “would be a catastrophe for the country.”

But he was also quick to highlight the political consequences for Republicans.

“It has the potential to create a national narrative that becomes a challenge for House Republicans,” he said. “They’re playing with fire.”

Republicans say Democrats risk a backlash of their own.

“The fact that House Democrats are rooting for a government shutdown just so that they can attempt to score political points is the lowest of the low,” said Daniel Scarpinato, an NRCC spokesman. “The longer these Democrats refuse to be part of the solution to reducing our debt, creating jobs and stopping Obamacare, the longer voters will continue to reject putting Nancy Pelosi back in the speaker’s chair.”

Democrats have been trying to make the case of late that their 2014 prospects are brightening, pointing out that Republicans have done little to improve their tarnished brand since last year’s presidential election. But the reality is that the political winds are, at this point at least, fairly still. And while the GOP’s numbers are in the tank, Democrats have their own problems: Obama’s approval numbers have slipped recently, and the party has the unenviable job of defending the health care rollout.

Then there’s the matter of the electoral playing field, which is tilted against Democrats. In the Senate, where the GOP needs to net six seats to win control, Democrats are hard-pressed to defend vacant seats in Montana, West Virginia and South Dakota. They’re also on defense in the House, where the Cook Political Report lists nine more Democratic seats as being vulnerable to a takeover than Republican seats. Democrats need to net 17 House seats to take the speaker’s gavel.

Democrats, however, argue that a shutdown could upend the current wisdom about how many seats are truly in play. House races are typically more vulnerable to the whims of the national environment than Senate contests, which are often race-by-race affairs.

Under the current Cook projections, just 29 of the 234 House Republicans are listed as vulnerable. If a shutdown occurs, Democrats contend, that number will grow considerably. While voter anger at the federal government isn’t at the levels it was in 2006, 2008 or 2010, a shutdown, they say, would make it come back with a vengeance — with the blame put squarely on the GOP.

“It’s exceedingly difficult for Democrats to win back the House unless there’s a groundswell of frustration that upsets traditional voting habits,” said Ben Tulchin, a San Francisco-based Democratic pollster. “If they force a shutdown, they’re done. … It could really open the door for Democrats to take back the House.”

Not everyone is convinced a shutdown would be a big difference-maker in 2014. With more than a year until the election, there’s still plenty of time for the political environment to go through several transformations.

“If something happens now, it’s not going to matter in 2014,” said Dave Beattie, a Democratic pollster.

Israel agreed that a shutdown alone wouldn’t hand Democrats the House, but the DCCC chairman said it would bolster his party’s case against Republicans. It wouldn’t create a wave itself, he said, but would help it develop.

Other Democrats worry that they, too, would pay a price in the event of a fiscal crisis.

Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee and a former DCCC chairman, predicted that incumbents from both parties would see their poll numbers crater as voters fume.

“It would further cement that this is a dysfunctional Congress, and that doesn’t help anybody,” he said. “I think it’s a political loser for everybody.”",www.politico.com,left,mq0OeIbUWG0Flqty

It ’ s really the only question that matters after Friday ’ s contest .
Pete Buttigieg ’ s strong finish in Iowa , where he came in less than two points behind Bernie Sanders on the final vote and roughly tied Sanders for state delegates , has propelled him upward in New Hampshire polls . In Suffolk ’ s tracking poll , Buttigieg trailed Sanders 11 percent to 24 percent in New Hampshire right before Iowa , but he had closed the gap to one point — 23 percent to 24 percent — in that same tracking poll conducted February 5–6 .

It’s really the only question that matters after Friday’s contest.

Manchester, N.H.

Pete Buttigieg’s strong finish in Iowa, where he came in less than two points behind Bernie Sanders on the final vote and roughly tied Sanders for state delegates, has propelled him upward in New Hampshire polls. In Suffolk’s tracking poll, Buttigieg trailed Sanders 11 percent to 24 percent in New Hampshire right before Iowa, but he had closed the gap to one point — 23 percent to 24 percent — in that same tracking poll conducted February 5–6.

Did anything happen at Friday’s debate in Manchester to change the dynamic of the race?

The frontrunner Sanders seemed to escape relatively unscathed. Joe Biden was the only candidate on stage to hit him hard on Medicare for All and Sanders’s past support of gun rights, but there was no defining moment that appeared likely to send the Vermont socialist sinking in New Hampshire.

Buttigieg, on the other hand, did take some hard shots from Amy Klobuchar, who portrayed the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., as a child. “We got a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us,” Klobuchar said after noting Buttigieg is himself the “cool newcomer.” She hit Buttigieg for saying he’d rather “watch cartoons” than the Senate impeachment trial. Klobuchar was shading the truth a little bit. Buttigieg did indeed say: “I live and breathe politics, and I find it exhausting. It’s just — it gets you down and makes you want to watch cartoons instead.” But he went on to say that this was a “temptation” that “the cynics” want Democrats to give in to.

Klobuchar was on firmer ground when she went after Buttigieg’s past support for Medicare for All. Buttigieg said at the debate that he has been “consistent throughout” on the issue of Medicare for All, but in 2018 he tweeted: “I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered.”
