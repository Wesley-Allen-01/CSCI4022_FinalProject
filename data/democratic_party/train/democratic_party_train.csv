Liberal Democrats are angry at President Obama over the CIA , his foreign policy , increasing Wall Street coziness and a host of other disappointments . The left wing is also frustrated with their party ’ s presumptive 2016 nominee and in the shadow of a humiliating midterm loss . So they 're acting out . Facing what promises to be a very unhappy two years in the minority with lame duck president and a presidential candidate who is deeply distrusted by the Democratic base , liberal lawmakers have adopted policies and practices they once abhorred from Republicans . And as it happens , the woman leading the charge is the only potential threat to 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton and the area of dispute is centered directly on one of Hillary ’ s weakest spots : her deep Wall Street ties . So what does this say about the future of the party and the instigator of this brinksmanship , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ?
[ “ If the president is lobbying , we do not like it , and we 're saying to our members , ‘ Do n't be intimidated by anybody. ’ ” —Rep . Maxine Waters , D-Calif. , on opposing the spending bill . ]
Just getting warmed up - They might not have won this time , but Warren & Co. have shown clout and the ability to organize to disrupt the best plans of the establishment . It seems highly unlikely that Obama and Hillary will be able to keep the rank and file in line , especially since the alliance between the two Democratic leaders is more of a cease fire than a partnership . That means more pressure on Hillary to move left and launch her official campaign sooner than her rumored early spring target . Giving Warren three or four months to raise her profile and stake out far-left positions would make Hillary ’ s task of crushing her harder and limit her ability to pivot center as soon as possible . It also means little hope for the president to enact any of the legacy-securing initiatives he had hoped for in his final years .

Can Warren still block the bill ? - Senate liberals could still scuttle the deal , but they would need some help from the right , which also hates the bill . Last night , both the House and Senate passed a two-day continuing resolution to fund the government and avoid a partial shutdown . The House also passed the “ CRomnibus , ” the hideously named , $ 1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the remaining nine-and-a-half months of the federal fiscal year ( a conventional omnibus spending plan ) but funding immigration programs for just three months ( allowing Republicans to try to roll back Obama ’ s temporary amnesty after the Senate is in GOP hands ) . The House ’ s move punted the bill back to the Senate for final passage and eventually Obama ’ s signature . But that is not as easy as it seems , with thanks and apologies to Fox News Hill honcho Chad Pergram , here ’ s the lay of the land :
The Senate reconvened at 10 a.m . ET , but must first finish the National Defense Authorization Act . Time runs out on this bill this afternoon .
Until the must-pass military measure is finished , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid can not file cloture to move to the vote for the spending package , which requires 60 votes .
This is the crucial moment for bill . If Warren and liberal senators get enough help from conservative Republicans opposed to the bill for other reasons , they could prevent it from advancing . But finding 41 votes for a move that would precipitate a shutdown seems highly unlikely .
Members from the left and right , however , have some additional options even after it passes . A single senator or a small group could insist on using all 30 hours of debate time , pushing past the two-day emergency funding plan approved Thursday night . That would force leaders to go back to the House for another emergency budget patch . Another vote would give conservatives who say they were hornswoggled by House leaders into backing the emergency bill on the grounds that the bigger bill was dead and buried . And with the shutdown threat revived , liberals and conservatives alike could make some additional demands , or at least use the time to try to find 51 senators to vote against final passage .
See ya - Is any of that likely to happen ? No way . But the procedure provides some sticking points to bedevil the establishment but also some unhappy votes for ideological purists . The Senate can avoid this whole mess by invoking “ unanimous consent ” to vote on the big spending bill this afternoon . However , as the name states , the decision has to unanimous . If one senator objects , the decision is rejected . And that means that the Warren wing and the Republican rebels alike would all have to cave to some degree . With the left and right demanding maximum resistance , a consent vote could be painful . The question will be whether that is more painful than the experience of dragging Congress and the country through that risky tedium to obtain a limited and uncertain goal . Unless they can scrounge up 41 votes in the Senate to kill it , this Frankenbudget is going to stagger forth .

With the economy still sputtering along , unemployment rates have remained high . But among American men , the story has been different . Rather than just losing work , recent years have seen a sharp rise in men dropping out of the workforce altogether . Where did they all go ? NYT reports that since the 1960s the number of unemployed men not working has increased from 5 percent to 16 percent . Only about one third of them are not working because of unemployment . The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics asks the remaining two thirds to describe their situation . About 13 percent of non-workers say they are currently in school . 20 percent of new non-workers say they are disabled , especially for those over the age of 50 . Once out of the work force because of disability , workers are extremely unlikely to return . The remaining factors include being a homemaker , though still rare , the number of men staying home has doubled since 2000 and finally retirement . Early retirement among prime-age workers has actually increased while workers over the age of 55 have put off retirement longer with the decline of pension plans and the increased age for Social Security benefits .

Coming off two weeks of breathless speculation about the vice president’s ambitions, Clinton now looks like she’s nearly locked up the support of party elites, something she critically failed to accomplish in 2008.

Story Continued Below

A phalanx of Clinton’s top aides — including campaign manager Robby Mook, political director Amanda Renteria, and top organizing official Marlon Marshall — worked party influencers at the Democrats’ candidate cattle-call here and at a private happy hour at the W Hotel bar on Thursday night, while trying to calm those with questions about the email controversy. Clinton too met with supporters privately on Thursday night.

And party officials gathered in the hotel’s hallways, conference rooms, and suites responded, delivering a level of enthusiasm for their wounded front-runner that demonstrated to would-be challengers how little space they have to pursue the Democratic establishment.

“This is really about how you put the numbers together to secure the nomination,” Clinton said Friday. “In 2008 I got a lot of votes, but I didn’t get enough delegates. So I think it’s understandable that my focus is going to be on delegates as well as votes this time.”

In a leak coinciding neatly with Clinton’s appearance in Minneapolis, Brooklyn told Bloomberg it has already secured commitments from more than 60 percent of the party’s superdelegates -- those officials and leaders whose support is not tied to primary or caucus tallies. The campaign also says it is briefing the unpledged delegates to firm up support.

It’s not a field-clearing advantage; superdelegates can change allegiances and Clinton was ahead in the delegate count early in the 2008 race too. But it’s significant if it holds.

Underscoring Clinton’s commanding position — and perhaps highlighting the disconnect between party officials and disaffected voters — the Sanders campaign appeared nearly an afterthought through the first two days of the DNC meeting, his supporters’ handwritten signs heavily outnumbered by Clinton t-shirts and bumper stickers until the candidate took the stage to loud cheers on Friday afternoon. Even the senator himself was received coolly at a reception of DNC members the previous night, according to people in the room.

“The DNC meeting in Minneapolis is Clinton country at the moment,” said Kate Gallego, a committee member from Arizona who said even her flight to Minnesota was overrun with Clinton buttons.

Evidence of her support was clear as her standard stump speech was treated by the fired-up audience as if it were a swing-state, general-election rally, interrupted by extended standing ovations.

This, even in the face of polling that’s going from bad to worse and hand-wringing from donors and supporters who’ve been urging the Brooklyn headquarters to find a new approach on the email controversy.

Certainly, Sanders and Biden had their supporters on site. The Vermonter’s senior staff met with delegates and his backers in “join the political revolution” t-shirts worked up a rousing applause when he was first mentioned in front of the Democratic party’s membership on Friday.

Meanwhile the Draft Biden group working to gin up support for the vice president held a handful of meetings with party officials — attracting a few dozen curious members at a time, according to attendees — without registering much of a physical presence. Few were ready to commit to Biden, said Bert Marley, a committeeman from Idaho who went to one of the meetings on Thursday evening, though party members were happy to listen to the presentation.

But many DNC members, who provide the support and infrastructure that can prove critical to a campaign, were outright dismissive of the idea that either challenger could seriously compete as primary season approaches.

“Reality has set in on Biden,” said Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa. “It’s just too hard.""

And it’s not just a question of electoral math for some Democrats, who bristle at the idea that the vice president could reshape the race the second he chose to get in.

“[Biden] doesn’t reach out to me for seven f---ing years and then he wants me to help him out? I don’t think so,” said Florida committeeman and Clinton backer Jon M. Ausman, lamenting the vice president's lack of party activity compared to Bill Clinton, who invited him to the Lincoln Bedroom as president. “I don’t really give a shit. I don’t care if he gets into the race or not.""

Clinton’s full-court press came at the end of a week when her campaign also rolled out an endorsement from Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack — an influential Iowan and colleague of Clinton’s and Biden’s in the cabinet — her main supportive super PAC unveiled its first ad, the political operation invited top fundraisers to Brooklyn headquarters for a briefing with senior staffers, and it told that same group it would start getting regular conference calls with Clinton’s top policy staffer.

“There are a lot of Democrats who worry about this. And you gotta do everything you can to reassure them. The problem is you can do what you did this week, and then the Quinnipiac poll comes out and everyone worries about it,” said veteran party strategist Bob Shrum, who helped lead the presidential campaigns of John Kerry and Al Gore.

So ending a stretch of two weeks when much of the party’s talk was about Biden’s presidential calculations and the opening that Clinton’s email controversy could create for the vice president, the campaign’s dominating presence in Minneapolis was welcomed by her backers, many of whom told POLITICO they were reassured by the campaign’s performance.

“She certainly has a huge presence here. They are working the meeting as they should — really hard,” said Florida Democratic Party executive director Scott Arceneaux.

That charm offensive spells trouble for the scattered Biden factions that showed up in Minneapolis. The chatter about the vice president’s candidacy slowed to a trickle on Friday, DNC members said, as Clinton forces worked to circle the wagons.

“The Biden talk is not what it used to be. I don’t see the concern out there that you saw a few weeks ago,” said Hinojosa. “Not in Minneapolis. And not among the leadership in Texas. Hillary remains pretty much locked up among a huge portion of the Democratic leadership that I’m aware of.”

“Texas is the second-largest state in terms of delegates in the country. It is physically impossible for Vice President Biden to have a significant impact in this primary election,” said Hinojosa.

And others, like Joni Gutierrez, a committewoman from New Mexico who committed to Clinton last week and called her speech here “the best ever,” were even more fed up with the speculation amid Clinton’s own delegate-counting:

“Hillary does not need this,” Gutierrez said.

Some Capitol Hill Democrats are preparing to launch broadsides against President Barack Obama if the Affordable Care Act website isn ’ t fixed by the end of the month .
That will come in the form of more aggressive scrutiny in Republican-led oversight hearings , open advocacy for further delay in the enrollment deadline and individual coverage mandate , and more calls for a staff shake-up in the White House .
“ The president and his team have repeatedly assured us that the system will be working by Dec. 1 . That ’ s when I start looking at what we have to do in our oversight function to hold the administration accountable for making it work. ” Rep. Bruce Braley , an Iowa Democrat who is running for an open Senate seat said Thursday , adding that he ’ s contemplating whether to ask the president to fire members of his staff . “ I ’ m thinking about those options . But my biggest concern is fixing the system and making it work . ”
( Understanding Obamacare : ███ 's guide to the Affordable Care Act )
Asked whether he was mad at the president , Braley hesitated for a few seconds amid the din of a Capitol hallway .
The building frustration — expressed in part Nov. 15 when 39 House Democrats voted for a GOP bill that would have let consumers keep expiring insurance plans — is driven by the fear that Obama ’ s failed rollout has suddenly left scores of Democrats vulnerable to defeat in the House and Senate .
These Democrats won ’ t win legislative changes without the assent of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) — and likely Obama — but their public positioning could put unsustainable pressure on the administration ’ s efforts to hold the line on the current contours of the law . And while the House is scheduled to return to session on Dec. 3 , the Senate won ’ t be back in from its Thanksgiving break until the week of Dec. 9 .
But already , Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D-La . ) is leading an upper-chamber push to allow people to keep their existing health plans . Sen. Mark Begich ( D-Alaska ) , who has introduced his own plan to give people other health care options , recently said he thought the appropriate time to act was after Thanksgiving break .
“ Let ’ s just wait and see what happens . We ’ re gon na — we ’ re gon na take two weeks off . I ’ m gon na visit with my five children together for the first time , 16 grandchildren , 44 people for Thanksgiving dinner . Let ’ s talk about that for a while , ” Reid said last week .
But in the meantime , Democratic lawmakers — particularly those on the House side — are preparing to try to put distance between themselves and the president because they ’ re not confident that the White House has a Plan B for getting the policy right or protecting them in the mid-term elections .
“ I don ’ t sense that at all . When you think about it , a week after the October shutdown Democrats were experiencing a euphoric high . We thought we had Republicans on the mat .

Rep.

“ If it ’ s not working substantially by the end of November then we have to think really hard about the Jan. 1 enrollment , because people will only have a couple of weeks , ” DeGette said , hinting that there might be congressional Democratic support for a delay at that point . On Friday , the administration announced that it would allow another week — until Dec. 23 — for people to enroll and still begin receiving coverage at the start of the new year , but that may not be enough to please lawmakers who are frustrated that their constituents haven ’ t had as much time as they thought they would to sign up .

But while the one-two punch of Obama and McDonough spared the White House a full-scale embarrassment on the floor of the House , it didn ’ t quell anxiety or imbue Democrats with new faith that Obama can solve the problems with the Affordable Care Act rollout — or deal with the political flak that would hit if the site continues to fall short after the self-imposed deadline .
“ There was an awful lot of eye-rolling when [ McDonough ] insisted that the website will be fixed in time for December 1 , and he really didn ’ t offer a Plan B , but was adamant that it would be up and running , ” said a House Democratic source who attended the meeting .
“ At this point , I don ’ t think there is anyone that would express any confidence in the administration ’ s ability to right the ship , ” said the source , adding that members seem to be “ bracing for another tidal wave when Dec. 1 comes and goes and we are still dealing with a dysfunctional website , or ‘ broken computer ’ as the old-timers have been calling it . ”
For now , Republican leaders in Congress are still discussing their options for how to handle the Nov. 30 deadline , but if the website falls short of White House predictions , there ’ s little doubt that they will pounce .
Administration officials say there ’ s no need for Democrats to wring their hands .
“ We expect that the website will be working smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of November , ” said one administration official . “ As [ the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ] has said , this means that by the end of November , the vast majority of website users will be able to move faster through the system , see fewer error messages , experience less time-outs and be able to complete their application and enroll in one sitting smoothly if they choose to do so . ”
The official pointed to reduced wait times on the website , lower error rates , and fewer problems with the entire site crashing as evidence that things have gotten better . But they couldn ’ t have gotten worse since the Oct. rollout , when only a relative handful of consumers were able to navigate the website at all .
“ As with any Web project , this is a dynamic online environment and a process that will be ongoing — we will continually be making enhancements , adding features and delivering new content and that will improve the user experience so we can best respond to ongoing consumer demand over time , ” the administration official said .
None of this sounds good to the president ’ s allies outside the White House , even if most haven ’ t jumped ship on Obama yet .
” As far as I can tell , the Democratic leaders and most members are willing to give the administration the time they asked for to see if they can get the kinks ironed out of the website , but there is a lot of frustration right now on the Hill and time is running out , ” Jim Manley , a former senior aide to Harry Reid who is now a senior director at Quinn Gillespie , said in an email . “ Most understand that it is the wrong time to be talking about a Plan B , but everyone wants to be reassured that they have an idea of where they want to go and how they intend to get there , and I am not sure that is the case right now . ”
They are particularly unhappy with Obama for setting a Nov. 30 deadline for fixing the website , even as he and his aides refuse to set a definable goal for achieving that . White House officials have talked about other options consumers can use to enroll — including in-person , telephone , and ground-mail signups . But those applications still have to be processed through a website that remains faulty , and lawmakers say the White House put too much emphasis on the Web and not enough on the other avenues , which they say might be more readily available to some of the poorest and sickest consumers who need health insurance .

Some Capitol Hill Democrats are preparing to launch broadsides against President Barack Obama if the Affordable Care Act website isn’t fixed by the end of the month.

That will come in the form of more aggressive scrutiny in Republican-led oversight hearings, open advocacy for further delay in the enrollment deadline and individual coverage mandate, and more calls for a staff shake-up in the White House.

Story Continued Below

“The president and his team have repeatedly assured us that the system will be working by Dec. 1. That’s when I start looking at what we have to do in our oversight function to hold the administration accountable for making it work.” Rep. Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat who is running for an open Senate seat said Thursday, adding that he’s contemplating whether to ask the president to fire members of his staff. “I’m thinking about those options. But my biggest concern is fixing the system and making it work.”

( Understanding Obamacare: POLITICO's guide to the Affordable Care Act)

Asked whether he was mad at the president, Braley hesitated for a few seconds amid the din of a Capitol hallway.

“Yes,” he said.

The building frustration — expressed in part Nov. 15 when 39 House Democrats voted for a GOP bill that would have let consumers keep expiring insurance plans — is driven by the fear that Obama’s failed rollout has suddenly left scores of Democrats vulnerable to defeat in the House and Senate.

These Democrats won’t win legislative changes without the assent of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) — and likely Obama — but their public positioning could put unsustainable pressure on the administration’s efforts to hold the line on the current contours of the law. And while the House is scheduled to return to session on Dec. 3, the Senate won’t be back in from its Thanksgiving break until the week of Dec. 9.

But already, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) is leading an upper-chamber push to allow people to keep their existing health plans. Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), who has introduced his own plan to give people other health care options, recently said he thought the appropriate time to act was after Thanksgiving break.

“Let’s just wait and see what happens. We’re gonna — we’re gonna take two weeks off. I’m gonna visit with my five children together for the first time, 16 grandchildren, 44 people for Thanksgiving dinner. Let’s talk about that for a while,” Reid said last week.

But in the meantime, Democratic lawmakers — particularly those on the House side — are preparing to try to put distance between themselves and the president because they’re not confident that the White House has a Plan B for getting the policy right or protecting them in the mid-term elections.

“I don’t sense that at all. When you think about it, a week after the October shutdown Democrats were experiencing a euphoric high. We thought we had Republicans on the mat. We thought we were going to win back the House and then this rollout fails,” said one House Democrat from a traditionally safe seat based in a major city. “Now, we need to be concerned, all of us, me included, that we aren’t viewed as ineffective and kicked out of our seats.”

Not only are Democrats watching helplessly as visions of taking over the House begin to dissolve, but they increasingly perceive the danger that the Senate could flip into GOP hands and that Obama’s final three years in office could be a total loss for their party’s agenda.

The Democratic National Committee on Saturday revealed the six cities - Birmingham, Alabama; Cleveland, Columbus, Ohio; New York, Philadelphia and Phoenix - who submitted bids to host the marquee campaign season event.

""We're thrilled with all the fantastic options that we have going into the next cycle,"" DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a press release.

""We look forward to evaluating these bids and selecting a city to host this special gathering of Democrats.""

The press release said a technical advisory committee will evaluate the cities over the coming months, including site visits and ""other inquiries."" The DNC said it will announce its decision later this year or in early 2015.

The Republican National Committee is farther along in its winnowing process. Denver, Dallas, Cleveland and Kansas City are the final cities bidding to hold the 2016 GOP convention. The RNC expects to announce its final decision in the fall.

In a letter to the DNC, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio pitched Brooklyn as the focal point for the Big Apple's bid to host the 2016 party confab.

The progressive mayor, elected just last November, intends to have the sprawling Barclays Center - home to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets - anchor the bid and serve as the principal venue site for the convention, with other events and accommodations spread across Brooklyn, Manhattan and New York's other boroughs.

The last time New York City hosted a party's presidential nominating convention was the 2004 Republican National Convention. It last hosted a Democratic convention in 1992. Both of those conventions were held in Manhattan's Madison Square Garden.

Among the other final five choices for the Democrat's, Philadelphia is the only one to previously host a major party convention. In 2000, Republicans officially nominated George W. Bush as the party's standard bearer at the then-named First Union Center.

democratic_party,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/democrats-rust-belt-dilemma-231842,Democrats wrestle with Rust Belt dilemma,2016-11-26,"Zach Montellaro, Heather Caygle, Gabriel Debenedetti","One month ago , Democrats viewed Arizona and Georgia as winnable states for the first time in decades . And demographic trends seem to have put Texas in play as well .
But then came Hillary Clinton ’ s shocking loss to Donald Trump , powered largely by her unexpected weakness across the traditionally Democratic industrial states of the Rust Belt .
Now , party officials in the fast-growing , so-called purple states that so recently looked within reach — all of which also fell to Trump — are increasingly wary that national party leaders will redirect their focus toward Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin , denying them the critical attention and resources that might otherwise accelerate their movement toward swing-state status .
“ Right now , Democrats need to make sure we correct but we don ’ t overcorrect , ” said Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed . “ This isn ’ t a situation where we need to be making false choices . We need to understand we won the popular vote , [ but ] we lost states we should not have lost . ''
The worry is at the heart of the quandary the party now faces as it attempts to find a middle ground between the coalition that elected Barack Obama to two terms but failed to materialize for Clinton , and the suddenly ascendant one that elected Trump to the presidency .
Current and aspiring leaders of the party have in recent days repeatedly pointed to the importance of keeping white working-class voters in the Democratic column , speaking of the need to reconfigure the economic message coming from their standard-bearers up and down the ballot so that it appeals to all voters , not just the African-American and Hispanic constituencies that make up the party base .
That ’ s been a top stated concern of both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as they seek to map out the party ’ s future . Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown kicked off the week with a New York Times op-ed making a similar case .
Yet Democrats in places like Arizona , Georgia and Texas — states where growing minority populations hold long-term promise for the party — fear the reaction to Clinton ’ s loss could lead to a zero-sum approach where the rush to win back wayward white voters in the Rust Belt comes at their expense .
`` I do have this worry where there 's going to be an opportunity-cost scenario , where they say we know how to win in these states , but not these others , ” says Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego . “ But the thing I like to point out to people is the same working-class people in Michigan are in Arizona . They vote the same , they may just not live in the same geography . ''
Democrats in Arizona and Georgia are quick to note that the party is as close as it ’ s ever been to being competitive at the presidential level in those states . On the strength of a surge in Latino voters , Clinton lost Arizona — where the GOP nominee has won in 16 of the past 17 elections — by less than 4 percentage points . In Georgia , Clinton lost by just 5 points as African-American voters turned out for Clinton .
Those results came despite minimal national investment in those two states . The Clinton campaign and its supportive super PAC ended up pumping ad money into both toward the end of the race — and Clinton herself visited Arizona once — but the vast majority of her team ’ s time and resources went toward core swing states .
“ What was going on in Georgia is real . It was the most competitive presidential election in Georgia since 1992 , and we did it with minimal resources , ” said Reed . “ We ’ re going to continue to do our work here and grind it out , but for the national Democratic Party it ’ s really important for us — we need to win Southern states going forward . And it sends a message even to the Rust Belt and Midwestern communities [ that ] when you bring along Southern states , it helps us maintain our status as a national party . ''
The Arizona and Georgia margins turned out to be closer than in Ohio and Iowa — two swing states Obama won twice — and Trump became the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to win Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin in the same election . As such , much of the public conversation surrounding the party ’ s post-Clinton future has zeroed in on what went wrong in those traditional battlegrounds .
“ Our national committees are not the most forward-looking institutions . The way these committees work is : it ’ s better to fail doing a conventional thing rather than trying something new , ” said Andy Barr , a Democratic strategist in Arizona . “ We ’ ve lost a ton of voters in the Midwest . Maybe they ’ ll come back , I don ’ t know , but those voters haven ’ t voted for any Democrat other than Barack Obama in a long freaking time . But with minimal investment in Arizona and Texas , those are the states where we gained voters , with almost no involvement from D.C . ''
Nonetheless , the party is unlikely to undergo any significant reallocation of resources for at least a few months , while it goes through a protracted period of soul-searching and elects a new Democratic National Committee chairman who will help direct such decisions .
“ The conversation that people have in the initial aftermath of a shocking defeat is hopefully different than the one that we will have when we ’ re really mapping out the future , ” said Seth Scott , an aide to Phoenix ’ s mayor who served as Clinton ’ s Arizona state director , and who said the state would be crucial to any Democrat ’ s White House hopes in 2020 . “ The last two weeks have been really difficult , not only for all of us personally , but for a party that is trying to grapple with not only how we lost , but how we lost to the person we lost to , and the way we lost . ''
And in the meantime , the party will go through a series of autopsies of what went wrong in November , a process that will likely include more rounds of second-guessing about the Clinton campaign and national Democrats ’ money distribution .
`` Look at what happened here in Texas without heavy investment or infrastructure . We won four of the five big metro areas in Texas , '' said Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar . “ Whoever the new DNC chair 's going to be , we 're hoping that there will be an emphasis on areas that will have growth opportunities , and Texas is one of them . But we 're already not getting those resources . So are they taking anything away from us ? No , we 're not getting it already . ''

“ It would be a mistake to not look at the gains that were made in Georgia , ” said Rebecca DeHart , executive director of that state ’ s Democratic Party , nodding to the looming uncertainty about resources .","One month ago, Democrats viewed Arizona and Georgia as winnable states for the first time in decades. And demographic trends seem to have put Texas in play as well.

But then came Hillary Clinton’s shocking loss to Donald Trump, powered largely by her unexpected weakness across the traditionally Democratic industrial states of the Rust Belt.

Now, party officials in the fast-growing, so-called purple states that so recently looked within reach — all of which also fell to Trump — are increasingly wary that national party leaders will redirect their focus toward Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, denying them the critical attention and resources that might otherwise accelerate their movement toward swing-state status.

“Right now, Democrats need to make sure we correct but we don’t overcorrect,” said Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. “This isn’t a situation where we need to be making false choices. We need to understand we won the popular vote, [but] we lost states we should not have lost.""

The worry is at the heart of the quandary the party now faces as it attempts to find a middle ground between the coalition that elected Barack Obama to two terms but failed to materialize for Clinton, and the suddenly ascendant one that elected Trump to the presidency.

Current and aspiring leaders of the party have in recent days repeatedly pointed to the importance of keeping white working-class voters in the Democratic column, speaking of the need to reconfigure the economic message coming from their standard-bearers up and down the ballot so that it appeals to all voters, not just the African-American and Hispanic constituencies that make up the party base.

That’s been a top stated concern of both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as they seek to map out the party’s future. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown kicked off the week with a New York Times op-ed making a similar case.

Yet Democrats in places like Arizona, Georgia and Texas — states where growing minority populations hold long-term promise for the party — fear the reaction to Clinton’s loss could lead to a zero-sum approach where the rush to win back wayward white voters in the Rust Belt comes at their expense.

""I do have this worry where there's going to be an opportunity-cost scenario, where they say we know how to win in these states, but not these others,” says Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. “But the thing I like to point out to people is the same working-class people in Michigan are in Arizona. They vote the same, they may just not live in the same geography.""

Democrats in Arizona and Georgia are quick to note that the party is as close as it’s ever been to being competitive at the presidential level in those states. On the strength of a surge in Latino voters, Clinton lost Arizona — where the GOP nominee has won in 16 of the past 17 elections — by less than 4 percentage points. In Georgia, Clinton lost by just 5 points as African-American voters turned out for Clinton.

Those results came despite minimal national investment in those two states. The Clinton campaign and its supportive super PAC ended up pumping ad money into both toward the end of the race — and Clinton herself visited Arizona once — but the vast majority of her team’s time and resources went toward core swing states.

“What was going on in Georgia is real. It was the most competitive presidential election in Georgia since 1992, and we did it with minimal resources,” said Reed. “We’re going to continue to do our work here and grind it out, but for the national Democratic Party it’s really important for us — we need to win Southern states going forward. And it sends a message even to the Rust Belt and Midwestern communities [that] when you bring along Southern states, it helps us maintain our status as a national party.""

The Arizona and Georgia margins turned out to be closer than in Ohio and Iowa — two swing states Obama won twice — and Trump became the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in the same election. As such, much of the public conversation surrounding the party’s post-Clinton future has zeroed in on what went wrong in those traditional battlegrounds.

“Our national committees are not the most forward-looking institutions. The way these committees work is: it’s better to fail doing a conventional thing rather than trying something new,” said Andy Barr, a Democratic strategist in Arizona. “We’ve lost a ton of voters in the Midwest. Maybe they’ll come back, I don’t know, but those voters haven’t voted for any Democrat other than Barack Obama in a long freaking time. But with minimal investment in Arizona and Texas, those are the states where we gained voters, with almost no involvement from D.C.""

Nonetheless, the party is unlikely to undergo any significant reallocation of resources for at least a few months, while it goes through a protracted period of soul-searching and elects a new Democratic National Committee chairman who will help direct such decisions.

“The conversation that people have in the initial aftermath of a shocking defeat is hopefully different than the one that we will have when we’re really mapping out the future,” said Seth Scott, an aide to Phoenix’s mayor who served as Clinton’s Arizona state director, and who said the state would be crucial to any Democrat’s White House hopes in 2020. “The last two weeks have been really difficult, not only for all of us personally, but for a party that is trying to grapple with not only how we lost, but how we lost to the person we lost to, and the way we lost.""

And in the meantime, the party will go through a series of autopsies of what went wrong in November, a process that will likely include more rounds of second-guessing about the Clinton campaign and national Democrats’ money distribution.

""Look at what happened here in Texas without heavy investment or infrastructure. We won four of the five big metro areas in Texas,"" said Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar. “Whoever the new DNC chair's going to be, we're hoping that there will be an emphasis on areas that will have growth opportunities, and Texas is one of them. But we're already not getting those resources. So are they taking anything away from us? No, we're not getting it already.""

Reed, the Atlanta mayor, makes the point that Clinton lost North Carolina and its 15 electoral votes — where her team spent tens of millions of dollars — by just roughly 1 point less than she lost Georgia and its 16 votes.

“It would be a mistake to not look at the gains that were made in Georgia,” said Rebecca DeHart, executive director of that state’s Democratic Party, nodding to the looming uncertainty about resources.

But if Clinton and her supporters were hoping to allay those doubts well ahead of a possible 2016 run, the past few months have not been helpful.

Clinton supporters would point out, fairly, that much of what has happened to them this summer — the steady stream of unseemly stories about Anthony Weiner’s continued virtual liaisons, his wife and Clinton confidante Huma Abedin’s very public decision to stand by him, and reports of mismanagement at the Clinton Foundation — has been beyond their control.

But it has all still renewed the question that hangs over Hillary Clinton: Has she learned from the mistakes of the past, and can she finally break some recurring cycles in her public life? Can she manage a functional, and focused, national campaign?

That probably can’t be fully answered unless and until Hillary Clinton clarifies whether she plans to run for president. Only then, when she assembles a new team and makes clear whether she is bringing on new blood amid the old Clinton hands, will it become clear what the latest iteration of a Clinton campaign looks like.

Unwanted coverage of the Clinton Foundation and the years leading up to Hillary Clinton’s arrival at its office has converged with the messiness of the Weiner-Abedin story. There has also been an element to some of the details in both storylines — people taking sides in a semipublic way in media accounts — that left some recalling the airing of dirty laundry after her 2008 campaign.

( PHOTOS: How close are Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton?)

Her supporters say it’s not the Clintons’ fault that the husband of one of the former secretary of state’s closest aides had more private baggage dumped in the middle of his mayoral campaign. And the Clintons were only trying to fix the internal problems at the family foundation detailed in a New York Times piece last week that highlighted questions about lax oversight and conflicts of interest, those same backers argue. The story described budgetary concerns and Bill Clinton’s own determination two years ago that things were “a mess” organizationally.

They also insist that the Clinton operation is stronger and leaner throughout than before. And the foundation has had some of the growing pains one would anticipate from what Clinton officials have called a “start-up.”

The consensus among Clinton allies whose support dates back decades is some version of this: Bill Clinton and his wife have done enough good work to mitigate the periodic bouts of negativity from their world.

But the coverage of late has been a reminder to Democratic operatives, Clinton donors and even their allies of years past.

Asked his take on the latest round of headlines involving the Clintons over the past month, former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville said, “Thus it was, thus it is and thus it shall be.”

“It’s always gonna be,” he added. “And if anybody thinks that it’s gonna change, they’re crazy.”

Yet he added that the global charitable work Bill Clinton has done, combined with his wife’s tenure at the State Department, are positives that often go overlooked.

“I think the Clinton-haters come out of the woodwork,” he said. “And if anybody thinks that’s not gonna happen they’re crazy. And I think if we’ve learned anything through all of this you deal with it is as it is and things turn out pretty good. Yes, it’s a little bit, ‘Oh God. We went through that [in the 1990s].

A year out from the Iowa caucus , some party members fret that Hillary Clinton ’ s dominance in the Democratic field will leave the party high and dry as the campaign season intensifies . A lack of competition within the party may hurt fundraising and makes it hard to develop the new blood that often grows out of highly competitive races , some party activists say .
The prospect of a Clinton victory stokes even deeper fears . “ My gut feeling as a Democratic activist is that a president Hillary Clinton will tell the Democratic Party , ‘ No caucuses , primaries only , ’ ” said John Deeth , an activist and organizer in Iowa City . “ If Hillary Clinton is elected president , this will be the last Iowa Caucus . ”
The Democratic presidential field is notably smaller and quieter than the Republican side , where a robust field of candidates is jockeying for position after Friday ’ s surprise withdrawal of poll frontrunner Mitt Romney .
In Iowa , the annual parade of appearances by big-name presidential candidates normally has ripple effects for fundraising and party-building activities among local organizations .

Hillary Clinton has complicated matters by considering delaying a formal announcement until July , and her allies are contemplating the possibility that she may not even debate in the primaries , as ███ Playbook first reported Thursday .

WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that Senate Democrats should ""get off their ass"" and stop blocking a $40 billion Homeland Security bill that would derail President Obama's immigration programs.

Boehner's comments came a day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate has reached a stalemate and ""the next move obviously is up to the House."" Senate Democrats voted three times last week to block the DHS funding bill from moving forward. They object to House-passed provisions that would cut off all funds to carry out Obama's executive orders on immigration.

The two Republican leaders seem to be each placing responsibility on the other chamber for what happens next on the funding bill. Unless Congress acts, funding for the Department of Homeland Security will expire on Feb. 27 and the agency will face a partial shutdown.

Boehner said the House will not take up a revised bill despite the Senate impasse.

""The House has done its job,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a news conference after meeting with House Republicans. ""Why don't you go ask the Senate Democrats when they're going to get off their ass and do something other than to vote 'no'?""

Obama announced in November that he would protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally in the U.S. His program would help the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. It also would expand his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gives temporary legal status and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children.

The House-passed bill would cut off all funding for the 2012 DACA program as well as blocking funds for Obama's latest immigration orders. Senate Democrats say they will only support the DHS funding bill if the immigration provisions are scrapped.

California wasn't supposed to be close. In early polling, Hillary Clinton had a commanding lead, but that lead has all but vanished. A new survey from the Public Policy Institute of California has Clinton in a virtual tie with Bernie Sanders among Democratic primary likely voters — 46 percent support Clinton while 44 percent support Sanders.

The Golden State, which holds its presidential primary June 7, is a big, liberal, delegate-rich prize in what has been a long and increasingly bitter primary fight.

And both candidates are fighting to win California. Clinton wrapped up a four-day swing Friday, while Sanders is in the midst of a weeklong barnstorming of the state.

Sanders pointed out recent polls with some glee at a rally in Santa Monica earlier this week. ""She's looking very nervous lately,"" he said. ""And I don't want to get her more nervous, so if you promise not to tell her, we're going to win here in California.""

In Salinas, a mix of what looked to be Trump and Sanders supporters gathered outside a Clinton event. They chanted and waved signs about her speech transcripts, email server and relatively hawkish foreign policy views.

Clinton supporter John Silva was puzzled by the protesters.

""You're either with Hillary or you're with Trump,"" he said.

Silva was wearing a black T-shirt with big white letters reading ""Dump Trump"" and admits he is more motivated against Trump than he is for Clinton. Silva initially supported Bernie Sanders, but now he plans to vote for Clinton in the primary.

Even a California loss for Clinton wouldn't really change the race, because she and Sanders would very likely split the state's delegates, says Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. He worked on the Clinton campaign in 2008.

""I think they would like to send a stronger message,"" he said, ""but at the end of the day the nomination process is about math much more than it is about momentum. Math beats momentum every time.""

That's probably not what Sanders and his supporters will be saying heading into the July Democratic convention if he is able to pull off a win in California. A Golden State victory would be a big part of Sanders argument to superdelegates that they should flip and support him.",www.npr.org,center,C53v1uJ20K6J99ZD

A REAGANITE AT THE WASHINGTON POST

A family dynasty is about to end at The Washington Post when Katharine Weymouth steps down as publisher on October 1, to be replaced by Frederick J. Ryan. Ms. Weymouth was advised of the impending change by Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos in mid-August; the news organization announced it on Tuesday. Mr. Ryan, 59, is an attorney and entrepreneurial-minded media entity who founded Politico seven years ago and was the former president of Allbritton Communications, which was bought by Sinclair Broadcasting, the deal finalized only last month.

Mr. Ryan’s political heritage is an interesting dynamic. He served in the Reagan White House beginning in 1982, and was ultimately named “Assistant to the President,” this according to White House records. Mr. Ryan went on to write two books about Ronald Reagan, is a board member of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and remains close to Nancy Reagan.

“Ryan’s background in Republican politics also is certain to raise questions about the direction of The Post’s editorial page, among the most influential in the nation,” wrote Post reporter Craig Timberg. “Ryan said he planned to keep the newspaper’s current executive editor, Martin Baron, and its editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt. Ryan said he did not anticipate changes in The Post’s editorial policies and would protect the independence of the newsroom, saying Baron ‘does a superb job’.”

The publisher-in-waiting appears ready to rumble. “You don’t shrink your way to success,” he said. “The Post is on the move.”

It would have cost Senate Democrats little to have given Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La. , a win on the Keystone Pipeline . After all , the president could have blown off the vote with an insurmountable veto , citing the need to protect executive prerogatives . So it seemed odd when the White House got coy ahead of the vote about the president ’ s veto threat . When the time came , though , we saw why : Team Obama had successfully whipped against the Landrieu bill . There was little chance that Landrieu was going to win her Dec. 6 runoff whatever the outcome , but with the Hail Mary turning into a Fail Mary , the seat is signed , sealed and delivered for the GOP . Democrats , led by the White House , ate one of their own rather than defy the orthodoxy of the party ’ s liberal base . That ’ s strong evidence that Democrats currently care more about ideological purity than electoral expediency . And that is always a dangerous thing .
“ The president sure has changed his mind about what he can do and what he can do now . I ’ m just basing it on what I ’ ve seen other presidents in the past do. ” – Rep. Henry Cuellar , D-Texas , on “ The Kelly File. ” Watch here .
Failing forward - Nowhere was this clearer than in the fact that despite having lost at least 65 seats since 2010 to reach their smallest minority since the 1920s , House Democrats gave Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , a seventh term as their leader . It has oft been mentioned that Pelosi is now second only to Sam Rayburn for her longevity as a party leader in the House . Less mentioned is that while Rayburn spent only four of his 21 years in the minority , Pelosi will have spent only four of her 14 years in the majority . Yes , this is partly about a dearth of young talent among Democrats , but it is more about liberal orthodoxy . Pelosi has been an uncharacteristically ideological party leader – consider her forcing Democrats to walk the plank on global warming fees in 2010 – and her members like it that way . Asked by Politico why she stayed , Pelosi chalked it up to ObamaCare : “ I ’ m honestly here to protect the Affordable Care Act. ” Gulp . Not exactly a cheery sentiment for Democrats looking to run as centrist reformers in 2016 .

‘ Big ’ loser - But the juice this week is really about immigration and the president ’ s preparation for the most audacious use of pen power yet . The White House disseminated talking points to immigration activists on Tuesday as part of some expectations setting , but mainly to get every Democrat to repeat , in unison , that previous presidents have exempted specific groups from deportation in the past . This move is different in scope and in nature , since the group reportedly will be defined by its status in the U.S. – parents of children here legally – as compared to prior exemptions , mostly for groups of refugees or immigrants from specific nations or regions . Soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , who , like Pelosi , breezed back into his leadership spot despite a hideous election performance has got his pom-poms ready . . “ I believe that whatever the president decides to do on his executive order , he should go big — as big as he can … ” Reid enthused .

Vanishing point - An audacious , confrontational approach to the midterm defeat is very much in vogue among Democrats , especially liberal firebrands who believe that a more concentrated version of the party ’ s ideology would have given more reason for inert coalition members to get to the polls . What the president heard from the two thirds of adults who did not vote was that they wanted more , more , more of his agenda . He started with global warming last week , but in the coming days will turn to immigration . As recent polling has shown , that won ’ t go over very well . Democrats may blame their inability to motivate their base for a painful midterm cycle , but anything seen as “ big ” could be very dangerous for a party that is approaching the vanishing point with the blue-collar white voters that once formed its core .

Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) doesn ’ t know if his effort to push off the debate on funding the government into next year will prove successful , but the Texas Republican is sure making an effort… “ I think a long-term omnibus or CR makes no sense .

Ewoks for Warren - Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton winds down her proxy campaign and prepares to power up the Death Star , the Ewoks down on Endor are not giving up without a fight . The Ready for Warren Super PAC will soon be dumping 100,000 letters , postcards and petition signatures on the desk of their heroine , Sen. Elizabeth Warren . They have also released their first official video which hopes to build momentum for a presidential run , saying in part , “ We think it ’ s time to elect a leader who is fearless , honest , and progressive. ” That is , they mean to say , not the former first lady of Arkansas . Clinton ’ s massive money and huge organization seems impossible to beat , especially since Warren shows little stomach for a fight . But the rebels are out there , hoping against hope that Obama ’ s presidency really did move the party to the left and wasn ’ t just a fast-vanishing Clinton interregnum .
[ Erica Sagrans , campaign manager for Ready for Warren , explains to the WaPo why Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) is already influencing Hillary Clinton ’ s candidacy . ]
The coming conflict - Hillary , meanwhile is selling something very different : Moderation and an appeal to voters in states written off by Democrats since 2000 . Mitch Stewart , who is a strategist for the Clintons ’ still-unofficial campaign , explained to Talking Points Memo that with her ability to reach out to “ white , working-class voters , ” lost to Obama and the party for more than a decade , Hillary can put states like Indiana , Georgia and Arkansas in play . How to do that ? As the failings of Clinton-core candidates in 2014 demonstrated , proximity to husband Bill is not enough to bring back the 1992 coalition . So how would Hillary bring them home ? By being moderate in the mold of the Big Dog himself . And guess what doesn ’ t fit with that : Aggressive global warming action , a nuclear deal with Iran , a last-man-standing defense of ObamaCare and , maybe most of all , large-scale , temporary amnesty by presidential fiat . Hillary is almost certain to eventually win control of the party that spurned her in 2008 . What we don ’ t know is how much of it will be left by the time she can grab the reins .

The first two attorneys whom Boehner tapped quit in succession , backing out after deciding that the issue was too politically charged to handle . Turley , a law professor at George Washington University in D.C. , has been an outspoken critic of what he has viewed as executive overreach by both Obama and former President George W. Bush…Boehner , an Ohio Republican , has not ruled out expanding the lawsuit to include a challenge to Obama 's promised executive order to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants . For now , however , the lawsuit remains focused on Obamacare . ”
The first modern state lottery started fifty years ago in New Hampshire . Since then , it has been a daredevil race ( to the top or bottom , depending on your view ) among states to expand their gambling offerings to allow ever more spending without any icky tax increases . In a legalized-vice arms race , states chased revenues through various incarnations : instant lottery , video lottery , etc . Now , 24 states have casinos and more will surely follow . As the disastrous , expensive effort to save the brainchild of the vice pioneers of Atlantic City have shown , legal gambling just isn ’ t enough anymore . It ’ s everywhere . And even if there isn ’ t a casino in your town , gambling is just a few clicks away on the Internet .

David Drucker reports : “ Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is exploring the creation of a super PAC dedicated to supporting Senate Republicans on the 2016 ballot , sources tell [ Washington Examiner ] . Senate Republicans were at a financial and advertising disadvantage for most of the 2014 cycle , as Senate Majority PAC , the super PAC of outgoing Majority Leader Harry Reid , carpet-bombed the airwaves in targeted states on behalf of Democratic candidates . McConnell wants an organization that can do the same for Republicans in 2016 , a presidential year , when his barely-minted majority faces a tough Senate map , with incumbents up for re-election in states like Florida , Illinois , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .

Democrats may blame their inability to motivate their base for a painful midterm cycle, but anything seen as “big” could be very dangerous for a party that is approaching the vanishing point with the blue-collar white voters that once formed its core.



[Roll Call: “Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) doesn’t know if his effort to push off the debate on funding the government into next year will prove successful, but the Texas Republican is sure making an effort…“I think a long-term omnibus or CR makes no sense. It hands over the decision-making authority of Congress to the president.”]



Ewoks for Warren - Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton winds down her proxy campaign and prepares to power up the Death Star, the Ewoks down on Endor are not giving up without a fight. The Ready for Warren Super PAC will soon be dumping 100,000 letters, postcards and petition signatures on the desk of their heroine, Sen. Elizabeth Warren. They have also released their first official video which hopes to build momentum for a presidential run, saying in part, “We think it’s time to elect a leader who is fearless, honest, and progressive.” That is, they mean to say, not the former first lady of Arkansas. Clinton’s massive money and huge organization seems impossible to beat, especially since Warren shows little stomach for a fight. But the rebels are out there, hoping against hope that Obama’s presidency really did move the party to the left and wasn’t just a fast-vanishing Clinton interregnum.



[Erica Sagrans, campaign manager for Ready for Warren, explains to the WaPo why Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is already influencing Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.]



The coming conflict - Hillary, meanwhile is selling something very different: Moderation and an appeal to voters in states written off by Democrats since 2000. Mitch Stewart, who is a strategist for the Clintons’ still-unofficial campaign, explained to Talking Points Memo that with her ability to reach out to “white, working-class voters,” lost to Obama and the party for more than a decade, Hillary can put states like Indiana, Georgia and Arkansas in play. How to do that? As the failings of Clinton-core candidates in 2014 demonstrated, proximity to husband Bill is not enough to bring back the 1992 coalition. So how would Hillary bring them home? By being moderate in the mold of the Big Dog himself. And guess what doesn’t fit with that: Aggressive global warming action, a nuclear deal with Iran, a last-man-standing defense of ObamaCare and, maybe most of all, large-scale, temporary amnesty by presidential fiat. Hillary is almost certain to eventually win control of the party that spurned her in 2008. What we don’t know is how much of it will be left by the time she can grab the reins.

BOEHNER TAPS TURLEY FOR OBAMACARE LAWSUIT

WashEx: “House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has hired prominent constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley to represent the House of Representatives in its lawsuit against President Obama’s unilateral move to delay implementation of an Obamacare provision requiring large firms to offer healthcare to their employees. The first two attorneys whom Boehner tapped quit in succession, backing out after deciding that the issue was too politically charged to handle. Turley, a law professor at George Washington University in D.C., has been an outspoken critic of what he has viewed as executive overreach by both Obama and former President George W. Bush…Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has not ruled out expanding the lawsuit to include a challenge to Obama's promised executive order to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants. For now, however, the lawsuit remains focused on Obamacare.”

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...

The first modern state lottery started fifty years ago in New Hampshire. Since then, it has been a daredevil race (to the top or bottom, depending on your view) among states to expand their gambling offerings to allow ever more spending without any icky tax increases. In a legalized-vice arms race, states chased revenues through various incarnations: instant lottery, video lottery, etc. Now, 24 states have casinos and more will surely follow. As the disastrous, expensive effort to save the brainchild of the vice pioneers of Atlantic City have shown, legal gambling just isn’t enough anymore. It’s everywhere. And even if there isn’t a casino in your town, gambling is just a few clicks away on the Internet. At the New Yorker, John Wolfson explains how lawmakers’ love of easy money has left so many states in the hole.

GOP GOVERNORS SHOW OFF AHEAD OF 2016 STAKES

GOP presidential prospects Govs. Chris Christie, R-N.J., Mike Pence, R-Ind., and Rick Perry, R-Texas, headline the Republican Governors Association’s two-day meeting, starting today in Baca Raton, Fla. The confab of Republican governors and governors-elect will hash over the RGA’s success in the midterms, policy goals and an election strategy to help the party win back the White House in 2016.

Mitt loosens up about Mormonism - 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney delivered a speech at Brigham Young University where he praised his Mormon background urging students that their religion is not a hardship but rather a blessing, saying, “There may be times in your life when you may feel that it is a bit of a burden being a member of the Church…But I can affirm this: your fellow members of the Church will be a blessing to you that far more than compensates.” This marks quite a shift from his 2007 speech “Faith in America” speech, where in an attempt to make a broad appeal to voters Romney only made brief mentions of his religion and only including the word Mormon once.

MCCONNELL LAYS GROUNDWORK FOR SUPER PAC TO RIVAL REID MACHINE

David Drucker reports: “Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is exploring the creation of a super PAC dedicated to supporting Senate Republicans on the 2016 ballot, sources tell [Washington Examiner]. Senate Republicans were at a financial and advertising disadvantage for most of the 2014 cycle, as Senate Majority PAC, the super PAC of outgoing Majority Leader Harry Reid, carpet-bombed the airwaves in targeted states on behalf of Democratic candidates. McConnell wants an organization that can do the same for Republicans in 2016, a presidential year, when his barely-minted majority faces a tough Senate map, with incumbents up for re-election in states like Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. McConnell sources confirmed Tuesday that the matter is under discussion, but said there was nothing to announce at this point.”



NO, VOTER ID LAWS DIDN’T SWING THE ELECTION

NYT’s Nate Cohn pushes back on Democratic claims that voter ID laws contributed to Democratic losses in midterm votes: “the so-called margin of disenfranchisement – the number of registered voters who do not appear to have photo identification –grossly overstates the potential electoral consequences of these laws.”

DON’T MESS WITH MOM

Opening his draft notice back in 1972, Ralph Rigby planned to hop the Canadian border near his upstate New York home. But that wasn’t going to cut it with the commander in chief, his mom. Mrs. Rigby was having none of it. “You won’t have to worry about the government coming to get you,” she warned him. “I’ll come get you.” As the WSJ reports, that threat straighten the 19 year-old’s path: “So instead of avoiding the military, he ended up making a life of it. This week, Chief Rigby [now 62] is leaving his last duty station as one of the final remnants of the days when obligatory service and the Vietnam War tore apart the nation’s social fabric….Chief Rigby served six deployments to Korea, including the latest with the 2nd Infantry Division. Initially reluctant to go to war in Vietnam, he ended up fighting in the first Gulf War, then later doing two full combat tours of Afghanistan and serving another in Iraq.”

democratic_party,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/politico-caucus-hillary-clinton-campaign-more-117981.html?hp=t1_r,Dems: Hillary Clinton must campaign more,2015-05-15,"James Hohmann, Katie Glueck","Four in 10 Democratic insiders in the early states warn that Hillary Clinton is not spending enough time on the campaign trail , making her vulnerable to possible challenges from the left and dampening the enthusiasm of progressives who are already committed to her .
The ███ Caucus — our weekly bipartisan pulse-taking of the most important activists , operatives and elected officials in Iowa and New Hampshire — also finds Democrats almost evenly divided over whether Clinton needs to take a firmer position on the trade battle that ’ s gripped Washington this week , but many approve of Bill Clinton ’ s efforts to be a more silent partner in his wife ’ s campaign .
Clinton will return to Iowa and New Hampshire next week , amidst an aggressive fundraising swing . Her campaign said Thursday that the events will again be small and relatively private .
But insiders are clamoring for the former secretary of state to do more events that allow more voters to see her in person . There ’ s a pervasive belief that her campaign stops need to feel more authentic and open in order to fire up the base .
“ She needs to step it up dramatically , ” said a pro-Clinton Iowa Democrat , who — like all 77 respondents — completed the questionnaire anonymously in order to speak candidly .
“ We have this need to feel well-loved every four years , ” said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat . “ If other candidates begin to make inroads , Clinton ’ s absence will be noted . ”
Several Democrats said she should headline a rally or give a major speech soon . One key Democrat in Iowa , where she finished third in 2008 , explained that “ a big open-attendance event would go a long way because it would at least let people actually see her ” in person .
To escape the media scrum , a New Hampshire Democrat suggested Clinton show up unannounced in the less populous North Country . “ Drop in on breakfast at a couple local spots , and then let word trickle out , ” the uncommitted activist said . “ She can spend a few hours doing very normal , hassle-free retail campaigning and then hold some kind of press avail later in the day . ”
On the other hand , a lot of Democrats joked that their friends will never be satisfied no matter how much time Hillary puts in on the ground . “ There is more concern out there among Democrats than I would have thought , ” said one in New Hampshire . “ People feel freer to voice their concerns about the Big Crash that everyone thinks will happen to her campaign . ”
Some establishment Democrats think there ’ s little upside to mixing it up at this stage , and they believe that the press is obsessed only with asking gotcha questions . “ The less time she can spend on the campaign trail , the better , ” said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat . “ Events bring a lot of unwelcome attacks , ” said another . “ She ’ s on the money trail now , ” said a pro-Clinton Democrat in Iowa . “ There is time in the fall to wear out her shoes . ”
Even some who want her on the trail more note a massive influx of field staff over the past month . “ In Des Moines , I always see three or four of them meeting for coffee at the Smokey Row coffee house , ” said a Democrat , referring to local hangout . “ As a matter of fact , the O ’ Malley guy hangs out there too ! ”
Seven in 10 Republicans said Clinton spends too little time campaigning . “ But when she does , she is so horrible , dull , scripted and phony that the Hillary juggernaut should create plans to build a soundproof Rose Garden in Brooklyn , ” said a Granite Stater .
“ Just about every other day I run into a Democrat who says , ‘ Jeez , your side is having all the fun , ’ ” said an Iowan .
One-third of GOP insiders said she ’ s smart to limit her appearances .
“ She has no credible opponents , ” said a New Hampshire Republican . “ She could hibernate for the next 10 months and be totally absent from the campaign trail . And still be fine . ”
Here are eight other takeaways from this 14th edition of The ███ Caucus :
Jeb ’ s fumbling of questions about Iraq reminds insiders of Bush-name baggage .
It took until Thursday for Bush to clarify that , knowing now about intelligence failures in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq , authorized by his brother , he would not have gone to war there . Earlier this week , he dismissed that question as a “ hypothetical ” — a position that three-quarters of Republican insiders called problematic .
Several insiders think the kerfuffle will make it harder for Bush to distance himself from his brother , former President George W. Bush .
“ Pretty bad given that he ’ s already battling the Bush fatigue and dynasty issue , ” said one New Hampshire Republican .
An uncommitted Iowa Republican added , “ This would not be a big deal if he had a different last name . But since his name is Bush , it ’ s another log on the ‘ Bush Fatigue ’ fire . ”
And a New Hampshire Republican aligned with a rival camp piled on : “ It reminds everyone that he has been , is , and will be in his brother ’ s shadow , which not only raises policy concerns but also the specter of dynasty . ”
The Iraq episode also raises questions about whether Jeb ’ s ready for primetime .
Many insiders from both parties expressed disbelief that Bush wasn ’ t better-prepared to answer questions about the war in Iraq .
“ Take away whether you agree or disagree with his answer , hypothetical or not , the fact that he is so incredibly unprepared for the spotlight is very alarming , ” said one Iowa Republican who supports another candidate . “ As I answer this survey , he has changed his position for a third time . Hello ! ? ”
An unaffiliated Granite State Republican noted that New Hampshire is not a particularly hawkish state , and that the unpopularity of the war in Iraq cost Republicans a lot of New Hampshire seats , in Congress and the statehouse , back in 2006 and 2008 .
“ If there was one topic Jeb Bush needed to have a good answer on during this campaign , this was it , ” the insider said . “ More than anything , these answers from Jeb this week were a reminder for Republicans about what they disliked most about his brother . ”
On the other side of the aisle , a New Hampshire Democrat aligned with Clinton sniped , “ He has handled talking about Iraq about as well as his brother handled the actual war . Jeb Bush is the obvious frontrunner , and he is stumbling out of the gate . ”
Most Republican insiders didn ’ t think Bush did himself any harm when he recently called his brother his top adviser on U.S.-Israel policy ( though Democrats overwhelmingly did ) . But he should keep the references to his brother to a minimum , they said , and the overwhelming answer to how the former president could be helpful was through fundraising , preferably behind closed doors .
“ He ’ s a fool to use W for anything other than shaking money out of people , ” said one Iowa Republican aligned with another candidate .
A New Hampshire Democrat noted gleefully , “ Is this even a question on the Republican side ? As a Democrat , I heartily endorse the idea of George W. Bush coming to … campaign frequently for Jeb ! ”
But several respondents did note that the former president could be a helpful voice , in private , as his brother seeks to court pro-Israel and evangelical voters .
“ Those voters who support Israel know that President Bush was a staunch , unequivocating ally of the nation , ” said one unaligned New Hampshire Republican . “ That Gov . Bush is taking his cues from him is a welcome development especially since so many Jewish people believe that President Obama is capitulating to anti-Israeli interests . For example , dispatching him to smooth things over with Sheldon Adelson was a smart move . ”
As for Bill , many Democrats also want him to keep a low profile .
Most insiders see Bill Clinton as an excellent speaker who can rally the base and energize crowds . But for now , he should avoid overshadowing the actual candidate by sticking largely to fundraisers and lower-key events , they say .
“ He needs to let Hillary get out more first and set the tone of her campaign , talk about her messages and connect with voters , ” said a New Hampshire Democrat . “ Once she establishes her campaign more widely , he should sweep in on the latter half and campaign for her . He is an asset — for sure — but people also want to hear about her and her ideas . ”
Republicans , and some Democrats , noted that Bill Clinton has caused some problems for the Clinton campaign in the way he ’ s handled questions about donations to their family foundation . Staying out of the limelight for now , some said , would help .
“ He needs to be supportive and in the background , ” an Iowa Democrat said . “ So far his comments have not helped , especially when questioned about the Clinton Foundation . ”
Several noted his ability , for better and worse , to go off-script .
“ He is a huge asset to Secretary Clinton . But at the same time , his likeability comes from his brilliance and ability to speak provocatively and not without a little thrilling unpredictability , ” said one New Hampshire Democrat . “ How do you solve a problem like Bill Clinton ? He must be putting quite few gray hairs on Robby Mook ’ s little head , ” the insider continued , referring to Clinton ’ s 35-year-old campaign manager .
Another New Hampshire Democrat called for fewer speeches and more retail : “ Put a loose leash on the Big Dog , but someone definitely needs to be holding the leash . ”
Democrats are divided over whether Hillary needs to take a firmer position on trade .
About half of Democrats think Clinton must say outright whether she supports the 12-nation Pacific trade deal and giving President Barack Obama fast-track authority . She ’ s given nuanced answers that nod to both sides ; the White House has insisted that Clinton is on their side , and some opponents of the deal have said that her silence shows she ’ s with them .
As the issue blew up on Capitol Hill this week , there ’ s increasing pressure from both sides for Clinton to give a yes-or-no answer .
“ Just days ago I would have said that most voters , even most base voters , didn ’ t have [ this ] on their radar at all , ” said a New Hampshire Democrat . “ Between media coverage , candidates scrambling to stake out policy positions , and even the President sending desperate-sounding emails to try to muster grassroots support , this issue is now on the front burner . ”
“ Democrats haven ’ t forgotten that her husband , who has been referred to as ‘ Outsourcer-in-Chief , ’ is held largely responsible for NAFTA and the negative impacts of those trade agreements , ” the Democrat added . “ That puts Hillary in a difficult place . ”
Clinton allies argue that it ’ s unfair to say she hasn ’ t taken a position ; it ’ s just that she ’ s very carefully threaded the needle . Asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership recently in New Hampshire , for example , she said : “ Well , any trade deal has to produce jobs , and raise wages , and increase prosperity and protect our security . And we have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive . ”
“ Nothing wrong with Hillary not cutting POTUS off at knees , while expressing deep reservations , ” said a New Hampshire Democrat .
“ In Iowa , her base is probably divided on the issue , ” added an Iowa Democrat . “ Rural communities tend to support trade deals , while organized labor tends to oppose them . ”
Seven in 10 Republicans said she can not get away with not giving a more definitive answer .
Backing up Obama on trade would hurt Hillary ; the question is how badly .
There ’ s a sense among several leading Democratic activists in the early states that Clinton standing with Obama might encourage Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) to reconsider running .
“ Base voters would not want her to align herself with Obama on such a conservative issue , ” said an Iowa Democrat . “ All trade bills have played into the hands of conservatives in the past , and this one won ’ t be any different . ”
“ She would lose a lot of support among the base , ” said another Iowa Democrat who backs her . “ This would become a litmus test for many Democratic activists , particularly organized labor . She needs to oppose it . ”
“ It would move a non-trivial amount of support to Bernie Sanders , ” said a New Hampshire Democrat .
Clinton boosters argue that the damage would be limited because these are people who wouldn ’ t back her anyway .
“ Progressives in Iowa that have already been reluctant to support her would use this as a rallying cry , ” said an Iowa Democrat who backs her . “ I think it wouldn ’ t lose her support but would make the opposition louder . ”
“ Anyone who would be pressing Hillary on this is likely already in the Sanders/O ’ Malley/anti-Hillary faction , and they feel very awkward because they were all primary supporters of President Obama over Hillary in 2008 , ” added a New Hampshire Democrat .
Others pointed out that the last three Democratic governors of New Hampshire were pretty openly pro-free trade . “ Labor doesn ’ t have a big footprint here , and the people who are ardently opposed to the president ’ s trade agenda are unlikely to be big Clinton supporters to begin with , ” said a New Hampshire Democrat .
Despite the events of this week , the Republican base does not really care about the trade fight .
This is the first huge , public intra-party fight in a while for Democrats , but most Republican insiders said their base is not paying attention in the early states .
“ C ’ mon , there isn ’ t one voter in 100 who knows enough about these trade deals to explain them to someone else , ” said one in New Hampshire .
“ It still feels like a D.C./Beltway/K Street issue , ” said another .
“ The isolationist , [ Pat ] Buchanan wing of the party is fervently dead-set against it , but they are far outnumbered by those who favor it or don ’ t care , ” added an Iowa Republican .
Agricultural interests are big proponents of the measure , and Iowa exports over $ 15 billion a year . But an Iowa Republican noted that fights over trade seem abstract for many voters . “ Maslow ’ s hierarchy of needs is on the low end with so many security-based concerns , ” he said . “ Trade is more self-actualization to voters . ”
Paul should seize the spotlight in the Patriot Act brawl .
Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) has pledged to filibuster the reauthorization of the Patriot Act as the Senate takes up the matter again — a good move for him , at least in the more libertarian Granite State , insiders say . Nearly three-quarters of both New Hampshire Republicans and Democrats say Paul ’ s plan would help in their state .
“ This is New Hampshire . Live Free or Die ! Don ’ t tread on me , and leave my phone records alone , ” said one Granite State Democrat who said the filibuster would be an asset .
Added an unaligned New Hampshire Republican : “ It enhances his standing with a vocal minority in a field with 19 candidates . To win New Hampshire you only have to be able to count to 25 percent . ”

The POLITICO Caucus — our weekly bipartisan pulse-taking of the most important activists, operatives and elected officials in Iowa and New Hampshire — also finds Democrats almost evenly divided over whether Clinton needs to take a firmer position on the trade battle that’s gripped Washington this week, but many approve of Bill Clinton’s efforts to be a more silent partner in his wife’s campaign.

Story Continued Below

Clinton will return to Iowa and New Hampshire next week, amidst an aggressive fundraising swing. Her campaign said Thursday that the events will again be small and relatively private.

But insiders are clamoring for the former secretary of state to do more events that allow more voters to see her in person. There’s a pervasive belief that her campaign stops need to feel more authentic and open in order to fire up the base.

“She needs to step it up dramatically,” said a pro-Clinton Iowa Democrat, who — like all 77 respondents — completed the questionnaire anonymously in order to speak candidly.

“We have this need to feel well-loved every four years,” said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat. “If other candidates begin to make inroads, Clinton’s absence will be noted.”

Several Democrats said she should headline a rally or give a major speech soon. One key Democrat in Iowa, where she finished third in 2008, explained that “a big open-attendance event would go a long way because it would at least let people actually see her” in person.

To escape the media scrum, a New Hampshire Democrat suggested Clinton show up unannounced in the less populous North Country. “Drop in on breakfast at a couple local spots, and then let word trickle out,” the uncommitted activist said. “She can spend a few hours doing very normal, hassle-free retail campaigning and then hold some kind of press avail later in the day.”

On the other hand, a lot of Democrats joked that their friends will never be satisfied no matter how much time Hillary puts in on the ground. “There is more concern out there among Democrats than I would have thought,” said one in New Hampshire. “People feel freer to voice their concerns about the Big Crash that everyone thinks will happen to her campaign.”

Some establishment Democrats think there’s little upside to mixing it up at this stage, and they believe that the press is obsessed only with asking gotcha questions. “The less time she can spend on the campaign trail, the better,” said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat. “Events bring a lot of unwelcome attacks,” said another. “She’s on the money trail now,” said a pro-Clinton Democrat in Iowa. “There is time in the fall to wear out her shoes.”

Even some who want her on the trail more note a massive influx of field staff over the past month. “In Des Moines, I always see three or four of them meeting for coffee at the Smokey Row coffee house,” said a Democrat, referring to local hangout. “As a matter of fact, the O’Malley guy hangs out there too!”

Seven in 10 Republicans said Clinton spends too little time campaigning. “But when she does, she is so horrible, dull, scripted and phony that the Hillary juggernaut should create plans to build a soundproof Rose Garden in Brooklyn,” said a Granite Stater.

“Just about every other day I run into a Democrat who says, ‘Jeez, your side is having all the fun,’” said an Iowan.

One-third of GOP insiders said she’s smart to limit her appearances.

“She has no credible opponents,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “She could hibernate for the next 10 months and be totally absent from the campaign trail. And still be fine.”

Here are eight other takeaways from this 14th edition of The POLITICO Caucus:

Jeb’s fumbling of questions about Iraq reminds insiders of Bush-name baggage.

It took until Thursday for Bush to clarify that, knowing now about intelligence failures in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, authorized by his brother, he would not have gone to war there. Earlier this week, he dismissed that question as a “hypothetical” — a position that three-quarters of Republican insiders called problematic.

Several insiders think the kerfuffle will make it harder for Bush to distance himself from his brother, former President George W. Bush.

“Pretty bad given that he’s already battling the Bush fatigue and dynasty issue,” said one New Hampshire Republican.

An uncommitted Iowa Republican added, “This would not be a big deal if he had a different last name. But since his name is Bush, it’s another log on the ‘Bush Fatigue’ fire.”

And a New Hampshire Republican aligned with a rival camp piled on: “It reminds everyone that he has been, is, and will be in his brother’s shadow, which not only raises policy concerns but also the specter of dynasty.”

The Iraq episode also raises questions about whether Jeb’s ready for primetime.

Many insiders from both parties expressed disbelief that Bush wasn’t better-prepared to answer questions about the war in Iraq.

“Take away whether you agree or disagree with his answer, hypothetical or not, the fact that he is so incredibly unprepared for the spotlight is very alarming,” said one Iowa Republican who supports another candidate. “As I answer this survey, he has changed his position for a third time. Hello!?”

An unaffiliated Granite State Republican noted that New Hampshire is not a particularly hawkish state, and that the unpopularity of the war in Iraq cost Republicans a lot of New Hampshire seats, in Congress and the statehouse, back in 2006 and 2008.

“If there was one topic Jeb Bush needed to have a good answer on during this campaign, this was it,” the insider said. “More than anything, these answers from Jeb this week were a reminder for Republicans about what they disliked most about his brother.”

On the other side of the aisle, a New Hampshire Democrat aligned with Clinton sniped, “He has handled talking about Iraq about as well as his brother handled the actual war. Jeb Bush is the obvious frontrunner, and he is stumbling out of the gate.”

Use W. only in doses, and generally with donors.

Most Republican insiders didn’t think Bush did himself any harm when he recently called his brother his top adviser on U.S.-Israel policy (though Democrats overwhelmingly did). But he should keep the references to his brother to a minimum, they said, and the overwhelming answer to how the former president could be helpful was through fundraising, preferably behind closed doors.

“He’s a fool to use W for anything other than shaking money out of people,” said one Iowa Republican aligned with another candidate.

A New Hampshire Democrat noted gleefully, “Is this even a question on the Republican side? As a Democrat, I heartily endorse the idea of George W. Bush coming to … campaign frequently for Jeb!”

But several respondents did note that the former president could be a helpful voice, in private, as his brother seeks to court pro-Israel and evangelical voters.

“Those voters who support Israel know that President Bush was a staunch, unequivocating ally of the nation,” said one unaligned New Hampshire Republican. “That Gov. Bush is taking his cues from him is a welcome development especially since so many Jewish people believe that President Obama is capitulating to anti-Israeli interests. For example, dispatching him to smooth things over with Sheldon Adelson was a smart move.”

As for Bill, many Democrats also want him to keep a low profile.

Most insiders see Bill Clinton as an excellent speaker who can rally the base and energize crowds. But for now, he should avoid overshadowing the actual candidate by sticking largely to fundraisers and lower-key events, they say.

“He needs to let Hillary get out more first and set the tone of her campaign, talk about her messages and connect with voters,” said a New Hampshire Democrat. “Once she establishes her campaign more widely, he should sweep in on the latter half and campaign for her. He is an asset — for sure — but people also want to hear about her and her ideas.”

Republicans, and some Democrats, noted that Bill Clinton has caused some problems for the Clinton campaign in the way he’s handled questions about donations to their family foundation. Staying out of the limelight for now, some said, would help.

“He needs to be supportive and in the background,” an Iowa Democrat said. “So far his comments have not helped, especially when questioned about the Clinton Foundation.”

Several noted his ability, for better and worse, to go off-script.

“He is a huge asset to Secretary Clinton. But at the same time, his likeability comes from his brilliance and ability to speak provocatively and not without a little thrilling unpredictability,” said one New Hampshire Democrat. “How do you solve a problem like Bill Clinton? He must be putting quite few gray hairs on Robby Mook’s little head,” the insider continued, referring to Clinton’s 35-year-old campaign manager.

Another New Hampshire Democrat called for fewer speeches and more retail: “Put a loose leash on the Big Dog, but someone definitely needs to be holding the leash.”

Democrats are divided over whether Hillary needs to take a firmer position on trade.

About half of Democrats think Clinton must say outright whether she supports the 12-nation Pacific trade deal and giving President Barack Obama fast-track authority. She’s given nuanced answers that nod to both sides; the White House has insisted that Clinton is on their side, and some opponents of the deal have said that her silence shows she’s with them.

As the issue blew up on Capitol Hill this week, there’s increasing pressure from both sides for Clinton to give a yes-or-no answer.

“Just days ago I would have said that most voters, even most base voters, didn’t have [this] on their radar at all,” said a New Hampshire Democrat. “Between media coverage, candidates scrambling to stake out policy positions, and even the President sending desperate-sounding emails to try to muster grassroots support, this issue is now on the front burner.”

“Democrats haven’t forgotten that her husband, who has been referred to as ‘Outsourcer-in-Chief,’ is held largely responsible for NAFTA and the negative impacts of those trade agreements,” the Democrat added. “That puts Hillary in a difficult place.”

Clinton allies argue that it’s unfair to say she hasn’t taken a position; it’s just that she’s very carefully threaded the needle. Asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership recently in New Hampshire, for example, she said: “Well, any trade deal has to produce jobs, and raise wages, and increase prosperity and protect our security. And we have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive.”

“Nothing wrong with Hillary not cutting POTUS off at knees, while expressing deep reservations,” said a New Hampshire Democrat.

“In Iowa, her base is probably divided on the issue,” added an Iowa Democrat. “Rural communities tend to support trade deals, while organized labor tends to oppose them.”

Seven in 10 Republicans said she cannot get away with not giving a more definitive answer.

Backing up Obama on trade would hurt Hillary; the question is how badly.

There’s a sense among several leading Democratic activists in the early states that Clinton standing with Obama might encourage Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to reconsider running.

“Base voters would not want her to align herself with Obama on such a conservative issue,” said an Iowa Democrat. “All trade bills have played into the hands of conservatives in the past, and this one won’t be any different.”

“She would lose a lot of support among the base,” said another Iowa Democrat who backs her. “This would become a litmus test for many Democratic activists, particularly organized labor. She needs to oppose it.”

“It would move a non-trivial amount of support to Bernie Sanders,” said a New Hampshire Democrat.

Clinton boosters argue that the damage would be limited because these are people who wouldn’t back her anyway.

“Progressives in Iowa that have already been reluctant to support her would use this as a rallying cry,” said an Iowa Democrat who backs her. “I think it wouldn’t lose her support but would make the opposition louder.”

“Anyone who would be pressing Hillary on this is likely already in the Sanders/O’Malley/anti-Hillary faction, and they feel very awkward because they were all primary supporters of President Obama over Hillary in 2008,” added a New Hampshire Democrat.

Others pointed out that the last three Democratic governors of New Hampshire were pretty openly pro-free trade. “Labor doesn’t have a big footprint here, and the people who are ardently opposed to the president’s trade agenda are unlikely to be big Clinton supporters to begin with,” said a New Hampshire Democrat.

Despite the events of this week, the Republican base does not really care about the trade fight.

This is the first huge, public intra-party fight in a while for Democrats, but most Republican insiders said their base is not paying attention in the early states.

“C’mon, there isn’t one voter in 100 who knows enough about these trade deals to explain them to someone else,” said one in New Hampshire.

“It still feels like a D.C./Beltway/K Street issue,” said another.

“The isolationist, [Pat] Buchanan wing of the party is fervently dead-set against it, but they are far outnumbered by those who favor it or don’t care,” added an Iowa Republican.

Agricultural interests are big proponents of the measure, and Iowa exports over $15 billion a year. But an Iowa Republican noted that fights over trade seem abstract for many voters. “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is on the low end with so many security-based concerns,” he said. “Trade is more self-actualization to voters.”

Paul should seize the spotlight in the Patriot Act brawl.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has pledged to filibuster the reauthorization of the Patriot Act as the Senate takes up the matter again — a good move for him, at least in the more libertarian Granite State, insiders say. Nearly three-quarters of both New Hampshire Republicans and Democrats say Paul’s plan would help in their state.

“This is New Hampshire. Live Free or Die! Don’t tread on me, and leave my phone records alone,” said one Granite State Democrat who said the filibuster would be an asset.

Added an unaligned New Hampshire Republican: “It enhances his standing with a vocal minority in a field with 19 candidates. To win New Hampshire you only have to be able to count to 25 percent.”

Respondents from Iowa were more divided about whether the move would be useful: nearly as many Iowa Republicans said it would help as said a filibuster would hurt (less than one in 10 New Hampshire Republicans said the same). On the other side of the aisle, nearly half of Iowa Democrats said it would help; roughly one-tenth said it would hurt.

“He is supposed to already have the libertarian vote share his father got,” said one Iowa Republican who aligns with another candidate. “He needs to moderate his views on this so he can attract voters who are more worried about national security.”

That 's a huge missed opportunity .
Education really is a divisive issue within the Democratic Party , and one on which Hillary Clinton has indicated she might take a different tack than President Obama .
Related How schools will be different without No Child Left Behind
Last week , Obama signed a new federal education law , the Every Student Succeeds Act . For the first time in more than two decades , it will scale back the federal government 's role in education . While teachers unions and congressional Republicans both like the new law , it 's received criticism from the left from those who say that states ca n't be trusted to safeguard the well-being of poor and minority students . ( Clinton said in a statement that she supports the law , although it 's not perfect . )
This would have been the ideal jumping-off point for a question about education policy :
President Obama just signed the Every Student Succeeds Act , which keeps the standardized testing requirement from No Child Left Behind but gives states more freedom to decide which schools are succeeding , and what to do about the ones that are n't . Do you trust states to make the right decisions without federal oversight ? And how would you work within the constraints of the law to improve education in the US ?
Clinton has suggested she 'll be closer to teachers unions than Obama
K-12 education has been almost entirely absent from the 2016 campaign trail so far . But Clinton 's few public statements suggest that she might be friendlier to teachers unions than President Obama , who often antagonized unions with his competitive grant programs , support for charter schools , and push to evaluate teachers based in part on their students ' test scores .
Clinton , who has been endorsed by both major teachers unions , has suggested charter schools cherry-pick their students . She opposes tying teacher pay to their students ' test scores , saying there 's `` no evidence '' that approach works .

This is a big and important division within the Democratic Party , one that debates repeatedly miss their chance to highlight .","So far, none of the presidential debates — Democratic or Republican — have asked about K-12 education. That's a huge missed opportunity.

Education really is a divisive issue within the Democratic Party, and one on which Hillary Clinton has indicated she might take a different tack than President Obama.

Related How schools will be different without No Child Left Behind



Last week, Obama signed a new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act. For the first time in more than two decades, it will scale back the federal government's role in education. While teachers unions and congressional Republicans both like the new law, it's received criticism from the left from those who say that states can't be trusted to safeguard the well-being of poor and minority students. (Clinton said in a statement that she supports the law, although it's not perfect.)

This would have been the ideal jumping-off point for a question about education policy:

President Obama just signed the Every Student Succeeds Act, which keeps the standardized testing requirement from No Child Left Behind but gives states more freedom to decide which schools are succeeding, and what to do about the ones that aren't. Do you trust states to make the right decisions without federal oversight? And how would you work within the constraints of the law to improve education in the US?

Clinton has suggested she'll be closer to teachers unions than Obama

K-12 education has been almost entirely absent from the 2016 campaign trail so far. But Clinton's few public statements suggest that she might be friendlier to teachers unions than President Obama, who often antagonized unions with his competitive grant programs, support for charter schools, and push to evaluate teachers based in part on their students' test scores.

Clinton, who has been endorsed by both major teachers unions, has suggested charter schools cherry-pick their students. She opposes tying teacher pay to their students' test scores, saying there's ""no evidence"" that approach works. And she's said that getting more funding for traditional federal education programs, such as federal money to educate poor students and students with disabilities, would be a top priority.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has hardly talked about K-12 eduction at all. And former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley was a strong supporter of charter schools while in office.

At first expressed in whispers , but now being yelled from the rooftops by some of the party ’ s most influential figures , Ellison is being smeared as both an anti-Semite and enemy of Israel — the same smears virtually any critic of the Israeli government reflexively encounters , rendered far worse if the critic is a prominent American Muslim . Three days ago , the now ironically named Anti-Defamation League pronounced Ellison ’ s 2010 comments about Israel “ deeply disturbing and disqualifying. ” Other Israel advocates have now joined in . What are Ellison ’ s terrible sins ? He said in a 2010 speech that while he “ wanted the U.S. to be friends with Israel , ” the U.S. “ can ’ t allow another country to treat us like we ’ re their ATM . ”
Stop , you know why are we sending a mill — $ 2.8 billion dollars a year over there when they won ’ t even honor our request to stop building in East Jerusalem ? Where is the future Palestinian state going to be if it ’ s colonized before it even gets up off the ground ? … … Now you got Clinton , Biden , and the president who ’ s told them — stop . Now this has happened before . They beat back a president before . Bush 41 said — stop , and they said — we don ’ t want to stop , and by the way we want our money and we want it now . [ Ellison laughs . ] Right ? You know , I mean we can ’ t allow , we ’ re Americans , right ? We can ’ t allow another country to treat us like we ’ re their ATM . Right ? And so we ought to stand up as Americans . As the full speech makes clear , he was referring to the indisputable fact that while Israel continues to take billions of dollars every year from the U.S. — far more than any other country receives in aid — it continually disregards and violates U.S. requests to stop ongoing expansion of illegal Israeli settlements , often in ways seemingly designed to impose the greatest humiliation on its benefactor Equally sinful in the eyes of the ADL was this statement on U.S. foreign policy : The United States foreign policy in the Middle East is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people . A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million . Does that make sense ? [ A male says “ no. ” ] Is that logic ? Right ? When the people who , when the Americans who trace their roots back to those 350 million get involved , everything changes . As J.J. Goldberg of The Forward noted , Ellison wasn ’ t lamenting the insidious influence of U.S. Jews — as the ADL shamefully claimed — but rather was “ plainly describing how American Muslims could have greater influence on American policy if they learned to organize. ” And agree or disagree with those positions , it is an indisputable fact that Israel receives far more in U.S. aid than any other country yet continually does exactly that which numerous U.S. presidents have insisted it not do , often to the detriment of U.S. interests . And many prominent foreign policy experts — including David Petraeus — have warned that excessive U.S. support for the worst actions of the Israeli government endangers U.S. national security by alienating Arabs in the region and fueling support for anti-American terrorism . The idea that a member of Congress is not permitted to debate these policies without being branded an anti-Semite is sheer insanity : malicious insanity at that . But that insanity is par for the course in Washington , where anyone who even questions U.S. policy toward Israel is smeared in this way — from James Baker to Howard Dean to Bernie Sanders and even Donald Trump . So pernicious is this framework that the U.S. Senate just passed legislation expressly equating what it regards as unfair criticism of the Israeli government with “ anti-Semitism. ” And when one is an American Muslim , ugly stereotypes and pervasive Islamophobia are added to this toxic brew to make the smears worse by many magnitudes . This smear campaign against Ellison received a major boost Friday night when the single largest funder of both the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign , the Israeli-American billionaire Haim Saban , said at the Brookings Institution , a part of which he funds : “ If you go back to his positions , his papers , his speeches , the way he has voted , he is clearly an anti-Semite and anti-Israel individual. ” Saban added : “ Keith Ellison would be a disaster for the relationship between the Jewish community and the Democratic Party . ”
That Saban plays such a vital role in Democratic Party politics says a great deal . To the New York Times , this is how he described himself : “ I ’ m a one-issue guy and my issue is Israel. ” In late 2015 , Ali Gharib wrote in The Forward : “ Saban ’ s top priority isn ’ t a liberal vision of American life . It ’ s Israel. ” When Hillary Clinton in 2015 condemned the boycott movement aimed at ending Israeli settlements , she did it in the form of a letter addressed personally to Saban . The Democratic Party ’ s central reliance on billionaire funders like Saban is a key reason that debates over Israel policy are not permitted within the party . It ’ s why any attempt to raise such issues will prompt systematic campaigns of reputation destruction like the one we ’ re witnessing with Ellison . To get a sense for just how prohibited the most benign and basic debates are when it comes to Israel , consider the quotes from Ellison ’ s college days dug up by CNN as supposedly incriminating . In 1990 , while a law student at the University of Minnesota , Ellison blasted the university president for condemning a speaking event featuring the anti-Zionist civil rights icon Kwame Ture ( also known as Stokely Carmichael ) ; Ellison ’ s argument was that all ideas , including Zionism , should be regarded as debatable in a college environment : The University ’ s position appears to be this : Political Zionism is off-limits no matter what dubious circumstances Israel was founded under ; no matter what the Zionists do to the Palestinians ; and no matter what wicked regimes Israel allies itself with — like South Africa . This position is untenable . In other words , Ellison — 26 years ago , while a student — simply argued that college campuses should not be deemed “ safe spaces ” in which debates over Israel are barred : an utterly mainstream view when the topic to be debated is something other than Israel . Leave aside the bizarre attempt to use someone ’ s college-aged political activism against them three decades later . As my colleague Zaid Jilani very ably documented several days ago , even the most inflammatory of Ellison ’ s campus statements — including his long-ago-renounced praise for the Nation of Islam — were grounded in righteous opposition to “ white supremacy and the policies of the state of Israel ” and “ show him expressing sympathy for the plight of underprivileged whites and making clear that he was not antagonistic toward Jewish people. ” Writing about the smear campaign circulating on the internet against Ellison , The Forward ’ s Goldberg said he found “ the evidence to be either frivolous , distorted or simply false. ” As CNN itself acknowledged when digging up these old Ellison quotes : “ None of the records reviewed found examples of Ellison making any anti-Semitic comments himself. ” How is that , by itself , not the end of the controversy ? The reason why it isn ’ t is a glaring irony . With the advent of Donald Trump and policies such as banning all Muslims from the country , Democrats this year incorporated anti-Islamophobia rhetoric into their repertoire . Yet what is being done to Ellison by the ADL , Saban , and others is Islamophobia in its purest and most classic form . Faiz Shakir is a senior adviser to Harry Reid who previously worked for Nancy Pelosi and the ThinkProgress blog at the Center for American Progress . He explains , from personal experience , that the vile treatment to which Ellison is now being subjected is common for American Muslims in political life :
Keith Ellison is being smeared like so many before him . If you 're Muslim in public life or even sympathetic to Muslim concerns , watch out ! — Faiz ( @ fshakir ) December 3 , 2016
I was literally called a terrorist by a right-wing publication when I joined @ NanyPelosi 's office . https : //t.co/pf5ChX1nyE — Faiz ( @ fshakir ) December 3 , 2016

A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. Does that make sense? [A male says “no.”] Is that logic? Right? When the people who, when the Americans who trace their roots back to those 350 million get involved, everything changes. As J.J. Goldberg of The Forward noted, Ellison wasn’t lamenting the insidious influence of U.S. Jews — as the ADL shamefully claimed — but rather was “plainly describing how American Muslims could have greater influence on American policy if they learned to organize.” And agree or disagree with those positions, it is an indisputable fact that Israel receives far more in U.S. aid than any other country yet continually does exactly that which numerous U.S. presidents have insisted it not do, often to the detriment of U.S. interests. And many prominent foreign policy experts — including David Petraeus — have warned that excessive U.S. support for the worst actions of the Israeli government endangers U.S. national security by alienating Arabs in the region and fueling support for anti-American terrorism. The idea that a member of Congress is not permitted to debate these policies without being branded an anti-Semite is sheer insanity: malicious insanity at that. But that insanity is par for the course in Washington, where anyone who even questions U.S. policy toward Israel is smeared in this way — from James Baker to Howard Dean to Bernie Sanders and even Donald Trump. So pernicious is this framework that the U.S. Senate just passed legislation expressly equating what it regards as unfair criticism of the Israeli government with “anti-Semitism.” And when one is an American Muslim, ugly stereotypes and pervasive Islamophobia are added to this toxic brew to make the smears worse by many magnitudes. This smear campaign against Ellison received a major boost Friday night when the single largest funder of both the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Israeli-American billionaire Haim Saban, said at the Brookings Institution, a part of which he funds: “If you go back to his positions, his papers, his speeches, the way he has voted, he is clearly an anti-Semite and anti-Israel individual.” Saban added: “Keith Ellison would be a disaster for the relationship between the Jewish community and the Democratic Party.”

That Saban plays such a vital role in Democratic Party politics says a great deal. To the New York Times, this is how he described himself: “I’m a one-issue guy and my issue is Israel.” In late 2015, Ali Gharib wrote in The Forward: “Saban’s top priority isn’t a liberal vision of American life. It’s Israel.” When Hillary Clinton in 2015 condemned the boycott movement aimed at ending Israeli settlements, she did it in the form of a letter addressed personally to Saban. The Democratic Party’s central reliance on billionaire funders like Saban is a key reason that debates over Israel policy are not permitted within the party. It’s why any attempt to raise such issues will prompt systematic campaigns of reputation destruction like the one we’re witnessing with Ellison. To get a sense for just how prohibited the most benign and basic debates are when it comes to Israel, consider the quotes from Ellison’s college days dug up by CNN as supposedly incriminating. In 1990, while a law student at the University of Minnesota, Ellison blasted the university president for condemning a speaking event featuring the anti-Zionist civil rights icon Kwame Ture (also known as Stokely Carmichael); Ellison’s argument was that all ideas, including Zionism, should be regarded as debatable in a college environment: The University’s position appears to be this: Political Zionism is off-limits no matter what dubious circumstances Israel was founded under; no matter what the Zionists do to the Palestinians; and no matter what wicked regimes Israel allies itself with — like South Africa. This position is untenable. In other words, Ellison — 26 years ago, while a student — simply argued that college campuses should not be deemed “safe spaces” in which debates over Israel are barred: an utterly mainstream view when the topic to be debated is something other than Israel. Leave aside the bizarre attempt to use someone’s college-aged political activism against them three decades later. As my colleague Zaid Jilani very ably documented several days ago, even the most inflammatory of Ellison’s campus statements — including his long-ago-renounced praise for the Nation of Islam — were grounded in righteous opposition to “white supremacy and the policies of the state of Israel” and “show him expressing sympathy for the plight of underprivileged whites and making clear that he was not antagonistic toward Jewish people.” Writing about the smear campaign circulating on the internet against Ellison, The Forward’s Goldberg said he found “the evidence to be either frivolous, distorted or simply false.” As CNN itself acknowledged when digging up these old Ellison quotes: “None of the records reviewed found examples of Ellison making any anti-Semitic comments himself.” How is that, by itself, not the end of the controversy? The reason why it isn’t is a glaring irony. With the advent of Donald Trump and policies such as banning all Muslims from the country, Democrats this year incorporated anti-Islamophobia rhetoric into their repertoire. Yet what is being done to Ellison by the ADL, Saban, and others is Islamophobia in its purest and most classic form. Faiz Shakir is a senior adviser to Harry Reid who previously worked for Nancy Pelosi and the ThinkProgress blog at the Center for American Progress. He explains, from personal experience, that the vile treatment to which Ellison is now being subjected is common for American Muslims in political life:

Keith Ellison is being smeared like so many before him. If you're Muslim in public life or even sympathetic to Muslim concerns, watch out! — Faiz (@fshakir) December 3, 2016

I was literally called a terrorist by a right-wing publication when I joined @NanyPelosi's office. https://t.co/pf5ChX1nyE — Faiz (@fshakir) December 3, 2016

At @thinkprogress, we were absurdly labeled anti-Semitic because we supported Obama admin stances. That cheapens ""anti-semitic"" charge — Faiz (@fshakir) December 3, 2016

Just Google what Frank Gaffney was saying about Suhail Khan and Faisal Gill in the Bush White House. — Faiz (@fshakir) December 3, 2016

See how even @GroverNorquist has been unfairly treated by right-wing smear agents because of who he's married to. — Faiz (@fshakir) December 3, 2016

Now it's Ellison's turn. At some point, this has to stop. So glad @SenSchumer, @rweingarten, others are not backing down to pressure. — Faiz (@fshakir) December 3, 2016",www.theintercept.com,left,YUhzYB9BBUwYoSqc

His late entry will create added difficulties as he seeks to build a campaign infrastructure and support in key states .
“ I ’ m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America . We can not afford four more years of President Trump ’ s reckless and unethical actions , ” ███ said in a statement announcing his candidacy . “ If he wins another term in office , we may never recover from the damage . ”
He reconsidered his earlier decision not to run in 2020 as he saw the Democratic field struggling to produce a front-runner to take on Trump , with none of the current leading contenders able to break out of the pack .
███ is the founder and majority owner of ███ LP , the parent company of ███ News . He served as New York ’ s mayor for three terms and now funds a global philanthropic arm .
In his announcement video , ███ portrayed himself as no-nonsense business and government leader , who created jobs at his own company , helped rebuild New York City after the Sept. 11 attacks and threw himself behind the biggest challenges facing the country , including climate change and gun control . ███ founded Everytown for Gun Safety and Beyond Carbon on the climate front , and his announcement said that he has given $ 10 billion to charitable causes and that ███ Philanthropies works in 129 countries .
At the same time , ███ faces significant hurdles in the campaign , including his late start and questions about why a billionaire and former Republican with a past career on Wall Street should be the standard-bearer for a party whose base increasingly is moving to the left , with young , diverse voters often skeptical of big business .
███ has been sharply at odds with many of the key ideas driving the Democratic party ’ s progressive base , opposing a tax on wealth and Medicare for All plans backed by senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .
Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the re-election effort was ready for ███ ’ s entry .
“ It ’ s not that Michael ███ may be unwelcome by the national electorate . It ’ s , is he welcome in his own Democratic primary ? ” Conway said on CBS ’ s “ Face the Nation . ”
Former Vice President Joe Biden entered the race as the front-runner , but he has struggled to raise money and at 77 , has faced questions about his age , verbal gaffes and other out-of-step comments . Pete Buttigieg , the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend , Indiana , has broken into a solid lead in Iowa with similarly centrist views , but lags in single digits in national polls and in predominantly non-white areas . That has potentially created an opening for ███ with centrist Democratic voters looking for someone who can defeat Trump .
Warren and Sanders have cemented their positions in the top tier of candidates but also raised concerns in the party that moving too far left would ensure Trump ’ s re-election .
███ spent more than $ 100 million to help Democrats take control of the U.S. House in 2018 . He plans to finance his own campaign , he said .
Refusing donations means that ███ will not qualify for any debates regulated by the Democratic Party , which has required candidates to meet a certain threshold of donations and polling numbers .
“ If that changes and we meet the eligibility requirements , we would gladly participate , ” campaign spokesman Jason Schechter said .
███ ’ s campaign announced a record-setting ad buy late last week , topping $ 34 million . That fueled criticism from some about self-funding a presidential campaign .
“ We do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections , '' Sanders tweeted on Sunday . `` That is why multi-billionaires like Michael ███ are not going to get very far in this election . ''
And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee , which supports Warren , called ███ `` the human embodiment of Elizabeth Warren ’ s core case for being president . ''
In addition , ███ already made plans to spend $ 100 million on a digital advertising campaign against Trump in the battleground states of Arizona , Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin . He also announced plans to spend another $ 15 million to $ 20 million to register voters in competitive states .
When ███ was mayor , Republicans derided his efforts to limit the consumption of sugary drinks as a “ Big-Gulp ban ” and a symbol of government overreach . His support of a “ stop-and-frisk ” policing policy as mayor has been criticized for targeting blacks and Hispanics , key Democratic constituencies .
Last week , ███ apologized for the “ stop-and-frisk ” policy in a speech to the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn .
The campaign website ███ launched Sunday includes a biographical video and touts his work to stop gun violence and climate change . It says , “ But now , he sees a different kind of menace coming from Washington , so there ’ s no stopping here . ”
The video says everyone should have access to health insurance and “ everyone who likes theirs can go ahead and keep it. ” It also says the wealthy will pay more in taxes , the struggling middle class “ will get their fair share ” and jobs will be created “ that let you get ahead . ”
Biden addressed the new rival in a CNN interview that aired Friday .
“ I welcome the competition , ” he said . “ Watch me . Watch me . The idea that I ’ m not in better shape than Mayor ███ physically and otherwise ? ”
His late entry into the race gives him little time to catch up , so ███ plans to adopt an untested approach . He plans to bypass the first four contests in Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina – the traditional route to the nomination . Instead , he will focus on California and the other delegate-rich U.S. states voting in the March 3 Super Tuesday contests and later .","LISTEN TO ARTICLE 5:42 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced he is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, offering his own mix of moderate policy stances and experience in business, government and philanthropy as the way to beat President Donald Trump.

Bloomberg, 77, called Trump “an existential threat to our country and our values” as he joined a crowded field of candidates, with fewer than three months before the Iowa caucuses. His late entry will create added difficulties as he seeks to build a campaign infrastructure and support in key states.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” Bloomberg said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.”

He reconsidered his earlier decision not to run in 2020 as he saw the Democratic field struggling to produce a front-runner to take on Trump, with none of the current leading contenders able to break out of the pack.

Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. He served as New York’s mayor for three terms and now funds a global philanthropic arm.

In his announcement video, Bloomberg portrayed himself as no-nonsense business and government leader, who created jobs at his own company, helped rebuild New York City after the Sept. 11 attacks and threw himself behind the biggest challenges facing the country, including climate change and gun control. Bloomberg founded Everytown for Gun Safety and Beyond Carbon on the climate front, and his announcement said that he has given $10 billion to charitable causes and that Bloomberg Philanthropies works in 129 countries.

At the same time, Bloomberg faces significant hurdles in the campaign, including his late start and questions about why a billionaire and former Republican with a past career on Wall Street should be the standard-bearer for a party whose base increasingly is moving to the left, with young, diverse voters often skeptical of big business.

Bloomberg has been sharply at odds with many of the key ideas driving the Democratic party’s progressive base, opposing a tax on wealth and Medicare for All plans backed by senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the re-election effort was ready for Bloomberg’s entry.

“It’s not that Michael Bloomberg may be unwelcome by the national electorate. It’s, is he welcome in his own Democratic primary?” Conway said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden entered the race as the front-runner, but he has struggled to raise money and at 77, has faced questions about his age, verbal gaffes and other out-of-step comments. Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has broken into a solid lead in Iowa with similarly centrist views, but lags in single digits in national polls and in predominantly non-white areas. That has potentially created an opening for Bloomberg with centrist Democratic voters looking for someone who can defeat Trump.

Warren and Sanders have cemented their positions in the top tier of candidates but also raised concerns in the party that moving too far left would ensure Trump’s re-election.

Bloomberg spent more than $100 million to help Democrats take control of the U.S. House in 2018. He plans to finance his own campaign, he said.

Refusing donations means that Bloomberg will not qualify for any debates regulated by the Democratic Party, which has required candidates to meet a certain threshold of donations and polling numbers.

“If that changes and we meet the eligibility requirements, we would gladly participate,” campaign spokesman Jason Schechter said.

Bloomberg’s campaign announced a record-setting ad buy late last week, topping $34 million. That fueled criticism from some about self-funding a presidential campaign.

“We do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections,"" Sanders tweeted on Sunday. ""That is why multi-billionaires like Michael Bloomberg are not going to get very far in this election.""

And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which supports Warren, called Bloomberg ""the human embodiment of Elizabeth Warren’s core case for being president.""

In addition, Bloomberg already made plans to spend $100 million on a digital advertising campaign against Trump in the battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He also announced plans to spend another $15 million to $20 million to register voters in competitive states.

When Bloomberg was mayor, Republicans derided his efforts to limit the consumption of sugary drinks as a “Big-Gulp ban” and a symbol of government overreach. His support of a “stop-and-frisk” policing policy as mayor has been criticized for targeting blacks and Hispanics, key Democratic constituencies.

Last week, Bloomberg apologized for the “stop-and-frisk” policy in a speech to the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn.

The campaign website Bloomberg launched Sunday includes a biographical video and touts his work to stop gun violence and climate change. It says, “But now, he sees a different kind of menace coming from Washington, so there’s no stopping here.”

The video says everyone should have access to health insurance and “everyone who likes theirs can go ahead and keep it.” It also says the wealthy will pay more in taxes, the struggling middle class “will get their fair share” and jobs will be created “that let you get ahead.”

Biden addressed the new rival in a CNN interview that aired Friday.

“I welcome the competition,” he said. “Watch me. Watch me. The idea that I’m not in better shape than Mayor Bloomberg physically and otherwise?”

His late entry into the race gives him little time to catch up, so Bloomberg plans to adopt an untested approach. He plans to bypass the first four contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – the traditional route to the nomination. Instead, he will focus on California and the other delegate-rich U.S. states voting in the March 3 Super Tuesday contests and later.",www.bloomberg.com,center,zmh6iOIXaFg7oUsz

“Hey man, it's only the future of the world in your hands,” Obama joked with Perez in one conversation, according to a DNC aide.

Obama’s former political adviser David Simas, who is now the CEO of the Obama Foundation, has also been making a string of calls to DNC officials in recent months.

Sources familiar with Obama’s meetings with members of Congress declined to offer the names of all of the lawmakers he has met with, saying the sessions were meant to be private.

The meetings and calls have come at a time when the Democratic Party, still reeling from the stunning 2016 presidential election loss, is searching for leadership.

As the party attempts to rebuild, Democrats find themselves in an identity crisis, still trying to figure out how they lost white working-class voters and the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin to President Trump.

A string of disappointing House special election losses has contributed to a sense of unease, and left Democrats questioning some of their leaders — particularly House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).

One source close to the former president said that while Obama wants to provide space for new leadership in the party to step in, he also wants to be “an available resource” for those drafting the Democratic message.

With Perez, the men discussed the outlines of the party's future. With others, he has discussed policy.

Obama — known for his ability to reach various segments of the Democratic Party — has talked about bridging the party’s current divide by explaining policy nuance in story form.

Obama's post-presidency office would not comment for this story.

The former president is expected to stay out of the political fray for now, sources familiar with his planning say, but he will begin emerging on the fundraising circuit and on the stump for candidates including Ralph Northam, the Democrat running for governor of Virginia, in the fall.

Because of this , the Democratic side of the race is going through a lurching transition .
Until very recently , it was a model primary . The establishment candidate was being challenged by an insurgent , who was pulling her left on a few key issues . It was all issues-based , above the belt , a good warmup for Clinton and a healthy set of debates for the party .
But now Sanders has built organization and momentum that make him more than a protest candidate . There 's a chance he could win . He 's a real candidate now .
There 's a great deal that goes along with that transition , not all of which has been fully digested yet by the US body politic . Here are three obvious implications :
The gloves are going to come off , as the Clinton camp 's somewhat desperate recent attacks show , and the contest is going to get dumber and uglier . As Matt Yglesias and Ezra Klein have both argued , Sanders is now going to be pressed to make his policy proposals a lot less hand-wavey and aspirational , a lot more like real governing plans with real trade-offs . Electability is going to come to the fore , in a way it has n't yet .
But there 's a fourth implication I have n't seen clearly articulated anywhere , so I want to lay it out . To put it bluntly , Sanders 's transition from protest to serious candidate raises a new question about him and Clinton , namely : Who would be better at being president ?
It sounds simple , but it was n't really a test Sanders had to pass before , so it 's not yet been a serious point of comparison between the two . Now it is a relevant question , and worth digging into a little . Answering it depends on clarifying exactly what kind of job a Democratic presidency would be in 2016 .
Clinton and Sanders are not nearly as far apart on policy as both sides would currently have us believe , as Jonathan Cohn argued in a recent column . And the differences between them pale next to their shared differences with any Republican in the race ( hence electability becoming the dominant question ) .
What 's more , Cohn points out , both would spend their time in office staving off Republicans , not passing their dream bills .
In 2016 , barring some truly disruptive political event ( which , who knows , Trump may prove to be ) , Republicans are going to keep control of the House of Representatives . They may keep control of the Senate as well , though that 's less certain , but all they need to block any hope of an expansive legislative agenda is the House , something Obama has learned over and over again .
So there will be no single-payer health care , no national carbon tax , no free college , no reparations . Given the current disposition of the Republican Party , it will be a miracle if regular-order business like budgets and debt ceiling bills can get through — if the government can keep functioning at all .
On legislation , the next Democratic president ( if there is one ) will mostly play defense , using the filibuster or , if necessary , the veto pen .
What progress there is on domestic policy will come from inventive , assertive use of executive power and smart appointments , both judicial and administrative .
To see how that works , Sanders and Clinton can consult the current officeholder . For his entire term in office , Obama has faced a stark and unprecedented degree of obstructionism . For the last six years , legislation , certainly legislation of any ambition or scope , was , with a few rare exceptions , impossible .
It took him a while , but he learned to make the best of it . He got good at it , as his record of accomplishment shows .
But getting good at it took a particular disposition and set of skills .
As Ezra Klein points out , Obama won on policy but lost on politics . He got a lot done , but it cost him ; polarization remains more poisonous than ever .
I think the right way to phrase it , though , is that Obama won on policy because he lost on politics , or , rather , because he was willing to lose on politics .
Even as their obstruction has hardened into dogma , Republicans have retained a talent for manipulating the levers of Washington opinion , which are designed around a ) the presumption of party symmetry , and b ) an overwhelming focus on the president as the center of political gravity .
If his party 's agenda is unable to attract Republican votes , it is assumed to be the president 's fault . He would n't meet in the middle , would n't compromise .
If political polarization and hostility remain dominant in Washington , it 's assumed to be the president 's fault . He should have called John Boehner more , schmoozed more .
If a policy passes on a party-line vote , or through unilateral use of executive action , it is assumed to be the work of a power-mad tyrant .
This is n't just a media thing . The public , too , shares a strong heuristic that bipartisanship is a signal of wisdom , or at least acceptability . Mitch McConnell was quite canny in exploiting it , recognizing its power before Obama was even sworn in . As he famously said in an interview about Obamacare :
It was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the [ health care ] bill were able to say it was bipartisan , it tended to convey to the public that this is OK , they must have figured it out . It ’ s either bipartisan or it isn ’ t .
That 's why he and other Republican leaders agreed , before Obama walked into the White House , that they would oppose his every move in a unified front .
If even a few Republicans strayed , it would lend Obama 's efforts the aura of bipartisanship . Whereas if Republicans stayed united and just a few Dems strayed , suddenly it was Obama 's opposition that was bipartisan , a crucial public relations advantage .
The media also exploits this heuristic , as does the permanent Washington political class . There is a powerful incentive , so built-in it 's almost beyond notice , for the president to chase the approval of Washington 's Very Serious People ( VSPs ) by uniting Red and Blue America , or at least by being seen making the attempt .
The incentive certainly works on many congressional Democrats , who spend much of their time in a defensive crouch , cowering from anything controversial , including Obamacare and Obama .
As long as Republicans kept Obama chasing after that approval and yanking it away at the last minute like Lucy with her football , they were able to effectively neutralize him . It was only after his reelection and — improbably — the Republican gains of the 2014 midterms that Obama finally gave up on it for good .
That 's when he developed his rhymes-with-bucket list and got to work . And he has racked up wins ever since , breaking the second-term curse in spectacular fashion .
What it takes to succeed as a Democratic president these days
Obama 's success has required two things . One is the self-possession and confidence to weather the disapproval of VSPs and the mau-mauing of Republican opponents . ( A big part of this is settling on the right advisers for the inner circle . )
The second is a good sense of the executive machinery and how it might be deployed to positive effect . Most of Obama 's second-term domestic victories have been bureaucratic : getting the military to sign off on LGBTQ soldiers and female combat troops , finding new ways to extend the Clean Air Act , raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers , and the like .
( One area where Obama has often been criticized is in his lack of attention to appointments , which will be crucial to the next president 's success . There is something to this criticism , though Obama 's effect on the federal bureaucracy is often underestimated . )
Determining where executive powers can be pushed , how to bring the bureaucracy along , the best way to structure new rules to make them resilient , the savviest people to run executive agencies and sit on the bench — these are all distinct skills .
Obama made progress through means the media and the public found unfamiliar and somewhat discomfiting , while facing a right-wing politico-media machine bent above all on denying him credit for anything . He won policy but lost politics .
For the left , that is vastly preferable to the inverse . Democrats would be lucky to replicate it .
Time to compare the candidates based on how well they 'd do what they could actually do
Which brings us back to Clinton and Sanders . If they are both serious candidates for president , then they should be treated like job candidates , evaluated on the qualities that are likely to affect their performance .
How liberal they are willing to talk during a primary is not one of those qualities . Their opinions on single-payer health care are not hugely relevant , nor are their stances on breaking up big banks , carbon taxes , serious gun control , or reparations for slavery .
How they talk about these aspirational issues can tell us something about their priorities , of course . But in practice , they are going to be hemmed in to the point that circumstances , more than priorities , will dictate opportunities .
Success , then , will come from seizing those opportunities when they arise , and making the most of them . It will come from understanding and manipulating the levers of the bureaucracy , from being ruthless about taking incremental wins wherever they can be found , from taking the long view and not overreacting to the hysterical , endless fluctuations in elite DC opinion .
These are dark arts . It 's difficult to predict who might master them .
Clinton seems more likely to forfeit opportunities through an overabundance of caution . Sanders seems more likely to forfeit them through cluelessness about how to run a giant administrative bureaucracy .
Clinton seems more likely to appoint establishment-friendly figures to run her government and cautious centrists to the bench . Sanders seems more likely to get mired in endless , energy-sapping confirmation battles .
Clinton seems more likely to surround herself with a bubble of insiders . Sanders seems more likely to rely on a `` political revolution '' that is unlikely to endure once he takes office .
And to make matters more obscure for voters , neither is willing to talk about these things directly . Admitting that your presidency will mostly be a rearguard battle , a unilateral executive grind , is not attractive politics . It does n't make for fun campaign rallies .
But these qualities matter far more , in concrete terms , than the boldness of the candidates ' plans or the inspirational quality of their rhetoric .
Even though idealistic Democratic primary voters may not want to hear it , when it comes to domestic policy , the Democratic contest is about who will be best at securing Obama 's accomplishments against Republican attack , exploiting incremental advances when they become possible , and manipulating the personalities and power centers inside Washington .
It 's about who will be the best grinder . That 's not the job the candidates , the media , and the public are talking about , but it 's the job Democrats are hiring a president to do .","Hillary Clinton and her supporters are getting worried about Bernie Sanders and his.

It's pretty obvious why:

Because of this, the Democratic side of the race is going through a lurching transition.

Now it is a relevant question, and worth digging into a little. Answering it depends on clarifying exactly what kind of job a Democratic presidency would be in 2016.

A Democratic president will get no cooperation from Congress

Clinton and Sanders are not nearly as far apart on policy as both sides would currently have us believe, as Jonathan Cohn argued in a recent column. And the differences between them pale next to their shared differences with any Republican in the race (hence electability becoming the dominant question).

What's more, Cohn points out, both would spend their time in office staving off Republicans, not passing their dream bills.

The last point is worth expanding.

What progress there is on domestic policy will come from inventive, assertive use of executive power and smart appointments, both judicial and administrative.

Obama learned to succeed with no help

To see how that works, Sanders and Clinton can consult the current officeholder. For his entire term in office, Obama has faced a stark and unprecedented degree of obstructionism. For the last six years, legislation, certainly legislation of any ambition or scope, was, with a few rare exceptions, impossible.

It took him a while, but he learned to make the best of it. He got good at it, as his record of accomplishment shows.

But getting good at it took a particular disposition and set of skills.

As Ezra Klein points out, Obama won on policy but lost on politics. He got a lot done, but it cost him; polarization remains more poisonous than ever.

I think the right way to phrase it, though, is that Obama won on policy because he lost on politics, or, rather, because he was willing to lose on politics.

Even as their obstruction has hardened into dogma, Republicans have retained a talent for manipulating the levers of Washington opinion, which are designed around a) the presumption of party symmetry, and b) an overwhelming focus on the president as the center of political gravity.

If his party's agenda is unable to attract Republican votes, it is assumed to be the president's fault. He wouldn't meet in the middle, wouldn't compromise.

If political polarization and hostility remain dominant in Washington, it's assumed to be the president's fault. He should have called John Boehner more, schmoozed more.

If a policy passes on a party-line vote, or through unilateral use of executive action, it is assumed to be the work of a power-mad tyrant.

This isn't just a media thing. The public, too, shares a strong heuristic that bipartisanship is a signal of wisdom, or at least acceptability. Mitch McConnell was quite canny in exploiting it, recognizing its power before Obama was even sworn in. As he famously said in an interview about Obamacare:

It was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the [health care] bill were able to say it was bipartisan, it tended to convey to the public that this is OK, they must have figured it out. It’s either bipartisan or it isn’t.

That's why he and other Republican leaders agreed, before Obama walked into the White House, that they would oppose his every move in a unified front.

If even a few Republicans strayed, it would lend Obama's efforts the aura of bipartisanship. Whereas if Republicans stayed united and just a few Dems strayed, suddenly it was Obama's opposition that was bipartisan, a crucial public relations advantage.

The media also exploits this heuristic, as does the permanent Washington political class. There is a powerful incentive, so built-in it's almost beyond notice, for the president to chase the approval of Washington's Very Serious People (VSPs) by uniting Red and Blue America, or at least by being seen making the attempt.

The incentive certainly works on many congressional Democrats, who spend much of their time in a defensive crouch, cowering from anything controversial, including Obamacare and Obama.

As long as Republicans kept Obama chasing after that approval and yanking it away at the last minute like Lucy with her football, they were able to effectively neutralize him. It was only after his reelection and — improbably — the Republican gains of the 2014 midterms that Obama finally gave up on it for good.

That's when he developed his rhymes-with-bucket list and got to work. And he has racked up wins ever since, breaking the second-term curse in spectacular fashion.

What it takes to succeed as a Democratic president these days

Obama's success has required two things. One is the self-possession and confidence to weather the disapproval of VSPs and the mau-mauing of Republican opponents. (A big part of this is settling on the right advisers for the inner circle.)

The second is a good sense of the executive machinery and how it might be deployed to positive effect. Most of Obama's second-term domestic victories have been bureaucratic: getting the military to sign off on LGBTQ soldiers and female combat troops, finding new ways to extend the Clean Air Act, raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers, and the like.

(One area where Obama has often been criticized is in his lack of attention to appointments, which will be crucial to the next president's success. There is something to this criticism, though Obama's effect on the federal bureaucracy is often underestimated.)

Determining where executive powers can be pushed, how to bring the bureaucracy along, the best way to structure new rules to make them resilient, the savviest people to run executive agencies and sit on the bench — these are all distinct skills.

Obama made progress through means the media and the public found unfamiliar and somewhat discomfiting, while facing a right-wing politico-media machine bent above all on denying him credit for anything. He won policy but lost politics.

For the left, that is vastly preferable to the inverse. Democrats would be lucky to replicate it.

Time to compare the candidates based on how well they'd do what they could actually do

Which brings us back to Clinton and Sanders. If they are both serious candidates for president, then they should be treated like job candidates, evaluated on the qualities that are likely to affect their performance.

How liberal they are willing to talk during a primary is not one of those qualities. Their opinions on single-payer health care are not hugely relevant, nor are their stances on breaking up big banks, carbon taxes, serious gun control, or reparations for slavery.

It will come from understanding and manipulating the levers of the bureaucracy, from being ruthless about taking incremental wins wherever they can be found, from taking the long view and not overreacting to the hysterical, endless fluctuations in elite DC opinion.

These are dark arts. It's difficult to predict who might master them.

Clinton seems more likely to forfeit opportunities through an overabundance of caution. Sanders seems more likely to forfeit them through cluelessness about how to run a giant administrative bureaucracy.

Clinton seems more likely to appoint establishment-friendly figures to run her government and cautious centrists to the bench. Sanders seems more likely to get mired in endless, energy-sapping confirmation battles.

Clinton seems more likely to surround herself with a bubble of insiders. Sanders seems more likely to rely on a ""political revolution"" that is unlikely to endure once he takes office.

And to make matters more obscure for voters, neither is willing to talk about these things directly. Admitting that your presidency will mostly be a rearguard battle, a unilateral executive grind, is not attractive politics. It doesn't make for fun campaign rallies.

But these qualities matter far more, in concrete terms, than the boldness of the candidates' plans or the inspirational quality of their rhetoric.

Even though idealistic Democratic primary voters may not want to hear it, when it comes to domestic policy, the Democratic contest is about who will be best at securing Obama's accomplishments against Republican attack, exploiting incremental advances when they become possible, and manipulating the personalities and power centers inside Washington.

It's about who will be the best grinder. That's not the job the candidates, the media, and the public are talking about, but it's the job Democrats are hiring a president to do.",www.vox.com,left,iJIxRTkuMWlvO4jN

The GOP may be in the midst of an identity crisis, but the Democratic Party is also facing a political crisis that could be made a lot worse if it doesn't win the White House in November.

Here's why:

Part of President Obama's legacy is the health of his party. He's had many successes in office — health care reform, climate change regulations, Wall Street reform — but his legacy will also include one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.

Every president sees his party lose hundreds of positions — it's the price a party holding the White House pays — but no president has come close to Obama. During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.

When Obama took office, there were 60 Democratic senators; now there are 46. The number of House seats held by Democrats has shrunk from 257 to 188.

There are now nine fewer Democratic governors than in 2009. Democrats currently hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the 1920s.

How did this happen?

1. There are two different electorates in America

There is Presidential Election America, where turnout is diverse. The electorate is younger, browner, more single, more secular — more Democratic. Then there's Midterm Election America, where the electorate is older, whiter, more rural, more church-going — in other words, more Republican. What's great for Republicans and bad for Democrats is that the vast majority of the governorships and state legislative seats are elected in the midterms.

And those positions are the seed corn for a party — they're the farm teams for higher-level offices. Right now the Democrats are at a very low ebb.

This is something President Obama lamented when he campaigned for Democrats in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014. Republicans manage to turn out their voters every two years, but Democrats, for some reason, only turn their voters out every four. Maybe, Obama mused, because Democrats just don't think midterms are ""sexy enough.""

2. Bad luck

Democrats had one spectacularly bad piece of luck. The Republicans' Tea Party-fueled surge in 2010 was perfectly timed to coincide with the decennial census, after which new congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by governors and state legislatures. Republicans' huge gains in the 2010 midterms put them in the driver's seat when it came time to draw new congressional districts in 2011. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell remembers what happened when Republicans took over the governor's mansion and the Legislature in his state:

""When I left office in January of 2011,"" says Rendell, ""there were 13 Democratic congressman and six Republican congressman. As a result of redistricting in the 2010 election, that turned around and we now have 13 Republican congressmen and five Democratic congressman.""

3. Democrats don't care

It's not only bad timing and gerrymandering that have hollowed out the Democratic Party. Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic National Committee official, says Democrats have never put enough effort and resources into state legislative races. Republicans, on the other hand, make those races a top priority.

4. Too many Democrats live in cities

This is another problem that makes it easier for Republicans to draw congressional and state legislative districts that disadvantage Democrats. Democratic voters are clumped together in urban areas. You could say that for the purposes of winning elections, Democratic voters are just not efficiently distributed.

Its why even in red states like Texas and Utah there are cities that are solidly Democratic — and why lesbian mayors were elected in Houston and Salt Lake City. When Democrats cluster in and around cities, they win local elections, but that doesn't help them win suburban or rural congressional seats.

Miller,"Sen. Claire McCaskill on Thursday slammed Sen. Bernard Sanders for complaining that the Democratic primary process is “ rigged ” against him , noting that his presidential campaign mostly wins closed caucuses contests .
“ Where Bernie Sanders has done well is caucuses — and they are closed . You can ’ t go if you ’ re working . You can ’ t absentee vote . You can ’ t mail in your ballot , ” the Missouri Democrat said on CBS ’ “ This Morning . ”
“ It is a very closed process and that ’ s the majority of the states he ’ s won , is the most closed process of all , ” said Mrs. McCaskill , who is a ally of likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton .
Mr. Sanders of Vermont has clashed with the Democratic Party over the primary system that he says is tilted in favor of Mrs. Clinton , who leads in the delegate hunt and is slowly closing in on the nomination .
The tensions between the two campaigns boiled over Saturday at the Nevada Democratic Convention in Las Vegas , when Mr. Sanders ’ supporters verbally assaulted party leaders and threw chairs after the majority of delegates were awarded to Mrs. Clinton .
“ I kind of agree with Bernie on this one . I think that Nevada was an aberration , ” Mrs. McCaskill said . “ I think that the millions of Bernie Sanders supporters are not people who want to resort to harassment and threats and throwing chairs . I do believe this was an outlier because I think the millions of people who support him are passionate and inspired by the message Bernie is delivering . ”
Mrs. McCaskill said that although the “ math ” showed Mr. Sanders likely will not win the nomination , she understood that he wanted to finish the process . She predicted the party would come together after the final primaries on June 7 .
The threat of likely GOP nominee Donald Trump becoming president should prod Mr. Sanders to get behind Mrs. Clinton ’ s run , Mrs. McCaskill said .
“ Bernie has to look at a potential President Trump and go uh-oh , we ’ ve got to get busy and make sure that we never let Donald Trump , the reality TV star that is reckless and risky and is an anathema to the things we believe in , we can never let him set foot in the Oval Office , ” she said . “ And I ’ m just confident Bernie will be there when the time comes . ”","Sen.

The Democratic National Committee alleges in a new multimillion dollar lawsuit that the Russian government, the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks engaged in a sweeping plot to interfere in the 2016 election in President Donald Trump's favor.

The lawsuit accuses top officials for the Trump campaign, Russian government officials and their military intelligence service, the GRU, of engaging in a vast, coordinated effort to inflict damage on Trump’s general election rival, Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

The complaint, filed on Friday, alleges the groups schemed to undermine her candidacy by breaching computer systems for the DNC and spreading materials seized on their servers.

The news, first reported by The Washington Post, signals the largest escalation so far of legal efforts by the Democratic Party to resolve allegations of foreign meddling by Russian operatives and possible coordination with Trump campaign officials.

Will she run or won’t she?

The obsessive speculation about Hillary Clinton’s plans for 2016 promises to be the longest and most intense parlor game in the history of American politics. It is a consuming fixation already, not just among the operatives and reporters who always inhale this stuff but to an extraordinary degree among average Americans.

Story Continued Below

The official Clinton line — she hasn’t decided and won’t for perhaps two years to come — has done nothing to quiet the national argument. She’s too tired, and, in her mid-60s, just wants to enjoy life, says one line. Nonsense, says the other: Why would anyone, especially someone as ambitious as she is, decline a historic presidential nomination that many believe is hers for the asking.

( PHOTOS: Who’s talking about Hillary, 2016?)

Of all the possible 2016 candidates, Clinton can most afford to take her time deciding. But there are a number of different choices — about her financial future, about her public profile, about whom she surrounds herself with — that will make clear whether Clinton is organizing her life in anticipation of a second presidential run or has decided to liberate herself from ambition and just do what she wants.

Here is a checklist of things to watch about Clinton’s future — a kind of viewer’s guide to Hillary Fever:

Her business choices

In many ways, Clinton’s path will be revealed as much by the choices she does not make as the ones she does.

How she chooses to make money over the next two years could be particularly telling. She could easily follow her husband or, more dramatically, Al Gore in amassing a fortune that would be worth tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars (and do recall she has already spent a fair amount of her own money to retire her 2008 campaign debt).

( Also on POLITICO: Clinton returns to public stage)

The problem is that many of the most obvious ways to do this would not necessarily be helpful to an aspiring presidential candidate. It could involve speaking fees to groups that she would just as soon not be associated with, or serving as an adviser or director of corporate interests that are lightning rods for one part or another of the Democratic coalition.

If she were to join, say, the board of Walmart, it would be a deal-breaker in a Democratic presidential primary.

The same holds true for her public speeches: Which ones she gives, and where, and who pays for them will be scrutinized closely (Speeches paid for by hedge funds, for instance, might be radioactive for the Democratic base.)

( PHOTOS: The Clinton-Obama relationship)

For that matter, any new property she and her husband buy will be factored into the equation — a report that they were looking at a home in the rich Long Island enclave the Hamptons was denied by her aides and would have been an odd choice in the post-Mitt Romney presidential cycle.

Clinton will lead a very affluent lifestyle under any scenario. But a future campaign is constraining by nature, and the choices Clinton makes about her earnings will reveal the extent to which she is preserving her options.

Caution versus candor

If there has been a flare pointing to a likely Clinton campaign, it was the nearly six-minute video she released explaining her shift in favor of gay marriage last month.

( WATCH: Hillary Clinton backs gay marriage)

It allowed Clinton to make a necessary policy shift. But it came at virtually the last minute possible before the U.S. Supreme Court took up arguments in two gay marriage-related cases.

Caution has been a hallmark of Clinton’s candidacies — going for the bold statement has not been. That’s unlikely to change now, especially as she is poised to continue using her own videos to circumvent the press and the unruliness of interviews.

And it’s hard to see her engaging in dangerous forms of politicking – she will likely back nominees but not get involved in primaries, and she will want to pick and choose so as not to expend too much political capital too early.

There are policy issues that relate to her time at the State Department where she could weigh in – Syria, for instance, or Iran. If she were to really say where she stands, based on her past policy platforms, she would likely back aggressive intervention in Syria. Another proposal observers could see her supporting, in the debt reduction fight, is the Simpson-Bowles plan.

But a presidential candidate who got burned for her vote a decade ago on the Iraq war — and who stumbled in a debate on a question about drivers’ licenses for undocumented immigrants — is unlikely to come close to stepping on these Democratic “third rails.”

The company she keeps

The type of entity Clinton sets up for her charitable work — she is expected to focus heavily on global issues pertaining to women and girls — is worth watching. If she hires strictly policy types, that could be a sign she’s not running. If there are political hires in the mix, it would show she’s being mindful of what the future could hold.

More broadly, the major unanswered question about Clinton is whether she has learned the lessons of 2008 and can avoid repeating the mistakes of a fractious, factionalized campaign.

The 2008 campaign was a hodgepodge of longtime aides and advisers, and was widely regarded as a dysfunctional mess as it became clear Barack Obama was on the rise. There were efforts to clean it up later — pollster Mark Penn was replaced as chief strategist — but by then the Good Ship Clinton had taken on too much water and Obama was in too strong a position.

So far, the most vocal Democrats about a potential Clinton run have been longtime friends of the first couple — James Carville, Paul Begala, Harold Ickes.

Meanwhile, most major operatives and firms that handle campaign work will not want to risk offending the Clintons and costing themselves money by signing up with other prospective campaigns as she weighs a run. If operatives do begin to sign up with other candidates in 2014, it will be telling.

Where her book tour takes her

Clinton is already starting to work on a memoir about the past several years of her life, a book that’s expected to net her a large advance. It will also include a book tour, which many Democrats believe will double as a rollout for a presidential campaign.

Using a presidential run as a masquerade for selling books was the province of many Republican candidates in the 2012 cycle — Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann and so forth.

Clinton doesn’t need to use one as a veil for the other. But if she does indeed plan to campaign, an easy way to launch softly in key states would be through her book tour.

Stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida would be signs of building toward a run.

The muzzle on the Big Dog

When Hillary Clinton ran for president last time, she was campaigning as the embodiment of her husband’s third term. The only problem was, those policies were a decade old by the time she was discussing them — in a change election.

Yet Bill Clinton’s policies were not the only source of controversy surrounding the former president during that race. He injected himself into the debate, repeatedly.

He has also been surrounded by a familiar group of long-serving associates, some of whom have occasionally stirred controversy.

Should Bill Clinton start doing less free associating in the media and create a more regimented operation at his foundation’s office in Harlem, that would send a clear signal that he and his wife are looking toward 2016.

Her appearance

There is an inherent difference in way the media focus on female candidates — female pols will make it on a New York tabloid cover in unfortunate poses or unflattering portraits more frequently than their male counterparts, as the state’s former senator knows all too well.

That said, the attention paid to, say, Chris Christie’s weight would belie the notion that this is entirely gender-based. The appearance of presidential candidates has been a subject of fascination dating back at least as far as William Howard Taft.

Clinton has often made jokes about the attention paid to her various hair styles and lengths, with the aim of humanizing herself for a skeptical press corps.

None of that is likely to change. What’s more, should Clinton suddenly focus on how she looks, it doesn’t necessarily signify a looming campaign — she is, for the first time in four years, able to stop and catch her breath and pay more attention to herself. And many of her fans have responded positively to the less buttoned-up version of Hillary Clinton — photos of her dancing in a bar on a foreign trip went viral on the Internet during the 2012 campaign.

democratic_party,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-riles-dems-by-refusing-to-pay-party-dues-bankrolling-her-colleagues-opponents,"AOC riles Dems by refusing to pay party dues, bankrolling colleagues' opponents",,"Marisa Schultz, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic Source","EXCLUSIVE : Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has already topped the fundraising charts in her short time in Congress , but the liberal darling won ’ t donate a cent of her millions to Democrats ' House campaign organization -- a position that has rankled some of her colleagues , Fox News has learned .
Instead , Ocasio-Cortez is building her own fundraising operation for fellow progressive candidates to bypass the official Democratic Party infrastructure . Already , she 's actively funding primary challengers to oust certain Democratic colleagues .
“ Sometimes the question comes : 'Do you want to be in a majority or do you want to be in the minority ? ' ” Rep. Gregory Meeks , D-N.Y. , told Fox News , when asked about AOC 's stance . “ And do you want to be part of a team ? ''
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) Chairwoman Cheri Bustos downplayed Ocasio-Cortez ’ s decision to shun dues and pointed to the record-breaking fundraising numbers the committee has notched without her .
“ That 's always up to individual members so I guess I do n't think about it one way or another , ” Bustos said when asked about Ocasio-Cortez 's stance . “ We ’ re raising record amounts of money from our members . ”
The DCCC declined to comment further on the matter of Ocasio-Cortez and her dues .
Another Democrat was less diplomatic : “ Deadbeat Cortez should pay her bills , ” complained the Democratic source . “ She ’ s always whining about people paying their fair share and here she is leaving her friends with the bill . ”
Their gripe is that Ocasio-Cortez hasn ’ t given any money to the DCCC , the party arm with the sole job of electing Democrats to the House . Records obtained by Fox News show the New York Democrat has failed to pay any of her $ 250,000 in “ dues ” to the DCCC .
Her goose egg of a contribution is no accident . Ocasio-Cortez says she has beef with the DCCC and she 'll withhold her money in protest of how the Democratic Party wo n't back insurgent progressive primary candidates , like herself , in the name of protecting incumbents .
“ For me personally , I ’ m not paying D-trip dues , ” said Ocasio-Cortez , using slang for the DCCC and citing a “ myriad of reasons . ”
“ One , I don ’ t agree with the policy around blacklisting groups that help progressive candidates , ” she said , referring to a DCCC effort to sideline vendors who assist challengers to members of Congress . “ I think we need to evolve as a party and make room for that . ”
'For me personally , I ’ m not paying D-trip dues . ' — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
Instead , Ocasio-Cortez is ramping up her donor base with the help of Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , whom she endorsed for president in October , to funnel money directly to progressive candidates .
Through social media posts and email solicitations , she 's activated her donor network to support her hand-picked candidates . In 2019 alone , she funneled more than $ 300,000 to candidates she ’ s endorsed by hosting online fundraising campaigns for them , according to records obtained by Fox News .
“ I want to help frontline members by putting that money straight into their pocket , ” Ocasio-Cortez said .
Bucking the Democratic Party line , Ocasio-Cortez led online fundraisers for at least two progressives who are trying to defeat sitting Democratic members of Congress .
She solicited nearly $ 18,000 in donations for Marie Newman , who is taking on current Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski , a conservative Democrat who opposes abortion . She also gave Newman an additional $ 5,000 directly from her campaign account . Ocasio-Cortez also raised nearly $ 35,000 in online donations for progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros , who is trying to defeat Rep. Henry Cuellar , D-Texas .
“ Certainly , these are new times , ” Cuellar said of his colleague 's effort to oust him , “ which is something that we certainly do n't agree with . ”
Cuellar said Democrats should be focused on the larger goal of beating Republicans and retaining the House majority . “ To have people try to purify the caucus because they do n't agree with them – 100 percent , I certainly do n't agree with that . ”
“ Hopefully , we will start to get away from this circular firing squad , '' said Cuellar , who paid all his dues to the DCCC , records show .
Ocasio-Cortez views herself as a vehicle to help candidates who wouldn ’ t ordinarily have access to DCCC resources and “ to really bring in people from outside the traditional political process , ” she said .
But she does support some colleagues : “ I ’ m happy to support some incumbents , but it ’ s not just a blanket rule . ''
In one online appeal , Ocasio-Cortez urged her supporters to back “ bold swing district Democrats ” by donating to Rep. Mike Levin from California , Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut , and Rep. Katie Hill ( before she resigned from Congress amid a throuple sex scandal with a staffer ) .
AOC 's supporters pitched in $ 38,000 for Levin and $ 35,500 Hayes -- both frontline DCCC members in competitive districts .
Other beneficiaries of her online campaigns include Sanders ( nearly $ 36,000 ) and fellow liberal squad members Reps. Rashida Tlaib ( about $ 10,000 ) , Ilhan Omar ( $ 29,000 ) and Ayanna Pressley ( $ 3,800 ) .
Ocasio-Cortez gained nationwide fame when the former bartender from the Bronx upset powerful 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley , D-N.Y. , in the 2018 primary . Now at just 30 years old , the Democratic socialist has turned into a fundraising juggernaut .
REP. JOE CROWLEY DEFEATED IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY UPSET BY NEWCOMER ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ
In the third quarter of 2019 , she raised $ 1.42 million -- more than any other House Democrat . She beat out top Democrats like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff by rejecting corporate PAC dollars and traditional high-dollar fundraisers and instead relying on grassroots small-dollar fans who are rooting for the young pol and her unapologetic fight for progressive ideals , like the Green New Deal .
Her fourth-quarter fundraising is even bigger . Her campaign nearly hit its goal of raising $ 2 million in the final three months of 2019 from online donors from every state . That amount puts her 2019 fundraising at more than $ 5 million , a groundbreaking amount for the youngest female ever elected to Congress .

While backing primary challengers while in Congress was once considered taboo , Ocasio-Cortez says the competition is good for the party .
“ We have to earn our keep every time , '' Ocasio-Cortez said . `` I think we have to make our case every single time . ”","EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has already topped the fundraising charts in her short time in Congress, but the liberal darling won’t donate a cent of her millions to Democrats' House campaign organization -- a position that has rankled some of her colleagues, Fox News has learned.

Instead, Ocasio-Cortez is building her own fundraising operation for fellow progressive candidates to bypass the official Democratic Party infrastructure. Already, she's actively funding primary challengers to oust certain Democratic colleagues.

“Sometimes the question comes: 'Do you want to be in a majority or do you want to be in the minority?'” Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., told Fox News, when asked about AOC's stance. “And do you want to be part of a team?""

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Chairwoman Cheri Bustos downplayed Ocasio-Cortez’s decision to shun dues and pointed to the record-breaking fundraising numbers the committee has notched without her.

“That's always up to individual members so I guess I don't think about it one way or another,” Bustos said when asked about Ocasio-Cortez's stance. “We’re raising record amounts of money from our members.”

The DCCC declined to comment further on the matter of Ocasio-Cortez and her dues.

Another Democrat was less diplomatic: “Deadbeat Cortez should pay her bills,” complained the Democratic source. “She’s always whining about people paying their fair share and here she is leaving her friends with the bill.”

Their gripe is that Ocasio-Cortez hasn’t given any money to the DCCC, the party arm with the sole job of electing Democrats to the House. Records obtained by Fox News show the New York Democrat has failed to pay any of her $250,000 in “dues” to the DCCC.

Her goose egg of a contribution is no accident. Ocasio-Cortez says she has beef with the DCCC and she'll withhold her money in protest of how the Democratic Party won't back insurgent progressive primary candidates, like herself, in the name of protecting incumbents.

“For me personally, I’m not paying D-trip dues,” said Ocasio-Cortez, using slang for the DCCC and citing a “myriad of reasons.”

“One, I don’t agree with the policy around blacklisting groups that help progressive candidates,” she said, referring to a DCCC effort to sideline vendors who assist challengers to members of Congress. “I think we need to evolve as a party and make room for that.”

Instead, Ocasio-Cortez is ramping up her donor base with the help of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., whom she endorsed for president in October, to funnel money directly to progressive candidates.

Through social media posts and email solicitations, she's activated her donor network to support her hand-picked candidates. In 2019 alone, she funneled more than $300,000 to candidates she’s endorsed by hosting online fundraising campaigns for them, according to records obtained by Fox News.

“I want to help frontline members by putting that money straight into their pocket,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Bucking the Democratic Party line, Ocasio-Cortez led online fundraisers for at least two progressives who are trying to defeat sitting Democratic members of Congress.

She solicited nearly $18,000 in donations for Marie Newman, who is taking on current Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, a conservative Democrat who opposes abortion. She also gave Newman an additional $5,000 directly from her campaign account. Ocasio-Cortez also raised nearly $35,000 in online donations for progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros, who is trying to defeat Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas.

“Certainly, these are new times,” Cuellar said of his colleague's effort to oust him, “which is something that we certainly don't agree with.”

Cuellar said Democrats should be focused on the larger goal of beating Republicans and retaining the House majority. “To have people try to purify the caucus because they don't agree with them – 100 percent, I certainly don't agree with that.”

“Hopefully, we will start to get away from this circular firing squad,"" said Cuellar, who paid all his dues to the DCCC, records show.

Ocasio-Cortez views herself as a vehicle to help candidates who wouldn’t ordinarily have access to DCCC resources and “to really bring in people from outside the traditional political process,” she said.

But she does support some colleagues: “I’m happy to support some incumbents, but it’s not just a blanket rule.""

In one online appeal, Ocasio-Cortez urged her supporters to back “bold swing district Democrats” by donating to Rep. Mike Levin from California, Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, and Rep. Katie Hill (before she resigned from Congress amid a throuple sex scandal with a staffer).

AOC's supporters pitched in $38,000 for Levin and $35,500 Hayes -- both frontline DCCC members in competitive districts.

Other beneficiaries of her online campaigns include Sanders (nearly $36,000) and fellow liberal squad members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (about $10,000), Ilhan Omar ($29,000) and Ayanna Pressley ($3,800).

Ocasio-Cortez gained nationwide fame when the former bartender from the Bronx upset powerful 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., in the 2018 primary. Now at just 30 years old, the Democratic socialist has turned into a fundraising juggernaut.

In the third quarter of 2019, she raised $1.42 million -- more than any other House Democrat. She beat out top Democrats like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff by rejecting corporate PAC dollars and traditional high-dollar fundraisers and instead relying on grassroots small-dollar fans who are rooting for the young pol and her unapologetic fight for progressive ideals, like the Green New Deal.

Her fourth-quarter fundraising is even bigger. Her campaign nearly hit its goal of raising $2 million in the final three months of 2019 from online donors from every state. That amount puts her 2019 fundraising at more than $5 million, a groundbreaking amount for the youngest female ever elected to Congress.

She’s benefited from joint online fundraising campaigns with Sanders that’s expanded her fundraising base and her commitments for reoccurring monthly contributions. His online appeals have raised more than $140,000 for Ocasio-Cortez, while she’s raised about $36,000 for Sanders by appealing to her supporters, according to her campaign.
